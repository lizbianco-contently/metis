His enthusiasm for the work he \ndid here was contagious. His sense of humor was wonderful. Jim Exon \nloved Nebraska football. He cared about a lot of issues, but other than \nhis family, Nebraska football came first. He is going to be buried in \nLincoln, NE, on this Wednesday. He died, I believe it was Friday night. \nBen Nelson called me Saturday morning. Jim Exon was certainly a mentor \nof Ben Nelson. We will all miss him very much.\n  I hope those who have some knowledge of Senator Exon will recognize \nwe hope to take an airplane trip to Nebraska Wednesday afternoon to \nattend his funeral. He was a wonderful man. I miss him so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6348-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ANTILYNCHING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this past Friday, I was in Cincinnati. I had \nsome business to conduct there, but my plane got in early, and I had \nsome time on my hands. My staff said: Would you like to go to a new \nmuseum that opened in August of 2004? I said: Sure, I will be happy to. \nIt is a museum that is dedicated to forcing us to remember what went on \nin the dark days of the history of this country dealing with slavery.\n  The museum is done so well. You walk in, and the first thing you see \nis this large facility--big, tall--and it is a facility that was used \nin the late 1700s, 1800s for holding slaves. The upper story--using \nthat term loosely--was for the men and the bottom for the women. They \nstill have the shackles there, the chains that were used to hold these \npeople. They have the writing on the walls used to describe what these \nhuman beings were worth, how much money, and for what they could be \nused.\n  So it is very appropriate that I returned to Washington today since \nwe are going to debate some legislation that is very pertinent.\n  In this body's two centuries of history, we have done many great \nthings. We sent men to the Moon, created schools for our kids, fed the \nhungry, and lent a helping hand to struggling families. But today I \nrise to speak about one of this institution's great failures--its \nshameful refusal to enact antilynching legislation in the first half of \nthe 20th century.\n  Today, one of the saddest chapters in our Chamber's history will come \nto a close when we apologize for the Senate's inaction. I join my \ncolleagues in apologizing to the deceased victims of lynchings and \ntheir surviving loved ones. I pray this Chamber will never fail to see \nthis injustice that was done. We must realize and understand what it \nwas. It was an injustice.\n  While the exact number is impossible to determine, records indicate \nthat since 1882--the best records we have--4,749 individuals have died \nfrom lynching, men and women, mostly men, and most of them by far \nAfrican Americans. These Americans were killed, tortured, mutilated, \nand maimed with near impunity. Most were denied due process under the \nlaw, and their killers rarely--very rarely--faced consequences for \ntheir actions, as indicated by the prayer offered today by our Chaplain \nwhich indicated little less than 1 percent who saw some retribution in \nthe courts. The Senate's inaction helped create a culture of acceptance \ntoward these heinous crimes against humanity.\n  Photos from this book--``Without Sanctuary'' is the name of the \nbook--a book of lynchings that occurred in America, and it is depicted \nin photographs--photographs that are so hard to accept--is the \nprincipal reason we are here today, this one book.\n  This book shows men, women, children donning their finest clothing \nand gleefully posing in front of deceased people who had been hanged \nand, prior to being hanged, often mutilated. Even worse, many photos \nwere turned into postcards, until 1908, when the Senate at least \namended U.S. Postal Service regulations to forbid the mailing of \nlynching photographs made into postcards. Think about that.\n  American history is rich with stories of heroes and heroines, as well \nas patriots, of patriotism. However, the lynching of so many Americans \nwill always be a stain on our great democracy. Only after passage of \ntime, only after growing pressure from civil rights organizations, only \nafter over 200 antilynching bills, condemnation by foreign nations, \npetitions from seven U.S. Presidents, and outcries from the African-\nAmerican press and some mainstream publications did the occurrence of \nthis horrible act decline. But this book, published in 2000, is the \nreal reason we are moving today.\n\n  It is my sincere hope that the relatives of the victims of these \nhorrible acts will accept this body's sincere apology and take solace \nin the Senate finally recognizing its shortcomings.\n  It is also my sincere hope that the Senate does not stop with its \napologies. There is much more to be done. We can honor the legacy of \nthese victims by continuing to confront the challenges in civil rights \nbefore us in enacting legislation that will protect, for example, \nvoting rights and improve the lives of so many Americans.\n  First, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand \nstrong in support of reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act.\n  Second, disparities between African Americans and Whites in health \ncare and education are still too great. I encourage this body to \nsupport legislation that will improve health care among African \nAmericans, improve educational resources, and provide opportunities for \nAfrican Americans in many different avenues.\n  Finally, I ask the families of the victims of these terrible crimes \nto accept the Senate's apology, and I pray that my colleagues will act \npositively on upcoming legislation to honor the souls of those passed \nand that they may finally rest in peace.\n  Mr. President, again, I extend my appreciation to the majority leader \nin allowing me to go before him this afternoon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6348-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6348-S6349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AFRICA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning, President Bush, accompanied \nby the Presidents of five African States--Botswana, Ghana, Niger, \nMozambique, and Namibia--announced the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct forum that will be held in July of this year in Senegal.\n  At that joint meeting and announcement of the Senegal meeting, I had \nthe opportunity to sit down and talk with each of these African \nleaders, the Presidents of their respective countries, about the \nparticular challenges their countries face and how the United States of \nAmerica, working in partnership with them, can help.\n  We discussed our continuing efforts to help the nations of Africa \nfight disease and hunger and to develop sound, healthy, and accountable \ngovernance.\n  In our conversations, I underscored the need for continued political \nreform, for economic development, for investment in human capital, \nespecially as we combat an issue the President talked a lot about \nearlier in the press announcement, and that is the tyranny of HIV/AIDS. \nWe also discussed the President's plan to offer additional emergency \naid to Africa at the upcoming G8 summit in July. This money is in \naddition to the $674 million the President announced last week during \nPrime Minister Tony Blair's visit to Washington.\n  Needless to say, the African Presidents were overwhelmed by these \ninitiatives. They were impressed by the leadership of Prime Minister \nBlair and President Bush and by the generosity of the American people.\n  Meanwhile, on Saturday, in what Treasury Secretary John Snow called \nan achievement of historic proportions, the G8, led by the United \nStates and the United Kingdom, agreed to cancel more than $40 billion \nin debt owed by 18 of the world's poorest countries, including 14 \nAfrican nations.\n  Two hundred and eighty million African citizens will no longer labor \nunder massive debtloads that have been crippling their ability to grow \nand prosper. This agreement wipes the slate clean. Their governments \nwill see a combined savings of an estimated $1.5 billion a year. As we \ndiscussed this morning, their challenge now is to invest those savings \nwisely and effectively.\n  If this money is used wisely, the people of these countries will see \nbetter education, cleaner water, less disease, and live better and more \nproductive lives. Countries such as Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, \nMozambique--all will be\n\n[[Page S6349]]\n\nbetter able to focus their resources on economic development, \neducation, health, infrastructure, and all the fundamentals that we \nknow help to build prosperity.\n  They will be able to once and for all break the loan-debt-forgiveness \ncycle that has undermined their ability to grow and to invest.\n  Saturday's agreement will help many of Africa's poorest countries get \non their feet and make meaningful strides toward the future.\n  President Bush and the Republican-led Congress have been steadfast \nsupporters of Africa's development. I personally have had the \nopportunity to visit the continent of Africa on eight separate \noccasions, both as majority leader and as part of medical mission work \non that wonderful continent. We have consistently championed efforts to \npromote accountability, good governance, political reform, and economic \ngrowth. Overcoming the problems that afflict the continent is tough \nwork, it is difficult work, it is challenging work, but we are \ncommitted to helping Africa realize its rich potential.\n  Instead of seeing only problems and obstacles, we seek solutions. \nInstead of offering a Band-Aid, we offered smart aid. We as a country \nhave much to be proud of in terms of our contributions. One only need \nto look at the statistics. So far this fiscal year, the United States \nhas provided the continent of Africa with $1.4 billion in humanitarian \nrelief. President Bush has tripled America's contributions.\n  Today, nearly a quarter of every aid dollar to Africa comes from \nAmerica, up from just 10 percent 4 short years ago. Yes, we really for \nthe first time demand accountability from these investments. These aid \ndollars today are tied to economic and political reforms. Our goal is \nto help these countries root out corruption, to address human rights, \nto protect human rights, to promote the rule of law, and to build a \nstable, civil society, one that can meet the needs and demands of a \ngrowing and modern society.\n  Meanwhile, the African Growth and Opportunity Acceleration Act, also \nknow known as AGOA, is already demonstrating its poverty fighting \npower. Last year, the Senate passed and the President signed the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Acceleration Act. As a result, U.S. \nexports to sub-Saharan Africa have increased by 25 percent and \nAmerica's imports from these participating countries are up 88 percent. \nEconomic growth in sub-Saharan Africa is at an 8-year high.\n  Our goal is to break with the old approaches of the past where \nsuccess was measured in dollars. Instead, we want real, measurable \nresults, proof that the African people are benefiting from our efforts. \nAnd they are coming. I applaud the President for his strong and \nprincipled leadership. He understands that Africa can be and is a place \nof great hope and opportunity. He sees both the practical and the moral \ndimensions of America's leadership.\n  Every human being needs and deserves the fundamentals of life: food, \nshelter, water, safety. Countries that fail in any of these basic \nfunctions become dangerous places for their citizens and potential \nthreats to America's security. It is in our mutual interest to promote \npeace and stability on the African Continent.\n  As a physician, I have had the opportunity to travel extensively \nthroughout the continent. I have had the opportunity to perform surgery \nand operate in the oldest medical school on that continent in Uganda. I \nhave had the opportunity to treat patients for war injuries, injuries \nfrom a civil war in southern Sudan, to treat patients with HIV/AIDS.\n\n  From that perspective, I was so proud when the President today was \ntalking at the press conference with the Presidents of those countries \nabout his HIV/AIDS initiative: $15 billion committed by the United \nStates, by our U.S. Congress, to combat what I believe is the greatest \nmoral, humanitarian, and public health challenge of our times. I am \nalso participating in an effort to help expand health care and spread \ngoodwill through that health care across the globe. I believe--and I \nhave had that little window to be able to see directly--that through \nthe good works of many talented women and men of compassion medicine \ncan be not only an instrument of health but by the delivery of that \nmedicine and by the delivery of that public health care can be a true \ncurrency for peace.\n  I have seen that real tangible intervention can help bridge the gaps \nand misunderstandings that so often divide people, that can divide \nsocieties. We see that phenomenon in Afghanistan and Iraq and we saw it \nin Southeast Asia in the aftermath of the terrible tsunami tragedy. \nCountless health care professionals from all over the world, both \nvolunteers and government workers, rushed to that devastated region to \noffer assistance. Private companies, corporations, and nongovernment \norganizations offered services and supplies. The outpouring of support \nfrom all over the world, led in many ways by American efforts, was \ntruly an extraordinary event, a moving testament to our shared \nhumanity. That is why in April I introduced the Global Health Corps Act \nof 2005. America possesses a vast reservoir of talent, skills, \nknowledge, and compassion that can both help heal but also promote \nhealth, both literally and figuratively, promoting our global ties. \nThis is just one of the many efforts we are making to help promote \npeace and well-being on the African Continent. We are also reaching out \ndirectly to individual countries to help them tackle their most \npressing problems.\n  Today, I also had the opportunity to speak with the President of \nNamibia. Namibia is one of Africa's greatest success stories. We were \njust there on a congressional delegation about 2 years ago.\n  Just 15 years after attaining its independence from apartheid-led \nSouth Africa, Namibia has emerged as a multiparty, multiracial \ndemocracy with a stable market-based economy. Like many African \ncountries, the greatest threat to Namibia's development and continued \nsuccess is the spread of the virus of HIV/AIDS. Namibia is one of the \ncountries most adversely affected by HIV/AIDS. Already, 22 percent of \nsexually active adults in Namibia are infected by HIV. AIDS accounts \nfor half of the deaths among individuals between the ages of 15 and 19 \nin Namibia and for 75 percent of all hospitalizations in public \nfacilities.\n  The continued spread of this disease will have a devastating impact \non the Namibian people and their efforts to build on their already \nremarkable achievements. For this reason, it is critical to continue to \nfund the President's emergency plan for AIDS relief, or PEPFAR, to \nassist Namibia in their battle against this terrible disease.\n  PEPFAR funding for Namibia has increased from $23 million in 2004 to \nan estimated $36 million in 2005. The administration has requested $49 \nmillion for 2006, and I encourage my Senate colleagues to support this \nfunding as the Namibian people continue their fight against HIV/AIDS.\n  Despite its openness and competitiveness, the Namibian economy still \nfaces a number of challenges. Since 1990, the annual per capita GDP \ngrowth rate in Namibia has averaged just 1.6 percent. The African \nGrowth and Opportunity Acceleration Act is helping to capitalize \nNamibia's economic potential. Already, AGOA is estimated to have \ncreated 9,000 new jobs in Namibia. In addition, Namibia's 2004 exports \nto the United States under AGOA are valued at $161 million.\n  These achievements I mention because they are a model for political \nand economic reform throughout the African Continent. Steady American \nsupport will enhance Namibia's ability to contribute to Africa's peace, \nsecurity, and stability. The President has said America has a special \ncalling to come to the aid of the African people and that ``we will do \nso with the compassion and generosity that has always defined the \nUnited States.''\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and with \nthe President to continue helping the continent heal and grow. We care \ndeeply about the future of Africa. With time and an unwavering \ncommitment to progress, I believe that together we can help Africa and \nits people share in the blessings of peace and prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6349-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6349-S6351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JESSE R.

Nichols, Sr., was born on June 14, 1909, \n     in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and was the first African \n     American Clerk employed by the United States Senate; and\n       Whereas, he carried out his duties in exemplary fashion, \n     bringing credit to the Committee and to Congress; and\n       Whereas, Jesse Nichols worked effectively under the \n     guidance of Democratic and Republican Chairmen, including Pat \n     Harrison of Mississippi, Walter F. George of Georgia, Harry \n     Flood Byrd of Virginia and Russell B. Long of Louisiana from \n     the 75th Congress through the 91st Congress.\n       Whereas, the Committee on Finance will long remember the \n     commitment, service and leadership of Jesse R. Nichols, Sr., \n     as documented in an oral history posted on the Senate \n     Historian's Web site; and\n       Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the United States \n     Senate expresses its deep gratitude and sincere respect for \n     Jesse R. Nichols for his unfailing service and his dedication \n     to the United States Senate. The Senate hereby expresses \n     condolences to the family due to the death of Jesse R. \n     Nichols, Sr., on February 18, 2005.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this resolution expresses our gratitude and \nrespect to the family of Jesse Nichols. I will take just a couple of \nmoments to comment on Jesse Nichols, who was the first African-American \nclerk to be employed by this body, the Senate.\n  Jesse Nichols was born on June 14, 1909, in Clarksdale, MS. In 1930, \nJesse enrolled at Howard University where he hoped to study medicine, \nbut his plans were derailed by the Depression, and he, as so many \nothers, had to join the employment line.\n  After a stint working at a local delicatessen, Jesse secured a \nposition at the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Then in 1937, \nSenator Pat Harrison of Mississippi hired Jesse Nichols to join the \nFinance Committee as document clerk/librarian. He became responsible \nfor the committee's immense collection of tax codes and hearings, \nwitness statements, and other publications.\n  Over the days and the weeks ahead, Mr. Nichols became indispensable \nto the committee staff and the Senators who depended on his \nprofessionalism and accumulated knowledge. On his 30th anniversary in \nthe Senate, Member after Member rose to pay tribute to Mr. Nichols. \nSenator Russell Long praised Mr. Nichols for his consummate \nprofessionalism, diligence, and devotion to this body. Delaware Senator \nJohn R. Williams testified that over his three decades of service Jesse \nNichols ``earned the respect of those former giants of this Senate, \neach of whom was proud to call him a friend.''\n  Jesse Nichols was deeply respected by his colleagues and was dearly \nmissed when he retired from the Senate in 1971. On February 18th of \nthis year, Jesse died a few months short of his 96th birthday. Jesse \nNichols lived a full and long life. On behalf of the Senate family, I \nrecognize the contributions of Jesse Nichols to this venerable body. We \nare sincerely grateful for his service and dedication.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Jesse R. \nNichols, Sr. Mr. Nichols, who passed away on February 15, was the first \nAfrican-American clerk for the Senate Finance Committee and one of its \nlongest serving staff members. He worked with the committee from 1937 \nto 1971.\n  Born in Clarksdale, MS, Mr. Nichols came to the Finance Committee at \na time early in the building of its staff. Back then, there were few, \nif any, African-Americans on staff with the Senate. At Finance, there \nwere just three staff members with the committee and no standing \nsubcommittees. Today, there are 70 staff members and 5 standing \nsubcommittees.\n  During his more than 30 years with the committee, he created the \ncommittee's archival system and became our resident historian. He also \ncontributed to the history of the Senate as a whole. In 1994, he \ngenerously participated in an extensive oral history for the Senate \nHistorical Office. In it, he describes some of his most memorable \nmoments during his long tenure. Mr. Nichols rubbed elbows with some of \nthe most important leaders of the day--but he was excluded from eating \nin the Capitol's restaurant and cafeterias because of his race.\n  On the day that Mr. Nichols celebrated his 30th anniversary with the \ncommittee, several Senators paid him homage on the Capitol floor. They \nnoted that Mr. Nichols outranked every member of the Finance Committee \nin terms of length of service. Senator Long in particular called Mr. \nNichols a ``senior member'' of the committee and ``one of God's best \npeople.'' When Mr. Nichols finally retired in 1971, the committee had \nto hire two people to carry on his extensive work.\n  I salute Mr. Nichols for his long and trusted service to the Senate \nand send my heartfelt condolences to the Nichols family.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to the life \nof Jesse Nichols, Sr., who passed away on February 22, 2005. Jesse R. \nNichols, Sr., faithfully served the U.S. Senate for over 30 years. He \nwas the first African American Clerk employed by the U.S. Senate.\n  Jesse Nichols was born on June 14, 1909, in Clarksdale, MS. He began \nhis service when the late Pat Harrison of Mississippi was the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee--the committee I am now \nprivileged to chair.\n  Jesse was appointed as a messenger for the Finance Committee in 1936, \nand was elevated about 6 months later to assistant clerk of the \nCommittee. At that time, the staff of the Finance Committee numbered \nonly three.\n  In 1967, on the occasion of his thirtieth anniversary on the Senate \nstaff, several members of the Finance Committee, led by Delaware \nRepublican John J. Williams, rose in the Senate chamber to pay tribute \nto Jesse Nichols who had ``earned the respect of those former giants of \nthe Senate, each of whom was proud to call him a friend.''\n\n  Senator Williams added that:\n\n       It is refreshing to meet a man who throughout the years has \n     served the Senate and his country with but one thought in \n     mind, and that is, to do his job to the best of his ability, \n     always remembering that as a Government employee he is a \n     servant of the people.\n\n  Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen added his endorsement, \nnoting that:\n\n       Thirty years of faithful and devoted service certainly \n     deserves to be taken account of in the proceedings of this \n     body.\n\n  An oral history interview conducted by the Senate Historical Office \nfrom March 26 to April 12, 1994, is available on the Senate Web site. \nThe history documents Jesse's employment by the Committee on Finance \nfrom the 75th Congress through the 91st Congress.\n  He worked under the guidance of Democratic and Republican Chairmen, \nincluding Walter F. George of Georgia, I Senator Eugene Millikin of \nColorado, Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia and Russell B. Long of \nLouisiana.\n  Jesse Nichols' service was faithful, exemplary and noteworthy. He \nserved not only the Finance Committee with class and grace, but also \nthe Senate as a whole during that critical period in American history. \nI join my colleagues in recognizing Mr. Nichols' life and am grateful \nto his service to our country.\n\n                              S. Res. 168\n\n       Whereas Jesse R. Nichols, Sr., faithfully served the United \n     States Senate and the Committee on Finance as the Government \n     Documents Clerk and Librarian from nineteen hundred thirty-\n     seven through nineteen hundred seventy-one;\n       Whereas Jesse R. Nichols, Sr., was born on June 14, 1909, \n     in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and was the first African \n     American Clerk employed by the United States Senate;\n       Whereas he carried out his duties in exemplary fashion, \n     bringing credit to the Committee and to Congress;\n       Whereas Jesse Nichols worked effectively under the guidance \n     of Democratic and Republican Chairmen, including Pat Harrison\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\n     of Mississippi, Walter F. George of Georgia, Harry Flood Byrd \n     of Virginia and Russell B. Long of Louisiana from the 75th \n     Congress through the 91st Congress; and\n       Whereas the Committee on Finance will long remember the \n     commitment, service and leadership of Jesse R. Nichols, Sr., \n     as documented in an oral history posted on the Senate \n     Historian's website: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate expresses its deep \n     gratitude and sincere respect for Jesse R.

GRIFFITH TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                        THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session and proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 66, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Thomas B. \nGriffith, of Utah, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District \nof Columbia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, is the Griffith nomination before the \nSenate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nThomas B. Griffith to serve as a judge on the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  Because Tom Griffith served as Senate legal counsel from 1995 to \n1999, many Members of this body are very familiar with his character, \njudgment, and record. For the benefit of those new members of this body \nand those members of the public who are not familiar with Tom Griffith, \nI want to spend the next few minutes detailing why his education, \nexperience, and expertise make him an excellent nominee for this \nextremely important Federal court.\n  As I will set forth, Tom has broad support on both sides of the \naisle. In the far too often partisan debate over judicial nominations \nthat has occurred over the last few years, it is refreshing to have \nbefore us a nominee whose past record of achievement has resulted in so \nmany current supporters who are firmly convinced that his future \nservice on the bench will be successful.\n  One of the many reasons why I am particularly proud to support Tom \nGriffith is because he is a constituent of mine. Mr. Griffith serves as \nassistant to the president and general counsel of Brigham Young \nUniversity.\n  As might be expected, Tom has many supporters at BYU. Here is what \nassociate dean and Professor Constance Lundberg at the J. Reuben Clark \nSchool of Law has to say about the nominee:\n\n       [Tom] is also a lawyer of unexcelled ability. He \n     understands the differences between law and policy and has a \n     deep understanding of the powers and prerogatives of each of \n     the three branches of government. He is immensely fair and \n     compassionate. The laws and Constitution of the United States \n     could not be in better hands.\n\n  Tom also has his supporters among law school faculty off the BYU \ncampus. For example, please listen to what Harvard Law Professor \nWilliam Stuntz has said about the qualifications of Tom Griffith:\n\n       I know a great many of talented men and women in America's \n     legal profession; I've taught more than three thousand \n     students at three top law schools, and I have friends \n     scattered across the country in various kinds of law practice \n     and in academics. I do not know anyone whom I would rather \n     see on the federal bench than Tom Griffith. If he is \n     confirmed, he will not just be a good judge. He'll be a great \n     one.\n\n  That is certainly strong praise and, as I remember law school, \ngetting praise from law professors is never easy unless you truly earn \nit.\n  In order to become the lawyer he is today, Tom received a solid \neducation.\n  Back in 1978, Mr. Griffith received his Bachelor's degree from BYU. I \nam proud to say that we both graduated from BYU. I am also proud to \ntell you that Tom graduated summa cum laude. For those of us who are \nproud to call Brigham Young University our alma mater, I want to note \nthat BYU is our Nation's largest private university and is recognized \nby many as one of the finest institutions of higher learning anywhere \nin the world.\n  Tom Griffith was the valedictorian of the BYU College of Humanities. \nHe was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious Edward S. Hinckley \nScholarship.\n  Mr. Griffith pursued his legal studies at the University of Virginia \nSchool of Law. Once again, he distinguished himself by being selected \nas a member of the law review at the University of Virginia. This is an \nhonor that very few law students achieve.\n  Upon graduation from law school in 1985, Tom commenced his legal \ncareer as an associate in the Charlotte, NC, law firm of Robinson, \nBradshaw and Hinson. During this time, Mr. Griffith was engaged in \ncorporate, commercial, securities and employment litigation.\n  In late 1989 Tom Griffith joined the well-known and highly regarded \nWashington, DC, law firm of Wiley, Rein and Fielding, first as an \nassociate. Tom specialized and excelled in complex environmental \ninsurance litigation and regulatory investigations and was made a \npartner in the firm.\n  Between March, 1995 and March, 1999, Tom Griffith served as Senate \nlegal counsel. This is a highly demanding job as the Senate legal \ncounsel advises the Senate on all legal matters related to the Senate \nincluding Senate investigations, the work of Senate committees, and \ndefending acts of Congress and Senate resolutions.\n\n  During his time as Senate legal counsel, Tom faced the many \nchallenges of advising the Senate during the impeachment of President \nClinton. If there was ever a circumstance to test the temperament of a \nlawyer, his ability to ascertain what the law is and what prudence \ndictates, and to provide objective legal advice in a fair and even-\nhanded manner in a highly charged atmosphere, surely it was the unique \ncircumstances of the impeachment trial. By all accounts, Tom Griffith \ncame through in flying colors.\n  After the impeachment trial, Tom rejoined the firm of Wiley, Rein and \nFielding for about one year before taking his current position in Utah \nas the general counsel of Brigham Young University.\n  As you can tell from this thumb nail sketch of Tom Griffith's career, \nhe is an achiever. He has had a terrific education and has done very \nwell at very demanding schools. He has also distinguished himself in \nthe practice of law with one of the great law firms in this country, as \nSenate legal counsel, and in his current capacity as assistant to the \npresident and general counsel at BYU.\n  Many have relied upon Tom Griffith for sound legal advice. That is \nbecause he is an excellent lawyer who provides excellent advice.\n  Despite the claims on his time made by the various legal positions \nMr. Griffith has held, he still found the time to take on a number of \nvoluntary assignments that demonstrate a commitment to serving those in \nneed. For example, between 1991 and 1995 Mr. Griffith spent several \nhundred hours of his own time attempting to overturn the sentence of a \ndeath row inmate. Ultimately, the strategy devised by Mr. Griffith was \nsuccessful in obtaining a pardon by then-Governor, now-Senator George \nAllen on the eve of the scheduled execution.\n  Tom has volunteered to represent disadvantaged public school students \nin disciplinary proceedings and has helped operate soup kitchens or \npeople in need.\n  I would also like to make my colleagues aware of Tom's interest in, \nand commitment to, the emerging democracies in Central Europe. For the \nlast\n\n[[Page S6352]]\n\n10 years, Tom has worked on the American Bar Association's Central \nEurasian Law Initiative, serving on the ABA Advisory Board in this \narea. In this capacity, he has helped train judges and lawyers in \nCroatia, Serbia, the Czech Republic and Russia. He has been very active \nin helping establish a regional judicial training center in Prague. Let \nme just mention what some of his peers in the international legal \ncommunity have said about Tom Griffith.\n  Here is what David Tolbert, the Deputy Registrar at the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has said about Tom \nGriffith:\n\n       Mr. Griffith is without question one of the best \n     professionals with whom I have worked, given not only his \n     capability as a lawyer but his integrity as a person. He also \n     shows an open-minded approach to legal and other issues, and \n     I have discussed many issues with him, a number of which we \n     come to at somewhat different angles, and his intellectual \n     honesty and integrity are outstanding.\n\n  That is indeed high praise. Mr. Tolbert is not alone among those in \nthe international legal community who have come to know Tom and speak \nhighly about him.\n  Mark Ellis, the executive director of the International Bar \nAssociation has made the following comments about Tom.\n\n       The duty of a judge is to administer justice according to \n     the law, without fear or favor, and without regard to the \n     wishes or policy of the governing majority. Tom Griffith will \n     fervently adhere to this principle. As is natural in a \n     democracy, people will not always agree with Tom's decisions \n     from the bench. I will certainly not always agree with those \n     decisions. However, there will never be a question as to the \n     veracity behind them.\n  I think that Mr. Tolbert and Mr. Ellis have made some important \nobservations about Tom Griffith's competence and character.\n  In addition to his international work in helping to bring democratic \ninstitutions into formerly totalitarian regimes, Mr. Griffith has also \nserved as a Commissioner on the Secretary of Education's Commission on \nOpportunity in Athletics. There are many difficult issues that \nuniversities across the country face in operating balanced athletic \nprograms vis a vis male and female athletes in a era of constrained \nbudgets. Tom has been a constructive voice in this important dialogue \nand sometimes thankless task. I prepared to speak at further length on \nhis activities in this area but will not do so at this point. I will \ntell you that--not surprising for a father of five daughters--Tom has \nworked, consistent with the law, to bring opportunities for women \nathletes.\n  In addition to these activities, between 1996 and 2002 Tom Griffith \nserved as vice chairman of the Federalism and Separation of Powers \nPractice Group of the Federalist Society. As a long time friend and \nsupporter of the Federalist Society and its leader, Leonard Leo, I am \npleased that Tom has provide his thinking and energy to the important \nareas of federalism and separation of powers.\n  As befitting a man of his experience, Mr. Griffith has also given \nmany speeches in educational settings that cover a wide variety of \nlegal topics including, The Rule of Law; The Line Item Veto Act; \nDisciplining Congress: The Taxing and Spending Powers, and, of course, \nThe Impeachment of President Clinton.\n  In addition, Tom has authored several scholarly articles that have \nappeared in legal periodicals including his law review note, Beyond \nProcess: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause and \nhis more recent 2003 article in the Utah Bar Journal entitled, Lawyers \nand the Rule of Law.\n  The record is clear that Tom Griffith is an accomplished lawyer and \nan outstanding member of the bar. Despite the many highlights of \nacademic achievements and professional accomplishments that I have just \nreviewed, I have no doubt that Tom would describe his greatest joy in \nlife as his 28-year marriage to his wife, Susan, and the six children \nthat their marriage has produced. Tom and Susan have five daughters--\nChelsea, Megan, Erin, Victoria and Tanye and a son, Robert. Tom and \nSusan were recently made grandparents for the first time. They have a \nmonth old grandson, William Sawyer Watts. His parents are Chelsea and \nEric Watts. I would be remiss if I did not mention that Tom's only \nother married child, Megan, is married to Ryan Clegg.\n  I think it is both important and appropriate to note that Tom has \npent considerable time in positions of leadership in his church.\n  Now that I have spent a few minutes describing the basic facts out \nTom Griffith's education and experience, I will spend the next few \nminutes making some qualitative judgments about him.\n  I am all for Tom Griffith. Everyone knows that. I first became \nfamiliar with Tom through his work in the Senate. As Senate legal \ncounsel, he impressed many in this body for being hard-working, fair-\nminded, and honest. I am aware of no one who believes that he carried \nout his responsibilities as Senate legal counsel in a partisan manner.\n  And let's face it, the role of Senate legal counsel is not an easy \njob. We all know about the challenges and difficulties associated with \nthe impeachment trial. But let me just list a few other significant \nlegal matters that Mr. Griffith handled while in the Senate.\n  These include representing the Senate in various lawsuits relate to \nthe Line Item Veto Act; advising the Senate of its institutional \ninterests in the Senate campaign finance investigations held by the \nCommittee on Government Affairs with respect to fund raising of the \n1996 elections; representing the Senate in the investigations related \nto the contested 1996 Louisiana Senate election; and, many matters, \nincluding a Senate subpoena directed to the White House, related to the \nSenate Whitewater investigation.\n  You can see that the inherently controversial issues that the Senate \nlegal counsel is compelled to confront could easily end up in making \nsome particular Senators less than pleased from time to time. Add to \nthat the mother of all contentious issues--a Senate impeachment trial--\nand I hope you can see why a person like Tom Griffith, who came through \nthe impeachment trial with bipartisan respect, might be exactly the \ntype of individual we need on the D.C. Circuit.\n  But do not take it just from me. I will spend the next few minutes to \ntell you what judgments that others--leading Republicans and Democrats \nalike--have made about Tom Griffith.\n  Let me start by reciting from the testimony that my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Bennett, gave to the Judiciary Committee last fall. Here \nis what Senator Bennett said:\n\n     . . . Tom Griffith really needs no introduction to the Senate \n     because he served as Legal Counsel to the Senate in what is \n     perhaps the Senate's most difficult experience, at least the \n     most difficult experience in the time that I have been here. \n     Tom Griffith was Counsel to the Senate when we went through \n     the historic impeachment . . . trial of President Clinton--\n     only the second time in our Republic's history where the \n     Senate has had this kind of challenge. I was involved in \n     that, as were members of this Committee.\n       The primary burden of dealing with that challenge fell upon \n     the two leaders, Senator Lott as Majority Leader and Senator \n     Daschle as the Minority Leader. I watched with interest and \n     then admiration as Tom Griffith negotiated through that \n     particular mine field, giving very sound, calm, carefully \n     researched and reasoned advice to both sides. He was not a \n     partisan counsel. From my observation, Senator Daschle was as \n     reliant upon Tom Griffith's legal expertise as was Senator \n     Lott.\n       If I can take us back to the memory of that experience, \n     virtually everyone around us in Washington predicted a melt-\n     down. The comment was made that this case was toxic. It had \n     soiled the House of Representatives and it was going to soil \n     the United States Senate.\n     . . . the Senate came out of that experience with its \n     reputation enhanced rather than soiled, and to no small \n     degree that fact . . . is due to Tom Griffith.\n       There are very few nominees for the Federal bench who have \n     had the experience of going through that kind of fire, who \n     have had their judicial temperament tested in that kind of an \n     atmosphere. Tom Griffith therefore comes before this \n     Committee unique in terms of his experience and with the \n     Senate as a whole, and indeed in the national spotlight.\n\n  I think that there is much wisdom in Senator Bennett's reflections. I \nunderstand that Senator Bennett will come to the floor this afternoon \nand make some remarks about Mr. Griffith. I hope my colleagues will \nlisten carefully to my colleague and friend from Utah.\n  Unlike the vast majority of the nominees the Senate reviews, judicial \nand executive branch, many of us have had the chance to know Tom \nGriffith personally and to see how he acts\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\nunder extremely stressful, and sometimes extremely partisan, \ncircumstances. He has more than passed the test. Tom Griffith has been \nin the crucible of major political and legal events. He performed well \nunder the sometimes scorching heat of the situation and helped all of \nus get through that unique test.\n  But do not take it from me and Senator Bennett alone, after all we \nare both Republicans and Mr. Griffith is our constituent. Here is what \nsome leading Democrats have said about Tom Griffith.\n  Let me start with Senator Dodd, our colleague from Connecticut. Upon \nMr. Griffith's departure from the Senate, Senator Dodd made the \nfollowing remarks on the Senate floor:\n\n       Mr. DODD. As an original cosponsor of the resolution, I \n     rise today to add my remarks in support of, and in gratitude \n     to, our former Senate legal counsel, Mr. Tom Griffith.\n       It is always with mixed emotions that I speak on occasions \n     such as this. While I am glad for Tom and wish him well in \n     his return to private practice, I know that the Senate will \n     miss the wise counsel and dedication he demonstrated during \n     his nearly 4 years of service to this body.\n       The ancient Chinese had a curse in which they wished their \n     victim a life ``in interesting times''. For better or for \n     worse, Tom lived such a life as Senate legal counsel. From my \n     place on the Rules Committee--first as a member and now as \n     Ranking Member--I had a unique perspective on the legal \n     counsel's efforts to deal with numerous ``interesting'' \n     issues presenting novel, rare, and in some cases, historic \n     issues, including implementation of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act, resolution of the Louisiana election \n     challenge, and, of course, the recent impeachment trial. \n     Speaking for myself--and, I suspect, most of my colleagues--I \n     must say that Tom handled those difficult responsibilities \n     with great confidence and skill.\n       A more contemporary observer--and one of Connecticut's most \n     famous residents-- Mark Twain, once suggested: ``Always do \n     right--this will gratify some and astonish the rest.'' During \n     his tenure as legal counsel, Tom exemplified this philosophy, \n     impressing all who knew him with his knowledge of the law and \n     never succumbing to the temptation to bend the law to \n     partisan ends. All of us who serve here in the Senate know \n     the importance of the rule of law; but let us never forget \n     that it is individuals like Mr. Thomas Griffith whose calling \n     it is to put that ideal into practice.\n       Once again, I wish to express my gratitude to Tom for his \n     years of service, and I ask that my colleagues join me in \n     supporting this resolution.\n\n  To me, these comments by Senator Dodd speak volumes about the precise \nqualities we should all want in our judiciary.\n  As an old litigator myself, I can tell you that it is possible for \nlayers arguing against each other, fighting tooth and nail against each \nother every day, to come out of litigation with mutual respect. Of \ncourse it is possible for adversarial advocates to come out of trial \nwith less than admirable feelings towards one another.\n  Whatever your views on the merits of President Clinton's impeachment, \nI think that most everyone would agree that David Kendall and Lanny \nBreuer were zealous advocates in the President's defense.\n  So was Chuck Ruff. We all miss him. He was a good man and a great \nlawyer.\n  As you would imagine, during the course of the impeachment trial both \nDavid Kendall and Lanny Breuer got to know Tom Griffith. They came to \nrespect him.\n  I am prepared to debate more extensively on some concerns that have \nbeen raised and may be raised today about Mr. Griffith's bar \nmembership. I might add that the ABA has looked into this matter very \ncarefully and gave Mr. Griffith a qualified rating. And you would think \nthat if the ABA was satisfied on a matter relating to bar membership, \nthat this should put the matter to rest.\n  Nevertheless, some questions have been raised. This issue has been \nfully explored and, I think, put to rest in two Judiciary Committee \nhearings on Tom Griffith. In any event, it has been the subject of a \nfew stories in the press. I might add that one of the newspapers that \ncarried this story, The Washington Post, ultimately editorialized in \nsupport of the nomination of Mr. Griffith.\n  I thought it noteworthy that two leading Democratic lawyers, David \nKendall and Lanny Breuer undertook a public act by writing a letter to \nthe editor to the Washington Post that stated as follows:\n\n       For years Tom has been a leader in the bar and has shown \n     dedication to its principles. The Federal bench needs judges \n     like Tom, an excellent lawyer supported across the political \n     spectrum.\n\n  Their letter goes on to say: ``We support Tom and believe he has the \nintellect and judgment to be an excellent judge. ``\n  I want to emphasize that these are President Clinton's lawyers \ntalking about a Republican judicial nominee--Tom Griffith--whom they \ngot to know during the Senate impeachment trial.\n  But they are hardly alone. Many other leading Democratic lawyers hold \nTom Griffith in high esteem. These include Seth Waxman, solicitor \ngeneral of the United States in the Clinton Administration. Here is \nwhat Mr. Waxman wrote to The Washington Post in the aftermath of its \nstory on Mr. Griffith's bar status:\n\n       I have known Tom since he was Senate legal counsel and I \n     was Solicitor General, and I have the highest regard for his \n     integrity . . . For my own part, I would stake most \n     everything on his word alone. Litigants would be in good \n     hands with a person of Tom Griffith's character as their \n     judge.\n\n  That is high praise from one of the most skilled Supreme Court \npractitioners in this country. And once again, I point out that it is \ncoming from a leading Democratic lawyer in support of one of President \nBush's judicial nominees.\n  Support for Tom Griffith is equally vigorous on the part of leading \nRepublican lawyers. Despite having been recently exposed as not being \nDeep Throat--after 30 years of speculation to the contrary--Fred \nFielding, former White House Counsel to President Reagan, is still \nproperly regarded as one of the best lawyers in Washington, DC, or \nanywhere else for that matter. Tom Griffith was his law partner so they \nknow each other well.\n  Mr. Fielding, the former chairman of the American Bar Association's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, has described Mr. Griffith \nas ``a very special individual and a man possessed of the highest \nintegrity. He is a fine professional who demands of himself the very \nbest of his intellect and energies.''\n  Speaking of former White House Counsels supportive of Tom Griffith, I \nwould like to point out that Abner Mikva, a leading Democratic \nattorney, firmly supports Tom Griffith. Abner Mikva was a Democratic \nCongressman, and a Democratic appointee to the very court to which Mr. \nGriffith has been nominated to serve. Here is what he says about Mr. \nGriffith:\n\n       Tom Griffith will be a very good judge. I have worked with \n     him indirectly while he was counsel to the Senate and more \n     directly as a major supporter to the . . . Central and \n     Eastern European Law Institute of the American Bar \n     Association. Tom was an active member of CEELI's advisory \n     board, and he and I participated in many prospects and \n     missions on behalf of CEELI.\n       I have always found Tom to be diligent, thoughtful and of \n     the greatest integrity. I think that the bar admission \n     problems that have been raised about him do not reflect on \n     his integrity. Rather, they appear to be understandable \n     mistakes and negligence which cannot be raised to the level \n     of ethical behavior. Tom has a good temperament for the \n     bench, is moderate in his views and worthy of confirmation.\n\n  I think that Judge Mikva, a leading Democrat got it exactly right. \nTom is a man of high integrity and competence. Problems stemming from \nfailure to timely pay bar dues--a problem that besets some 3,000 \nmembers of the District of Columbia Bar Association each and every year \nand was immediately corrected by Mr. Griffith when brought to his \nattention--should not be artificially magnified. As Judge Mikva has \ncommented on this issue: ``. . . this is a whole lot of nothing.''\n  And that assessment--a whole lot of nothing--is from the former chief \njudge of the DC Circuit, former White House counsel to President \nClinton and former Congressman. If during this debate somebody tries to \nmake something out of nothing with respect to the bar membership issue, \nI just want you to remember what Ab Mikva has concluded because he has \na lot of experience in making these type of judgments from his time in \nCongress, at the White House, and on the bench.\n  Unfortunately--and with apologies to George Gershwin's Porgy and \nBess--sometimes in judicial confirmations, nothing's plenty for some.\n  Those who have known and worked with Tom Griffith praise him. Another \nname partner of Mr. Griffith's old firm, Richard Wiley, has this to say \nabout\n\n[[Page S6354]]\n\nhim: ``Tom is an outstanding lawyer, with keen judgment, congenial \ntemperament and impeccable personal integrity. He would bring great \nexpertise and fair-minded impartiality to the bench and, in my \njudgment, would be a considerable credit to the DC Circuit and the \nFederal Judiciary as a whole.''\n  While Dick Wiley is a leading Republican attorney, not all of the \nattorneys at the firm he founded are Republicans. Here is what Tom \nBrunner of Wiley, Rein and Fielding has to say about Tom Griffith.\n\n       I offer these views from the perspective of a life-long and \n     politically active Democrat. While Tom and I don't always \n     agree on partisan political issues, I have the highest regard \n     for his integrity and for his open-mindedness. As a judge, he \n     would approach each case without prejudice, with a \n     willingness to be educated and considerations he did not \n     previously understand and a rock-solid commitment to \n     fairness.\n\n  Last year I received a letter from 13 leading Democratic attorneys, \nincluding former Representative Jim Slattery, Bill Idle, President of \nthe ABA in 1993-1994, and Sandy D'Alemberte, President of the ABA in \n1991-1992. Here is what this distinguished group of Democratic lawyers \nhad to say about Tom Griffith:\n\n       Each of us has had extensive contact with Tom and believes \n     him to be extremely well qualified for service on the D.C. \n     Circuit. For year Tom has been a leader in the bar and has \n     shown dedication to its principles. The Federal bench needs \n     people like him, one of the best lawyers the bar has to \n     offer. We urge the Senate to confirm his nomination.\n\n  I must say that I heartily join them in urging the Senate to confirm \nTom Griffith to the DC Circuit.\n  Over the past several years, we have heard many criticize President \nBush for nominating individuals that my friends across the aisle find \ntoo divisive. As I have just shown, in nominating Tom Griffith, \nPresident Bush has made a conscious attempt to submit the name of an \nindividual that has broad bipartisan support.\n\n  I just hope that my colleagues across the aisle will recognize the \nsimple fact that President Bush is offering a nominee that he hopes, \nand I hope and expect, will gain a broad bipartisan vote of support.\n  I was pleased that despite some concern expressed by some Democrats \non the Judiciary Committee that Tom Griffith received the support of \nmany Committee Democrats, including the support of both Senators Durbin \nand Schumer, both of whom who would acknowledge the fact that they are \nsometimes among the toughest critics of President Bush's judicial \nnominees.\n  The minority leader, Senator Reid, has expressed a willingness to \nbring the Griffith nomination up for a vote and I hope that he supports \nMr. Griffith.\n  Tom Griffith is an extraordinarily qualified nominee. He has the \neducation, experience, judgment, and character to make a fine judge. \nThose of you who worked with him while he was Senate legal counsel know \nthis to be the case. I ask that those of you who are new to this body \nor did not work with Mr. Griffith while he was here ask the opinion of \nthose of us who were in the Senate and worked closely with him.\n  I am old-fashioned enough to believe in the notion of the Senate \nfamily. Tom Griffith is part of the Senate family. I, and many of my \nSenate colleagues, have reputations for helping deserving members of \nthe Senate family because we recognize that some of the most public-\nspirited individuals in our country choose to work in the Congress, \nincluding some of our most energetic, smart and idealistic young \npeople.\n  I also recognize that given the extraordinary capabilities of staff \nmembers, such as Tom Griffith, it is only fitting and natural for \nCongressional staff to move into positions of great responsibility \nwithin the judicial and executive branches of government. So I always \ntry to help along and give the benefit of the doubt to Congressional \nstaffers who are nominated to serve by the President--any President, \nRepublican or Democrat.\n  I take great pride in lobbying on behalf of a former Democratic Chief \nCounsel of the Judiciary Committee, Stephen Breyer, to serve on both \nthe 1st Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.\n  I would hope that my colleagues will continue to join me in this \napproach of recognizing those who have done well for the American \npublic in serving the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to act to send Tom Griffith off to the D.C. \nCircuit with the type of broad bipartisan confirmation vote that \nreflects the broad bipartisan support that his nomination has \nengendered.\n  For me, this is an easy vote. I know Tom and his record. I hope that \nafter all of my colleagues have considered his qualifications, it will \nbe an easy vote for them as well. Tom Griffith is a good man and has \nwhat it takes in terms of education, intelligence, judgment and \ncharacter, to become a great judge.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Tom Griffith to serve on the \nD.C. Court Circuit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there was \n4 hours of debate evenly divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I will take such time as I may need.\n  Mr. LEAHY, Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Thomas Griffith \nto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Mr. Griffith's \ndecision to practice law without a license for a good part of his \ncareer should be disqualifying. Mr. Griffith has foregone at least 10 \nopportunities to take the bar in Utah, and has continued to refuse \nduring the pendency of his nomination. In this regard he appears to \nthink he is above the law. That is not the kind of person who should be \nentrusted with a lifetime appointment to a Federal court and, least of \nall, to such an important court as the DC Circuit, which is entrusted \nwith protecting the rights of all Americans. This is the wrong \nnomination for this court and I will vote against it.\n  The DC Circuit is an especially important court in our Nation's \njudicial system for its broad caseload covering issues as varied as \nreviews of Federal regulation on the environment, workplace safety, \ntelecommunications, consumer protection, and other critical Federal \nstatutory and constitutional rights. The White House has rejected all \nDemocratic efforts to work together on consensus nominees for this \ncourt and refused to engage in consultation. That is too bad and \ntotally unnecessary. This is another in a series of inappropriate \nnominations this President has made to this court. Last week, Senate \nRepublicans voted in lockstep to confirm Janice Rogers Brown to this \ncourt. The takeover of this court is now complete. Mr. Griffith is the \nthird nominee from President Bush to be considered by the Senate. If \nconfirmed the eleven judges on the court will include a majority of \nseven judges appointed by Republican Presidents.\n  At Mr. Griffith's hearing last March, I noted that unlike the many \nanonymous Republican holds and pocket filibusters that kept more than \n60 of President Clinton's moderate and qualified judicial nominees from \nmoving forward, the concerns about Mr. Griffith were no secret. Unlike \nthe Republicans' pocket filibusters of Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan, \nwho were each denied consideration and an up-or-down vote when \nnominated to the DC Circuit, Mr. Griffith knows full well that I think \nhe has not honored the rule of law by his practicing law in Utah for \nfive years without ever bothering to fulfill his obligation to become a \nmember of the Utah Bar.\n  He has testified that he has obtained a Utah driver's license and \npays Utah State taxes, but he is not a member of the bar despite \nadmitting practicing law there since 2000. According to his answers to \nmy questions, he has taken no steps to fulfill the requirements for \npracticing law in Utah by taking the Utah bar exam and becoming a \nmember of the Utah Bar. He was also derelict in his duty toward the DC \nBar, and less than forthcoming with us on questions related to his \nrepeated failures to maintain his D.C. Bar membership and his failures \nto pay his annual dues on time not just once, not twice, but in 1996, \n1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. He was twice suspended for his \nfailures, including one suspension that lasted for three years.\n  As was reported last summer in The Washington Post, and confirmed \nthrough committee investigation, Mr. Griffith has spent the last five \nyears\n\n[[Page S6355]]\n\npracticing law in Utah as the General Counsel to Brigham Young \nUniversity. In all that time he has not been licensed to practice law \nin Utah, nor has he followed through on any serious effort to become \nlicensed. He has hidden behind a curtain of shifting explanations, \nthrown up smokescreens of letters from various personal friends and \npolitical allies, and refused to acknowledge what we all know to be \ntrue: Mr. Griffith should have taken the bar.\n  Mr. Griffith has so far foregone ten opportunities to take the Utah \nbar exam while applying for and maintaining his position as general \ncounsel at BYU. This conscious and continuous disregard of basic legal \nobligations is not consistent with the respect for law we should demand \nof lifetime appointments to the Federal courts. Neither has Mr. \nGriffith yet satisfactorily explained why he obstinately refuses to \ntake the Utah bar.\n  This is not Mr. Griffith's first or only bar problem. He was \nsuspended for failing to pay his DC Bar dues and then misled this \ncommittee on the facts of that suspension as well as other late \npayments. Contrary to his misleading testimony at his hearing, it seems \nthat the only year Mr. Griffith actually paid his DC bar dues on time, \nafter coming to the Senate in 1995, was in 1995. Two suspensions from \nthe practice of law in two years, three late or non-existent payments \nin four years, and an attempt to mischaracterize this embarrassing \nrecord are hardly just an single ``administrative oversight'' unless by \nthat Mr. Griffith means to indicate that his single admitted error is \nthat he does not comply with the law.\n  What may be more disturbing than Mr. Griffith's failure to pay his DC \ndues, is his lack of concern about the implications of having practiced \nlaw in DC without proper licensure. When I asked him if he had notified \nhis clients or law firm from the period he was suspended, he brushed me \noff, telling me that his membership in good standing was reinstated \nonce he got around to paying his unpaid dues. Of course, that ignored \nmy question, which was about the ramifications of having been suspended \nfor two separate periods over the course of years while he continued to \npractice. Clients and partners should have been notified and courts \nshould have been informed.\n  The Department of Justice apparently agrees that suspension for \nfailure to pay bar dues is a serious matter. Recent newspaper reports \ndisclosed that the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility \ntakes such a matter seriously enough to have opened an investigation \ninto the case of a longtime career attorney there who, like Mr. \nGriffith, was suspended from the DC bar because he did not pay his \ndues. Unlike Mr. Griffith's case, the Department is concerned enough \nabout such a suspension that they filed notices with the courts in \nevery case this attorney worked on during the period of his suspension, \nnotifying them that he was not authorized to practice at the time. \nPracticing law without a license is a serious matter.\n  The facts surrounding Mr. Griffith's nonexistent membership in the \nUtah bar are even more troubling. He began his service as assistant to \nthe president of the university and general counsel of BYU in 2000. At \nthat time he was not a member of the Utah bar, he was suspended from \nmembership in the bar of the District of Columbia, and he was an \ninactive member of the North Carolina bar. Mr. Griffith's own testimony \nis that for the last five years, as part of his responsibilities as BYU \ngeneral counsel, he has been practicing law in Utah.\n\n  So, what made Mr. Griffith think he could practice law without being \na member of the Utah bar? Mr. Griffith testified that he relied on an \nin-house counsel exception that does not exist in Utah statutes and is \nnot recognized by the Utah Supreme Court, as Mr. Griffith was forced to \nconcede. It was a most convenient and self-serving excuse. There is no \nsuch ``general counsel'' exception in Utah and there never has been. He \ncould not point to any Utah statute or Utah Supreme Court pronouncement \nallowing this behavior--because it does not exist as a matter of law. \nMoreover, his predecessor at BYU and the general counsels of the other \nuniversities in Utah are all members of the Utah bar.\n  Mr. Griffith has never been able to identify who at the Utah bar he \nclaims advised him that he did not need to join the bar. This \nfundamental refusal to abide by the law is all the more troubling by \nMr. Griffith's obstinate behavior in refusing to take the bar in order \nto cure his failure. This is not complicated: Get licensed. Indeed, \nduring the course of committee consideration he admitted that when he \nasked a second-year law student to research the matter she came back to \nhim and advised that he should take the bar. Yet here we are, with the \nSenate being urged to confirm someone to a lifetime appointment as a \nFederal judge on a court with jurisdiction over important cases that \ncan have nationwide impact and that nominee has adamantly refused to \nfollow legal requirements in his own legal practice.\n  The general counsel of the Utah bar, Katherine Fox, wrote to Mr. \nGriffith on May 14, 2003, telling him she was ``surprised'' he thought \nthere was a general counsel exception, and explained that there was no \nway under his circumstances to waive into the Utah bar without taking \nthe bar exam. This response from a career lawyer in the Utah bar made \nbefore political pressure was ratcheted up to defend a Republican \nnominee seems pretty straightforward to me. In plain, simple to \nunderstand words, Ms. Fox instructed Mr. Griffith to take the bar \nexamination at the earliest opportunity. That was more than two years \nago. Mr. Griffith refused to comply.\n  In an interpretation worthy of the Queen of Hearts from Alice in \nWonderland, Mr. Griffith and his supporters have defied logic and \nreason by turning Ms. Fox's letter upside down in an attempt to \ncharacterize it as something other than it is and to condone his \nconduct. If he will make this self-serving interpretation in this case, \nwhat makes anyone think that he will not be the same sort of ends-\noriented judge that will twist facts and law in cases he rules on from \nthe Federal bench? Ms. Fox's recommendation that he ``closely \nassociate'' himself with a Utah lawyer until he takes the bar and \nbecomes a member of the bar was not offered as an indefinite safe \nharbor that permits him to violate Utah law. Ms. Fox's letter is being \nmisused and mischaracterized as an invitation to flout the law. This is \nthe kind of reinterpretation in one's own interest that characterizes \njudicial activism of the worst sort when employed by a judge.\n  There are more reasons for serious concern about Mr. Griffith's \nfitness to be a member of the DC Circuit Court. His judgment is brought \ninto serious question by his views on Title IX of our civil rights \nlaws. This charter of fundamental fairness has been the engine for \novercoming discrimination against women in education and the growth of \nwomen's athletics. I urge all Senators to think about our daughters and \ngranddaughters, the pride we felt when the U.S. women's soccer team \nbegan winning gold medals and World Cups, the joy they see in young \nwomen with the opportunity to play basketball and ski and compete and \ngrow.\n  With the recent reinterpretation of title IX being imposed by this \nadministration in ways that will no doubt be challenged through the \ncourts, we may now understand why the Bush administration sees the \nappointment of Mr. Griffith to the DC Circuit Court as such a priority. \nHis narrow views on title IX were unveiled during his efforts as a \nmember of the Bush administration Secretary of Education's Commission \non Opportunity in Athletics, to constrict the impact of title IX. Does \nanyone doubt that he would rule that the Bush administration's revision \nthrough regulations should be upheld?\n  The United States Supreme Court recently decided that whistleblowers \nare protected in the title IX context. That was a close, 5-4 decision, \nin which Justice O'Connor wrote for the majority. Just the other day \nthe Justices refused to hear a challenge to an appellate court decision \nthat essentially found that title IX could not be blamed for cutbacks \nin men's athletic programs. These recent legal developments regarding \nTitle IX serve to remind us how important each of these lifetime \nappointments to the Federal courts is. In light of the record on this \nnomination, I am not prepared to take a chance on it and will vote \nagainst it.\n  I also note that during the Clinton presidency, Senate Republicans \nensured that the 11th and 12th judgeships\n\n[[Page S6356]]\n\non the DC Circuit were not filled. They had argued since 1995 that the \ncaseload of the DC Circuit did not justify a full complement on the \ncourt. Indeed at a 1995 hearing, they called Judge Laurence H. \nSilberman of the circuit to so testify. Republicans have argued for \nyears this circuit's caseload per judge is one of the lightest in the \ncountry. In a May 9, 2000, letter to Senator Kyl, Judge Silberman \nargued that the DC Circuit's caseload continued to decline from 1995 to \n2000 and to oppose confirmation of additional Clinton nominees.\n  In fact, the DC Circuit caseload has continued to decline and in 2004 \nwas less than it was in 1999, when Senate Republicans refused to \nconsider two highly qualified and moderate nominations by President \nClinton to vacancies on the circuit. With the confirmation of Janice \nRogers Brown to that court, there are now ten confirmed, active judges \nfor the DC Circuit, which is what Republicans maintained was \nappropriate since 1999.\n  With all the self-righteous talk from the other side of the aisle \nabout their new-found principle that every judicial nominee is entitled \nto an up or down vote, the facts are that in 1999 and 2000 the \nnomination of Elena Kagan to the DC Circuit was pocket filibustered by \nthose same Senate Republicans. Ms. Kagan is now dean of the Harvard Law \nSchool. Qualified? Yes. Was she given consideration in a Republican run \nSenate? Not on your life. Likewise the nomination of Allen Snyder to a \nvacancy on the DC Circuit was never voted upon. Mr. Snyder is a former \nclerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist and was a highly respected partner in \na prominent DC law firm, the same law firm from which President Bush \nnominated John Roberts to the same court. Senate Republicans pocket \nfilibustered President Clinton's nomination of Mr. Snyder but \nunanimously supported the confirmation of Mr. Roberts. Senate \nRepublicans played a cruel joke on Mr. Snyder when they allowed him a \nhearing but would never list him for a vote before the Judiciary \nCommittee or the Senate.\n\n  In September 2002, Senator Sessions explained that Clinton nominees \nElena Kagan and Allen Snyder were blocked: ``Because the circuit had a \ncaseload about one-fourth the average caseload per judge. And the chief \njudge of the circuit said 10 judges is enough, instead of 12. And I \nactually thought that was too many. I thought ten was too many.''\n  Well, the DC Circuit's caseload per judge is lower now than it was \nduring the Clinton administration. Let us see whether the votes of \nRepublican Senators this time will be based on the same rationale they \ngave to pocket filibuster Clinton nominees.\n  Last week we witnessed a Republican Senator, who had voted against \nthe confirmation of a Clinton judicial recess appointment and had \nexplained his vote as opposition to recess appointments, reverse \nhimself to vote for a Bush judicial recess appointment. Last week we \nwitnessed dozens of Republican Senators, who had voted against \nconfirmation of Ronnie White of Missouri in 1999 and explained their \nvote as compelled by the opposition of his home-state Senators, reverse \nthemselves and vote in favor of Justice Janice Rogers Brown and ignore \nthe strong, consistent and well founded opposition of her two home-\nstate Senators.\n  Tomorrow we will see whether the many Republican Senators who delayed \nand opposed the confirmation of Judge Merrick Garland in 1996 and 1997 \nand who pocket filibustered the nominations of Allen Snyder and Elena \nKagan in 1999 and 2000 will vote against a Bush nominee to the DC \nCircuit because the caseload of the circuit does not justify more \njudges. Tomorrow we will see if many Republican Senators again retreat \nfrom their earlier rationale because today a Republican controls the \nWhite House.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Concentration of Media Broadcasting\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a couple of things have happened in the \nlast several days that I want to visit. First, I wish to talk for a \nmoment about public broadcasting and, secondly, to talk about a Supreme \nCourt decision that was announced this morning here in Washington, DC, \nand the relationship between the two.\n  First, I will talk about public broadcasting. I confess I am a big \nsupporter, a big fan of public broadcasting. I think they are an \norganization that provides an independent view of a range of issues to \nthe American people. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, public \ntelevision, and public radio, I think, provide a significant service to \nthis country.\n  In a time when there is this enormous concentration in the media, \nmore and more television stations are being bought up by fewer and \nfewer companies--one company owns over 1,200 radio stations in this \ncountry--the Federal Communications Commission writes new rules that \nget overturned by the courts, frankly, that say you can even buy up \nmore of these properties. In fact, the rules the Federal Communications \nCommission developed some while ago said it is going to be all right in \none of America's major cities for one company to own three television \nstations, eight radio stations, the dominant newspaper, and the cable \ncompany. That is unbelievable. Are they dead from the neck up? What \npossibly could they be thinking?\n  Fortunately for us, the Federal courts struck down the new rules and, \nfortunately for us, this morning the Supreme Court decided that the \ncourt had justification in striking down these new ownership rules.\n  Again, I do not think it makes any sense to have a handful of people \nin this country determining what the American people see, hear, and \nread, and that is exactly what is happening.\n  That brings me back to public broadcasting. It is interesting that at \na time of this concentration in the media--one company owning a lot of \nradio stations, 1,200 of them, one company and several companies owning \na lot of television stations--at a time when there is not much room for \ndiscord and voices, which, incidentally, I think strengthens a \ndemocracy.\n  There is this old saying when everyone is thinking the same thing, \nnobody is thinking very much. This democracy of ours, this system of \nself-government, this country that is full of self-expression is \nstrengthened, in my judgment, by an exchange of views of people who \nhave different views. But that, regrettably, is seen somehow as being \ndisloyal these days.\n  Oh, I know, someone in the Dixie Chicks said something that was \nunpopular about the President, and then we had tractors driving over \nthe CDs from the Dixie Chicks and big rallies to burn their music. Just \nbefore the last election, one television consortium decided they were \ngoing to run a clearly partisan film designed to attack only one \nPresidential candidate and not allow time for the opposing view. This \nwas a television consortium that nearly every single night was doing \neditorials against one of the Presidential candidates.\n  In Minot, ND, late one evening, a train ran the tracks and some cars \nof anhydrous ammonia spilled a plume over that community of nearly \n50,000 people, and that deadly cloud of anhydrous ammonia enveloped \nthat community at about 2 o'clock in the morning. There is some \ndisagreement about the events of that night, but reports are that the \ntelephone calls went to the local radio station, and were not answered. \nAll the radio stations in Minot are owned by one company.\n  What is happening in these broadcast facilities these days is they \nare running a broadcast out of a board someplace 1,000 miles away, \nsomeone who is homogenizing the music to run it\n\n[[Page S6357]]\n\nthrough the local station. There is no local broadcasting in many \ncases. What you have is a company 1,000 miles or 1,500 miles away \ndeciding they are going to run some homogenized music through the sound \nboard. You do not even need people around to do that.\n  The Minot, ND, story is one that has been well repeated. I know there \nis some dispute about a number of the details, but the fact is, there \nshould not be any dispute about what is happening with this \nconcentration. We now have people who sit in a basement, perhaps 20, 30 \nmiles from here--one of the examples I heard was over in Baltimore, a \nguy sitting in a basement studio saying: It is sunny in Salt Lake City. \nWhat a beautiful morning to wake up in Salt Lake City. He was not in \nSalt Lake City. He was in a basement in Baltimore.\n  He was reading off the Internet, pretending he was broadcasting to \nthe local folks over the local station in Salt Lake City. They have a \nterm for that. They also have a term for the kind of homogenized \ntelevision news that is put out by people who are not in your region to \nmake it look like it is locally produced news.\n  We have this massive concentration in the media, which I think is \nawful, the FCC promoted rules that says we will let them concentrate \neven further. As I said, in a major city, under the FCC rule, one would \nbe able to own eight radio stations, three television stations, the \ncable company, and buy the dominant newspaper all at the same time. I \nthink it was one of the single most complete cave-ins to the biggest \ncorporate interests in this country I have ever seen: The public \ninterest be damned.\n  The FCC had three-quarters of a million people write to it to say: Do \nnot do this. It did not matter to them. They just did it. Now they have \nbeen enjoined by a court. The Supreme Court says they cannot continue \nand so now they have to start over. Perhaps when they start over they \nwill understand they also have a responsibility to work for the public \ninterest, which brings me to public television.\n  A couple of things are kicking around about public television. Last \nweek, I believe on Thursday or Friday, the appropriations subcommittee \nin the House decided to cut funding for public broadcasting. The cut in \nfunding probably meets the interests of some who would like to abolish \nit. I do not know. I know we had one of our colleagues some years ago \ndecide to get in a big fight with Big Bird and, frankly, Big Bird won. \nPublic broadcasting is widely supported in this country.\n  In recent years, we have heard a drumbeat by people who say public \nbroadcasting, public television, public radio, is biased. It has a \nliberal bias, they say. No evidence of that, to my knowledge. Still, \nthe mantra seems to try to brand it as something that is anathema to \nfairness or balance.\n  The other day I called Mr. Tomlinson, who is the Chairman of the \nBoard of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He has been in the \nnews a great deal. In fact, as Chairman, he is one who has made the \npoint that he believes that some of the programming is not balanced, is \nin fact biased towards the liberal view.\n  I talked to Mr. Tomlinson by telephone the other day. I do not know \nhim. I do not have anything bad to say about him. But I called him \nbecause of what I had read in the public domain that he has said as \nchairman of the board.\n  I knew he had hired, with public funds, a consultant to come in and \ntake a look at programming, particularly Bill Moyers', called ``NOW,'' \nI believe it was titled, to see if it was fair. I will not use ``fair \nand balanced'' because that belongs to another brand.\n  So I wrote to Mr. Tomlinson and asked: Why do you not send me the \nwork papers, send me the summary. I would like to see this report that \nyou empaneled with public funding. He did. He sent me what he called \nthe raw data. The raw data is here. This is raw, certainly, and I guess \nit is data, but there is no summary. So I called to ask: Would you \nplease also send me summary.\n  If one looks through the raw data, it is unusual and strange. I will \nnot enter this into the record. I will not put all of this information \ninto the record. I am not going to read from all of it. I am still \nawaiting a summary. But I must say that the Chairman of the Board of \nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting hired a consultant to do an \nevaluation of programming. Then we have all of these sheets that \ndescribe the guests and it says: anti-Bush, anti-Bush, pro-Bush, anti-\nBush. It appears to me to be not so much an evaluation of is this \nslanted, is it liberal, does it have an agenda; it is the evaluation of \nis this program critical of the President?\n\n  Is that why a consultant was employed, to see whether public \nbroadcasting is critical of our President? God forbid that we would be \ncritical of the President of the United States.\n  I find it interesting that in this evaluation--this one is \nincidentally conservative/liberal, C or L. This was not anti-Bush but C \nor L. My colleague, Senator Hagel from Nebraska, appeared on one of the \nprograms, and he apparently disagreed with a portion of President \nBush's strategy with respect to Iraq. So my colleague, Senator Hagel, \nis referred to as liberal. He is a liberal contributor to National \nPublic Radio. My guess is that is going to surprise a lot of \nNebraskans.\n  If he were on the floor he would probably say he is a pretty good \nconservative Republican, someone for whom I have deep admiration, but \nhe kind of claimed the liberal status according to the consultant.\n  This is pretty unseemly, frankly, spending public money on a \nconsultant who then sits down and looks at all of these programs to see \nif something is being said that might be critical about a President or \nCongress.\n  Well, I guess that is enough to say about this particular report. I \nwill await the summary, but as someone who supports public broadcasting \nand thinks it contributes a great deal to this country--and by the way, \nwho do my colleagues think has been willing to do programs about the \nconcentration of media ownership in this country, about the fact that \none company has gobbled up over 1,200 radio stations and fewer people \nare involved in what we hear, what we see and what we read in this \ncountry because they are gobbling up all the television stations as \nwell? Who do my colleagues think has the guts to do programs on the \nquestion of what does the concentration in the media mean in America?\n  Is it ABC, or CBS, or NBC? Get real. Do my colleagues think they are \ngoing to do that? They are involved in the concentration. Public \nbroadcasting did it. Public broadcasting is willing to take this on.\n  How about a program that describes waste in the Defense Department? I \nam on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I feel very strongly \nabout our country having a strong defense. I feel passionate about \nsupporting men and women who wear this country's uniform. We need to \nhonor them and support them in every way possible. I also happen to \nthink that the Pentagon is one of the largest bureaucracies in the \nworld, and there is massive waste there. So public television did one \nprogram in which they talked about waste over at the Pentagon. Do you \nknow how that is described? Antidefense. God forbid that you should \ndescribe waste at the Pentagon because then you will be classified, \naccording to this consultant, as antidefense.\n\n  Let me describe something that was going on deep in the bowels of the \nPentagon about a year and a half ago. They spent about $8 million, and \nthey were going to create what was called a futures market for \nterrorism. It was basically supposed to be an online betting parlor.\n  For example, you would be able to bet on such things as: How many \nAmerican soldiers would be killed in the next year? Would the King of \nJordan be assassinated within the next 12 months?\n  Yes, that is exactly what the Pentagon was preparing to put up and \noperate in a real way on the Internet. They were within 3 days of doing \nit, and they wanted $8 million to continue it for the next fiscal year.\n  Senator Wyden and I discovered what they were trying to do. We blew \nit wide open. We had a press conference, described what they were \ndoing, had on the Internet to show that they were only days away from \nimplementing this crazy strategy, and the next day, the Department of \nDefense shut it down.\n  At the press conference, I said this idea of setting up an online \nbetting\n\n[[Page S6358]]\n\nparlor to take bets on terrorism was unbelievably stupid. Can you \nimagine, setting up a futures market by which Americans can buy futures \ncontracts and effectively bet on how many soldiers will be killed in \nthe coming year? That is exactly what was going to happen in the bowels \nof the Pentagon.\n  Just as an aside, one of my staff people, about 4 months later, used \na Google search and typed in the words ``unbelievably stupid,'' and my \nname came up. That is the danger of Google, I suppose.\n  But the fact is, what was happening in the bowels of the Pentagon \nwas, in fact, unbelievably stupid and a tragic waste of the taxpayers' \nmoney and very unseemly, so we shut it down. Would that be called \nantidefense? I guess so. I guess, according to this consultant, that is \nantidefense. It may even be anti-Bush, I don't know.\n  On top of all this, the attack on public broadcasting by cutting the \nfunding in the U.S. House, by hiring a consultant--unknown to the \nBoard, by the way--with public funding to try to determine what is \nanti-Bush and pro-Bush or liberal or conservative--on top of all that, \nlast week, the Washington Post reports that the search for the new \npresident of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has narrowed. I \ndon't know whether it is true. I am just telling you what was in the \npapers last week. It has narrowed to two candidates, and the leading \ncandidate is a former co-chair of the Republican National Committee. A \nformer co-chair of the Republican National Committee they are going to \nmake head, the president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting? I \ndon't think so. At least those who worry about bias, those who worry \nabout objectivity, ought not be thinking about presenting to this \nCongress something as unprecedented as that.\n  I want public broadcasting in this country to be what it has always \nbeen: a proud symbol of independence, willing to search for the truth \nwherever it exists and willing to take on tough subjects. I mentioned \nthat it falls to the Public Broadcasting System to air the programs \nabout concentration in the media. Do you know why? Because FOX News is \nnot going to do it, CBS is not going to do it, NBC and ABC won't do it. \nSo the American people will be spoon-fed this intellectual pabulum that \nsays: All this is really good. If one company owns all the radio \nstations in your town, good for you.\n  It is not good for you. Who is going to broadcast the local baseball \ngames? Who is going to broadcast the local parade? Who is going to \nreport on local issues, when someone in a basement in a city not far \nfrom here is broadcasting over a radio station in Salt Lake City and \npretending to be living there when, in fact, they have never set foot \nin the town?\n\n  Enough about that--only to say that some of us in this Chamber and \nsome of us in Congress care very deeply about the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting, about public television and public radio. I happen \nto listen to NPR, National Public Radio, on the way in the mornings, in \nto work in the Capitol. I think it is some of the best news you can \nfind.\n  Let me say I listen in the evening, when I can, to Jim Lehrer. I \nchallenge you to find a better newscast than that which exists on \npublic television. There are those who believe they want to abolish \nfunding for it. If there are those who believe they want to have a \nformer co-chair of the Republican National Committee now assume the \npresidency at a time when they themselves have raised all these \nquestions and hired consultants about objectivity, I want them to know \nthey are in for a fight because some of us care deeply about the future \nof public broadcasting in this country.\n  I wish to talk just for a moment about an announcement last week. \nComing in, listening to the radio this morning, I heard a report that \nthe dollar had strengthened just a bit recently. It has strengthened on \nthe news that last Friday, at 8:30 in the morning, our trade deficit \nwas announced, and our trade deficit last Friday was announced to be \nonly $57 billion. It actually went up to $57 billion, a significant \nincrease from the month before, but a bit less than had been expected. \nOn the strength of that, the dollar improved a little bit because the \ncurrency market, which is probably on medication of some type, believes \nthat is marginally good news.\n  This is the fourth highest monthly trade deficit in the history of \nthis country, the fourth highest trade deficit ever. What it means is \nwe are drowning in a sea of red ink. Going back to 1998, these are our \nmonthly trade deficits on this chart. It means we are buying more from \nabroad than they are selling, importing much more than we are \nexporting. So each day, we sell about $2 billion worth of America. Each \nand every day, 7 days a week, we sell about $2 billion worth of our \ncountry.\n  This is what we expect. If we take a look at the first 4 months of \ntrade deficits this year, it is 22 percent higher than last year. You \nsee, last year was a big record. This year, we are probably headed \ntoward $750 billion in the annual trade deficit.\n  To a lot of people, the trade deficit doesn't matter; it is just a \nterm. There is nobody in this Chamber wearing a dark-blue suit who is \never going to lose his job because of a trade deficit. It is just folks \nworking on production lines and working for American companies who \ndiscover that this trade deficit means we are buying from abroad what \nwe used to buy at home and sending American jobs abroad. We are firing \nthe workers at home and doing it relentlessly, day after day after day.\n  There are some who say, ``I know you are using these statistics and \nthis data, but what really matters is how it relates to the entire \neconomy.'' You can see how it relates to the economy. It is going up, \nup as a percent of our GDP.\n  Finally, while our trade deficit is a serious problem with Japan, \nwith Canada, with Mexico, with Europe, this is the 500 pound gorilla--\nChina. It is a dramatic problem.\n  I have spoken at length. Some do not want to hear it anymore, but it \nis worth saying again because, you know, repetition is important, at \nleast for slow learners. For others, it is important just to remember. \nLet me describe some specific examples.\n  Incidentally, I notice the Presiding Officer smiled a bit. I am not \nspeaking about anyone in this Chamber being a slow learner. These are \nall advanced learners who serve in the Senate, I am sure. But let me \ndescribe some stories, if I might. I have used them all.\n  Huffy bicycles. In fact, I got a letter from Huffy bicycles. They \ndidn't like what I said. Huffy bicycles used to be made in Ohio. It was \n20 percent of the bicycle market in the United States. You buy them all \nat Wal-Mart, Kmart, Sears. The people in Ohio who made Huffy bicycles \nactually put a little decal between the handle bar and the front \nfender. The decal was the American flag.\n\n  The workers in Ohio who made Huffy bicycles were fired because they \nwere making $11 an hour plus benefits, and their jobs went to China for \n30 cents an hour by people who work 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a \nday.\n  The last job performed by those folks in Ohio was to take off the \nlittle flag decal on the Huffy bicycle and replace it with a decal of \nthe globe. Huffy bicycles are not American any more. They are Chinese. \nWhy? Because American workers were making $11 an hour plus benefits. \nThey were paid too much money.\n  Radio Flyer, the little red wagon that all the children in this \ncountry played with, was an American company for 110 years. It is gone \nnow. Little red wagons are made elsewhere. Why? Because the American \nworkers cost too much.\n  Levis? There is not one pair of Levis made in the United States. \nNone. It is an all American company. Levis are gone.\n  Fig Newton cookies. Want to buy some Mexican food? Fig Newton cookies \nare made in Monterey, Mexico. They left this country to be made in \nMexico.\n  Fruit of the Loom underwear, shorts, shirts--gone.\n  I could go on and on at great length. But these are companies who \ntook their jobs elsewhere. Why? Because you can find labor dirt cheap, \nyou can instantly move technology and capital, and then you can produce \nthat product--yes, bicycles, wagons, underwear, shirts, shoes, \ntrousers, trinkets, you name it--you can produce it elsewhere. Then you \ncan ship it to Toledo, Fargo, to Los Angeles, Boston, New York, and \nsell it to the American consumer.\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\n  It is a brilliant strategy, if you are a big corporation that wants \nto maximize your profits. It is a devastating strategy, if you have \nworked all your life in a factory, proud of what you produce, and have \njust been told your job is gone.\n  Thirty years ago, the largest American corporation was General \nMotors. People frequently worked for that corporation for a lifetime, \ngenerally were paid a pretty good wage, were paid health care and also \nretirement benefits. Now, the largest corporation is Wal-Mart. I don't \nhave to tell you what the average wage is, what the turnover is. The \nfact is, it is dramatically different, with less stability, fewer \nbenefits, lower wages.\n  This country is in a race to the bottom, and what we ought to be \ndoing with the strategy on international trade is lifting others up. \nInstead, we are pushing American workers down.\n  The other day, I found out that Lama boots, Tony Lama boots--I talk \nabout Levis being all American, when you spot someone with Tony Lama \nboots, you think that is all American. Tony Lama boots has now moved to \nChina.\n  The list goes on and on and on.\n  So the question is, when will this country stand up for its own \neconomic interests? Not build walls around America, but at least \ndevelop a straight strategy that tries to lift others up rather than \npush us down. There is a feeling among some that workers do not matter \nvery much, workers are like wrenches, like screwdrivers and pliers. Use \nthem, use them up, and you throw them away. And throwing them away is \nas easy as saying, sayonara, so long, we are off to China, off to Sri \nLanka, off to Bangladesh.\n  The thing is, none of this works. Henry Ford used to believe that he \nwanted his workers to earn a sufficient income so they could buy the \nproduct they produce. He wanted the workers at Ford Motor to have \nenough in wages to be able to buy Ford cars. Very simple. Simple \neconomics.\n  This is an unsustainable course. We cannot continue this course of \ntrade deficit after trade deficit, $50, $60 billion a month, month \nafter month after month.\n\n  There is a lot of discussion about crisis around here. The President \nsays Social Security is in crisis. It is not. Social Security, if \nnothing is done, will be wholly solvent until George W. Bush is 106. \nClearly, it is not a crisis. Do we have to make some adjustments \nbecause people are living longer? Yes, and we will, and we should. But \nit is not a crisis. The trade deficit is a crisis. In a presidential \ncampaign, some time ago, this issue was described as that giant sucking \nsound, that giant sucking sound that sucks American jobs out of this \ncountry.\n  People say, well, more people are working. But what is happening in \nthis country? What is happening is good American jobs are leaving. And, \nno, it is not just the manufacturing jobs. It is now all too often \nengineering jobs, programming jobs, system design jobs, and others as \nwell. What are the American workers replacing the lost jobs with? Jobs \nthat pay less. Jobs with less security. Jobs without health care. Jobs \nwithout retirement capability. That is what is happening in our \ncountry.\n  Again, this town will snore through it. Last Friday, at 8:30 in the \nmorning, we get an announcement that in the previous month we had a \n$57-billion trade deficit. What was the reaction to this town? Just \nroll over and continue laying down and taking another long nap because \nnothing much like this matters. This is not a crisis. This is not \nurgent, they say.\n  This country has an identity crisis. It has to decide what it wants \nfor its future, and who will stand up for it. We fought for 100 years \non these issues. We had people die on the streets of this country for \nthe right to organize as workers. People literally died in the streets \nfor the right to organize. Now a company can shut down their U.S. \noperation, ship the jobs to China, and if those workers, at 30 cents an \nhour, try to organize, they are fired like that. Just that quick.\n  We had people fighting in the streets over child labor laws, over \nsafe workplaces, the right to work in a safe plant, the right to expect \nthat a plant is not going to dump its chemicals into the air and into \nthe water. Nowadays, corporations can instantly decide to pole-vault \nover that. We will just fire the American workers and move the jobs to \nanother country.\n  The other day, I saw a report about the 470 workers laid off at a \nGeneral Electric plant making refrigerators. They were told on April \nFool's Day of this year, April 1, it would be the last day for 470 \nworkers. G.E. was going to discontinue the production of midline, side-\nby-side refrigerator models that supposedly are not competitive or do \nnot have the right product features, but a very similar new line of \nrefrigerators will be started up in the G.E. Plant in Celaya, Mexico. \nAnd that plant will be funded with a loan from the Export Import Bank, \nwhich is to say U.S. taxpayers.\n  This may not matter much to someone around here who wears a white \nshirt and a blue suit to work and who is never going to lose their job \nto cheap foreign labor. I don't know of one journalist or one \npolitician in this country that has ever lost their job to cheap \nforeign labor. It is just the folks on the assembly line, folks that \nwork for a living in the plant, often the folks that have to come back \nin the evening and at suppertime and tell their family, I lost my job \ntoday. It wasn't because I did a bad job. I have worked for that \ncompany for 15, or 20, or 25 years. I love that job. I love it, but I \ncannot compete with 30 cents an hour.\n  This country has to try to figure out what is going on in how it \ndeals with it. This country really needs to understand that this is a \ncrisis and this requires action and an urgent response by this \nPresident and by this Congress.\n  There is so much to say about trade. I am tempted to continue to talk \nabout the 600,000 cars we get from Korea every year. We get the \nopportunity to send 3,000 cars back into the Korean marketplace. \nUnbelievable to me. Just unbelievable. There are 600,000 vehicles \ncoming our way from Korea, and we do not get cars into Korea.\n  I could talk about automobiles in China, talk about beef to Japan, I \ncould talk about potato flakes to Korea. The length of the presentation \ncould be nearly endless.\n\n  But for now let me say last Friday's announcement of one more trade \ndeficit sells just a bit more of this country in a way that Warren \nBuffet, a fellow I greatly admire, says will one day put us in the \nposition of being sharecroppers because we are selling part of America \nwith these dramatic trade deficits. And it is not just selling part of \nour country when you are buying more than you are selling. Not only are \nyour jobs leaving--and in this case they are leaving for much lower \nwages--but in addition to that, you end up, unlike the budget deficit, \nwhich you can argue as an economist we owe to ourselves, you end up \nproviding, in the hands of foreign governments, currency, stock, or \nreal estate claims against our country. That affects foreign policies, \nvirtually everything else we do.\n  I will have more to say about this. But I did not want Friday's \nmoment to pass, despite the rather sleepy attitude here in Washington, \nDC. In the hot, lazy months of summer, I did not want it to pass \nwithout some people understanding that some of us think what is \nhappening is nuts. And some of us believe it is time--long past the \ntime--for Congress and the President to have the backbone, the nerve, \nand the will to stand up for this country's economic interests and say: \nWe represent this country. We represent the United States.\n  The next time there is a trade agreement negotiated, they ought to \nwear a jersey that says ``USA.'' And maybe they could just look down \nbriefly to see who they represent and say: I stand for this country and \nthis country's long-term interests. Without that--and we have not had \nthat for a long while--this country, in my judgment, is consigned to a \nfuture of lower wages and a lower standard of living.\n  You will not, in my judgment, long remain a world economic power \nwithout addressing this issue directly. My hope is sooner, rather than \nlater, my colleagues will join me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hagel are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning business.'')\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           tobacco settlement\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue that appeared \nin the newspapers last week. Last week a client was sold out by his \nlawyer. It happens across America on a regular basis. It is \nunfortunate. It is unethical, unprofessional, and basically wrong, but \nit happens.\n  The reason why this caught my attention, and the attention of many, \nwas that the lawyer in this case was the Attorney General of the United \nStates; the client, the American people. At issue was a lawsuit brought \nagainst the tobacco industry by the Department of Justice. It was a \nlawsuit started under President Clinton and carried on under President \nBush. The case was made that the tobacco industry in America over 50 \nyears deceived and deliberately misinformed the people about the \ndangers of the product they were selling.\n  Last week our lawyers, the Attorney General of the United States and \nthe Department of Justice, the people who are supposed to be working \nendlessly every day to protect the best interests of America, basically \nwalked away from their own case. The Department of Justice chose to \ndismiss credible testimony from its own witnesses, people it had \nbrought into this lawsuit.\n  A few months ago, Michael Fiore, who spent his entire career in \npublic health and the study of tobacco use and cessation, recommended a \ncomprehensive smoking cessation program across America, funded at $5.2 \nbillion a year for at least 25 years. Mr. Fiore's testimony was that we \nwould take the money and profits the tobacco companies had made by \ndeceiving the American people about the danger of tobacco and \ncigarettes and use it so that Americans currently smoking, addicted, or \nwho might be tempted to smoke would have a chance to be spared from the \ndisease and death which follows from that addiction.\n  Last week, the Justice Department's lawyer, a gentleman working for \nAttorney General Gonzales by the name of Stephen Brody, shocked the \ncourt and the American people by announcing that the Justice Department \nwould only seek a fraction of the money which his own witness had said \nshould be recovered by the people. This Assistant Attorney General, \nStephen Brody, walked into a courtroom and said that instead of the \n$130 billion the tobacco companies would owe to the people to help them \navoid tobacco addictions, he would only seek $10 billion.\n  Before I was elected to Congress, I used to be a trial lawyer. I used \nto go through this routine. But it certainly didn't involve billions or \neven millions of dollars. They were much smaller cases. If I was being \nsued and someone had said, Listen, we need $100,000 and that is it, \ncome up with $100,000 or we are going to trial, I would have to make an \nassessment. Is this case one that I am likely to win or lose, if I am \nbeing sued, $110,000, $100,000 on the line? But if a few days before \nthe trial they walked in and said, No, we are wrong. It isn't $100,000, \nit is only $10,000, I would think to myself, They don't have much of a \nlawsuit, on one day to ask for $100,000 and the next to ask for \n$10,000.\n  In this case, our Attorney General, through Mr. Brody, was asking the \ncourt for $130 billion. And then last week, to the surprise of \neverybody, he walked in and said, No, only $10 billion.\n  Does this administration really believe the people of the United \nStates won't notice the Government is willing to leave $120 billion on \nthe table and walk away from it?\n  Well, they did notice. Newspapers across the country have run \neditorials and articles criticizing the Department of Justice for what \nappears to be bad representation of the American people, the fact that \nthe American people were cheated by their lawyer, newspapers are from \nall over the country: Houston, TX; Lowell, MS; Lakeland, OH; \nHarrisburg, PA; Tacoma, WA; Albuquerque; Denver; Racine, WI; Los \nAngeles; New York; and the Washington Post. The country has noticed \nthat a lawyer sold out his client because it is a big sellout.\n  The Albany Times Union wrote:\n\n       So, why the sudden about face? Yes, it's routine for \n     attorneys to suddenly change a client's demand if it appears \n     that the merits of the case are weak, or that a judge or jury \n     appears likely to rule against them. But most legal experts \n     had widely believed the government would win this case \n     because it was based on the same evidence used successfully \n     by state attorneys general to win $246 billion. That evidence \n     . . . showed they knew cigarettes were addictive even as they \n     conducted campaigns to get young people to smoke.\n\n  The Denver Post editorial was headlined, ``What Are the Feds \nSmoking?'' Good question.\n  The Lowell Sun says:\n\n       The dramatic change [in government strategy] was both \n     shocking and outrageous. Allowing political pressure to \n     interfere in any trial--particularly one of such importance--\n     is beyond unacceptable, it's unconscionable.\n\n  Finally, the Houston Chronicle, from the President's own home State \nof Texas, quotes a civil attorney who says he would be ``thrilled'' if \nhe were representing a tobacco company in this case. The lawyer said:\n\n       I've never seen anything like this happen unless there's \n     political pressure.\n\n  It is obvious something happened in this case, and it wasn't about \nlaw. It was clearly about politics.\n  The Chronicle concludes:\n\n       If this illustrates the compassion [Attorney General] \n     Alberto Gonzales promised to bring to the job, then he is \n     feeling sorry for the wrong people.\n\n  I agree. This administration has never demonstrated much enthusiasm \nfor this tobacco case, which it inherited from the Clinton \nadministration.\n  To its credit, though, the Department has avoided public discussion \nof settlement, prosecuted a strong case, brought in the witnesses, \nuntil last week. I have joined several of my colleagues in the House \nand Senate asking the Attorney General to initiate an investigation \nsurrounding this decision last week to basically sell out the American \npeople when it comes to this tobacco lawsuit. I call on the Attorney \nGeneral, through his inspector general or directly, to answer the \nquestion: Why did you walk away from the American people in this \ntobacco lawsuit?\n  This Government has signaled to the tobacco industry that the \nsettlement will be cheap. While the American people deserve more, the \npeople's lawyers appear to be winking at the other side. It is hard to \nimagine a settlement after last week that would be a good deal for the \nAmerican people. I encourage the Department to hold off any settlement \ndiscussions until we replace the DOJ officials who sold us out last \nweek. Those who put pressure on Stephen Brody have to go. If The \nDepartment of Justice can walk into that courtroom and sell out the \nAmerican people, the American people need a new lawyer.\n  The purpose of this lawsuit was to hold accountable the promoters of \ntobacco use for what has become the leading cause of preventable death \nin America. An early settlement in this case will miss that point \nentirely. The Department of Justice set out a detailed case \nestablishing the tobacco industry's role in misleading America. This is \na rare opportunity to hold tobacco companies accountable for the \npreventable deaths tobacco causes and to reach those who are addicted \nto tobacco today.\n  The Department of Justice chose to walk away, leaving $120 billion \nand 43 million American lives behind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of Mr. Thomas \nB. Griffith for confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. I could not be here in my capacity as chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee to open the debate this afternoon because we \nhad a field hearing on juvenile crime in Philadelphia. But I am here \nnow because I want to express my views as to why I believe Mr. Griffith \nis preeminently well qualified to take on the important job of circuit \njudge in the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. Griffith has an extraordinary academic background. He graduated \nfrom Brigham Young University with his bachelor's degree in 1978, with \na summa cum laude rating and high honors. He also was valedictorian of \nhis college. He earned his law degree from the University of Virginia. \nDuring law school, Mr. Griffith was a member of the Editorial and \nArticles Review Board of the Virginia Law Review, which is a very high \nposition at a prestigious law school.\n  Following law school, Mr. Griffith worked at the Charleston, NC, law \nfirm of Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson. He then continued his very \ndistinguished professional career as a partner at Wiley, Rein & \nFielding. In 1995, by unanimous resolution, the Senate, sponsored by \nthe Republican and Democratic leaders, appointed him to the nonpartisan \nposition of Senate legal counsel.\n  During his tenure as Senate legal counsel, Mr. Griffith tackled a \nvery tough issue relating to the impeachment of President Clinton. He \ndid an outstanding job. He also argued, on behalf of the Senate, two \nvery important matters involving committee investigations and the line \nitem veto litigation, which resulted in two landmark decisions by the \nSupreme Court of the United States, At the conclusion of his tenure, \nMr. Griffith was unanimously endorsed by a bipartisan resolution, \ncosponsored by Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, Senator Dodd, and Senator \nMcConnell, expressing the Senate's gratitude for his services as Senate \nlegal counsel.\n  There were especially complimentary remarks made by Senator Dodd, who \nsaid, ``Mark Twain once suggested, `Always do right. This will gratify \nsome people and astonish the rest.' During his tenure as legal counsel, \nTom exemplified this philosophy, impressing all who knew him with his \nknowledge of the law and never succumbing to the temptation to bend the \nlaw to partisan ends. All of us who serve here in the Senate know the \nimportance of the rule of law; but let us never forget that it is \nindividuals like Mr. Thomas Griffith whose calling it is to put that \nideal into practice.''\n  Senator Thurmond also expressed high praise for Mr. Griffith, as did \nSenator Lott.\n  Beyond his work in the profession, Mr. Griffith has found time to \ngive back to the community. He serves as an advisory board member to \nthe ABA Central European and Eurasian Law Initiative. Furthermore, \nwhile in private practice, Mr. Griffith took on a significant pro bono \nrepresentation of a death row inmate, which led to the commutation of \nthe inmate's sentence by the Governor of Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nCongressional Record, statements of support on behalf of Mr. Griffith.\n  There being no objection, the material was to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Support\n\n       Seth Waxman said of Mr. Griffith's nomination, ``I have \n     known Tom since he was Senate Legal Counsel and I was \n     Solicitor General, and I have the highest regard for his \n     integrity. For my own part, I would stake most everything on \n     his word alone. Litigants would be in good hands with a \n     person of Tom Griffith's character as their judge.''\n       Glen Ivey, former counsel to Former Senate Democratic \n     Leader Tom Daschle, wrote to this Committee, stating, ``I \n     believe Mr. Griffith is an exceptional nominee and would make \n     an excellent judge. Although Mr. Griffith and have different \n     party affiliations and do not agree on all political matters, \n     I learned during the Senate's Whitewater and Campaign Finance \n     Reform investigations that Mr. Griffith took seriously his \n     oath of office. Even when we were handling sensitive and \n     politically charged issues, he acted in a non-partisan and \n     objective manner. I believe Mr. Griffith has the intellect \n     and the temperament to make an outstanding jurist.''\n       According to David Kendall, personal counsel to President \n     and Senator Clinton, ``For years Tom has been a leader in the \n     bar and has shown dedication to its principles. The federal \n     bench needs judges like Tom, an excellent lawyer who is \n     supported across the political spectrum. . . . [W]e support \n     Tom and believe he has the intellect and judgment to be an \n     excellent judge.''\n       Harvard Law Professor William Stuntz has known Mr. Griffith \n     for over twenty years. He wrote, ``Few people I know deserve \n     to be called wise; very few deserve to be called both wise \n     and good. Tom is a wise and good man. I believe he will be \n     one of this nation's finest judges.''\n       Abner Mikva, a former White House Counsel for President \n     Clinton and a former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the D.C. Circuit, wrote to Senator Leahy, ``I write as an \n     enthusiastic supporter. . . . I have known Tom Griffith in \n     the public sector and in the private sector, and I have never \n     heard a whisper against his integrity or responsibility. Tom \n     Griffith will be a very good judge. I have always found Tom \n     to be diligent, thoughtful, and of the greatest integrity . . \n     . Tom has a good temperament for the bench, is moderate in \n     his views and worthy of confirmation.''\n       Finally, Senator Dodd of Connecticut noted that Mr. \n     Griffith handled his difficult responsibilities as Senate \n     Legal Counsel with great confidence and skill . . . \n     impressing all who knew him with his knowledge of the law and \n     never succumbing to the temptation to bend the law to \n     partisan ends.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. There has been a challenge against Mr. Griffith, with \nrespect to his Utah bar membership. Because he serves as general \ncounsel to Brigham Young University, there were some questions raised \nas to whether he should have been a member of the Utah bar. I think \nthat issue has been clarified, although some are still contesting it. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a full explanation \nof the Utah bar membership issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Tom Griffith: Utah Bar Membership\n\n\n                                 Facts\n\n       As soon a Mr. Griffith accepted the position of Assistant \n     to the President and General Counsel of Brigham Young \n     University (``BYU''), he sought to determine what Utah's \n     requirements were for in-house counsel by consulting with \n     Utah attorneys.\n       Mr. Griffith always has complied with the advice he \n     received--when his responsibilities require that he provide \n     legal advice to the University, he does so only in close \n     association with active members of the Utah Bar.\n       Mr. Griffith was told that, as in-house counsel, he need \n     not become a member of the Utah Bar provided that when he \n     gives legal advice, he does so in close association with \n     active members of the Utah Bar.\n       Mr. Griffith has always provided legal advice in \n     conjunction with one of four attorneys in his office who are \n     licensed with the Utah Bar, or an outside counsel who is \n     licensed with the Utah Bar. As BYU's General Counsel, he has \n     made no court appearances, nor has he signed any pleadings, \n     motions, or briefs.\n       Mr. Griffith communicated with Utah State Bar officials who \n     were aware that he had not sat for the Utah Bar exam. These \n     officials advised Mr. Griffith to associate himself closely \n     with a Utah Bar member whenever giving legal advice pending \n     his admission to the Utah Bar--which he did. Not once did \n     Utah Bar officials warn Mr. Griffith that his arrangements \n     were contrary to accepted practice--because they weren't. The \n     Utah Bar has affirmed that such arrangements do not \n     constitute practicing law without a license.\n       Numerous former and current Utah Bar officials have written \n     letters affirming that the precautions taken by Mr. Griffith \n     were appropriate and in accordance with the Utah Bar rules.\n       Five former Presidents of the Utah Bar: ``While there is no \n     formal `general counsel' exception to the requirement that \n     Utah lawyers must be members of the Utah bar, it has been our \n     experience that a general counsel working in the state of \n     Utah need not be a member of the Utah Bar provided that when \n     giving legal advice to his or her employer that he or she \n     does so in conjunction with an associated attorney who is an \n     active member of the Utah Bar and that said general counsel \n     makes no Utah court appearances and signs no Utah pleadings, \n     motions, or briefs.''--John Adams, Charles Brown, Scott \n     Daniels, Randy Dryer, Dennis Haslam, Letter to Chairman \n     Hatch, June 28, 2004.\n       John Baldwin, Executive Director of the Utah Bar: ``To \n     those general counsel who cannot avoid circumstances which \n     approach or may cross that line, we have consistently advised \n     that under such circumstances they should directly associate \n     with lawyers who are licensed in the state and on active \n     status. Our policy has also consistently been that of those \n     who follow that advice are not engaged in the unauthorized \n     practice of law.''--Letter to Chairman Hatch, July 2, 2004.\n       Ethics experts have explained that Mr. Griffith has at all \n     times been in compliance with rules of ethical professional \n     conduct.\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\n       ``[T]he requirement of membership in a particular bar is \n     not in itself a rule of ethical professional conduct, but a \n     lawyers' `guild rule' (like minimum fee schedules and \n     restrictions on advertising) designed to restrict \n     competition.--Monroe Freedman, Law Professor at Hofstra \n     University and Thomas Morgan, Law Professor at GW Law School, \n     Letter to the Editor, New York Times, July 4, 2004.\n       ``At best, the requirement of a license is intended to \n     assure that one who holds himself out to the public as a \n     lawyer is indeed competent to serve as a lawyer. In that \n     regard, there is no question about Mr. Griffith's competence, \n     which is the only ethical issue that is material.'' Id.\n       The ABA and the American Law Institute Restatement both \n     support a policy of not requiring in-house counsel to be \n     license in state, as long as the attorney is licensed in at \n     least one state.\n       ALI Restatement: ``States have permitted practice within \n     the jurisdiction by inside legal counsel for a corporation or \n     similar organization, even if the lawyer is not locally \n     admitted and even if the lawyer's work consists entirely of \n     in-state activities, when all of the lawyer's work is for the \n     employer-client and does not involve appearances in court. \n     Leniency is appropriate because the only concern is with the \n     client-employer, who is presumably in a good position to \n     assess the quality and fitness of the lawyer's work.''--ALI \n     Restatement, Section 3, Comment f.\n       ABA Model Rules: ``(d) A lawyer admitted in another United \n     States jurisdiction and not disbarred or suspended from \n     practice in any jurisdiction, may provide legal services in \n     this jurisdiction that (1) are provided to the lawyer's \n     employer or its organizational affiliates and are not \n     services for which the forum requires pro hac vice \n     admission.''--Model Rule 5.5(d)(1).\n       Mr. Griffith's sole employer, BYU, was aware that Mr. \n     Griffith was not a member of the Utah Bar and did not require \n     him to be a member. BYU is the largest private university in \n     the U.S., with campuses and programs throughout the world--\n     much like a multinational corporation.\n       Former Dean of BYU Law and Chair of BYU General Counsel \n     Search Committee, Professor H. Reese Hansen: ``The fact that \n     Mr. Griffith was not a member of the Utah Bar was, of course, \n     well known to all relevant decision makers when he was \n     recommended for and hired as Assistant to the President and \n     General Counsel to BYU.''--Letter to Chairman Hatch, June 29, \n     2004.\n       Dean Hansen: ``A lawyer who is employed as General Counsel \n     to a [multinational corporation] and who provides legal and \n     other services only to his or her employer is obviously not \n     licensed to practice in every jurisdiction where the entity \n     has suppliers, customers, or shareholders or where its \n     advertisements may reach. I view BYU's Assistant to the \n     President and General Counsel in exactly the same situation \n     in regard to his bard membership. . . . I believe that Mr. \n     Griffith has conducted his professional service to his sole \n     client, Brigham Young University, in a completely appropriate \n     manner in all regards and consistent with common practices of \n     general counsel to large U.S. entities who conduct multi-\n     state and international activities.'' Id.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Similarly, there had been an issue regarding Mr. \nGriffith's lapsed membership in the District of Columbia bar, which \noccurred because of an administrative oversight.\n  Excuse me; nothing is as troublesome as a pesky summer cold. Without \nthis cold, my speech would be considerably longer, Mr. President, so \nthere are some advantages, at least, for anyone who may be watching on \nC-SPAN--if anyone watches C-SPAN during these late afternoon \nproceedings of the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that a full \nexplanation of the DC Bar membership issue also be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Tom Griffith: D.C. Bar Membership\n\n\n                                 Facts\n\n       In 2001, Mr. Griffith discovered that his D.C. Bar \n     membership had been suspended for failing to pay his annual \n     dues. As soon as he became aware of the problem, he paid the \n     dues and was reinstated as a bar member in good standing.\n       Mr. Griffith accepts full responsibility for the oversight, \n     and he brought the lapse in his membership to the attention \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee in his questionnaire.\n       Having worked as an attorney at a large D.C. law firm from \n     1991-1995, Mr. Griffith became accustomed to the firm's \n     practice of paying its attorney's bar dues.\n       When Mr. Griffith became Senate Legal Counsel, he was late \n     in paying his 1997 D.C. Bar dues, and as a result, was \n     suspended from the D.C. Bar for approximately five weeks. As \n     soon as Mr. Griffith became aware of the problem in January \n     1998, he paid the dues and was reinstated as a member in good \n     standing.\n       In 1998, while still serving as Senate Legal Counsel, Mr. \n     Griffith unintentionally failed to pay his 1998 D.C. Bar dues \n     and was suspended as a result. He was unaware of his \n     suspension at the time.\n       When Mr. Griffith returned to his former law firm in March \n     1999, he wrongly assumed, based on his prior experience at \n     the firm, that the firm was paying dues on his behalf. He \n     continued to have no knowledge of suspension.\n       Mr. Griffith paid his back dues as soon as he discovered \n     the problem in 2001. He was promptly reinstated as a member \n     in good standing of the D.C. Bar. Since then, he has paid his \n     D.C. Bar dues in a timely manner and remains a D.C. Bar \n     member in good standing.\n       Mr. Griffith's situation is not at all unusual. D.C. Bar \n     counsel quotes that every year over 3,000 D.C. lawyers (and a \n     number of sitting judges) are ``administratively suspended'' \n     for late payment of dues.\n       An inadvertent failure to pay bar dues does not reflect \n     poorly on Mr. Griffith's character or ability to serve as a \n     judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Abner Mikva, former Chief Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the D.C. Circuit: ``I cannot believe the [the Washington \n     Post] or anyone else thinks that the inadvertent failure to \n     pay bar dues because no bill was sent is a mark of a lawyer's \n     character. I have known Tom Griffith in the public sector and \n     in the private sector, and I have never heard a whisper \n     against his integrity or responsibility.''--Letter to the \n     Editor, Washington Post, June 8, 2004.\n       David Kendall, private attorney to former President \n     Clinton, and Lanny Breuer, former Associate Counsel to \n     President Clinton: ``Contrary to the Post's implication, Tom \n     is an outstanding attorney who takes his responsibilities as \n     a member of the bar seriously. . . . As soon as he realized \n     that bills were unpaid, he paid them. Tom took the common and \n     proper course of action under the circumstances. This \n     innocent oversight has no bearing on his ability to serve as \n     a judge.''--Letter to the Editor, Washington Post, June 11, \n     2004.\n       Former ABA Presidents Bill Ide and Sandy D'Alemberte, along \n     with 11 other attorneys: ``By immediately paying his dues \n     when he became aware of the oversight, Tom took the proper \n     course of action. According to D.C. Bar counsel, such an \n     oversight is entirely common and of no major concern, \n     particularly where no reminder notice is sent out. In fact, \n     Tom was promptly reinstalled after he paid his accrued dues, \n     without any questions raised about possible sanctions.''--\n     Letter to Chairman Hatch, June 14, 2004.\n       Ethics Expert, Professor Monroe H. Freedman, Hofstra \n     University Law School: ``In the District of Columbia, Mr. \n     Griffith had in fact been a member of the bar in good \n     standing; the only problem was a temporary lapse in the \n     payment of dues, which he promptly remedied when he became \n     aware of it. He thereby once again became, and remains, a \n     member of the D.C. Bar in good standing. Neither the bar nor \n     anyone else has ever questioned Mr. Griffith's competence to \n     practice law.''--Letter to Chairman Hatch, June 29, 2004.\n       Mr. Griffith was ``administratively suspended'' from the \n     D.C. Bar for failure to pay his bar dues. No disciplinary \n     action was ever taken against him.\n       * Former ABA Presidents Bill Ide and Sandy D'Alemberte, \n     along with 11 other attorneys: ``The Post improperly equated \n     Tom's situation to `disciplinary suspension,' a rare sanction \n     imposed only when a lawyer knowingly refuses to pay bar dues. \n     It was nothing of the kind. When advised of the problem, Tom \n     promptly paid his dues in full.''--Letter to Chairman Hatch, \n     June 14, 2004.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We had a second hearing for Mr. Griffith this year, \nafter I became chairman, because his original hearing was not well \nattended. It was held at the end of the last session. At the hearing \nthis year, I think we explored in considerable detail the issue of his \nD.C. bar membership.\n  It is always a difficult matter when a lawyer is a member of one bar \nand seeks to become a member of another. I know I went through a \nsimilar issue when I took the New Jersey bar, 23 years after I attended \nlaw school. It is an experience, but I went through it. However, I \nthink this by no means disqualifies Mr. Griffith, and I think the issue \nhas been adequately explained on the record.\n  Tom Griffith is well known in the Senate, perhaps better known than \nvirtually any other judicial nominee who comes here, because he had \nbeen legal counsel to the Senate. I think many people who know Mr. \nGriffith on a personal, intimate basis know of his high ethical \nstandards, his scholarship, and his legal ability. He is soft spoken. \nHe is mature. He is knowledgeable. I think he will make a fine circuit \njudge.\n  Mr. Griffith comes with an especially strong recommendation from the \nformer chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, who has \nknown Mr. Griffith personally for many years, and speaks very highly of \nhim.\n  Regrettably, I cannot be here tomorrow to speak again, as is the \npractice for the chairman to speak immediately before leadership, \nbecause I will be\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\ntraveling in Pennsylvania with President Bush. Tom Griffith is an \noutstanding candidate, and I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm him.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, in \nfact, in the absence of any other Senator on the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand the debate is on the \nqualifications of Thomas Griffith.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I wish to make a few comments with respect to Mr. \nGriffith. I ask all Members of the Senate to think back on what for \nmany of us will be the most dramatic experience we had as Members of \nthis body. It was an unprecedented situation, certainly in this, the \nlast century. You had to go all the way back to Abraham Lincoln's time \nto find anything similar to it, when we met in this body with the Chief \nJustice of the United States, William Rehnquist, sitting in the chair, \nand held an impeachment trial of the President of the United States.\n  I doubt very much that will ever happen again. It was a very \ndifferent kind of trial than the one that occurred with Andrew Johnson \nthe first time this happened. That was purely political with Andrew \nJohnson, and everybody recognized that. I remember a Member of this \nbody saying that we had actually had three impeachment situations in \nour history: The first, Andrew Johnson; the second that never got to \nthe Senate, which was Richard Nixon; and the third, President Clinton. \nThe Senator said Andrew Johnson, clearly not guilty, clearly a \npolitical vendetta; Richard Nixon, clearly guilty, clearly should have \nbeen removed--he stopped that by resigning; and then he said the \nClinton one was in between. It was a close case that could have gone \none way or the other.\n  Some of my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle said it is not \na question of whether he did it. It is not a question of whether it was \na high crime and a misdemeanor. The only question was whether it was a \nserious enough high crime and misdemeanor on the part of the President \nof the United States to justify removing him from office. I think that \nwas a thoughtful summary of where things were.\n  Why am I saying all of this with respect to Thomas Griffith? Because \nduring the period that the Senate went through that very difficult and \nhistoric debate, the counsel to the Senate of the United States was \nThomas Griffith. In that position, he served both sides. He was not \ncounsel to the majority, he was not counsel to the minority, he was the \nSenate's counsel.\n  I remember very well the conversations that took place here, both \nformally and informally.\n  I remember the time when we were in a quorum call where the then \nminority leader, Tom Daschle, and the then majority leader, Trent Lott, \nmet in the well of the Senate, other Senators pressed forward, and \npretty soon we had about 30 Senators gathered around talking: What can \nwe do, how can we resolve this, where can we go?\n  The decision was made, as a result of that, the Senate would go into \nthe old Senate Chamber in executive session, where there were no \ntelevision cameras, there were no reporters, there was no staff, other \nthan the absolutely essential one or two. We talked about how we could \nget through this difficult time.\n  One of the speeches given in that chamber made this comment about the \nimpeachment proceedings with respect to President Clinton. He said: \nThis case is toxic. It has sullied the Presidency. It has stained the \nHouse of Representatives. It is about to do the same thing to us.\n  Unfortunately, the Senator made that prediction, with which I agree, \nbut had no solution. He was just short of explaining how difficult that \nwas going to be out of a sense almost of resignation that this \nparticular case was going to end up besmirching the Senate as badly as \nit had stained the Presidency and the House of Representatives.\n  When it was all over, some 30 days later, that particular prediction \nhad not come true. The Senate had not been stained. Indeed, it was one \nof the Senate's finest hours. We had come together in a civil way, with \na deliberate understanding of our responsibility. We had acted \nresponsibly. Every Member of the Senate had voted his or her own \nconscience, and we had disposed of the case in a manner that reflected \nwell upon the Senate.\n  In that situation, the legal mind that was counselling both Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lott was Tom Griffith, the Senate's counsel who \nwould sit down with the Republicans and describe to Senators the \nprecedent, outline what the consequences would be if we did this, that, \nor the other. He would then sit down with the Democrats and do exactly \nthe same thing from a standpoint of evenhandedness, fairness, great \nrespect for the law, and through documentation and examination, \nthorough scholarship and research.\n  The Senate counsel who did all of those things and helped the Senate \nthrough, arguably, one of its most difficult times in the last 100 \nyears, is the man now before the Senate to be a circuit judge.\n  I am very surprised people have such short memories. People who were \ncomplaining about Tom Griffith not being qualified for the circuit \ncourt bench, where were they when he was qualified and performing \nmagnificently on their behalf as the counsel of this body? Have they no \nmemory of the professionalism, the deep research, the evenhanded \nfairness that Tom Griffith showed on that occasion? Don't they remember \nhow he served, regardless of party, the law, the precedent, and the \ninstitution?\n  We can talk about opinions. We can talk about papers written. We can \ntalk about positions taken. All of these are important in deciding what \nwe should do with respect to a circuit court judge. But I cannot think \nof any place where we could duplicate the crucible in which a potential \njudge's capabilities are tried that would approach the crucible through \nwhich Tom Griffith has come.\n  I intend to support him. I urge my colleagues to support him. He will \nmake an outstanding circuit court judge.\n  I, ultimately, come to a very personal kind of test. If I were on \ntrial for some very complicated situation, some very Byzantine kind of \ncharge that required a great legal mind to cut through to the real \nissues, would I want that case to be tried before Tom Griffith sitting \non the bench? My answer, as I have thought about it, is clearly, yes. \nIf I were on trial, and I needed a judge who had the capacity to cut \nthrough all the extraneous matter and get to the heart and render an \naccurate decision, I would want Tom Griffith to be the judge in that \nkind of case.\n  I hope I am never on trial in a case that goes before the circuit \ncourt. But there are those who will be. There are those who will have \nthat challenge and have that experience. The best thing I can do for \nthem is to vote to put Tom Griffith on the court so he will be there to \nrender that kind of service and that kind of expertise on their behalf.\n  I hope he is confirmed. I will vote for his confirmation. I urge all \nof my colleagues to do the same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in 45 minutes or so, we will be turning to \nan important issue which people have spoken to over the course of the \nday, an issue we will be spending the evening on. It is an issue that \nis one of the worst failings of this institution in our history, a \nfailing surrounding a refusal to act on our part against lynching, \nagainst vigilantism, against mob murder. It has been a shame in many \nways. We have to be careful when we use that word, but when we look at \nthe reality of missed opportunities to act, we can, with justification, \nuse the word ``shame'' on the institution and a shame on Senators who \ndidn't just fail to act but deliberately kept the Senate and the whole \nof the Federal Government from acting and from acting proactively.\n  Although deep scars will always remain, I am hopeful we will begin to \nheal and help close the wounds caused by lynching. Four out of five \nlynch mob victims were African American. The practice followed slavery \nas an ugly expression of racism and prejudice. In the history of \nlynching, mobs murdered more than 4,700 people. Nearly 250 of those \nvictims were from my State of Tennessee. Very few had committed any \nsort of crime whatsoever. Lynching was a way to humiliate, to repress, \nto dehumanize.\n  The Senate disgracefully bears some of the responsibility. Between \n1890 and 1952, seven Presidents petitioned Congress to ban lynching. In \nthose same 62 years, the House of Representatives passed three \nantilynching bills. Each bill died in the Senate, and the Senate made a \nterrible mistake.\n  The tyranny of lynch mobs created an environment of fear throughout \nthe American South. Lynching took innocent lives. It divided society, \nand it thwarted the aspirations of African Americans. Lynching was \nnothing less than a form of racial terrorism.\n  It took the vision and courage of men and women such as Mary White \nOvington, W.E.B. DuBois, George H. White, Jane Adams and, of course, \nfellow Tennessean Ida Wells-Barnett to pass Federal laws against \nlynching and put an end to the despicable practice.\n  Ida Wells-Barnett, indeed, may have done more than any other person \nto expose the terrible evils of lynching. A school teacher from Memphis \nwho put herself through college, she became one of the Nation's first \nfemale newspaper editors. A civil rights crusader from her teens, Ida \nWells committed herself to the fight against lynching after a mob \nmurdered her friends--Thomas Moss, Calvin McDowell, and Henry Stewart.\n  These three men, driven by their entrepreneurial energy, opened a \nsmall grocery store that catered primarily to African Americans. They \ntook business away from nearby White business owners. Driven by hatred \nand jealousy, by rage and prejudice, an angry White mob stormed their \nstore. Acting in self-defense, Wells' three friends fired on the \nrioters. The police arrested the grocers for defending themselves. The \nmob kidnapped all three from jail, and all three were murdered in the \nMemphis streets.\n  These brutal murders galvanized Wells into action. Her righteous \nanger, blistering editorials, and strong sense of justice further \nenraged Memphis bigots. They burned her newspaper presses and \nthreatened to murder her. Wells moved to Chicago and became one of that \ncity's leading social crusaders. Wells' book ``Southern Horrors: Lynch \nLaw in All Its Phases'' and her dogged investigative reporting exposed \nmillions of Americans to the brutality of lynching. In a nation rife \nwith racism and prejudice, Ida Wells and her colleagues began the civil \nrights movement. They helped bring us integration. They paved the way \nfor equality. And they taught all of us that racism is a terrible evil.\n  After many years of struggle, after many setbacks, and after much \nheartache, they won. From President Truman's Executive order ending \nsegregation in the Armed Forces to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a series \nof civil rights laws moved the Nation toward legal equality.\n  But no civil rights law is as important to our Nation's political \nprocess as the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n  It enfranchised millions of African-American voters and it brought \nmany black politicians into office.\n  Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act will be up for reauthorization in \n2007. President Reagan signed into law a 25-year reauthorization in \n1982.\n  Section 4 contains a temporary preclearance provision that applies to \nAlabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, \nVirginia, and parts of Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, and North \nCarolina.\n  These States must submit any voting changes to the U.S. Department of \nJustice for preclearance. If the Department of Justice concludes that \nthe change weakens the voting strength of minority voters, it can \nrefuse to approve the change.\n  While I recognize that this can impose a bureaucratic burden on \nStates acting in good faith, we must continue our Nation's work to \nprotect voting rights. That is why we need to extend the Voting Rights \nAct.\n  Quite simply, we owe civil rights pioneers such as Ida Wells nothing \nless.\n  I hope the day will come when racism and prejudice are relegated \ncompletely to our past. This resolution is a positive step in the right \ndirection.\n  Transforming our Nation requires that we recall our history--all of \nit. We can become a better people by celebrating the glories of our \npast--but also our imperfections. That includes continuing to do our \nutmost to protect voting rights for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tonight this body will take an important \nand extraordinary step. The Senate will, belatedly but most sincerely, \nissue a formal apology to the victims of lynching and their families, \nsome of whom are with us tonight in this Chamber, for its failure to \npass antilynching legislation.\n  Without question, there have been other grave injustices committed in \nthe noble exercise of establishing this great democracy. Some have \nalready been acknowledged and addressed by this and previous \nCongresses, and our work continues. However, there may be no other \ninjustice in American history for which the Senate so uniquely bears \nresponsibility. In refusing to take up legislation passed by the House \nof Representatives on three separate occasions and requested by seven \nPresidents from William Henry Harrison to Harry Truman, the Senate \nengaged in a different kind of culpability.\n  Beginning in 1881, this tragic phenomenon of domestic terrorism was \ndocumented in large measure through the groundbreaking and heroic \nefforts of Ida B. Wells-Barnett and the independent newspapers and \npublications. From that year until 1964, 4,742 American citizens were \nlynched. These are the recorded numbers. Historians estimate the true \nnumber to be much higher.\n  An apology alone can never suffice to heal the harm that was done, \nand for many victims justice is out of reach. Yet I believe, and this \nresolution lays forth the principle, that a sincere and heartfelt \napology is a necessary first step toward real healing.\n  It is important that the people of our country understand the true \nnature of this unprecedented rampage of terror. Many Americans have \nimages from popular books and movies, like ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' \nthat cloud their understanding of lynching. A group of angry White men \ntake an accused and presumed guilty Black man deep into the woods and \nhang him. Those are the images, although accurate and tragic, but they \ndelude us from the true nature of lynching in this dark period of \nAmerican history.\n  The thought of a small, angry mob murdering Black prisoners in the \ndead of night ignores the reality of lynching in most respects. We are \nfortunate and grateful that a passionate and resolute independent \nscholar named James Allen saw something catalytic in the photographic \nevidence of lynching, and he began to collect these gruesome and \nhorrific photographs. His work, ``Without Sanctuary,'' showed the real \nfaces of lynching, and the images he unveiled began to change the way \npeople viewed these tragic events and called to several of us in the \nSenate to issue this apology tonight. It is because of his work, this \nbook, that the Committee for a Formal Apology and the families of the \nlynching victims--and some victims themselves who are here--are here \ntoday and that this important historic resolution is before the Senate.\n  I would like to show some of these photographs now. This is one of \nthe hundreds--thousands of photographs of men, women, and children who \nwere lynched in this Nation, lynching that occurred--a citizen of our \nNation, lynched. As your eyes look at this picture, they are \nimmediately drawn to the victim. These hangings were sometimes--in most \ninstances--very brutal events. Sometimes the hanging itself came after \nhours of torture and just excruciating fear and humiliation.\n  After this book was published and these pictures came into more full \nview of the American public, what happens is your eyes leave the figure \nof the victim and move to the audience. This is part of the story that, \nin my mind, has not been completely told, and it needs to be told \ntonight and every day into the future.\n  As you can see, there are children gathered here. These are children \nlooking up at this man hanging from a tree. History will record that \nsome of these children were let out of Sunday schools to attend the \nlynchings. History will record that some businesses closed down so that \nthe whole town could attend these lynchings. History will record that \nthese lynchings did not occur mostly at night or in the back woods or \nacross the levees--lynchings were a community event. In many instances, \nit was a form of public entertainment. It was mass violence, an open \nact of terrorism directed primarily against African Americans and \nothers who sympathized with their cause.\n  If we are truly to understand the magnitude of this tragedy, we must \nstudy the stories behind this grim parade of death.\n  In March of 1892, three personal friends of Ida B. Wells opened the \n``People's Grocery Company,'' a store located across the street from a \nWhite-owned grocery store that had previously been the only grocer in \nthe area. Angered by the loss of business, a mob gathered to run the \nnew grocers out of town. Forewarned about the attack on their store, \nthe three owners armed themselves for protection, and in the riot that \nensued, one of the businessmen injured a White man. All three were \narrested and jailed. Days later, the mob kidnapped the men from jail \nand lynched them. This was the case that led Ida B. Wells to begin to \nspeak out against this injustice.\n  Her great grandson is with us today. He has told this story through \nthe halls of Congress to give testimony to her life and to her courage \nand to her historic efforts. Without the work of this extraordinarily \nbrave journalist, this story never really could have been told in the \nway it is being told now, today, and talked about here on the Senate \nfloor. To her, we owe a great deal of gratitude. She knew these men \npersonally. She knew they were businessmen. They were not criminals. \nShe knew they were successful salespeople, not common thugs. And she \nwrote and she spoke and she tried to gather pictures to tell a story to \na nation that simply refused to believe.\n  Forty-two years and thousands of lynchings later is the case of \nClaude Neal of Marianna, FL. After 10 hours of torture, Claude Neal \n``confessed'' to the murder of a girl with whom he was allegedly having \nan affair. For his safety, he was transferred to an Alabama prison. A \nmob took him from there. They cut off his body parts. They sliced his \nside and stomach. People would randomly cut off a finger here, a toe \nthere. From time to time, they would tie a noose around him, throw the \nrope over a tree limb. The mob would keep him there in that position \nuntil he almost died then lower him again to begin the torment all \nover.\n\n  After several hours, and I guess the crowd exhausted themselves, they \njust decided to kill him. His body was then dragged by car back to \nMarianna, and 7,000 people from 11 States were there to see his body in \nthe courthouse of the town square. Pictures were taken and sold for 50 \ncents a piece.\n  One might ask, how do we know all the grizzly details of Claude \nNeal's death? It is very simple. The newspapers in Florida had given \nadvance notice. They recorded it one horrible moment after another. One \nof the members of the lynch mob proudly relayed all the details that \nreporters had missed in person. Yet, even with the public notice, 7,000 \npeople in attendance, and people bragging about the activity, Federal \nauthorities were impotent to stop this murder. State authorities seemed \nto condone it, and the Senate of the United States refused to act.\n  Time went on. In 1955, just 9 years before Congress passed the Civil \nRights Act, the world witnessed the brutal lynching of Emmett Till. \nFourteen\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\nyears old, Emmett Till was excited about his trip from his home on \nChicago's southside to the Mississippi Delta. Like many children during \nthe summer, he was looking forward to visiting his relatives. Prior to \nhis departure, his mother, Maimie Till Bradley, a teacher, had done her \nvery best to advise him about how to behave while in Mississippi. With \nhis mother's warning and wearing the ring that had belonged to his \ndeceased father, on August 20, 1955, Till set off with his cousin, \nCurtis Jones, on a train to Mississippi.\n  Once there, he and some friends went to buy some candy at the general \nstore. According to his accusers, this young 14-year-old whistled at a \nstore clerk as he left. She happened to be a white woman.\n  Armed with pistols, the mob took Emmett from his uncle's home. His \nuncle is with us tonight. They took him in the middle of the night. \nThree days later his little body was discovered in the Tallahatchie \nRiver, weighed down by a 75-pound cotton gin fan tied around his neck \nwith barbed wire. His face was so mutilated when Wright identified the \nbody he could only do so based on the ring that he had been wearing.\n  Coincidentally, through no asking of our own, but I guess it is \nappropriate, the trial of his accused murderer, Edgar Ray Killen, \nbegins today in Mississippi.\n  While the details that led to the lynching are not always clear from \njust these few that I have described, there is little doubt what took \nplace at the lynchings themselves. In most instances, prelynching \nnewspaper notices, school closings to allow children to view the \nspectacle, special order trains to carry people to the event, are all \npart of a gruesome but true part of America's history.\n  Jazz legend Billy Holiday provided real texture in her story and song \n``Strange Fruit.'' She defied her own record label and produced and \npublished the song on her own, was threatened with her life because she \ncontinued to sing it. But like so many things, words can't always \ndescribe what is happening, even though speeches were given, words were \nwritten, newspapers were published.\n  The words to the song are as follows:\n\n     Southern trees bear a strange fruit\n     Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,\n     Black body swinging in the Southern breeze,\n     Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.\n\n     Pastoral scene of the gallant South,\n     The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,\n     Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh,\n     And the sudden smell of burning flesh.\n\n     Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck,\n     For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,\n     For the sun to rot, for a tree to drop,\n     Here is a strange and a bitter crop.\n\n  Something in the way she sang this song, something in the pictures \nthat described the event, must have touched the heart of Americans \nbecause they began to mobilize, and men and women, White and Black, \npeople from different backgrounds, came to stand up and begin to speak. \nThey spoke with loud voices and with moving speeches and with great \nmarches.\n  But the Senate of the United States, one of the most noble \nexperiments in democracy, continued to pretend, to act like this was \nnot happening in America and continued to fail to act.\n  It would be a mistake to look at this ugly chapter in our democracy's \ndevelopment with pity and hopelessness, however. The truth is, today's \napology should be seen as a tribute to the endurance and the triumph of \nAfrican-American families.\n  There is a particular family here, the Crawford family. I think there \nare over 150 of them. Earlier today I talked with some of the leaders \nof the family. I said: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. They \nnodded because that is exactly what happened to this family. The town \ntried to kill this family, to run them out, and, in fact, ran them out \nof the town, but this family just grew stronger, and with their love \nand lack of bitterness, but with a determination to find justice some \nway, they are here today. In fact, it was the progress of African \nAmericans that spurred this terrible reaction to them in the first \nplace.\n  As I stated earlier, the early lynchings were not of criminals. The \nearly lynchings were of successful farmers, of successful businessmen, \nleaders in their communities because these lynchings were an act of \nterrorism to make American citizens feel they had no voice and no \nplace.\n  W.E.B. Dubois summarized the motivation behind these slayings \nperfectly when he said:\n\n        . . . [T]he South feared more than Negro dishonesty, \n     ignorance and incompetency, Negro honesty, knowledge, and \n     efficiency.\n\n  With slavery abolished by the Civil War, a group of Americans had to \nmentally justify as inferior and subhuman those who suddenly were \nequals and competitors. Having lost the war throughout the South, \nwatching the progress of former slaves was simply too much in that \nregion and in other regions throughout the country, as well.\n  As a senior Senator from the State of Louisiana, I feel compelled to \nspend just a few moments, before I acknowledge my friend and cosponsor \nin the Senate, Senator George Allen, who has brought this resolution to \nthe attention of our Senate colleagues.\n  Louisiana has a distinct history from much of the United States due \nto its long colonial ties with both France and Spain. One consequence \nof this history is that Louisiana had more free people of color than \nany other Southern State. Nearly 20,000 Louisianians who were largely \nconcentrated in New Orleans formed a large and very prosperous African-\nAmerican community in the 1860s. They enjoyed more rights than most \nfree men of color. A large percentage spoke only French and educated \ntheir children in Europe. The community, the records show, owned more \nthan $2 million worth of property, which was quite a large sum in those \ndays, and dominated skilled labor areas such as masonry, carpentry, \ncigar making, and shoemaking.\n  That is why Louisiana's prominent role in lynchings is so bitter. It \nmars a long history of tolerance and integration that to this day \ndistinguishes Louisiana from other places in the South.\n  Still the difficult fact remains that only three States have had a \nhigher incidence than Louisiana of these occurrences. The NAACP, which \nwas founded over the issue of lynchings, recorded 391 such murders in \nmy State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of all the Louisiana victims \ncompiled by Professor Michael Pfeifer, author of ``Rough Justice, \nLynching and American Society,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       List of Louisiana Victims\n\n       April 24, 1878, Unidentified Man, Unidentified Sugar \n     Parish, Arson, Unknown, Unknown.\n       July 30, 1878, Jim Beaty, Monroe, Ouachita Parish, Unknown, \n     Black, Private.\n       July 30, 1878, Ples Phillips, Monroe, Ouachita Parish, \n     Unknown, Black, Private.\n       July 30, 1878, Tom Ross, Monroe, Ouachita Parish, Unknown, \n     Black, Private.\n       July 30, 1878, Henry Atkinson, Monroe, Ouachita Parish, \n     Unknown, Black, Private.\n       September 14, 1878, Valcour St. Martin, Hahnville, St. \n     Charles Parish, Murder, Unknown, Unknown.\n       October, 1878, Joshua Hall, Ouachita Parish, Unknown, \n     Black, Mass.\n       October, 1878, Sam Wallace, Ouachita Parish, Unknown, \n     Black, Mass.\n       November 5, 1878, Unidentified Man, Ouachita Parish, \n     Unknown, Black, Unknown.\n       November 5, 1878, Unidentified Man, Ouachita Parish, \n     Unknown, Black, Unknown.\n       November 5, 1878, Unidentified Man, Ouachita Parish, \n     Unknown, Black, Unknown.\n       November 5, 1878, Unidentified Man, Ouachita Parish, \n     Unknown, Black, Unknown.\n       November 5, 1878, Unidentified Man, Ouachita Parish, \n     Unknown, Black, Unknown.\n       December 3, 1878, Moustand, Franklin, St. Mary Parish, \n     Attempted Rape, Black, Private.\n       December 15, 1878, Victor Bryan, New Roads, Pointe Coupee \n     Parish, Murder, Black, Private.\n       September 1, 1879, George Williams, Ouachita Parish, \n     Threats Against White, Black, Private.\n       August 20, 1879, Ed.

It is also true that members of the Senate delegation \nfrom Louisiana participated in the actions that led us to not act.\n  However, I am very proud to stand here with my colleague from \nVirginia and to note that the other Senator from Louisiana, a \nRepublican, stands with me. We are united in our support of this \nresolution to offer the sincere apology to try to bring to light the \nfacts about lynching, to encourage people to seek the truth.\n  I said earlier today people are entitled to their own opinions. But \nthey are not entitled to their own facts. And the facts about this \nterrible domestic terrorism and rash of terrorism stand today and will \nnot be pushed aside. It is with humility but with pride that I support \nand put forth before the Senate today, with the Senator from Virginia, \nthis resolution.\n  The junior Senator from Louisiana is an original cosponsor of this \nresolution, as are a number of sons of the South. Furthermore, in \nLouisiana's legislature in Baton Rouge, a very similar resolution \npassed today. Thus, the people of Louisiana can truly say we are trying \nto open a dialogue, and bring closure to a bitter history.\n  This is a particularly important step for the South. For while \nlynchings occurred in 46 of the 50 States, and people of all races were \naffected, it would be a mischaracterization to suggest that this was \nnot a weapon of terror most often employed in the South, and most often \nagainst African Americans. That is why I am so glad to be joined in \nthis endeavor by the junior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen. He has \nbeen instrumental in getting us to this point of consideration, and I \ntruly appreciate his hard work and dedication to our joint effort.\n  It is also important to acknowledge the bravery of those who took \npersonal risks long before this day in opposition to lynching. First \nand foremost, we must acknowledge the pioneering journalism of Ida B. \nWells. Though personally threatened with death, Ms. Wells continued to \ndocument these outrages before justice, so that future generations \nmight know the history of this era. It should be noted that it was her \nexample that led other women, such as Jane Adams, to join in her fight \nagainst lynching. In fact, women, generally, are viewed as having \nplayed a major role in the antilynching campaign.\n  There was tremendous political courage shown in Georgia. Georgia was \nthe first State to adopt antilynching legislation in 1893. Yet, the \nState continued to experience a disproportionate share of lynching \nattacks. However, starting with Governor Northen in 1890, several of \nGeorgia's Governors fought lynch violence in their State resolutely. In \nmany cases it came at personal cost. Gov. William Atkinson, having left \nthe Governor's mansion, personally challenged a lynch mob of 2,000 \npeople in his home town. It is a record of political leadership upon \nwhich Georgia can now proudly reflect.\n  Another great voice in the antilynching crusade was Congressman \nGeorge White of Tarboro, NC. He was the last former slave to serve in \nCongress--ending his congressional career in 1901. He introduced an \nanti-lynching bill to stem the rising tide of violence, with 107 \nattacks having occurred in 1899. While his bill was defeated in the \nHouse of Representatives, he initiated one of its first political \nconsiderations.\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\n  Finally, we cannot ignore the Senate's own passionate voices to end \nthe practice of lynching. Senator Champ Clark of Missouri famously \nposted photos of a recent Mississippi lynching in the Democratic \ncloakroom with the caption: There have been no arrests, no indictments, \nand no convictions of any one of the lynchers. This is not a rape case. \nRegrettably, those photos and his convictions could not bring these \nterrible events to a close. We also salute the efforts of Senators \nRobert Wagner of New York and Edward Costigan of Colorado. The Wagner-\nCostigan bill was yet another noble effort to inject Federal resources \ninto combating lynching. While it was again filibustered, it was \nanother noble effort that demonstrated that people of good will \nremained the majority.\n  Because of the courage of these and other individuals, by the 1930s \npublic opinion had turned against lynching. In 1938, a national survey \nshowed that 70 percent of Americans supported the enactment of an \nantilynching statute. Even in the South, at least 65 percent of these \nsurveyed favored its passage. In short, even if southern Senators had \nthe political latitude to endorse Federal antilynching legislation, \nmost seemed to be too mired in personal prejudice to accept that fact. \nWhere these southern Senators were concerned, justice was mostly deaf, \nbut never color blind.\n  In closing, I would like to acknowledge several members of my staff: \nJason Matthews, Kathleen Strottman, Nash Molphus, Sally Richardson, and \nmany others, who have helped, along with others, put this resolution \nbefore the Senate today.\n  I want to end with one of the most moving comments that I read in the \nbook ``Without Sanctuary,'' as I have read excerpts from publications \nand magazines and newspapers about this situation, and have been \nreading them now for months on this issue. It is taken from McClure's \nMagazine, in 1905, by Ray Stannard Baker, who wrote about one of the \nlynchings--I think it was of a Mr. Curtis. I will submit that for the \nRecord. He says:\n\n       So the mob came finally, and cracked the door of the jail \n     with a railroad rail. The jail is said to be the strongest in \n     Ohio, and having seen it, I can well believe the report is \n     true. But steel bars have never yet kept out a mob; it takes \n     something much stronger: human courage backed up by the \n     consciousness of being right.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate was wrong not to act. It was wrong to not \nstand in the way of the mob. We lacked courage then. We perhaps do not \nhave all the courage we need today to do everything we should do, but I \nknow we can apologize today. We can be sincere in our apology to the \nfamilies, to their loved ones, and perhaps now we can set some of these \nvictims and their families free and, most of all, set our country free \nto be better than it is today. However great it is, we can most \ncertainly improve.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague, Senator Allen, from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nresolution of apology that Senator Landrieu of Louisiana and I have \nsubmitted. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her leadership on \nthis matter. It has been a pleasure to work with her on this and other \nmatters, but this is undoubtedly the most historic.\n  I got involved in this because I received a letter from Dick Gregory. \nI know Members of the Senate received thousands of letters and e-mails \nand phone calls. He asked me to join with Senator Landrieu last year on \nthis. He was signing this letter on behalf of Dr. E. Faye Williams, \nMartin Luther King III, Dr. C. DeLores Tucker, and others. But he asked \nme. He said:\n\n       I respectfully ask you to serve as an original cosponsor of \n     the Landrieu resolution. . . . We realize life will go on and \n     your world will not be affected if you choose to do nothing.\n\n  That struck me as: Well, I am going to choose to do something. He \nasked me to sponsor this on the Republican side ``because it is the \nright thing to do.''\n  That says it all, really, when we see an affront to the basic \nprinciples that were enunciated in the spirit of this country in the \nDeclaration of Independence. When we seceded from Britain, we talked \nabout freedom, liberty, and justice, trying to constitute that here in \nthis country, fighting for so many years to free ourselves from the \nmonarch to construct a free and just society, with freedom of religion, \nfreedom of expression, due process of law, equal protection, as well as \nthe rule of law.\n  In so many of those key pillars of a free and just society, when one \nlooks at what happened with the lynchings, the torchings, the whippings \nto death of people because of their race, because of their religion, \nbecause of their ethnicity, the cold-hearted hatred of it, and the \ncountenance of it--and the fact that this wonderful Senate, with these \nhistoric desks where you can pull out drawers and see some of the great \nminds, the great orators of our history who had argued magnificently \nand inspiringly things on this Senate floor--you see there were times \nin our history when Senators ended up looking the other way. They did \nnot take a stand. They turned their eyes, they turned their heads when \nsomething positive could have been done to disapprove, deplore, and \nobviously pass a law to make lynching a Federal crime.\n  This Chamber is part of our representative democracy. We are to \nrepresent the ``Will of the People.'' We are also to represent those \nfoundational principles of our country. Unfortunately, that has not \nalways occurred.\n  Daniel Webster, standing in the Old Senate Chamber, told his \ncolleagues in 1834 that a ``representative of the people is a sentinel \non the watchtower of liberty.'' Indeed, the Senate has been a great \nwatchtower of liberty. Many individuals have been outstanding orators, \nbrilliant men and women in the world's greatest deliberative body. \nUnfortunately, this August body has a stain on its history, and that \nstain is lynching. Americans died from hangings, from whippings, from a \ntorch, from evil hearts outside of this Chamber.\n  Three-fourths of the victims of these injustices--and these have been \ndocumented and researched by the respected archives of the Tuskegee \nInstitute--were perpetrated against African Americans. Mr. President, \n4,749 Americans died by lynching, whipping, torturing, and mutilation, \nstarting in 1882. Many times these lynchings were not lone acts by a \nfew white men. Rather, they were angry gangs, as Senator Landrieu \ntalked about. They were occasions, they were events, mobs who were \nwhipped into frenzies by the skewed mentalities of what is right and \nwhat is wrong.\n  These cruel and unjust acts are so contrary to the rule of law, due \nprocess, and equal protection that we pride ourselves on in the United \nStates. Again, three-quarters of the victims were African Americans. \nBut this hatred also was perpetrated against those who are Asian, \nprimarily Chinese; against American Indians; against Latinos; against \nItalians; and against people who are Jewish; and others who found \nthemselves unprotected.\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Landrieu and I, as well as my colleagues who \nare joining us right now in the Chamber--Senator Kerry and Senator \nPryor--are rising this evening to make history, to try to right \nhistory. We are standing to give our heartfelt and formal apology, not \nfor what anybody here presently in the Senate had done, but what this \nbody, this continuous body, failed to do in the past. And it is an \napology to all the victims and descendants of those who were lynched, \nwho were whipped to death, who were torched to death, who were \nmutilated to death.\n  Many of the victims' descendants are currently watching in our \ngallery. This is a somber, not happy time but also one of reflection. \nIt is one of the failures of the Senate to take action when action was \nmost needed. It was a time where we were trying to make sure all \nAmericans had equal opportunity. However, that clearly was not the \ncase.\n  Senator Landrieu showed those photographs. These were vile killings. \nThey captivated front-page headlines. They drew crowds with morbid \ncuriosity and left thousands and thousands, mostly African Americans, \nhanging from trees or bleeding to death from the lashing of whips. By \nnot acting, this body failed to protect the liberty of which Daniel \nWebster spoke.\n  One of those who suffered this awful fate was an African American \nnamed Zachariah Walker, from Coatsville, VA. In 1911, Walker was \ndragged from a hospital bed where he was recovering from a gunshot \nwound. Accused of killing a white man--which he had claimed was in \nself-defense--Walker was burned alive at the stake without trial.\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\n  Such horrendous acts were not just a regional phenomenon of the \nSouth. States such as Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and even the \nWashington, DC area experienced this sort of mob violence and \ninjustice. Lynching was not just a regional problem; it was a crime \nthroughout our Nation, which occurred in 46 States of our country. It \nwas because of the national scope of these atrocities that the Senate \nshould act.\n  The Senate, of course, failed to pass any of the nearly 200 \nantilynching bills introduced in Congress during the first half of the \n20th century. Three bills passed the House of Representatives, but they \nwere filibustered on the Senate floor. In addition, seven Presidents \nhad asked that such laws be passed.\n  One might ask: What impact would such a Federal law have had? Would \nthat have saved all 4,749 people who were lynched, torched, mutilated, \nor whipped to death? Probably not in all cases because some had \noccurred before such bills were passed.\n  However, it would have sent a message, as it was read in newspapers \nacross the land--whether in small towns, big cities, or in the \ncountry--that as a nation, we must stop such horrendous injustices \nbeing perpetrated on people, that we stand for the rule of law and \nequal protection and due process. By the Senate not acting, guess what \nmessage was sent. It sent the message that there are some people who \nmay not think this is a good idea, that the Senate apparently condones \nit because they failed to act, notwithstanding the request of \nPresidents and the passage of such bills in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Why was Federal legislation needed? Because out of these 4,749 \ninjustices of lynching, torching, and whipping, only 1 percent were \nprosecuted. In many cases, local authorities were complicit and \ninvolved in these cruel acts of injustice. Virginia was one of the \nStates that actually passed an antilynching law which means that while \nthere were 100 such lynchings, torchings, and burnings--and 100 is too \nmany--compared to other States in the South, that was less. I have \nlearned a lot since we introduced this bill. North Carolina's \nGovernors, in the early 1900s, protested against such mob violence in \ntheir State and, therefore, they had less than in other States.\n  Another reason I got involved is to carry on the tradition of a man \nnamed Champ Clark, a Senator from Missouri whose son was actually one \nof my mentors when I first became involved in organized politics. He \nmoved to the Charlottesville area when I was Governor, and I appointed \nhim to the University of Virginia Board of Visitors. Sadly, he died a \nfew years ago.\n  I found that his father, Senator Champ Clark of Missouri, posted \nphotos--similar to those Senator Landrieu had--in our cloakrooms, of \nmutilated bodies. I will read from a document entitled, ``The U.S. \nSenate Filibusters Against Federal Anti-Lynching Legislation: The Case \nFor A Formal Apology.'' It states:\n\n       Unlike in 1935, when senators killed anti-lynching \n     legislation in just six days, the 1937-38 filibuster took six \n     weeks. One reason: in April 1937, a Mississippi mob, in \n     collusion with local law enforcement, removed two African \n     Americans from their jail cells, whipped them with chains, \n     gouged out their eyes with ice picks, and put them to death \n     with acetylene blowtorches. Senator Champ Clark of Missouri \n     posted photos of these victims' mutilated bodies in the \n     Senate cloakroom with a caption, ``There have been No \n     arrests, No indictments and No convictions for any one of the \n     lynchers. This is NOT a rape case.\n       One month later, a mob in Georgia, consisting partly of \n     women and teenage girls, forced its way into a funeral home \n     and seized the body of a lynched twenty-four-year-old African \n     American. After dumping the body into the trunk of a car and \n     carrying it through town in a horn-blowing motorcade, the mob \n     took it to a baseball field and burned it.\n       Horror-struck by these incidents, Senators sought to invoke \n     cloture. If nothing else, they recognized that not only were \n     African Americans in high lynch states at risk, but their own \n     constituents were unprotected if they were black and \n     traveling through these areas. Sadly, after courageously \n     battling on the Senate floor for six weeks, they abandoned \n     their effort to obtain cloture.\n\n  Six weeks with all this and no action. Historians will no doubt \ndisagree as to a single reason why Senators blocked antilynching \nlegislation in the 1920s through the 1940s. My desire is not to get \ninto motivations. Regardless of their reasoning, one reason that I can \nsee from all this is that there is no reason. There is no rationale. \nThey were clearly wrong. They turned their eyes. They turned their \nheads. That is why it is so important that we set aside these hours to \napologize for this lack of action by the Senate--because there was no \nreason. There was no tolerance. There was an acceptance and a \ncondonation of vile, hate-filled activity.\n  Thankfully, justice in our Nation has moved forward and left such \ndespicable acts history. In ignoring the protections of our Founding \nFathers, that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, the Senate \nturned its back on our foundational principles of justice and freedom.\n  I look around the Chamber and note that all of us serve with a great \ndeal of honor and integrity, and many have throughout our history.\n  As Ephesians teaches us: All things that are reproved are made \nmanifest by light. This apology has been a long time in coming.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Landrieu, for her tireless efforts in \ngetting this resolution agreed to. I thank also leader Frist for making \nthe legislation a priority and taking time on the Senate schedule to \nrecognize the significance of the moment.\n  I thank the cosponsors. We have nearly 80 cosponsors and will most \nlikely have more by the end of the day. They recognized the importance \nof a resolution and knew that the Senate owed an apology to the victims \nof lynching, their families and descendants. I also thank James Allen, \nas Senator Landrieu has, for his authorship of ``Without Sanctuary: \nLynching Photography in America,'' for bringing to us these horrendous, \nbut important, issues and making us react, recognizing how violent and \nhate-filled they were.\n\n  I also thank Janet Langhart Cohen and Mark Planning for their \nspirited leadership and teamwork in getting support for this \nresolution. I want to share with my colleagues some excerpts from Ms. \nCohen's comments.\n\n       While some members of the Senate question why so many of us \n     have been seeking the passage of this official expression of \n     apology at this time, the real question is why the Senate \n     action was not forthcoming decades ago.\n\n  This is important for us to understand the meaning for those who are \ndescendants of victims of lynching and torture and whipping.\n  She continues:\n\n       Consider the scope and depth of the crimes committed \n     against humanity: more than four thousand men and women were \n     hung from trees, many of them disembowled, their limbs and \n     organs amputated, and then set on fire. These heinous acts . \n     . . were designed to terrify African American citizens, \n     remind them that they have fewer rights and protections than \n     animals, and drive them from their land--all while serving as \n     entertainment for white society.\n\n  The point is, this was to intimidate people.\n  Ms. Cohen says that she comes to the Senate today--she is in the \ngallery with many other descendants--for many reasons. She writes:\n\n       As a Black woman, as the spouse of a former Senator, and as \n     one who had a family member lynched, I need to bear witness \n     to an act of decency that has been deferred, indeed \n     filibustered, for far too long.\n\n  We know she is here with many others and recognize that it has been \nfilibustered far too long.\n  She also states that:\n\n       It's important to remind the American people about the evil \n     chapters in our history. It is the reason we construct \n     museums in Washington and beyond, to hold up for all to see \n     how capable we are of descending into the heart of darkness. \n     It's important for us to look back into the past so that we \n     can pledge never again to allow racial hatred to consume our \n     ideals or humanity.\n\n  President Bush, in his second inaugural address, stated:\n\n       Our country must abandon all habits of racism because we \n     cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of \n     bigotry at the same time.\n  She concludes with these statements:\n\n       An apology, I concede, will do nothing for the thousands of \n     people who perished during what has been called ``the Black \n     Holocaust.'' It cannot repair the battered souls of their \n     survivors. It is, after all, only a symbolic act. Our \n     symbols, however, the Eagle, Old Glory, Lady Liberty, to \n     mention but a few, are but short hand narratives of who we \n     are as Americans.\n       It is through an acknowledgment of the Senate's abdication \n     of its duty to protect and defend the rights of all American \n     citizens that, perhaps, we can begin to understand the pain \n     and anger that still lingers in\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\n     the hearts and minds of so many who have been deprived of the \n     equality promised in our Constitution.\n       My friend and mentor, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once \n     said that ``the arc of history bends toward justice.''\n       Today, as the Senate Members cast their historic votes, \n     that arc dips closer to its destination.\n\n  Signed, Janet Langhart Cohen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 13, 2005.\n       First, I want to commend Senators George Allen and Mary \n     Landrieu for their leadership in introducing Senate \n     Resolution 39 and for their persistence in bringing it to a \n     vote today. I also wish to express my profound gratitude to \n     Mark Planning who has been indefatigable in his quest for the \n     passage of this measure.\n       While some members of the Senate question why so many of us \n     have been seeking the passage of this official expression of \n     apology at this time, the real question is why Senate action \n     was not forthcoming decades ago.\n       Consider the scope and depth of the crimes committed \n     against humanity: more than four thousand men and women were \n     hung from trees, many of them disemboweled, their limbs and \n     organs amputated, and then set on fire. These heinous acts, \n     carried out and protected under the claim of ``states \n     rights'' were designed to terrify African-American citizens, \n     remind them that they had fewer rights and protections than \n     animals, and drive them from their land--all while serving as \n     entertainment for white society.\n       Picnics were even held by white communities so that those \n     who claimed to be decent, law abiding citizens could witness \n     and rejoice in the mutilation of those whose ancestors had \n     been ripped from their homeland, separated from their \n     families, sheared of their identities, brought in chains to \n     America, and sold on the auction block as sub-human chattels.\n       It is inconceivable that any person of reason or \n     conscience, of any faith, Christian or non-Christian, could \n     possibly tolerate such barbarism, such a display of pure \n     evil. But people did, of course. They tolerated it and \n     sanctioned it, not during the Dark Ages, but during my \n     lifetime. And those who sanctioned it were not uneducated \n     barbarians; they included men who held positions of office \n     and honor at all levels of government, including the United \n     States Senate. The parliamentary delaying tactics that \n     currently are the subject of so much debate took place in the \n     nation's Capital, on the floor of this hallowed institution.\n       I have come to the United States Senate today for many \n     reasons. As a Black woman, as the spouse of a former Senator, \n     and as one who had a family member lynched, I need to bear \n     witness to an act of decency that has been deferred, indeed \n     filibustered, for far too long.\n       I am told that some members of the Senate are not prepared \n     to support this measure because they think that an official \n     apology is too trivial, meaningless and irrelevant to the \n     times in which we live.\n       The passage of time can never remove the stain of \n     institutionalized terrorism from our history or permit any \n     public official to dismiss the pain of those who have lost \n     family members to the savagery of lynch mobs as something \n     unworthy of the Senate's agenda and deliberations.\n       It's important to remind the American people about the evil \n     chapters in our history. It is the reason we construct \n     museums in Washington and beyond, to hold up for all to see \n     how capable we are of descending into the heart of darkness. \n     It's important for us to look back into the past so that we \n     can pledge to never again allow racial hatred to consume our \n     ideals or humanity.\n       In his Second Inaugural Address, President Bush stated \n     that, ``Our country must abandon all habits of racism because \n     we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of \n     bigotry at the same time.'' These are noble words and they \n     deserve to be acted upon as well as invoked.\n       Finally, let me say that this Resolution is but a first \n     step in the process of educating the American people about \n     our history; of not allowing this part of our past to be \n     reduced to a footnote, or glossed over and air brushed into \n     oblivion.\n       An apology will not erase the criminality that was once \n     considered a cultural or regional privilege. An apology does \n     not purport to serve as an absolution for the sins of the \n     past.\n       An apology, I concede, will do nothing for the thousands of \n     people who perished during what has been called, ``the Black \n     Holocaust. It cannot repair the battered souls of their \n     survivors. It is, after all, only a symbolic act. Our \n     symbols, however, the Eagle, Old Glory, Lady Liberty, to \n     mention but a few, are but short hand narratives of who we \n     are as Americans.\n       It is through an acknowledgement of the Senate's abdication \n     of its duty to protect and defend the rights of all of \n     America's citizens, that, perhaps, we can begin to understand \n     the pain and anger that still lingers in the hearts and minds \n     of so many who have been deprived of the equality promised in \n     our Constitution.\n       My friend and mentor, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said \n     that, ``The arc of history bends towards justice.''\n       Today, as the Senate members cast their historic votes, \n     that arc dips closer to its destination.\n                                             Janet Langhart Cohen.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am proud that this resolution will pass \ntonight. The Senate is going to be on record condemning the brutal \natrocities that plagued our great Nation for over a century.\n  I will close with the words of our resolution:\n\n       Whereas, an apology offered in the spirit of true \n     repentance moves the United States toward reconciliation and \n     may become central to a new understanding, on which improved \n     racial relations can be forged. Now, therefore, be it \n     Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) apologizes to the victims of lynching for the failure \n     of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation;\n       (2) expresses the deepest sympathies and most solemn \n     regrets of the Senate to the descendants of victims of \n     lynching, the ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human \n     dignity, and the constitutional protections accorded all \n     citizens of the United States; and\n       (3) remembers the history of lynching, to ensure that these \n     tragedies will be neither forgotten nor repeated.\n\n  My colleagues, I ask you to join all of us in examining our history, \nlearn from history, never again sit quietly, and never again turn one's \nhead away when the ugly specter of racism, antisemitism, hate, and \nintolerance rises again. It is our responsibility to stand strong for \nfreedom and justice.\n  In the future, I am confident that this Senate will perform better \nthan it has in the past. We will protect the God-given blessings of all \npeople to life and liberty, regardless of their race, their ethnicity, \nor their religious beliefs. The Senate can do better; we have done \nbetter tonight. But the real measure of what we have learned when such \nacts occur in the future is, will this Senate rise and condemn it to \nprotect those God-given liberties? I know that Senator Landrieu and I \nbelieve the Senate will rise appropriately.\n  Mr. President, with that, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous agreement, the Senate now proceed to the \nvote on the pending resolution; I further ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding adoption of the resolution, the remaining time under \nthe previous agreement remain available for Senators who wish to make \nstatements, provided that any statements relating to the resolution \nappear prior to its adoption in the Congressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 39) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. What is the status of the time? Is it under control, or is \nit just open?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nLouisiana control the time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts in just a moment. He has been very patient. As a \ncosponsor of the resolution that just passed, it is a privilege and it \nis appropriate for Senator Kerry to be one of the first Senators to \nspeak upon its passage.\n  I wish to just mention very briefly, because I am not sure he is \ngoing to be able to stay with us much longer, Mr. James Cameron has \nbeen with us all day. Mr. Cameron is 91 years old. He lives in Marion, \nIN. In 1930, when he was 16 years old, a mob dragged him from a cell at \nGrant County Jail and put a rope around his neck. He was accused of a \nmurder and a rape. He was nowhere around when it occurred. His \nassociates, Abe Smith and Thomas Schipp, were both lynched that night. \nA man in the crowd spared him by proclaiming that he, in fact, was \ninnocent and should be let go. He then went on to live an extraordinary \nlife without bitterness, with a lot of love. He has been married for 67 \nyears, has 4 children and multiple grandchildren. Senator Evan Bayh, \nwho serves in this body--when he was Governor of Indiana, he pardoned \nMr. Cameron. But he\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\nis really the one who has forgiven us for what was done against him.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I start by thanking Senator Landrieu and \nSenator Allen for their leadership on this effort and for all those \ndescendants of families who have been absolutely extraordinary in the \nway in which they relived their pain, brought it to the public view, \nkind of laid their hearts out on the table in a very real and emotional \nway--that has been a wonderful part of this process--and the way in \nwhich the book Jimmy Allen put together has helped to unleash a pain \nthat was never lost, never forgotten by anybody, but never quite had a \nplace to play itself out--until this public effort that is being made \nby the Senate.\n  There is no small irony, I suspect, in the fact that the Senate is \nhere sort of making good on what the Senate failed to do. I personally \nam struck by even, at this significant moment, the undeniable and \ninescapable reality that there are not 100 Senators as cosponsors. \nMaybe by the end of the evening there will be, but as we stand here \nwith this resolution passed by voice vote, there are not.\n  Moreover, all the people in the Senate and the press understand how \nwe work here. It is critical that we take the step we are taking and \nhave taken, but at the same time wouldn't it have been just that much \nmore extraordinary and significant if we were having a recorded vote \nwith all 100 Senators recording their votes? We are not.\n  So even today, as we take this gigantic step, we are also saying to \nAmerica that there is a journey still to travel. I don't want to \ndiminish one iota--and I don't mean to because I believe what is \nhappening here today is so significant, but at the same time, it has to \ngive all of us a kind of kick in the rear end to get us out there to do \nthat which is necessary, which gives fuller meaning to the words that \nare going to be expressed here and have been expressed here--most \nimportant, to give fuller meaning to the emotions that have been laid \nbare for all of America to understand better by the families who have \ncome here to share this with us.\n  I also join not just in thanking Mr. Cameron and Ms. Johnson, and \nothers, but Janet Langhart, who is here with our former colleague and \nthe former Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen. We certainly appreciate \nher commitment to this effort and the meaning of this to her and to all \nof the families who have come here together.\n\n  It is pretty incredible to think about it. Lynchings really replaced \nslavery. They came in the aftermath of slavery, around the 1880s. \nBetween the 1880s and 1968--I have to pause when I think about that \nbecause I was already a young officer in the military. I had left \ncollege. I remember the early part of the 1960s devoted to the civil \nrights movement, the Mississippi voter registration drive. We were \nstill recording lynchings during that period of time, but I did not \nknow it, not in the sense that we know it today.\n  I thought I knew history pretty well, but I will tell you, until I \nsaw this array of photographs which then sparked my curiosity to read \nmore about it, I had always thought, like most Americans, that a \nlynching was just slinging a rope over a branch of a tree and that was \nit. The story is so much more gruesome than that, so much more dark and \nhorrendous as a moment in American history that it is really hard to \nbelieve it happened at all in our country, which is another reason it \nis so important that we are taking this step to remember.\n  We have seen revisionism in almost every part of history, including \nthe Holocaust. So it is good we are taking this step today, and it is \ngood we have these photographs now brought together as a compilation of \nhistory, and it is good that the Senate is taking this effort tonight.\n  It is extraordinary to think that 99 percent of the perpetrators of \nlynchings escaped any reach of the law whatsoever. It is incredible to \nthink that almost 5,000 people are recorded as incidents, and how many \nare not recorded? How many went without the local authorities in each \nof those communities--who were already complicitous in what happened, \nstanding by, permissive, turning away from basic human rights--how many \nof those incidents were not recorded?\n  A lot of us have read a lot about World War II and the Holocaust and \nother moments of history where there is a knock on the door and life \nchanges. But you have to stop and really think what it was like in all \nbut four States in our country, not just for African Americans but for \nnew people, for folks who had come here from other places to live the \nAmerican dream. In some cases, they were not knocks, they were just \nangry mobs screaming and yelling with torches and running rampant \nthrough a household, dragging out people screaming. In other cases, \nthere was a pretext, more polite, but it was never polite in what it \nended up as.\n  Lynchings were not just lynchings; they were organized torture. They \nwere incidents of kinds of torture that defied imagination, about which \nyou do not even want to talk, the kinds of things that any decent \nsociety ought to stand up against. People were literally tortured for \nsport in front of people, and crowds would cheer--bedlam. Children were \nbrought to be spectators. Some of these photographs show kids standing \nthere with their eyes wide open and adults standing beside them, who \nwere supposed to be more responsible, glued to the horror they were \nwitnessing.\n  In the first half of the last century alone, in the 20th century, \nover 200 antilynching bills were introduced in the Congress--200. Three \ntimes, the House of Representatives passed antilynching legislation. \nSeven Presidents asked for this legislation to be passed. The Senate \nsaid no.\n  So it is important that we are here today to apologize. Some people \nwonder what the effect of an apology is. We can understand that \nquestion being asked. This is sort of a day of reckoning for us as a \ncountry, it is a moment for the conscience of our country to be \nlistened to by everybody. It is an embarrassingly and unforgivably late \nmoment in coming, but we are addressing a stain on our history, and we \nare working to heal wounds across generations. I believe that is \nimportant. Some people might try to diminish that, but the very lack of \nunity I mentioned earlier, in fact, goes to show why this apology is so \nimportant and why we all have to keep moving in this direction.\n  No words, obviously, are going to undo the horror of those 5,000 \nAmericans losing their lives. No apology is going to just wipe away the \nmemories of Mr. Cameron and others, though they have shown a greater \ngraciousness of understanding than others even at this moment.\n  The fact is that this resolution can be one more step in the effort \nfor all of us to try to get over the divide that still exists between \nraces and as a result of Jim Crow in this country, but only if we face \nthe truth. It is the Bible that reminds us that it is the truth that \nsets us free. And so it is that we have to embrace it, commit ourselves \nto putting our hearts and our actions where our words have now preceded \nus. This should be an important step forward, but, frankly, it will \nonly do that if we do not stop here.\n  The truth is that it is not enough to face the horror of lynchings if \nwe then just walk out of here and consciously turn away from legally \nseparate and unequal schools in America. It is not enough to decry \ndecades of refusing to use the force of law against lynchings if today \nwe refuse to use the force of law to tear down the barriers that \nprevent people from voting, barriers in the economy, divisions in the \nhealth care system that works for too few of those who are in the \nminority in America.\n\n  It is only by reconciling the past that we have to understand where \nwe have to go in the future and get there. I remind my colleagues to \nremember the words of Julian Bond when he dedicated that beautiful, \nsimple memorial in Montgomery, AL, to those who gave their lives for \ncivil rights. He said it was erected as much to remember the dead as it \nwas for those young people who cannot remember the period when the \nsacrifices began, with its small cruelties and monstrous injustices, \nits petty indignities and its death dealing in inequities. There are \nmany too young to remember that from that seeming hopelessness, there \narose a mighty movement, simple in its tactics, overwhelming in its \nimpact. That is why we have to remember the period\n\n[[Page S6375]]\n\nof the lynchings. That is why this resolution is important--for the \nyoung people who do not know what it means to wake up in the middle of \nthe night to hear that knock, for young people to need to commit to \nhelp our country complete the journey in order to guarantee we make it \nall that it promises to be and can be.\n  We will never erase what Mr. Cameron or Mr. Wright and too many \nothers went through, but we certainly can honor the legacy of these \ncivil rights heroes and the martyrs who came before us by doing right \nby them and by the country. I hope this resolution will help us do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nIllinois as he should use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nresolution. Before I make any further remarks, I would like to \nrecognize Doria D. Johnson, and thank her for coming. She is from \nEvanston, IL. Ms. Johnson is the great, great-granddaughter of Anthony \nCrawford, a South Carolina farmer who was lynched nearly 100 years ago \nfor the crime of being a successful Black farmer. I am sure that this \nday has special meaning for her, and for the other family members of \nthose who were impacted by these great tragedies of the past. I thank \nher and others for being here today.\n  Since America's darkest days of Jim Crow, separate but equal, fire \nhoses, church bombings, cross burnings and lynchings, the people of \nthis great Nation have found the courage, on occasion, to speak up and \nspeak out so that we can right this country's wrongs, and walk together \ndown that long road of transformation that continues to perfect our \nUnion. It is a transformation that brought us the Civil Rights Act and \nthe Voting Rights Act; a transformation that led to the first Black \nMember of Congress, and the first Black and White children holding \nhands in the same playground and the same school; a transformation \nwithout which I would not be standing here speaking today. But I am. \nAnd I am proud because, thanks to this resolution, we are taking \nanother step in acknowledging a dark corner of our history. We are \ntaking a step that allows us--after looking at the 4,700 deaths from \nlynchings, the hate that was behind those deaths, and this Chamber's \nrefusal to try and stop them--to finally say that we were wrong.\n  There is a power in acknowledging error and mistake. It is a power \nthat potentially transforms not only those who were impacted directly \nby the lynchings, but also those who are the progeny of the \nperpetrators of these crimes. There is a piercing photographic exhibit \nin Chicago right now that displays some of the lynchings that occurred \nacross the country over the past two centuries. These photographs show \nthat what is often most powerful is not the gruesome aspects of the \nlynching itself, nor the terrible rending of the body that took place. \nNo, what is most horrific, what is most disturbing to the soul is the \nphotographs in which you see young little White girls or young little \nWhite boys with their parents on an outing, looking at the degradation \nof another human being. One wonders not only what the lynching did to \nthe family member of those who were lynched, but also what the effect \nwas on the sensibilities of those young people who stood there, \nwatching.\n  Now that we are finally acknowledging this injustice, we have an \nopportunity to reflect on the cruelties that inhabit all of us. We can \nnow take the time to teach our children to treat people who look \ndifferent than us with the same respect that we would expect for \nourselves. So it is fitting, it is proper, and it is right that we are \ndoing what we are doing today.\n  However, I do hope, as we commemorate this past injustice, that this \nChamber also spends some time doing something concrete and tangible to \nheal the long shadow of slavery and the legacy of racial \ndiscrimination, so that 100 years from now we can look back and be \nproud, and not have to apologize once again. That means completing the \nunfinished work of the civil rights movement, and closing the gap that \nstill exists in health care, education, and income. There are more ways \nto perpetrate violence than simply a lynching. There is the violence \nthat we subject young children to when they do not have any opportunity \nor hope, when they stand on street corners not thinking much of \nthemselves, not thinking that their lives are worth living. That is a \nform of violence that this Chamber could do something about.\n  As we are spending time apologizing today for these past failures of \nthe Senate to act, we should also spend some time debating the \nextension of the Voting Rights Act and the best way to extend health \ncare coverage to over 45 million uninsured Americans. We should be \nconsidering how we can make certain that college is affordable for \nyoung African-American children, the great, great-grandchildren or the \ngreat, great, great-grandchildren of those who have been wronged. These \nare the ways we can finally ensure that the blessings of opportunity \nreach every single American, and finally claim a victory in the long \nstruggle for civil rights.\n  Today is a step in the right direction. Today's actions give us an \nopportunity to heal and to move forward. But for those who still harbor \nanger in their hearts, who still wonder how to move on from such \nterrible violence, it is worth reflecting for a moment on one \nremarkable individual: Mamie Till Mobley.\n  Mamie Till Mobley's child Emmett was only 14 years old when they \nfound him in the Mississippi River, beaten and bloodied beyond \nrecognition. After Ms. Mobley saw her child, her baby, unrecognizable, \nhis face so badly beaten it barely looked human, someone suggested that \nshe should have a closed casket at his funeral. She said: No, we are \ngoing to have an open casket, and everybody is going to witness what \nthey did to my child.\n  The courage displayed by this mother galvanized the civil rights \nmovement in the North and in the South. And, despite the immensity of \nthe pain she felt, Mamie Till Mobley has repeatedly said: I never \nwasted a day hating. Imagine that. She never wasted a day hating, not \none day.\n  I rise today, thanking God that the United States Congress--the \nrepresentatives of the American people and our highest ideals--will not \nwaste one more day without issuing the apology that will continue to \nhelp us march down the path of transformation that Mamie Till Mobley \nhas been on her whole life, and that the people in attendance in the \ngallery have been on for generations.\n  I am grateful for this tribute, and I am looking forward to joining \nhands with my colleagues and the American people to make sure that when \nour children and grandchildren look back at our actions in this \nChamber, we do not have something to apologize for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today to talk about \none of our Nation's darkest periods, a stain in history we would rather \nforget but that we cannot ignore. While White mobs committed 4,742 \nhangings, floggings and burnings of African Americans, the Senate \nwatched indifferently, failing to pass any of the 200 separate bills \nbefore it to make lynching a Federal crime. S. Res. 39, expressing the \nSenate's apology for failing to adopt antilynching legislation, is long \noverdue. I express my sincere apologies and regret to the families in \nArkansas and the Nation, especially to the victims and their \ndescendants, that this body failed to help at a time when they needed \nit most.\n  I hope that acknowledging these grave injustices of the past will \nhelp begin to heal the wounds that exist today. Even more so, this \nacknowledgement should serve as a lesson that government must step in \nto help foster racial reconciliation, ensure the mob mentality never \nreturns, and protect those who are most vulnerable.\n  The Senate can start by continuing to advance civil rights and \nequality, and work to close the divide that continues in our \nneighborhoods, schools and workplaces. I am afraid that if we don't \nstart truly addressing inequities we will look back once again at the \nSenate's inaction with disdain and remorse.\n  Most of the worst offenses of lynching occurred in the south and \nArkansas was no different. Between the years\n\n[[Page S6376]]\n\n1860-1936, 318 lynchings occurred in Arkansas. Of this number, 230 were \nblack, including 6 females. Three-quarters of the lynchings in our \nState that are recorded were against African Americans.\n  Of course, statistics don't have a face, they don't feel pain, nor do \nthey hold memories. But people and families all over Arkansas do, and \nthey remember these crimes and the Senate's inaction to protect them.\n  In March 1892, a reporter from the Christian Recorder reported the \nchaos and hopelessness occurring throughout the state:\n\n       There is much uneasiness and unrest all over this State \n     among our people, owing to the fact that the people all over \n     the State are being lynched upon the slightest provocation; \n     some being strung up to telegraph poles, others burnt at the \n     stake and still others being shot like dogs.\n       In the last 30 days there have been not less than eight \n     colored persons lynched in this State. At Texarkana a few \n     days ago, a man was burnt at the stake.\n       In Pine Bluff a few days later two men were strung up and \n     shot, and this too by the brilliant glare of the electric \n     lights. At Varner, George Harris was taken from jail and shot \n     for killing a white man, for poisoning his domestic \n     happiness.\n       At Wilmar, a boy was induced to confess to the commission \n     of an outrage, upon promise of his liberty, and when he had \n     confessed, he was strung up and shot. Over in Lonoke County, \n     a whole family consisting of husband, wife and child were \n     shot down like dogs. Verily the situation is alarming in the \n     extreme.\n\n  There were few honest press accounts of such lynchings, a problem \nthat continues to trouble historians today as they put together the \npieces of this period. Most Arkansas press accounts were no different. \nLynchers were considered heroes, officers conniving, and the accused \nguilty.\n  A case in point:\n  In 1919, Arkansas would be home to a terrible racial injustice--the \nso-called Elaine Race Riot.\n  According to sketchy accounts that have been pieced together by \nhistorians, in September 1919, black sharecroppers met to protest \nunfair settlements for their cotton crops from white plantation owners. \nLocal law enforcement broke up the union's meeting, and the next day a \nthousand white men, and troops of the U.S. Army, converged on Phillips \nCounty to put an end to the black sharecroppers' so-called \n``insurrection''.\n  The number of African-American deaths from this lynching is disputed, \nranging from 20 at the low end to 856 men and women on the high end.\n  The details of the Elaine Race Riot of 1919 have never been formally \nwritten down, but Mayor Robert Miller of Helena, AR remembers them \nvividly.\n  At the time, Mayor Miller's four uncles were preparing for a hunting \ntrip. Three of them had traveled to a town near Elaine, Helena, AR, for \nthis special occasion, which turned tragic when a mob saw the brothers \nwith guns in hand, and assuming they were part of the ``insurrection,'' \nall four were immediately killed.\n  Of the anti-lynching legislation we are considering today, Mayor \nMiller says, ``It won't change what happened, but at least it's a good \nthing, a movement in the right direction.''\n  A 2000 article from the Arkansas Times reports on Arkansas' most \nhigh-profile lynching and the lasting impact it has had on families in \nArkansas today.\n  In May 1927, a mentally retarded black man named John Carter was \naccused of attacking a white mother and daughter. Upon his capture near \nLittle Rock a mob of 100 quickly gathered and prevented police from \ntaking him to Little Rock, where police would protect him from being \nlynched.\n  After hanging him from a utility pole, the mob dragged John Carter's \nbody through the city, and burned it in downtown Little Rock at 9th and \nBroadway.\n  The Arkansas Times article recounts a conversation that occurred 30 \nyears later, in September 1957 of a mother talking to civil rights \npioneer Daisy Bates about the John Carter lynching. The mother had this \nto say:\n\n       I am frightened Mrs. Bates. Not for myself, but for my \n     children. When I was a little girl, my mother and I saw a \n     lynch mob dragging the body of a Negro man through the \n     streets of Little Rock. We were told to get off the streets. \n     We ran. And by cutting through side streets and alleys, we \n     managed to make it to the home of a friend.\n       But we were close enough to hear the screams of the mob, \n     close enough to smell the sickening odor of burning flesh. \n     And, Mrs. Bates, they took the pews from Bethel Church to \n     make the fire. They burned the body of this Negro man right \n     at the edge of the Negro business section.\n\n  The woman speaking to Daisy Bates was named Birdie Eckford. Her \ndaughter Elizabeth, one of the Little Rock Nine, would walk through an \nangry, threatening crowd the following day to claim her right to an \nequal education at Little Rock Central High School.\n  Little Rock Central High School today reminds us of some of the \ndarkest days during the civil rights movement. As a former student, \nhowever, I can tell you that it also represents hope and achievement.\n  The year 2007 will mark the 50th anniversary of the desegregation \nprocess at Little Rock Central High School. Last Friday, I spoke with \nseven members of the Little Rock Nine to tell them that we are closer \nto funding an adequate visitor center and museum in time for his \nlandmark anniversary.\n  Minnijean Brown Trickey, one of the Nine, said this Visitors' Center \nwill serve many purposes, but what struck me was her assurance that the \nCenter ``is an opportunity for healing.''\n  Today's resolution offers similar opportunities. It allows us to \nremember the past, begin healing from that past, look at how far our \nNation has come to address equality and discrimination and rededicate \nourselves to acknowledging how much further we must go from here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak in support \nof S. Res. 39, apologizing for the Senate's failure to enact \nantilynching legislation. It is important for us to reflect on the \nstatements that have been made by my colleagues, including the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana and the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, so that we can remember the history of this country and how \nAmerica has been an America in progress. The past can be painted in \nstatistics or it can be painted in the stories of people who have \nsuffered from the unjust result of the absence of an antilynching law.\n  We can speak about the time between 1882 and 1968 when there were \nnearly 5,000 lynchings. These lynchings that occurred were not \nlynchings that occurred just in the southern part of the United States \nof America but happened throughout most of the States of our country, \nincluding in my own home State of Colorado, where a historian has in \nhis own research concluded that there were about 175 lynchings in \nColorado between 1859 and 1919.\n  It is appropriate and fitting that today we apologize for the absence \nof those laws, that we recognize people like James Cameron who became a \nsurvivor of the lynchings of that time period, recognize that this \nSenate today says we apologize for that past.\n  It is perhaps even more important to look to the future of America \nand to look at the racial issues and the challenges we face as a nation \nto create an America that truly is an America of inclusion. It is one \nthing to stand in the Chamber of the Senate today, to look at our \nhistory, and to learn from that painful history, but it is equally as \nimportant to look to the future and to recognize the challenges we face \nin this America in the decade ahead, and the 100 years ahead require us \nto learn from those very painful lessons of the past.\n  When one looks at those very painful lessons of the past, we have to \nrecognize for the first 250 years of the beginnings of this Nation we \nhad a system of law that recognized it was OK for one group of people \nto own another group of people under our system of slavery just because \nof the color of their skin. It is important for us, also, to recognize \nthat it took the bloodiest war of the United States during the Civil \nWar, for over half a million people were killed on our own soil in \nAmerica to bring about an end to the system of slavery and to usher in \nthe 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments which are the bedrock of the \nconstitutional liberties we now endow upon all people of America.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that in that time period of the Civil War we \nsaw the blood and life of so many Americans laid down in this country, \nwe still continued through another period of almost 100 years where we \ndivided our\n\n[[Page S6377]]\n\nNation according to groups. It was over 100 years ago when Justice \nHarlan, writing for the dissent in the now famous case of Plessy v. \nFerguson, made the following observation, disagreeing with the U.S. \nSupreme Court on the segregation system which was ushered in under that \ndecision, saying:\n\n       The destinies of the races, in this country, are \n     indissolubly linked together and the interests of both \n     require that the common government law shall not permit the \n     seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of law.\n\n  That was over 100 years ago. Yet it took more than half a century, \nuntil 1954, in the decision of Brown v. Board of Education, for the \nU.S. Supreme Court under the leadership of Justice Warren to say in \nthese United States, separate but equal was unconstitutional under the \n14th amendment. It took more than half a century more for the U.S. \nSupreme Court to make that statement.\n  So when we look to the future of America, when we look to the \ndiversity that defines our country, it is my belief that this next \ncentury will be defined by how we as an American society embrace the \nconcept of an inclusive America. When we embrace a concept of an \ninclusive America, we talk about including people of all backgrounds--\nbe they Anglo Americans, French Americans, African Americans, Latinos, \nNative Americans, women--that we as an American society will be \nchallenged in the century ahead by how we deal with the issue of \ninclusion, and the greatness of this country will be defined by how \nsuccessful we are in making sure we are inclusive of all people.\n  There are some who have recognized this. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nin writing for the U.S. Supreme Court in the now famous decision of the \nUniversity of Michigan from several years ago, made the following \ncomment about the importance of diversity in higher education in the \nmajority opinion:\n\n       These benefits are not theoretical but real, as major \n     American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in \n     today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed \n     through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, \n     and viewpoints.\n\n  That was from the brief submitted by General Motors. She went on to \nsay:\n\n       What is more, high-ranking retired officers and civilian \n     leaders of the United States military assert, based on their \n     decades of experience, a highly qualified racially diverse \n     officer corps is essential to the military's ability to \n     fulfill its principal mission to provide national security.\n\n  It was in that articulation by Justice Day O'Connor, where she \narticulated the challenge and the opportunity that we have as an \nAmerican society, the 21st century unfolds in front of us.\n  In my estimation, the greatness of this country depends on our \nlearning and not forgetting the painful lessons of the past, including \nthe lynchings that occurred across America, while also looking forward \nto the challenge of including people of all backgrounds and all races \nin all of the business affairs and civic affairs of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am very glad we are passing \nthis resolution. There have been attempts in the past by other Members \nof Congress, such as my good friend, the former Congressman Tony Hall \nof Ohio, who had tried several years back to get a resolution of \napology with regard to slavery. They never could work out all the \ndetails. I am very glad the Senate has come to this point that it could \ncritique itself for this legislative body's failure to enact \nantilynching laws back at a time when it would have been so important \nto stop these kinds of mayhem and murderous rampages where mobs would \ntake, supposedly, justice into their own hands.\n  Thank goodness we have come to a point at which we can admit our \nmistakes, even though this is several generations later, and pass such \na resolution as we will do tonight.\n  Interestingly, one of my political heroes is a person who Americans \nrarely hear about. He was a British Parliamentarian in the late 1700s \nand the early 1800s named William Wilberforce. Wilberforce was elected \nto the Parliament at the age of 21 along with one of his best friends, \nWilliam Pitt, the Younger. And in 3 years, at age 24, Pitt was elected \nPrime Minister. Of course, Wilberforce could have been in his Cabinet. \nBut at that point Wilberforce had recognized the great evil of the day \nand dedicated his life to the elimination of the economic order of the \nday, which was the English slave trade where the captains would take \nthe boats down off the coast of Africa under the guise of friendship, \nround up native Africans, put them in the holds of those slave ships, \nand take them to the New World and sell them.\n  Wilberforce is a hero to me because, as a government official, a \nmember of Parliament, he would not even join William Pitt, the \nYounger's Cabinet. He wanted to devote his life to the elimination of \nthe slave trade. It took him 20 years to do it. Time after time, he was \nbeat back, but he persevered, and he finally won, 20 years later. Then, \nbefore Wilberforce died, he saw that Parliament actually abolished \nslavery. That was some 30 years before slavery was abolished here in \nAmerica.\n\n  So it is a privilege for me to be here at long last to join our \ncolleagues to apologize for the Senate's failure in the 1930s to pass \nlegislation outlawing the barbaric practice of lynching. For more than \na century, this country presented two realities to its citizens. \nEnshrined in our Constitution is a government and a legal system \ndesigned to protect the rights of all Americans so that our freedom \ncannot be taken away or infringed upon without due process of law. But \nfor many decades, however, this system of justice and respect for the \nrule of law did not apply to all of the citizens of this country.\n  In 1857, in the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, that guarantee in \nthe U.S. Constitution that all men are created equal was not intended \nto include Blacks by that decision. For many years later, Black \nAmericans found few protections in the constitutional guarantees of \nliberty and freedom and equal protection under the law. A Black man \naccused of a crime against a White person found that he had no access \nto the courts to prove his innocence, he had no access to a fair and \nimpartial jury of his peers. All too often, White citizens, armed with \nguns and feelings of righteousness, would take the accused, as law \nenforcement officers stood by, and brutalize them and hang them in a \npublic setting for other members of the community to view and feel \navenged. How horrible would that be, a public spectacle that was \nsupposed to intimidate, that was supposed to strike fear. Did it? You \nbet it did. It was meant to send a message to the members of the Black \ncommunity that they better remain in their place, to remember that the \nguarantees of freedom and fairness in the Constitution did not include \nthem.\n  In my State of Florida, there were 61 lynchings of Black Americans \nbetween 1921 and 1946, which, of course, represents only a fraction of \nthe total number that were committed in my State. There is no \njustification or explanation for these horrible acts of violence. As a \nnation that respects the rule of law and court-prescribed justice, what \nhappened was vigilantism and mob rule. That is what determined \n``justice.'' And that is never justifiable.\n  There is a place in Florida called Rosewood. It was the site, in the \n1920s, of what many describe as a massacre. That Black community was \ndestroyed by Whites. No arrests were ever made in as many as 27 racial \nkillings in that location.\n  Florida finally passed the Nation's first compensation for Blacks who \nsuffered from those past racial injustices. It was all directed back to \nthe massacres that had occurred at Rosewood, FL. The 1994 Florida \nLegislature passed the Rosewood Claims Bill to compensate victims for \nloss of property as a result of the failure to prosecute those \nindividuals responsible. I felt as a Floridian that this \nacknowledgement was long overdue, and it made me proud to see, at long \nlast, that we addressed the tragedy of Rosewood.\n  Now, as a Member of the Senate, I believe this resolution we are \npassing tonight is long overdue. In being proud of this event, I am \nalso humbled to stand up as a Member of the Senate and to personally \napologize for the Senate's failure to act--a failure to outlaw barbaric \nacts such as lynchings and racial massacres.\n  I am proud, too, that we can today reaffirm that we are a nation of \nlaws designed to protect the freedom and liberty of all Americans--all \nAmericans--regardless of race.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6378]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an issue that will be considered \nby the Senate later this evening, an issue of historic importance. It \nwill be an official apology by the Senate for the Senate's failure to \nprotect victims of lynching in America.\n  Fifty years ago, on August 20, 1955, a Chicago woman named Mamie Till \ntook her 14-year-old son Emmett to the 63rd Street Station in Chicago \nto catch the southbound train to Mississippi. Emmett was going to spend \nthe summer with his great uncle and aunt in a town called Money, MS, in \nthe heart of the Mississippi Delta.\n  The next day, August 21, 1955, young Emmett Till arrived in \nMississippi. He spent the next few days helping out around the house, \nworking with his great uncle, Moses Wright, in the cotton fields.\n  On August 24, after a long day of working in the fields, Emmett and a \ngroup of teenagers went into town to Bryant's Grocery Store for some \nrefreshments. The store--owned by a White couple named Roy and Carolyn \nBryant--served primarily Black workers, sharecroppers, and their kids. \nEmmett went into Bryant's Grocery Store to buy some bubble gum. Some \nkids who were hanging out outside the store accused Emmett of whistling \nat Carolyn Bryant, one of the proprietors of the store.\n  Four days later, on August 28, Carolyn Bryant's husband and his half \nbrother went to Moses Wright's home at 2:30 in the morning. They \nkidnapped young Emmett Till from his bed, and they committed one of the \nmost notorious and horrific lynchings in American history. They \nbrutally beat this young man from Chicago, IL, Emmett Till. They gouged \nout his eyes, they shot him in the head, they tied a large metal fan \naround his neck with barbed wire, and they threw his mangled, dead body \ninto the Tallahatchie River.\n  A few days later, his broken and bloated body was found floating in \nthe river. Emmett Till was returned to his mother in Chicago in a \ncoffin. On September 3, 1955, Mamie Till held a historic funeral for \nher son at Roberts Temple Church of God in Chicago. She did a \ncourageous thing: She directed that the casket remain open so that \neveryone could see what hatred and racism had done to her little boy.\n  Tens of thousands of Chicagoans came to say goodbye to 14-year-old \nEmmett Till, a young man who just a few weeks before got on that train \nto visit his family in Mississippi. News coverage of that funeral \nreached millions more around the world. Jet Magazine made a historic \ndecision: They decided to print actual photographs of Emmett Till's \nmutilated body lying in the casket and cover his funeral. The decision \nby that magazine and the publicity that came with Emmett Till's tragic \ndeath changed people across America. I cannot tell you how many African \nAmericans I have met who said that the world changed after the murder \nof Emmett Till. They came to realize that what happened to him should \nnot be allowed to happen in America.\n  One of my favorite friends in Congress, one of my heroes of all time, \nis a man named John Lewis. He represents Atlanta, GA, as a Member of \nthe House of Representatives. He was one of the pioneers in the civil \nrights movement. He was 15 years old, 1 year older than Emmett Till, \ngrowing up in Alabama, when he saw those photographs of this young man. \nLike millions of African Americans, John Lewis was haunted by the \nimage. He told a Washington Post reporter recently: I remember thinking \nit can happen to anyone, me or my brothers or my cousins. It created a \nsense of fear that it could happen to anyone who got out of line.\n  Those images of Emmett Till inspired more than fear. In many people, \nthey inspired courage and resolve. There was a decision made by so many \nat every level of life in America to no longer ever tolerate the brutal \ninhumanity of hatred and racism of Jim Crow laws. When Rosa Parks, the \nlegendary civil rights leader, refused to give up her seat on that bus \nin Montgomery, AL, it was 100 days after Emmett Till's murder. She \nsaid, when asked later: How did you show the strength to do that, stand \nup against everybody and say, no, I will not sit in the back of the \nbus, she said she got her courage by thinking of that young man, Emmett \nTill.\n\n  Eight years later, in a song entitled ``The Murder of Emmett Till,'' \nthe great poet/songwriter Bob Dylan had the following lyrics:\n\n     If you can't speak out against this kind of thing,\n     a crime that's so unjust,\n     your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt,\n     your mind is filled with dust.\n\n  Today, 50 years after Emmett Till's brutal murder, the Senate will \nformally and officially offer apologies to not just the families of \nEmmett Till but the nearly 4,800 other Americans who died at the hands \nof lynch mobs in our country, in this great Nation of America, between \n1882 and 1968. We offer our apologies as well to the countless millions \nof Americans who were forced to live with the fear that they could be \nthe next victim.\n  Emmett Till's cousin, Simeon Wright, was lying next to Emmett the \nnight he was kidnapped and lynched. Simeon Wright is with us today. \nDoria Johnson, from Evanston, IL, also is with us today. Her \ngrandfather, Anthony Crawford, was lynched by a White mob in Abbeville, \nSC, in 1916. He was beaten, hanged, and shot more than 200 times. What \nkind of offense would merit that kind of punishment? What had Anthony \nCrawford done? Anthony Crawford, in 1916, in South Carolina, a Black \nman, got into an argument with a White man over the price of cotton \nseed at a store.\n  To them and to all who lost a loved one to lynching and to those who \nlost a piece of their own childhood and their own sense of security, we \nsay today formally and officially in the Senate that we were wrong--\nwrong for failing to protect them, wrong because we never said we were \nsorry.\n  The murders of Emmett Till and Anthony Crawford are among those \ndocumented in a groundbreaking book and museum exhibit called ``Without \nSanctuary: Lynching Photography in America.'' The exhibit has traveled \nall over the United States and opened just last week at the Chicago \nHistorical Society.\n  Mr. President, just a few days ago, the Chicago Sun-Times did an \neditorial on this issue of lynching and this exhibit. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, June 12, 2005]\n\n         Exhibit of Lynching Photos Shows Evil we Must Remember\n\n       The Chicago Historical Society's ``Without Sanctuary: \n     Lynching Photography In America'' seems an unlikely \n     exhibition to launch in a Northern city. But the link between \n     Chicago and ``murder by a mob of an individual outside the \n     confines of the legal system,'' a definition that comes \n     halfway through the exhibit, is long-standing. It has been 50 \n     years since Chicagoan Emmett Till was lynched in Mississippi. \n     That case is still with us.\n       Till's murder, for allegedly whistling at a white woman, \n     shocked an entire nation and sparked the civil rights \n     movement in the North, but lynching had gone on for decades. \n     Journalist Ida Wells-Barnett was crusading against it in 1892 \n     when three successful black businessmen were lynched. Through \n     her fearless reporting, Barnett established that lynching was \n     not the white man's response to a black man's abuse of white \n     women, but that most lynchings were caused by ``economic \n     competition and racial hatred.''\n       In 1893, Barnett stood outside the Chicago World's Fair and \n     protested the exclusion of African Americans, while handing \n     out copies of her pamphlet: ``Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in \n     All Its Phases.'' Still, except for protest art such as \n     Claude McKay's ``The Lynching'' and Billie Holiday's \n     ``Strange Fruit,'' the sadistic killing of black Americans \n     has mostly been hidden from America's mainstream.\n       The Chicago Historical Society's exhibit will change that. \n     And it strikes us as fitting that photographs and documents, \n     many of which are on loan from private collections, have \n     ended up here. Although the re-opening of the Till murder \n     case has sparked new interest in this subject, many young \n     Chicagoans probably do not know how widespread this crime was \n     or that it occurred outside of the South in places such as \n     Downstate Cairo.\n       ``No part of the nation was immune,'' as the exhibit \n     recalls with a quotation from W.E.B. Du Bois. ``We must \n     remember because if the world forgets evil, evil is reborn.''\n       The 53 images of lynchings that took place between 1870 and \n     1961 constitute a shocking testament to America's shame. The \n     lynching exhibition runs through Dec. 4. Don't miss it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this editorial from the Chicago Sun-Times \nurges people to attend the exhibit and notes that ``many young \nChicagoans probably do not know how widespread this crime was or that \nit occurred outside of the South in places such as\n\n[[Page S6379]]\n\ndownstate Cairo,'' IL. That is an important point. Lynching was not \njust a southern shame, it was an American shame. While most lynchings \noccurred in the South, they also happened in the North.\n  I commend Senators Mary Landrieu and George Allen for authoring this \nresolution and working so hard to have the Senate take it up and right \nthis historical wrong. It is my hope the Senate will match the words of \nthis resolution with action. It is not enough to apologize for the \nfailure of our predecessors to protect their fellow citizens from \nviolent prejudice. We have a responsibility to protect those who are \ntargets of today's hate crimes as well. Senator Ted Kennedy, a \nDemocrat, and Senator Gordon Smith, a Republican, have been trying for \nyears to persuade Congress to pass a new, stronger Federal hate crimes \nbill. Year after year, they have met with resistance.\n  Listen to the arguments of those who oppose a stronger hate crimes \nbill today, and you hear the same arguments that were made against a \nFederal antilynching bill decades ago. The names have changed, the \narguments and the excuses are the same.\n  They say we in Congress cannot pass a strong hate crimes bill because \nit will infringe on States rights or because the Constitution does not \ngive Congress explicit authority to pass such a law.\n  Listen to what a Member of the House of Representatives, James Woods \nof Virginia, said in 1922:\n\n       This bill, commonly known as the ``anti-lynching bill'' \n     would be described more accurately if designated--from the \n     standpoint of its effects rather than from its purpose--as a \n     ``bill to override the Constitution of the United States, to \n     foment race hatred, and to revive sectional animosity.'' If \n     it were possible to put an end to lynching by a lawful act of \n     Congress, none would support such legislation more earnestly \n     than we of the South.\n\n  The Constitution does not say anything explicitly about the Civil \nRights Act, which the Senate passed 41 years ago, or the Voting Rights \nAct, which turns 40 today. There always will be political voices that \nwill find excuses to delay acting on the moral challenges of our time.\n  Finding the moral courage to deal with those challenges in our own \ntime is the real test of leadership. What is it we are doing or failing \nto do today that would lead the Senate 50 years from now to apologize? \nThat is the question.\n  I hope Congress will pass the Kennedy-Smith hate crimes bill as \ntangible proof to the victims of lynching that we will never again \nwithhold our protection when Americans are persecuted and killed simply \nfor being who they are.\n  When Mamie Till put her son on that train for Mississippi, he was \nwearing a watch he had been given by his father before his father died. \nThe hands on that watch stopped when Emmitt Till was tortured and \nmurdered.\n  Much has changed in the 50 years since Emmitt Till died, but some \nsmall part of America's soul has always remained frozen in that time \nbecause of our failure to formally acknowledge that what happened was \nwrong. By apologizing to the victims of lynching--and by having the \ncourage to protect the victims of hate crimes today--we can reclaim \nthat piece of our soul and move forward in time as one Nation \nindivisible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the opportunity has finally come to make \nthe record right--to begin to balance what has been an imbalance. We \nhave come to this floor to apologize for the silence of the U.S. Senate \nregarding the lynching of our fellow Americans, primarily African \nAmericans.\n  Tonight, we begin to redress the lynching madness that swept our \ncountry from the 1880s and which continued unchecked through the 1950s, \nand even as recently as the 1960s. It is estimated that nearly 5,000 \nAmericans were lynched during this time. African Americans were strung \nup from trees, burned at the stake, mutilated in the town square for \nall to see. Those who committed such atrocities went without \npunishment. Justice was not only denied, it was ignored, abdicated, and \noverthrown.\n  The victims were not just those who were killed. A lynching is not \nonly a heinous and savage act against one person; it is an act of \nviolence against the rights of an entire community. Its victims are \neveryone who hears its hateful message.\n  Ida B. Wells-Barnett explained well the nature of lynching in \nAmerica. Born in Mississippi a few months before the signing of the \nEmancipation Proclamation, Ida Wells-Barnett was the editor and co-\nowner of a Black newspaper called ``The Free Speech and Headlight.'' In \n1900, she wrote:\n\n       Our country's national crime is lynching. It is not the \n     creature of an hour, the sudden outburst of uncontrolled \n     fury, or the unspeakable brutality of an insane mob. It \n     represents the cool, calculating deliberation of intelligent \n     people who openly avow that there is an ``unwritten law'' \n     that justifies them in putting human beings to death without \n     complaint under oath, without trial by jury, without \n     opportunity to make defense, and without right of appeal.\n\n  Lynching was an attack on the rule of law itself, and yet the U.S. \nSenate did not act against it. Antilynching legislation was called for \nby seven U.S. Presidents. The House of Representatives passed three \nantilynching bills. This body passed none, though many were introduced.\n  In 1935, Senator Edward Costigan spoke in favor of an antilynching \nbill he had introduced with Senator Robert Wagner. Having made a \ncareful yet passionate argument for his proposed legislation, Senator \nCostigan concluded:\n\n       If one can mention, much less picture such appalling facts \n     as I have recited without being revolted, he is indeed \n     hardened out of all semblance to humanity. They destroy our \n     claim to civilized life. They must not be permitted to \n     multiply. Every repetition of mob brutality denies its \n     victims the right of speedy and impartial trial and the equal \n     protection of laws guaranteed by the Constitution. No man can \n     be permitted to usurp the combined functions of judge, jury, \n     and executioner of his fellow men; and whenever any state \n     fails to protect such equal rights, I submit that the federal \n     government must do its utmost to repair the damage which is \n     then chargeable to us all.\n\n  Faced with both the opportunity and the responsibility to act, the \nSenate simply failed. That failure is a permanent stain on this body, \nand we are not trying to wipe it away. We only hope that acknowledging \nit will allow for some national healing.\n  To the families of victims of lynching who sit in the Senate Gallery \ntonight, let me offer my personal sorrow over the injustice you have \nsuffered. I hope our action today will bring you some comfort, though \nit cannot ease your loss.\n  As the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, I also want to \nsay a special word about the members of the American Armed Forces who \nwere lynched in the country they had defended. Following both World War \nI and World War II, returning soldiers were lynched, many while still \nwearing their military uniforms. It is difficult to imagine a more \nunjust situation. There would be no new respect for these brave African \nAmericans who had fought for our country, only the old order of \ninjustice and hate.\n  Mr. President, it is easy for the Senate to apologize now. This is \nnot a tough decision, only a somber one. But there are still tough \ndecisions ahead. While we cannot bring justice to those who were \nlynched, we can continue to bring about the just society that was \nmocked and shredded by acts of lynching.\n  In that spirit, I hope that today is part of a larger effort toward \nracial reconciliation and justice. We can continue by honoring the \nTuskegee Airmen with the Congressional Gold Medal for their \ncontributions to our Nation's defense and to its progress, as proposed \nin bipartisan legislation, S. 392, introduced on February 16, 2005. And \nwe can make progress on so many vital issues--education, health care, \njobs--that would improve the lives of African Americans and all \nAmericans. We have moved past lynching, but we have not reached \njustice. I hope we will not fail to act.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my able colleagues, Senator Mary \nLandrieu and Senator George Allen, for their diligence and leadership \nin bringing this healing resolution, which I was pleased to cosponsor, \nbefore the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthis important resolution. I commend my friends and colleagues, Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Allen, for their leadership on this important \nissue.\n  It is difficult to address this subject without noting the shameful \nrecord of Senate inaction on the issue of lynching. As noted in the \ntext of the resolution, 4,742 people were lynched in the\n\n[[Page S6380]]\n\nUnited States between 1882 and 1968. During that time, 7 U.S. \nPresidents pushed for Congressional action on what had succeeded \nslavery as the ultimate expression of racism. Between 1920 and 1940, \nthe House of Representatives passed strong antilynching measures on \nthree different occasions. Sadly, the Senate failed to do its duty to \nenable antilynching legislation to be enacted, thus allowing this \ndespicable, murderous practice to continue.\n  This Senate Resolution is long, long overdue. As we all know, the \nSenate has a basic Federal responsibility to provide protection to \nthose in need. While our predecessors failed in that regard, we have an \nopportunity today to begin healing the wounds that this body's failures \nhave inflicted upon the African American community for so many years.\n  The apology we issue today comes too late for the thousands of \nAmericans brutally slain in this abhorrent manner. Hopefully, by our \nacknowledgment of wrongdoing, and our sincere apology, we can bring \nsome solace to the family members who still recall--all too vividly--\nthe horror of having a loved one murdered by lynching.\n  We must never forget the thousands of men, women and children who \nwere deprived of life, human dignity, and the Constitutional \nprotections that are to be accorded all U.S. citizens, We have a \nresponsibility--to all Americans--to ensure that the tragedy of \nlynching, and this body's failure to address it, will neither be \nforgotten, nor repeated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in condemning the \nshameful role of lynching in the Nation's history and the decades of \nrefusal by the Nation, especially the United States Senate, to act \nagainst it. I commend my colleagues Senator Landrieu of Louisiana and \nSenator Allen of Virginia for bringing this important issue before the \nSenate floor and taking this long overdue action. And I thank the \nfamily members of the victims of lynching, many of whom traveled great \ndistances to be here today.\n  The history of lynching is a stain on the Nation's past. Over 4,700 \npersons were lynched in the United States from the 1880s to the 1960s.\n  These lynchings involved acts of unspeakable cruelty. Many victims \nwere shot, burned or hanged. Some of the victims were accused of \ncriminal offenses, while others were attacked because of something they \nsaid or because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n  The vast majority of victims were African Americans who were killed \nsolely because of their race. In the year 1892 alone, 230 persons were \nlynched--at least one victim every other day. We must never forget that \ninjustice. Many whites also fell victim to this brutality, singled out \nfor their religion or ethnicity, their refusal to accept the racial \nhierarchy, or other reasons.\n  Lynching was devastating to African American communities. It struck \nfear into the hearts and minds of African Americans, who knew they \ncould be killed at any time for the most trivial of offenses or for no \noffense at all.\n  Year after year, the Federal Government and State and local \ngovernments failed to respond effectively to the danger. The \nperpetrators had little reason to fear that they would be prosecuted or \nconvicted. In some cases, scheduled lynchings were announced in \nnewspapers beforehand, demonstrating the unwillingness of local law \nenforcement to intervene. Photos of lynchings show onlookers grinning \nat the camera. The failure of local authorities to prevent these \natrocities dehumanized, demoralized, and terrorized black Americans.\n  When the 370,000 African-American soldiers who served in World War I \nreturned home, many believed that they had earned the equality they had \npreviously been denied. Their hopes soon turned to frustration, as the \ndiscrimination of the pre-war years was renewed and reinvigorated. Even \nnewly discharged soldiers were lynched, still wearing their uniforms.\n  Lynching was more than isolated acts of brutality. It was vigilante \nmob murder that became systemic, ritualized and condoned by a racist \nsociety. It became a cruel weapon of white supremacy which took the \nlives of many African Americans and terrorized whole communities. Along \nwith Jim Crow laws, segregated schools and dismal lack of property \nrights, lynching was used as an organized weapon of oppression that \ndenied the fundamental rights of tens of millions of African Americans. \nAs W.E.B. DuBois stated, the things that ``the white South feared more \nthan Negro dishonesty, ignorance and incompetency, [were] Negro \nhonesty, knowledge, and efficiency.'' Lynching was part of an organized \nattempt to oppress African-American communities and exclude them from \nthe American dream.\n  In 1900, African-American Congressman George White introduced the \nfirst antilynching bill, only to see it die in committee. Brave men and \nwomen like Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. DuBois, and others in the NAACP, \nlobbied tirelessly for Federal antilynching legislation in the first \nhalf of the twentieth century. Their efforts succeeded in the House of \nRepresentatives, which passed such legislation three times between 1922 \nand 1940. Each time, however, the legislation died in the Senate.\n  In 1945, President Truman proposed a new antilynching bill, to make \nlynching a crime under Federal law. His proposal never made it out of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  We cannot undo the Senate's past failures to act against lynching. \nBut we can and must do all we can to erase its bitter legacy.\n  Today, there is strong need to strengthen laws against hate crimes \nand other violence motivated by bigotry. As the Supreme Court has \nstated, bias-motivated violence is ``more likely to provoke retaliatory \ncrimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and incite \ncommunity unrest.'' Like acts of terrorism, hate crimes have an impact \nfar greater than the impact suffered by individual victims; they are \ncrimes against entire communities and against the whole Nation. Whether \nbased on prejudice against the victim's race, religion, ethnic \nbackground, gender, disability, or sexual orientation, hate crimes are \nmodern-day lynchings which threaten not just individuals, but our \nentire social and political order.\n\n  My colleague, Senator Smith and I have introduced bipartisan \nlegislation to strengthen our laws against hate crimes, and I urge all \nof our colleagues to support it. That bill passed the Senate last year \nand died in the House. We will not give up until it becomes law.\n  As each of us knows, the past has consequences for the present, and \npast acts of lynching over many decades contributed substantially to \nthe disparities between African American and Whites. We cannot undo \nthat history, but if we are sincere in our apology today, we must match \nour words with deeds and work harder together to close the gaps.\n  At the beginning of this year, members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus put forward a plan for doing so, and we should work to implement \nit as one of the most important issues before us in this Congress.\n  We need to do more to ensure the job security of African Americans, \nwhose unemployment rate is 10.1 percent--almost double the national \naverage and more than double the unemployment rate of Whites.\n  Thirty-four percent of African American children live in poverty, \nnearly double the national average. We know that education is the key \nto opportunity and a better life, and we should be doing more to \nimprove education at every level. We need to do more to help the \nyoungest children in American--and the earlier, the better. Head Start \nhas a 30-year track record of achievement in preparing children for \nkindergarten. It makes an enormous difference for 300,000 young African \nAmerican children.\n  We must meet our promise of fully funding the No Child Left Behind \nAct. The President's proposed budget shortchanges elementary education \nunder the Act by $12 billion--for a total deficit of $39 billion since \nthe school reform law was first enacted. The No Child Left Behind Act \nis already leaving 3 million children behind.\n  In fact, the President's proposed budget contains the first absolute \nreduction for education in a decade. It has a cumulative cut of $40 \nbillion for education over the next 5 years. One out of every three \nprograms eliminated by the President is a program in the Department of \nEducation.\n  We should also be doing more to fund opportunities for college. We \nknow that African Americans are only half as likely as Whites to earn a \ncollege\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\ndegree. The current annual unmet need of a typical undergraduate now \naverages $5,800. It is more important than ever to increase grant aid. \nYet the Bush administration has proposed only a $500 increase in the \nmaximum Pell grant this year.\n  The budget also reduces a number of important programs to help \nAfrican Americans, while preserving tax cuts for the rich and powerful. \nIt proposes a 5-year freeze on child care funding, which will reduce \nthe number of low-income children receiving this assistance by 300,000 \nin 2009. The budget also cuts $10 billion over 5 years from Medicaid, \nthe program that provides basic health care for the poor.\n  As we review our legislative priorities, we cannot forget that we \nhave a special duty to address the malignant disparities created by \nlong-standing racial bigotry in this country--of which lynching was the \nmost vicious example but far from the only example.\n  It's fitting that we enact this apology today, the first day of the \nlong overdue trial for the brutal lynching of civil rights workers \nJames Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner in 1964. Those \nmurders, 41 years ago this month, took the lives of three young men \nwhose only offense was attempting to register African Americans to vote \nin Mississippi, and it shows how deeply rooted racial violence once was \nin American life. All of us hope that the prosecution now taking place \nin that case, like the Senate apology today, can begin to heal these \nbitter wounds of injustice that the nation still feels because of the \nsordid legacy of lynching.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve the great \ngoal of genuine equal opportunity for all our citizens. May the passage \nof this resolution mark a new beginning of race relations in America.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to clarify the record concerning my \nsupport for the resolution before us today.\n  I chose to cosponsor this resolution because of my abhorrence for the \ncrime of lynching. I have been told that the passage of this resolution \nwill enable people whose families were affected by this terrible crime \nto resolve their frustration that Government authorities did not do \nmore to stop it. If this resolution helps people deal with the past so \nthat they can move on to the future, it is a worthwhile statement to \nmake.\n  Having said that, I am aware of concerns that have been raised about \npossible ``next steps'' based on the Senate's action on S. Res. 39. Let \nme just say that this resolution should not be interpreted--at least so \nfar as this Senator is concerned--as any kind of an endorsement for \nsome claim of compensation based on any action or inaction of the \nFederal Government.\n  In fact, what brings me to the floor is a concern that the actions of \na particular Senator long ago may be subjected to unfair, revisionist \ncriticism from our perspective today. The Senator in question is my \npredecessor, known as ``the Lion of Idaho,'' William Borah.\n  Senator Borah was one of the leaders of the Senate in blocking \nconsideration of the anti-lynching legislation. I think it is important \nfor the record to show that whatever motives others may have had at the \ntime for blocking this legislation, William Borah offered convincing \njustifications for his position rooted in serious constitutional and \npolicy concerns.\n  This is the conclusion I have drawn from considerable historical \nresearch of the debates of the time, which has been condensed into a \nreport by a talented law student, David Palmer, who served as my law \nclerk earlier this year. I am going to ask that this report be printed \nin the Record so that all my colleagues can review it. It is an \nabsorbing read, and I think it supports the conclusion that Senator \nBorah made a principled stand at the time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the report of David Palmer concerning \nWilliam Borah's arguments against Senate action be printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: Senator Craig\n     Fr: David Palmer\n     Re: William Borah's arguments against Senate anti-lynching \n         bills in the 1920's & 1930's\n       William Borah spoke out in opposition to the anti-lynching \n     bills presented to the Senate on several occasions during the \n     1920s and 1930s. He did this primarily for two reasons: \n     first, Senator Borah felt that such a bill represented an \n     unconstitutional exercise of federal rights in the realm of \n     criminal law (an area which had previously been reserved for \n     the states); second--to a lesser degree--Senator Borah argued \n     that even if such a bill were constitutional, it would be an \n     ineffective law meant largely to penalize the South. \n     Combining these rationales, and noting that lynching was a \n     relatively infrequent crime of increasing rarity with each \n     passing year, he argued that the tremendous costs to state \n     sovereignty through federal intrusion in this matter would be \n     much more dangerous to the good of all than any uncertain \n     benefits that might come through passing such a bill. In \n     short, Senator Borah was not a racist; rather, he was a man \n     of deep commitment to this nation's federalist system, and \n     this memo will present his respective constitutional and \n     policy arguments against the anti-lynching bills of his day.\n\n 1. William Borah's Constitutional Arguments Against the Anti-Lynching \n                                 Bills\n\n       Senator Borah felt that there were a number of \n     constitutional infirmities with the anti-lynching bills he \n     faced, although they all revolved around his firm belief in \n     states' rights as a centerpiece of the entire government. His \n     constitutional problems with the various anti-lynching bills, \n     as well as his reasons for championing state sovereignty so \n     strongly, are detailed below.\n\n\nA. Borah: The Fourteenth Amendment Is Not An Acceptable Constitutional \n                     Basis For Anti-Lynching Bills\n\n       To put Senator Borah's arguments in context, the proponents \n     of the anti-lynching bills typically based their opinion that \n     such bills were constitutional on two grounds: first, that \n     the Federal Government must guarantee a republican form of \n     government to all citizens; second, that the 14th Amendment's \n     equal protection clause allowed for federal action in the \n     face of state failure to prosecute lynchings. 79 Congo Rec. \n     6, 6524 (1935). Borah felt that the first point was ``utterly \n     irrelevant'' (id.), and apparently so did his debating \n     opponents, as almost all the constitutional debates Borah \n     participated in dealt with aspects of the 14th Amendment.\n       Regarding the 14th Amendment, Borah consistently argued \n     that any attempt to apply the amendment to the actions of \n     individuals by the Federal Government should be rejected, as \n     the amendment's framers specifically rejected this idea. Id. \n     at 6362. The anti-lynching bills invariably allowed the \n     Federal Government to step in at some point to prosecute the \n     perpetrators of a lynching if a state had not done its law-\n     enforcement job, thus mandating federal intrusion into law \n     enforcement against individual action which was not \n     undertaken by the states. Borah argued that this simply \n     cannot be justified under the 14th Amendment, as such a \n     capacity for law enforcement by the Federal Government \n     (against individuals not acting as official representatives \n     of a state) was explicitly rejected by those who originally \n     passed the 14th Amendment. Id.\n       In a later debate (in 1937), Borah similarly argued that \n     the 14th Amendment contains no clause whatsoever allowing the \n     Federal Government to go into a state and establish civil \n     liability for damages between citizens of the state, or \n     between citizens and a subdivision of a state (as would have \n     been allowed in that year's bill). He further argued that \n     this anti-lynching bill was such a new proposition--\n     constitutionally speaking--that the people of the United \n     States should be consulted in the form of passing this bill \n     as a constitutional amendment. Borah feared that it would \n     ultimately result in the ``elimination of the states.'' 81 \n     Congr. Rec. 8,8746-8 (1937).\n       Additionally, Borah argued that if our nation were really \n     concerned about the equal protection of the law being \n     enforced where it is needed, then the 1937 bill should not \n     have exempted violence due to ``gangsterism'' and \n     racketeering. This was the area in which he felt that most \n     states had truly failed to enforce the law. Instead, the \n     exemption reinforced in Senator Borah's mind that the anti-\n     lynching bill was really a sectional bill aimed at punishing \n     the south while exempting the northern states for their own \n     law enforcement failures. Id. at 8753.\n       Finally, in 1938 Senator Borah cited several Supreme Court \n     cases for the proposition that the 14th Amendment was not \n     designed to transfer any power from the states to the Federal \n     Government for protecting the lives, liberty and property of \n     a particular state's citizens. 83 Congr. Rec. 2, 1492 (1938). \n     Borah concluded his 14th Amendment arguments by stating that \n     the only way a state could be liable under that amendment--in \n     this area of the law--is if it were to not pass laws \n     protecting its citizens from lynching. Id. at 1495. Because \n     the states had done that, and given that the framers of the \n     14th Amendment (and the Supreme Court) had rejected the idea \n     that the amendment transferred any power to the Federal \n     Government for enforcing the criminal law, Senator Borah \n     strongly opposed using the 14th Amendment as a basis for the \n     antilynching bills.\n\n\n   B. Borah: McCulloch v. Maryland Precludes the Anti-Lynching Bills\n\n       Senator Borah attacked the 1938 anti-lynching bill on an \n     additional ground: it would have allowed the Federal \n     Government to bring suit on behalf of an individual\n\n[[Page S6382]]\n\n     against a division of a state (a county) if the officials of \n     the division had not enforced anti-lynching laws. Borah noted \n     that this ability for one sovereign to bring suit against \n     another sovereign was precluded by a continuous line of \n     Supreme Court cases beginning in 1819 with McCulloch v. \n     Maryland, 17 U.S.316. Id. at 1490.\n       Senator Borah began this argument by pointing out that \n     McCulloch held the ability of one sovereign to tax another is \n     the ability to destroy it, and this therefore is not \n     constitutionally permissible. He further argued that the \n     ability of one sovereign to bring suit against another is an \n     equivalent power, and therefore it is unconstitutional on \n     that ground as well. Finally, in response to another \n     senator's argument, Borah went through a detailed list of how \n     the Supreme Court had repeatedly issued decisions \n     supporting his view (even in the cases decided since the \n     passage of the 14th Amendment). Id. at 1491.\n       There are three key points Borah made in support of this \n     McCulloch argument. First, he pointed out that the anti-\n     lynching bill would have allowed the Federal Government to \n     sue counties on behalf of individuals, and these suits \n     against counties would constitute direct interference by the \n     Federal Government with the power of states over their \n     counties. Numerous Supreme Court decisions have disallowed \n     such actions because of their impingement on state \n     sovereignty. Id. at 1492.\n       Second, Borah argued that suing counties was the same thing \n     as suing states (an idea supported by numerous Supreme Court \n     decisions), and states could never consent to be sued by \n     another sovereign (at most they could consent to be sued by \n     their citizens). Id. at 1493.\n       Last, he argued that states cannot be found liable for the \n     actions of their employees when those employees are not \n     acting in an official capacity. As states already had anti-\n     lynching laws on their books, Borah argued that any lack of \n     enforcement by state officials of those state laws indicated \n     that county officials were not acting in an official capacity \n     during the dereliction of their responsibilities. Therefore, \n     to allow the Federal Government to take action against those \n     officials would be to allow the government to sue the states \n     (through their counties) in situations where no official \n     state conduct had occurred. 83 Congr. Rec. 1, 141 (1938). \n     This, Borah argued (citing several Supreme Court decisions \n     for this proposition), is constitutionally impermissible. 83 \n     Congr. Rec. 2, 1494 (1938).\n\n\n           C. Borah's Miscellaneous Constitutional Arguments\n\n       In addition to the constitutional arguments already \n     discussed, William Borah included two other, albeit less-\n     emphasized, legal objections to the anti-lynching bills in \n     his speeches. One such argument was an objection to the \n     trigger of Federal intervention under these bills: when only \n     one man committed a lynching, it did not allow Federal \n     jurisdiction; rather, it required the actions of a group of \n     people, and thus ``the Constitution is being made subject to \n     construction in accordance with the number of persons present \n     when the crime takes place.'' 79 Congr. Rec. 6, 6677 (1935). \n     Borah concluded this argument by saying that the act should \n     be rejected because ``we certainly have not one Constitution \n     for a half dozen and another Constitution for an \n     individual.'' Id. at 6504.\n       Another point that Borah made regarding the \n     constitutionality of the anti-lynching bills dovetails with \n     his McCulloch arguments. He posed a question on the floor \n     which implied that the particular anti-lynching bill before \n     the Senate would create a cause of action for an individual \n     against a county (and therefore a state), thus allowing an \n     individual to sue a state--which is explicitly barred by the \n     11th Amendment. 83 Congr. Rec. 1, 965 (1938). While the \n     senator to whom Borah asked this question replied that the \n     suit technically was to be brought in the name of the United \n     States Government on behalf of an individual, it is clear \n     that this question was designed to cover Senator Borah's \n     bases. In other words, if the suit was undertaken by the \n     United States against a state, then the McCulloch reasoning \n     would apply to make it unconstitutional; alternatively, if \n     the action was undertaken by an individual, the 11th \n     Amendment would apply. In either case the act would be \n     unconstitutional.\n\n\n   D. Borah: The Anti-Lynching Bills Would Destroy Essential States' \n                                 Rights\n\n       Near the conclusion of William Borah's final speech \n     regarding the anti-lynching bills, he summarized his position \n     by stating that his only interest in opposing these bills was \n     in preserving the integrity of the State. To him, the state \n     was and remained ``the fountain source of the people's power \n     in the Government; and when that is destroyed, democratic \n     government is at an end.'' 83 Congr. Rec. 2, 1496 (1938). \n     Racism did not enter that consideration, as his words and \n     actions reveal a man of great devotion to the ideals of our \n     federal system. Moreover, given the complete lack of a \n     constitutional basis for any federal anti-lynching law, Borah \n     felt that such a measure would constitute a naked intrusion \n     by the Federal Government into state sovereignty. \n     Furthermore, while Senator Borah repeatedly said that he had \n     great respect for what the senators backing the anti-lynching \n     bills were trying to do, he also could not allow any such \n     bill to pass out of the Senate in order to have its \n     constitutionality ruled on by the Supreme Court (as several \n     senators had suggested as a course of action) without \n     ``stultifying'' his own convictions. 79 Congr. Rec. 6, 6673-4 \n     (1935). If the law were to be somehow found constitutional \n     under an increasingly activist court, Borah felt that through \n     this bill the Congress would ``have utterly annihilated all \n     State sovereignty.'' Id. This was a possibility he could \n     never support.\n       A primary reason Senator Borah so passionately opposed the \n     anti-lynching bills was that allowing federal intrusion \n     through those bills would create a principle of law that he \n     felt would justify further intrusion in almost unlimited \n     circumstances. While supporters of such bills could argue \n     that the legislation only allowed federal intrusion under \n     limited circumstances, the legal principle of the matter was \n     of supreme importance to William Borah. He stated ``[i]f the \n     Federal Government can send a United States marshal into the \n     State of Tennessee to arrest a sheriff because he has failed \n     to protect a colored man from violence, it can, under the \n     same principle, send a United States marshal into the State \n     of New York to arrest a sheriff, or other officer on whom the \n     duty is imposed, because he neglected to protect the life of \n     a citizen against the violence of thugs.'' 83 Congr. Rec. 1, \n     141 (1938). Therefore, while an anti-lynching bill might only \n     take a limited amount of power from the states in the short-\n     term, Senator Borah was a man who looked at the long-term \n     future; he saw that any such bill such held grave \n     implications for the sovereignty of states. Along these \n     lines, he also argued that allowing this level of federal \n     intrusion would indicate the complete displacement of our \n     nation's federalist system. After all, if a state could not \n     be entrusted exclusively to enforce its own laws, then he \n     felt there was no such thing as local government. Id.\n       Additionally, Senator Borah included in his speeches some \n     powerful language as to why he felt so strongly about \n     protecting states' rights. In one speech, he explained that \n     the experiences uniquely gained in local government shaped \n     the political views of the founders of this nation. 83 Congr. \n     Rec. 2, 1496 (1938). In another debate, he explained that \n     in 1922 he opposed, in committee, the Dyer anti-lynching \n     bill in part because he was convinced that it is not sound \n     national policy ``to remove responsibility from the \n     different local governments of the communities for the \n     enforcement of the law. In the long run that results in \n     breaking down all sense of duty upon the part of the \n     citizen.'' 79 Congr. Rec. 6, 6673-74 (1935).\n       Moreover, this opposition to encroaching federal power is \n     consistent with Senator Borah's views on other New Deal \n     legislation as detracting from state sovereignty. Regarding \n     such legislation he went on record as stating that ``we can \n     only have a great Federal Union by having great individual \n     sovereign States.'' Id. Concerning all of these measures \n     (including the anti-lynching bill), Borah expressed his \n     heartfelt feeling that ``there is nothing in all the realm of \n     government more essential to the happiness and well-being of \n     the American people than the right of local self-\n     government,'' and the increased power by the Federal \n     Government constituted an ever-growing threat to this \n     happiness and well-being. Id.\n       In sum, Senator Borah felt that states necessarily had to \n     retain their sovereign powers to make this union a great one. \n     Any detraction from that power, particularly one with such \n     far-reaching principles for federal intrusion as would be \n     created under this bill, would be devastating to our federal \n     system. Given the complete lack of constitutional support for \n     such a bill in his eyes, William Borah could not in good \n     conscience allow any of the anti-lynching bills to leave the \n     Senate and potentially destroy the sovereignty of the states \n     under an overreaching Supreme Court. Senator Borah was a deep \n     believer in states' rights, his words and actions \n     consistently supported that view, and to ascribe racism to \n     him as a motivation is to both blatantly ignore the \n     historical record as well as demean a man who dedicated his \n     Senate service to furthering the form of government that \n     would provide the greatest good for Americans of all races. \n     As the Senator himself put it (in reference to the final \n     anti-lynching bill put before him): ``[t]his, Mr. President, \n     is another compromise with a vital principle of our dual \n     system of government. It is bartering with the future for the \n     supposed and transient demands of the present, and at a time \n     when the present is taking care of the problem. It is another \n     instance in which our confidence in our scheme of government \n     is not strong enough to say to all races, all creeds, all \n     groups, and all factions: Your problems, however serious, are \n     subordinate to the principles of this Government, and you \n     must work them out within the compass of the long-tested and \n     well-accepted principles of democracy.'' 83 Congr. Rec. 1, \n     143 (1938).\n\n  II. William Borah's Policy Arguments Against the Anti-Lynching Bills\n\n       Although Senator Borah's opposition to the anti-lynching \n     bills was primarily based on his belief that such legislation \n     represented an unconstitutional infringement on states' \n     rights, he also opposed the bills as poor policies. In his \n     view, even if such bills were constitutional, they would \n     merely result in an ineffective law that would destructively \n     penalize the South. Given that lynching was declining each \n     year as a crime, Borah believed that instituting an \n     ineffective--and potentially damaging--bill to stop\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\n     a disappearing crime was simply not worth the price to be \n     paid in greatly eroded state sovereignty. This section will \n     detail William Borah's beliefs that creating federal anti-\n     lynching laws would be poor national policy--even if they \n     were somehow deemed constitutional.\n\n\n  a. borah: the anti-lynching bills are potentially harmful sectional \n                                measures\n\n       In an extended speech given in 1938, Senator Borah assumed, \n     for purposes of arguing the wisdom of adopting such a policy, \n     that the anti-lynching bill before the Senate was \n     constitutional. He then attacked the potential law on several \n     grounds, beginning with his belief that the bill was nothing \n     more than a sectional measure aimed at the South. 83 Congr. \n     Rec. 1, 138-9 (1938). By sectional measure, Borah meant that \n     he believed this legislative measure to be based on the same \n     idea that inspired so much of northern policy towards the \n     South during Reconstruction: a desire to punish the area \n     because the southerners were incapable of self-government. \n     Id. Although the senator did not offer in his 1938 speech a \n     great amount of evidence as to why this was a sectional \n     measure, it seems clear from his earlier speeches regarding \n     the exception of ``gangsterism'' from prosecution that he \n     felt anti-lynching legislation was aimed at a crime primarily \n     occurring in the South while simultaneously exempting \n     northern cities and states from their own law enforcement \n     failures.\n       Senator Borah further explained that a measure aimed at the \n     South would be both undeserved by the region and potentially \n     harmful to the nation. He felt that the South had dealt as \n     well as could possibly be expected with its ``race problem'' \n     in the 70 years since the Civil War, and this was in part \n     evidenced both by the economic progress of southern blacks as \n     well as the lower per capita arrest rate by southern blacks \n     (as compared to northern blacks). He finally stated his \n     belief that nations are held together by more than just laws; \n     mutual respect, confidence and tolerance from one part of the \n     country to another is essential too. Borah feared that \n     passing such a sectional bill would arouse old problems in \n     the south that could potentially disrupt national unity. Id.\n\n\n         b. borah: the anti-lynching bills will be ineffective\n\n       Another policy argument that Senator Borah advanced against \n     anti-lynching legislation was that it would be ineffective. \n     He first stated this belief in the Congressional Record in \n     1935 when he argued that the legislation would be useless \n     because lynching can only be effectively prevented by \n     educating people. 79 Congr. Rec. 6, 6674 (1935). Borah \n     reiterated that same argument in 1938, when he stated that \n     educating both races ``to understand their responsibility to \n     society'' would be the best way to end lynching, and he also \n     noted that such education was underway in the South. 83 \n     Congr. Rec. 1, 139 (1938).\n       Additionally, Borah argued that the actual enforcement of \n     the federal law would be ineffectual for two reasons. First, \n     he pointed out that the Federal Government is simply \n     incapable of enforcing criminal law; he cited the federally-\n     controlled District of Columbia and its extraordinary murder \n     and crime rate as his primary example of this ineptness. Id. \n     His second reason aligned with his concern that this was a \n     sectional bill: Senator Borah felt that if Congress were to \n     pass a bill that the South would interpret as aimed at \n     them, then it would be completely unrealistic to expect \n     southerners--even those employed by the Federal \n     Government--to enforce the anti-lynching laws to any \n     greater degree than the state anti-lynching laws. He \n     firmly believed that laws could not be enforced without \n     being backed by public opinion. Id.\n\n\n  c. borah: lynching is disappearing as a problem in the united states\n\n       A final policy argument that Senator Borah made against \n     anti-lynching laws is that it was a disappearing crime. In \n     1937 he offered the statistic that 40,000,000 Americans were \n     living in poverty to support Senator Pepper's argument that \n     the Senate should be dealing with the problems of the \n     nation's poor instead of ``debating an anti-lynching bill, \n     when the total toll of lynching last year, I think, was about \n     11, one of the minor categories of crime, nationally \n     speaking, in the United States.'' 82 Congr. Rec. 1, 158 \n     (1937). One year later Borah argued that lynching had \n     dramatically decreased in the United States since 1918, and \n     it had almost disappeared in many states by 1938. Given the \n     extremely small number of lynchings in the two years prior to \n     the introduction of the 1938 anti-lynching bill (combined \n     with the national trend towards fewer lynchings each year) \n     Senator Borah concluded that there was not a sufficient \n     problem to justify judging the southern states (through \n     passing a sectional measure against them) as having failed in \n     their provision of free government. 83 Congr. Rec. 1, 140 \n     (1938).\n\n        III. Potential Problems With William Borah's Statements\n\n       Although Senator William Borah's speeches convey the \n     message that his real motivation for opposing anti-lynching \n     legislation was based on his concern for state sovereignty, \n     he did make one particular comment that needs to be addressed \n     for its potential racial offensiveness. In 1938, Borah \n     referred to a quotation by Henry W. Grady as true, and this \n     quotation described the white and black races as two \n     ``utterly dissimilar races on the same soil--with equal \n     political and civil rights--almost equal in numbers but \n     terribly unequal in intelligence and responsibility.'' Id. at \n     141. While this quote does on its face seem to be an overtly \n     racist comment, there are a few reasons why this quote should \n     not be taken as evidence that William Borah fought the anti-\n     lynching bills because he was himself a racist.\n       The first reason this is so is that following this \n     quotation, Borah put what he meant by it in context. As he \n     explained, he felt that no race of people would have the \n     capacity to assume full citizenship following years of being \n     enslaved. Id. (Borah then argued that the efforts by the \n     South in the years since Reconstruction were the best that \n     could be expected given the circumstances of the region's \n     past, and therefore the region should not be punished by this \n     sectional bill.) Given his statement that no race could have \n     assumed full citizenship following such treatment, it implies \n     that Borah considered any lack on the part of the blacks to \n     be a result of their slavery rather than an innate racial \n     defect. While it is not a flattering statement, it is not \n     strictly a racist remark; instead, Borah does seem to \n     indicate that any race under similar conditions would be \n     unequal in some regards to the enslaving race.\n       More important, William Borah's other speeches all strongly \n     reinforce the point that his opposition to the anti-lynching \n     bills were purely based on his views of the importance of \n     state sovereignty. He repeatedly praised the intentions of \n     his Senate colleagues who supported the anti-lynching bills, \n     and none of those opponents ever imputed any racist motives \n     to his beliefs. While opposing senators may have disagreed \n     with his constitutional views, there is no record whatsoever \n     that Borah's views were not legitimately held in this and \n     other areas of federal expansion. To try and read such a \n     motivation into the Congressional Record is to engage in \n     revisionist history with no basis other than a personal \n     agenda. Any description of William Borah as being racially \n     motivated to oppose the anti-lynching legislation ignores all \n     of the written record in order to manufacture a preferred \n     reason for the senator's views.\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n       Senator William Borah was a passionate advocate for states' \n     rights, and this--rather than racism--was the basis for his \n     opposition to the anti-lynching bills presented to the Senate \n     during the 1920s and 1930s. Senator Borah felt that those \n     bills were unconstitutional for several reasons, and the 14th \n     Amendment was certainly not a sound basis for them to pass \n     constitutional muster. Moreover, Borah saw the anti-lynching \n     bills as creating a principle that would justify repeated and \n     destructive federal intrusion into the state sovereignty that \n     was necessary for our nation's well-being. Finally, as \n     lynching had dramatically decreased in the United States by \n     the late 1930s, and given the Senator's feelings that anti-\n     lynching legislation would be an ineffective solution to that \n     disappearing problem (while at the same time threatening \n     national unity), William Borah strongly believed that passing \n     an anti-lynching bill would needlessly destroy our nation's \n     federalist system without solving any problems at all.\n       In his final Senate speech against an anti-lynching bill, \n     Senator Borah eloquently concluded by arguing that a loose \n     interpretation of the 14th Amendment would contribute to the \n     downfall of our governmental system, and that ``a few lives \n     will be lost if we do not pass this measure, . . . which we \n     will all regret. But many lives were lost to establish this \n     Government, to establish this dual system, and the happiness \n     and contentment of many millions will be lost if we do not \n     preserve it.'' 83 Congr. Rec. 2, 1497 (1938).\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today not only to show my support for \nS. Res. 39 but also to honor the achievements of Dr. James Cameron, the \noldest living lynching survivor. Dr. Cameron moved on from his horrific \nearly experience with racial hatred to found America's only Black \nHolocaust Museum. His life story and work are a source of hope and \npride for many survivors of racial violence.\n  Dr. Cameron was born in LaCrosse, WI, in 1914 and moved to Indiana as \na teenager. In Indiana, he accompanied two friends involved in an armed \nrobbery that turned to rape and murder. Though Dr. Cameron ran away \nwell before the crime was committed, all three young men were taken to \njail. The Ku Klux Klan stormed that jail on August 7, 1930, hung Dr. \nCameron's two friends and beat Dr. Cameron severely. Dr. Cameron \nsurvived but spent another 6 years in jail for crimes he did not \ncommit.\n  Dr. Cameron has never let us forget the injustice done to him and to \ntoo many other victims of lynching and other forms of racial violence. \nAfter moving back to his home State of Wisconsin, he founded the Black \nHolocaust Museum in Milwaukee. This unique museum lays bare our \nNation's violent past of racism and slavery. Dr. Cameron's efforts to \nshine a light on this disturbing aspect of our history have opened the \neyes of thousands to the suffering of African-Americans--not only in \nthe age of slavery but also in\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\nthe decades that followed. As painful as the exhibits in his museum are \nto view, they are a necessary reminder of the costs of racial hatred--\nand of the apology we owe to the families torn apart by acts of racial \nhatred.\n  Because of my great respect for Dr. Cameron--and because he has \nopened our eyes to the great crimes committed by this nation by not \nending lynching--I am cosponsoring S. Res. 39, a resolution apologizing \nto the victims of lynching and the descendants of those victims for the \nfailure of the Senate to enact antilynching legislation. The history of \nlynching in America is an atrocious one indeed. Between the years 1882 \nand 1968, some 4,700 people were lynched. And though, over that same \nperiod, nearly 200 antilynching bills were proposed, none made it past \nthe Senate.\n  That lack of action is truly a black mark on this institution's \nhistory and legacy. An apology cannot erase our crimes--but an \nacknowledgment of the costs of our inaction is a first step toward \nensuring we never again let hate and racism run unchecked through our \ngreat Nation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor and strong \nsupporter of S. Res. 39, an apology on behalf of the United States \nSenate, for its inaction during one of this Nation's darkest chapters. \nToday, my colleagues and I, through this legislation, offer an apology \nto the victims of lynching, and their families and descendants, for the \nSenate's failure to enact antilynching legislation throughout the \ncourse of this Nation's history. Despite the fact that, at key \njunctures in our Nation's history, the House of Representatives passed, \nand the President stood ready to sign, Federal law to actively \neliminate lynching throughout the country, such legislation died in the \nSenate, as did the many victims of this heinous crime who might have \nbeen saved by the passage of such law.\n  Following the Civil War, and as Reconstruction ended Federal troops \nwithdrew their presence from the States that had been in rebellion, \nlynching became the most extreme form of racial oppression in the \nSouth. Between 1881 and 1964, at least 4,749 reported lynchings took \nplace, with most of the victims being black; all but four States had at \nleast one lynching on record. However, 99 percent of the perpetrators \nof these crimes escaped any punishment, as State and local authorities \nrefused to investigate and prosecute these cases, and those who were \ncharged with lynching were regularly acquitted by all-white juries.\n  Unprotected by State authorities, African-Americans and civil rights \ngroups sought protection from the Federal Government, the same \nauthority that rid this Nation of the scourge of slavery. As a result \nof the Reconstruction amendments to the Constitution, the Federal \nGovernment had the express power to pass legislation under the 13th and \n14th Amendments to use the full force of the Federal Government's law \nenforcement authority to put an end to lynching. In fact, between 1890 \nand 1952, seven Presidents petitioned Congress to halt lynching, and \nalmost 200 antilynching bills were introduced in Congress. Most \nnotably, on three on three occasions between 1920 and 1940, the House \nof Representatives passed strong antilynching bills. And equally as \nregrettably, all three of these bills died in the United States Senate.\n  That is why I find S. Res. 39 to be entirely appropriate, and frankly \nlong overdue. This resolution, offered by my colleagues Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Allen, constitutes a formal apology by the Senate \n``to the victims and survivors of lynching for its failure to enact \nantlynching legislation.'' It further expresses this Chamber's sympathy \nand regret to the descendants of these victims. Undoubtedly, a measure \nof this nature may stand as insignificant when compared to the sad \nlegacy of men, women, and children dying at the hands of racist, \nbigoted vigilantism. Yet it is my hope that this resolution, which we \nwill pass tonight, will help heal some of the wounds for the surviving \nfamily members of the victims of lynching.\n  This effort has been a long time coming, and I am thankful for the \ninvolvement of my colleagues, present and former, who have taken part \nin supporting this effort. I thank the sponsors of this resolution, \nSenators Allen and Landrieu, as well as all other cosponsors of this \nresolution, 60 in number altogether. I also want to thank Janet \nLanghart Cohen and her husband, our former colleague and fellow Mainer \nBill Cohen. Their devotion to championing this cause helped to raise my \nawareness of this issue, and I am sure many of my colleagues have \nsimilar feelings.\n  For decades after the Civil War, too many of our fellow Americans \nsuffered from the murderous actions of lynching bees and the fear and \nintimidation that accompanied those actions. People of all backgrounds \nfell victim to lynch mobs in nearly every State, but this burden fell \nespecially hard on our fellow citizens in the African American \ncommunity. Needless to say, the Senate bears no direct responsibility \nfor these crimes, nor does this resolution suggest anything along those \nlines. However, the Senate's sin was one of omission. At critical \njunctures in our history, when the tide of the terror wrought by \nlynching could have been stemmed by passage of Federal legislation, the \nSenate single-handedly blocked such action. For this inaction, at times \nwhen this legislative body was needed the most, we in the Senate \nexpress our heart-felt apology to those whose suffering could have been \navoided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to state my support for the \nnomination of Thomas B. Griffith to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nD.C. Circuit. I believe that Mr. Griffith will serve the Federal \njudiciary with honor and distinction.\n  Mr. Griffith served as Senate Legal Counsel while I was majority \nleader, and I found him to be intelligent, honorable, and supremely \nqualified for this position on the Federal bench. As Senate Legal \nCounsel, he represented the Senate, its committees, Members, officers, \nand employees in litigation relating to their constitutional powers and \nprivileges; advised committees about their investigatory powers and \nprocedures; and represented the institutional interests of the Senate \nwith honor.\n  He was appointed to that nonpartisan position by a unanimous \nresolution sponsored by the leaders on both sides of the aisle. In \naddition to his service to this body, Mr. Griffith has obtained \nextensive legal experience in private practice in civil, criminal and \nregulatory matters.\n  Mr. Griffith currently serves as assistant to the president and \ngeneral counsel of Brigham Young University, a position he has held \nsince August of 2000. As general counsel for BYU he is responsible for \nadvising the university on all legal matters, including the management \nof all litigation involving the university.\n  Evidence of qualification can also be found in Mr. Griffith's \noutstanding academic record. He graduated summa cum laude from BYU, \nreceiving high honors with distinction from its Honors Program. He \nlater received his Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School \nof Law and served on the editorial and articles review board of the \nVirginia Law Review.\n  Mr. Griffith has the support of a broad, bipartisan group of \nattorneys and law professors, including Abner Mikva, former Chief Judge \nof the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n  This nominee has also served on the American Bar Association Central \nEuropean and Eurasian Law Initiative's Advisory Board. With the CEELI, \nhe participated in the training of judges and lawyers in Croatia, \nSerbia, Russia, the Czech Republic and several other countries and has \nactively worked to establish a regional judicial training institute in \nPrague. His experiences in these unique endeavors should be of \nparticular value during his tenure on the bench.\n  Additionally, between 1991 and 1995, Mr. Griffith dedicated hundreds \nof hours in the pro bono representation. He has also represented \ndisadvantaged students in the public school system in North Carolina \nduring due process hearings that accompanied disciplinary actions.\n  The American Bar Association has stated that Mr. Griffith is \nqualified for this position in the Federal judiciary, and I concur.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the resolution for consideration today \ndetails the Senate's shameful failure to pass\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\nanti-lynching legislation despite several attempts. Even as seven \nPresidents called for anti-lynching legislation, and the House three \ntimes passed such bills, the Senate has steadfastly refused to act.\n  At least 4,749 people were reported lynched between 1881 and 1964, \nwith the vast majority of the victims being African-American. \nShockingly, 99 percent of the perpetrators of these horrible acts \nescaped punishment from State or local authorities.\n  My State was one of only four or five States that did not have a \nlynching during that time. It wasn't just one or two States. It was \nevery State in the Union, every State of the then-48 States with the \nexception of only four or five.\n  Even though my State did not have any, I cosponsored this resolution \nbecause I believe an apology is in order. I have cosponsored this \nresolution because an apology is surely in order, and I believe Senator \nLandrieu deserves great credit for bringing this important issue to the \nSenate's attention.\n  This public act of contrition is an important gesture today to take \nresponsibility for the civil rights misdeeds of the past. But it is \nalso an opportunity for Congress to show the country that we will not \ntolerate similar offenses. As we pass this resolution, it is fitting to \ncarry this principle to the present and act in kind to prevent civil \nrights and human rights abuses occurring now in this country and around \nthe world.\n  As we pass this resolution, we should also recognize that it is long \npast the time to pass the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, which \nwould strengthen and extend our Federal hate crimes law. The Senate has \nrepeatedly passed this bill, with 65 votes in the last Congress. The \nRepublican leadership in the House, with the acquiescence of the Bush \nWhite House, has killed it. It is fitting that we apologize for past \ninaction, but that does not obviate the need to solve today's problems.\n  By the same token, we should reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in \nthis Congress and not wait for 2007. We need to ensure that this law, \none of the most important bills of the 20th century, remains in effect \nto safeguard the fundamental right of all citizens to participate fully \nin our democracy.\n  We should also remember the leading role this country played in \ndrafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was modeled \non our own Bill of Rights. As the country that, especially since the \nSecond World War, has been looked to around the world as a beacon of \nhope for victims of arbitrary arrest, torture, and the denial of \nfundamental freedoms, we need to set a far better example than we are \ntoday. The atrocities and dehumanizing mistreatment that have occurred \nin U.S. military detention facilities in Afghanistan, Iraq and \nGuantanamo, are eerily reminiscent of some of the despicable acts \ndescribed in this resolution. In addition, the continued assistance the \nadministration is providing to foreign security forces that violate \nhuman rights, directly contradict the message we are trying to send \nwith this resolution. We should not be satisfied with long overdue \napologies. There are serious human rights problems that we need to \naddress today.\n  A few years ago, I had the opportunity to examine the book ``Without \nSanctuary: Lynching Photography in America,'' which is referred to in \nthis resolution. The haunting photographs in this book make plain the \nevil that lurked in this Nation not very long ago, and make it \nimpossible to accept the fact that the individuals and mobs that \ncommitted these heinous acts by and large suffered no consequences. \nThis resolution deserves our immediate approval, and I hope it provides \nsome comfort to the descendants of the victims of these horrible \ncrimes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is every citizen's duty to know American \nhistory. One fact we must reckon with is that our experiment in self-\ngovernment began in a compromise with the existence of slavery. As the \nAmerican experiment went forward, protections granted to slavery in the \nConstitution--a document that never explicitly mentioned slavery--were \ndismantled. The cost was great: Brother fought against brother in the \nCivil War, largely over whether ``the peculiar institution'' would be \nallowed to thrive in the United States. When, at the end of that \nterrible conflict, the 13th amendment was put in the Constitution, \nslavery was abolished.\n  Yet while a pernicious institution was now, thankfully, illegal, its \naftereffects were still felt in the former slave States. Postwar \nreconstruction was supposed to restore the natural and the civil rights \nof the former slaves and their descendents; but State and local \nauthorities did not enforce those rights. The lynching of African \nAmericans, and other forms of persecution, would persist into the 20th \ncentury, to the shame of every decent citizen.\n  Candidly facing this history is important. We must not forget the \nwrongs of the past--nor that we have had leaders willing to come \nforward and stand against those wrongs. From the Continental Congress \npassing the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which banned slavery in the \nregion northwest of the Ohio River, to the words and deeds of Frederick \nDouglass and Abraham Lincoln, to the civil rights movement of the \n1960s, brave men and women reaffirmed for all of us the principles of \nhuman equality and consent of the governed on which our Nation was \nfounded.\n  Lincoln declared: ``Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not \nfor themselves, and under a just God, cannot long retain it.''\n  I support Senate Resolution 39 in the name of honesty and national \nunity. As Senators representing Americans of all colors and creeds, we \nought to give due recognition to past injustices. Even more \nimportantly, we ought to live today by Lincoln's dictum. We must make \nsure our laws and our practices always reflect our belief in individual \nworth and equality under the law. This belief held in common is what \nhas helped Americans--whatever their race, religion, or background--to \nsucceed.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate has accomplished some \nwonderful things for this country. But sometimes this body makes grave \nmistakes. Today, by passing the resolution apologizing to the victims \nof lynching, we acknowledge one of the gravest. The use of the \nfilibuster and other dilatory tactics to prevent the enactment of a law \ncriminalizing lynching is among the darkest chapters in the history of \nthe U.S. Senate. This resolution is a small but important step toward \nhelping us come to terms with the Senate's disgraceful failure over a \nperiod of many years, at the beginning of this century, to protect our \ncitizens. I congratulate Senators Landrieu and Allen for their work to \nbring this resolution before the Senate.\n  There are few crimes as despicable and contrary to the rule of law as \nlynching. The practice was born of hatred, racial or otherwise, and \ndisdain for our criminal justice institutions. Unfortunately, lynching \noccurred throughout the United States, with cases documented in all but \nfour states. From 1881 to 1964, there were 4,749 recorded victims of \nlynching. Of these victims, 3,452 were African Americans. Worse still, \nin nearly all cases of lynching before 1968, local and state law \nenforcement officials failed to investigate or prosecute the \nperpetrators.\n  An anti-lynching law would have allowed Federal prosecutors to bring \nthe perpetrators of lynching to justice. On three occasions, the House \npassed anti-lynching bills, but each time a small group of Senators \nfilibustered the proposals in the Senate.\n  Although a resolution cannot make up for the terrible injustice \nperpetrated against the victims of lynching and their families, this \nresolution is, at least, a positive step toward recognizing the \nSenate's past mistakes. There is much more that the Senate must do to \naddress continuing racial injustice in this country. But this \nresolution is a worthy effort. I am proud to support it, and I am \npleased that the Senate will pass it tonight.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President. I rise today in support of Senate \nResolution 39.\n  This resolution acknowledges a dark period in the history of our \nNation and the history of this institution. It was a time of racial \nintolerance, hatred and violence, that took the lives of 4,742 people, \nmostly African Americans, between 1882 and 1968. It was also a time \nwhen this body failed to fulfill its moral and constitutional \nresponsibilities to pass significant legislation\n\n[[Page S6386]]\n\nwhich may have prevented many of these deaths.\n  During this time, there were 284 victims of lynching in my home State \nof Arkansas. It was a crime that was documented in over 46 States. To \nproperly punish those responsible, Congress tried on over 200 occasions \nto pass antilynching legislation but on each occasion it came to the \nSenate floor, it was defeated.\n  While we can never adequately express the deep sympathy and regret in \nour hearts, I am hopeful this long overdue acknowledgment and apology \nbrings some sense of solace to the descendants of victims of lynching. \nThis was a moment in our nation's history that was at odds with the \nprinciples upon which we were founded, and a moment at odds with our \nfuture. When we acknowledge the misdeeds of our past and demonstrate a \nwillingness to learn the lessons from those actions, we build upon the \nmany things that unite us all to make our Nation stronger and a better \nplace to live.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today we in the Senate are finally \napologizing to the descendants of the nearly 5,000 victims of lynching, \nprimarily African Americans, for our failure to enact antilynching \nlegislation.\n  Even though the House of Representatives passed three strong \nantilynching measures between 1920 and 1940, the Senate filibustered \nall of those measures. This was wrong, and this resolution is long \noverdue.\n  Lynching, a widely acknowledged practice that continued until the \nmiddle of the 20th century, was a shameful chapter in our history. It \nwas mob justice at its most heinous, motivated by racial and ethnic \nhatred. And it was a national problem occurring in all but four States \nin our country.\n  While passing this apology is important, it not going to right every \nwrong. And it does not absolve us of our responsibility to continue to \nwork to provide justice in American society.\n  Justice at the polls for those who are made to stand in line for \nhours to exercise their right to vote.\n  Justice in the schools so that every child has an equal educational \nopportunity.\n  Justice in the workplace so that no worker will face discrimination.\n  Let us use this opportunity not only to apologize for a shameful \ninjustice but to dedicate ourselves to eradicating the remaining \ninjustices in our society.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am here to speak on the Senate's need to \nredress a past wrong. For more than 6 decades, the Senate attempted to \npass legislation outlawing the terrible act of lynching. And for more \nthan six decades, against the wishes of many Presidents and a majority \nof Congressmen and Senators, a small minority of Senators prevented any \nantilynching legislation from passing this body. Three times the House \npassed bills with severe penalties for perpetrators of this crime, and \nthree times companion bills failed to garner enough support to stop a \nfilibuster in the Senate. Today, it is time for atonement--and for a \nbelated apology on behalf of the United States Senate.\n  My colleagues and I have drafted this resolution to apologize for the \npast mistakes of this governing body. This terrible crime was a \nwidespread phenomenon in the late 19th century and throughout the first \nhalf of the 20 century. It was practiced in some 46 states.\n  Mark Twain once termed lynching as an ``epidemic of bloody \ninsanities.'' Compounding the tragedy of lynching is that fact that \nsome 99 percent of the perpetrators of these crimes failed to receive \nany punishment for their actions.\n  This resolution cannot make up for the Senate's past failures, but it \nwill serve as a statement of remorse from this body. It has been said \nthat one cannot judge the past through the lens of the present, but \nlynching should have been viewed as a crime in any time. The Senate, \nthrough this legislation, apologizes for its past mistakes, and seeks \nto redress the failure of this body to protect Americans from violent \nand sadistic behavior.\n  No longer will this body permit an ``epidemic of bloody insanities'' \nto overtake this Nation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \nSenate passage of S. Res. 39, a resolution of apology for the Senate's \nfailure to pass anti-lynching legislation.\n  Some may wonder about the need to pass this resolution concerning \nevents that occurred decades ago. I believe it is important that light \nbe shown upon, and a discussion occur, about these horrific events. As \nthe famous saying goes, ``Those who do not know history are doomed to \nrepeat it.'' There were almost 5,000 documented cases of mob lynching \nin the United States since the Civil War. It is important to note that \nmany historians believe this number should be doubled to include the \nundocumented cases that occurred.\n  Lynchings occurred almost everywhere in the United States, and were \nin many cases examples of so-called mob justice which thwarted the \ndecisions of or shortcut the American judicial system. Despite the \nnational scope of these events, the Senate refused to pass anti-\nlynching legislation that would provide greater protection to innocent \nvictims and bring the guilty to justice.\n  While we cannot reverse the decisions made by previous Senates, we \ncan at the very least, offer our apologies and highlight this shameful \nperiod in American history. Only by exposing these terrible events, \ndiscussing how they occurred, and learning from them can we hope to \navoid repeating them in the future.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today the Senate acknowledges the dark \nside of our history. We apologize for a terrible wrong--the Senate's \nrepeated failure to adopt anti-lynching legislation. This legislation \nis long, long overdue. I join my colleagues in offering this resolution \nas a way of saying how profoundly sorry we are that the Senate did not \nact decades earlier--when action might have saved lives. We also \nrecommit ourselves to ensuring that this will never happen again.\n  The horrific practice of lynching is a stain on our Nation--and on \nour souls. There were over 4,700 documented lynchings in the United \nStates. There were 29 documented lynchings in Maryland. These lynchings \nwere public events, with members of the community colluding--either \ndirectly or indirectly--in this horrifying practice. It was no accident \nthat they made them public--they were sending a message to other \nAfrican Americans in the community. These crimes left thousands of \npeople dead and families and communities scarred. Yet 99 percent of \nthese murderers were never arrested or tried for their crimes.\n  For many in Maryland, the history of lynchings is not an \nabstraction--it is the history of their family or their community. The \nWashington Post reported about a 1906 lynching in Annapolis, where \nHenry Davis was lynched on a bluff near College Creek just days before \nChristmas. There was George Armwood, who was lynched and burned by a \nmob in Princess Anne's County, and King Davis--who was lynched in \nBrooklyn, MD on Christmas Day in 1911. Many institutions throughout the \nNation have tried to document the extent of this racial violence--but \nso many incidents went unreported that we will never have a true \naccount of how many African Americans were murdered.\n  Billie Holiday, a Baltimore native, tried to capture the despicable \npractice of lynching in her 1939 song ``Strange Fruit.'' Her career \nsuffered because of the painful honesty of this song. Her record label \nrefused to record it, and some of her concerts were cancelled. Yet \nHoliday's perseverance turned ``Strange Fruit'' into one of the ``most \ninfluential protest songs ever written'' and an inspiration for those \nfighting for racial justice.\n  The Senate tried several times to put an end to this monstrous \npractice by outlawing it, but each time the measure died. This is a \nhorrific failure that cost American lives. This failure will always be \na scar on the record of the United States Senate.\n  Today we apologize for this tragedy, though no action now can right \nthis wrong. Although we acknowledge this dark side of our history, we \ncannot and should not want to erase it. We must ensure that it serves \nas a lesson about a time when we failed to protect individual rights \nand preserve freedom.\n  This legislation is important to recognizing the evil of lynching and \nthe failure of government to protect its citizens. It also stands as a \nsymbol of our commitment to move our Nation\n\n[[Page S6387]]\n\nforward so we can truly be a symbol of democracy.\n  Next week in Baltimore, we will open the Reginald Lewis Museum of \nAfrican American History and Culture. It will be a proud day--the \ncelebration of a strong and proud history that has made our Nation \ngreat. This museum documents the courageous journeys toward freedom and \nself-determination for African Americans in Maryland and in America. \nYet history must also acknowledge this dark side of our history. We \nmust educate the next generations about the proud history, and mighty \nstruggle that African Americans have endured in the United States.\n  Today, this resolution stands as a painful reminder of that history. \nYet it should also stand as a guiding principle--that we must always \nfight to protect the rights of all Americans. This resolution \nacknowledges that the Senate was wrong when it failed to enact anti-\nlynching laws. But it also empowers us to move forward to do all that \nwe can to strengthen opportunity for all Americans, to fight \ndiscrimination in every form and to ensure that we vigorously protect \nthe rights of all Americans.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this past February, I introduced the \nresolution celebrating Black History Month that follows these remarks. \nThirty five other Senators have joined me in this effort. I offered \nthis resolution in the spirit of my late friend Alex Haley, who lived \nhis life by the words ``Find the Good and Praise It''. These six words \nare etched on his tombstone in the front yard of his grandparents' home \nin Henning, TN. When Alex was a boy, he would sit on the front porch \nsteps of that home on summer evenings listening to his great aunts rock \nin their chairs and tell the stories that eventually became Roots, the \nstory of the struggle for freedom and equality.\n  It is in that spirit that the Black History Month resolution honors \nthe contributions of African Americans throughout our history, \nrecommits the United States Senate to the goals of liberty and equal \nopportunity for every American, condemns the horrors of slavery, \nlynching, segregation, and other instances in which our country has \nfailed to measure up to its noble goals, and pledges to work to improve \neducational, health, and job opportunities for African Americans and \nfor all Americans.\n  African Americans were brought forcibly to these shores in the 17th \ncentury. From that dark beginning, however, these men and women and \ntheir descendants have overcome great obstacles. They continue to do \nso, and have taken a prominent place among the many people of diverse \nbackgrounds who have come together here to form a single nation. \nAfrican Americans have made and continue to make significant \ncontributions to the economic, educational, political, artistic, \nliterary, scientific, and technological advancement of the United \nStates of America.\n  Black History Month, and this discussion in the Senate today, offer \nan opportunity to remind ourselves that the United States of America is \na work in progress. Ours is the story of a people establishing high \nideals, and then struggling to reach them, often falling short, rarely \nachieving them, but always recommitting ourselves to trying again. This \nis why we continue to say that anything is possible in America, that no \nchild shall be left behind, and that we will pay any price to defend \nfreedom, although we well know that we will never quite reach such \nlofty ideals.\n  Perhaps the most ambitious of our goals is the proposition, expressed \nin the Declaration of Independence, that ``all Men are created equal, \nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, \nthat among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. .  .  \n. .'' Our most conspicuous failure to reach this goal is the treatment \nof African Americans. Slavery, lynching, and segregation are all \ndisgraceful examples of times when this Nation failed African \nAmericans, when we failed to live up to our own promise of that \nfundamental truth that all men are created equal.\n  However, for almost every time that we have failed, we have then \nstruggled to come to terms with the disappointment of that failure and \nrecommitted ourselves to trying again. Where there once was slavery, we \nenacted the 13th and 14th amendments abolishing slavery and declaring \nequal protection under the law for all races. After segregation, came \nBrown v. Board of Education and the Voting Rights Act. There are so \nmany moments like these in our history. We should celebrate these \nmoments, but we should not stop there. We celebrate and remember our \nhistory so that we can learn its lessons and apply them today. Today's \nwrongs are begging for attention. African Americans in this country \nface significant and often crippling disparities in education, health \ncare, quality of life, and other areas where the Federal Government can \nplay a role.\n  There are different ways to acknowledge those times when Americans \nhave failed to live up to our lofty goals. The Senators from Louisiana \nand Virginia, who are also co-sponsors of our Black History Month \nresolution, have chosen to apologize for the actions of some earlier \nSenators as a way of expressing their revulsion to lynching. I also \ncondemn lynching, and this Black History Month resolution condemns \nlynching. But, rather than begin to catalog and apologize for all those \ntimes that some Americans have failed to reach our goals, I prefer to \nlook ahead. I prefer to look to correct current injustices rather than \nto look to the past. Maya Angelou once wrote, ``History, despite its \nwrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not \nbe lived again.''\n  There is no resolution of apology that we can pass today that will \nteach one more child to read, prevent one more case of AIDS, or stop \none more violent crime. The best way for the United States Senate to \ncondemn lynching is to get to work on legislation that would offer \nAfrican Americans and other Americans better access to good schools, \nquality health care and decent jobs. By joining together in our Black \nHistory Month resolution, 35 members of this body commit ourselves to \ndo just that, to find more ways to look to the future, and to continue \nto contribute to this work in progress that is the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I don't know what my friend Alex Haley would say about this Senate \nresolution or that Senate resolution. But I do know how he celebrated \nBlack History Month. He told wonderful stories about African Americans \nand other Americans who believed in the struggle for freedom and the \nstruggle for equality; he minced no words in describing the terrible \ninjustices they overcame. He said to children that they were living in \na wonderful country of great goals, and that while many in the past \noften had failed to reach those goals, that we Americans always \nrecommit ourselves to keep trying.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \narticulate and poignant remarks of the junior Senator from Tennessee. \nHe is absolutely right, of course, that the era of widespread lynching \nin our nation's history is deplorable. And he is right that we must \nlook to the future, to ensure that such crimes are never again allowed \nto occur.\n  There are different ways to acknowledge those times when Americans \nhave failed to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee quotes Maya Angelou, who once wrote, ``History, despite \nits wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need \nnot be lived again.'' Indeed, let us learn from the past, and look \nforward with such courage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I know we have other Senators on their way \nto the Chamber to speak.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am here tonight on behalf of my \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Allen, and all of our colleagues who \nparticipated in the debate to close out this evening on this very \nimportant and historic resolution, S. Res. 39, which has apologized \nformally, officially, and with great sincerity to the thousands of \nvictims of\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\nlynching and to their descendants. It was, as was stated most \neloquently and passionately on this floor, a very dark chapter, indeed, \nin American history, but a real mark against this Senate that, despite \nthe repeated pleas of the victims and their families, thousands of \nAmericans, the House of Representatives, and seven Presidents, of both \nparties, the Senate failed to act.\n  Tonight the Senate has admitted its mistake and has taken a very \npositive step in admitting failure so that we can have a brighter \nfuture. I know that many of these victims and their families--\n``survivors'' is really a better word--have triumphed against this \nevil. Many were African Americans, but they were people of all \ndifferent races and religious backgrounds. Many of them were here \ntonight and have been with us all day today.\n  I know their names are part of the record, but again they were James \nCameron, 91 years old, a victim of lynching who miraculously survived \nto tell his story; Doria Johnson, the great-granddaughter of Anthony \nCrawford--Grandpa Crawford, as he has been called--from Abbeville, SC--\nwhat a story that family has to tell. Dan Distel, the great-grandson of \nIda Wells. What a brave and historic journalist she was. In the face of \nliterally constant threats to her life, she continued to write. What a \nrole model for journalists everywhere of the courage of what it really \ntakes to tell a story. And she did it.\n  We had many other family members and history professors with us \ntoday. There was a tremendous effort that enabled us to get to the \nfloor tonight. As I wrap up, I want to again thank the staff. I thank \nmy staff, including Jason Matthews, my deputy chief of staff; Kathleen \nStrottman, legislative director; Nash Molpus, who is with me on the \nfloor. Our staff has been very helpful. Senator Allen's staff has also \nbeen remarkable and so many have contributed to this effort.\n  I had many quotes to choose from, Mr. President, to end tonight. \nReally, there were hundreds of them that would be appropriate. But one \nwas especially appropriate, for the close of this debate because, while \nit ends one chapter, it begins many new chapters in the history of our \nNation. The woman I will quote from is one I have admired my whole \nlife. I have read much about her and have been taught a lot about her. \nI will read this quote from this particular woman because it took guts \nto say what she did, at a time when people in America didn't want to \nhear it. This came at a time when people didn't want to hear what women \nhad to say, generally, about any subject, let alone the subject of \ninjustice and intolerance not only in our Nation but the world.\n  The woman I will quote is Eleanor Roosevelt, who actually led a group \nof descendants into this Chamber in 1938 to urge the Senate, hopefully \nby their presence, to act--men and women who came with their own being, \ntheir own bodies to try to tell the Senate what you are reading about \nisn't true; these are innocent people. Eleanor Roosevelt escorted them \nto this Chamber and, of course, through all of their mighty efforts, \nactions were not taken, but not through any fault of hers. What I want \nto quote is what she wrote about universal human rights. I read this as \na young legislator. Of course, we read lots of things, and some things \nstick and some don't. This particular quote is seared into my heart. I \ntry to remember it every chance I get. I read it often, and I would \nlike to read it tonight because it is very relevant to the debate that \nwe have had. She wrote:\n\n       Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small \n     places, close to home--so close and so small they cannot be \n     seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the \n     individual person, the neighborhood he lives in, the school \n     or college he attends, the factory, farm, or office where he \n     works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child \n     seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without \n     discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they \n     have little meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen \n     action to uphold them close at home, we shall look for them \n     in vain in the larger world.\n\n  We have heard stories today--hundreds of stories about these small \nplaces close to home--trees in a public square, river banks, levees, \nstreets, alleys, open fields, behind school buildings, and in front of \nstores. This is where people want to experience dignity and justice. \nSome of these towns are so little they may still not be on any map of \nthe United States. Maybe in some of these towns--because of what \nhappened in the past--there are very few people who live there. And \nsome of these places are quite large, where you can find them on the \nmap. I think it is instructive for the Senate, as we make this sincere \napology tonight, that we really take a breath and be very introspective \nto think about where these small places are in America, where these \nplaces of any size are in America, and recommit ourselves to be honest \nabout our failings and our shortcomings, to be honest about the fact \nthat we are not always as courageous as we should be.\n  But when we come to a point where we know we made the wrong decision, \nwe didn't act in the best interests of our country or the American \ncitizens who look to us for their protection and their support, we \nshould at least be able to sincerely say we are sorry. That is what we \ndid tonight. I thank Eleanor Roosevelt. I am forever grateful for her \ngreat leadership for the country and for thousands of Americans, people \nof all races, who advocated for justice and freedom at great expense to \ntheir own life--which is not what most of us experience today, \ngratefully--with great expense to their reputation, their livelihood. \nShe was really not understood or appreciated in the world in which she \nlived.\n  There were many children in the Senate today, these children and \ngreat, great, great-grandchildren. Some of the victims and some of the \njournalists who have written about this in the past were here. Let's \nmake sure they know the truth and they know that tonight we apologize.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to \nthe presentations that have been made on the floor and wish to be \nassociated with the sentiments involved.\n  I come from a State that does not have a history of lynchings, but \nthat does not mean I should be absolved from the concern that all \nAmericans should have over the lynchings that have occurred. I note \nthat it was the filibuster that made it possible for the Senate to be \nthe body that blocked this legislation in the past. I would hope that \nin the future, we would all realize that the filibuster should be used \nfor more beneficial purposes than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6388-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I spoke on the Senate floor last week about \nthe benefits to all if the President were to consult with Members of \nthe Senate from both sides of the aisle on important judicial \nnominations. I return today to emphasize again the significance of \nmeaningful consultation on these nominations because it bears repeating \ngiven what is at stake for the Senate, the judiciary and this country.\n  In a few more days the United States Supreme Court will complete its \nterm. Last year the chief justice noted publicly that at the age of 80, \none thinks about retirement. I get to see the chief from time to time \nin connection with his work for the Judicial Conference and the \nSmithsonian Institution. Sometimes we see each other in Vermont or en \nroute there, and I am struck every time by his commitment. I marvel at \nhim. I think that his participation at the inauguration earlier this \nyear sent a powerful positive message to the country. I know that the \nchief justice will retire when he decides that he should, not before. \nHe has earned that right. I have great respect and affection for him \nand he is in our prayers.\n  In light of the age and health of our Supreme Court justices, \nspeculation is accelerating about the potential for a Supreme Court \nvacancy this summer. In advance of any such vacancy, I have called upon \nthe President to follow the constructive and successful examples set by \nprevious Presidents of both parties who engaged in meaningful \nconsultation with Members of the Senate\n\n[[Page S6389]]\n\nbefore selecting a nominee. This decision is too important to all \nAmericans to be unnecessarily embroiled in partisan politics.\n  I said again last week that should a vacancy arise, I stand ready to \nwork with President Bush to help him select a nominee to the Supreme \nCourt who can unite Americans. I have urged consultation and \ncooperation for 4 years and have reached out, again, over the last \nseveral months to this President. I hope that if a vacancy does arise \nhe will finally turn away from his past practices, consult with us and \nwork with us.\n  Some Presidents, including most recently President Clinton, found \nconsultation with the Senate in advance of a nomination most beneficial \nin helping lay the foundation for successful nominations. President \nReagan, on the other hand, disregarded the advice offered by Senate \nDemocratic leaders and chose a controversial, divisive nominee who was \nultimately rejected by the full Senate.\n  In his recent book, ``Square Peg,'' Senator Hatch recounts how in \n1993, as the ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nhe advised President Clinton about possible Supreme Court nominees. In \nhis book, Senator Hatch wrote that he warned President Clinton away \nfrom a nominee whose confirmation he believed ``would not be easy.'' \nSenator Hatch goes on to describe how he suggested the names of Stephen \nBreyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both of whom were eventually nominated \nand confirmed ``with relative ease.'' Indeed, 96 Senators voted in \nfavor of Justice Ginsburg's confirmation, and only 3 Senators voted \nagainst; Justice Breyer received 87 affirmative votes, and only 9 \nSenators voted against.\n  The Constitution provides that the President ``shall nominate, and by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint'' judges. \nFor advice to be meaningful it needs to be informed and shared among \nthose providing it.\n  Those recent examples are not the only examples of effective and \nmeaningful consultation with the Senate. According to historians, \nalmost 150 years ago, in 1869, President Grant appointed Edwin Stanton \nto the Supreme Court in response to a petition from a majority of the \nSenate and the House. More than 70 years ago, in 1932, President Hoover \nconsulted with Senator William E. Borah regarding who he should \nnominate to succeed Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. According to \nhistorical reports, as has been confirmed by Republican Senators, \nSenator Borah counseled the President to select Benjamin Cardozo from \nhis list of potential nominees.\n  Bipartisan consultation would not only make any Supreme Court \nselection a better one, it would also reassure the Senate and the \nAmerican people that the process of selecting a Supreme Court justice \nhas not become politicized.\n  Recently, a bipartisan group of 14 Senators joined together to avert \nan unnecessary showdown in the Senate over the effort to invoke the \n``nuclear option.'' That would have changed 200 years of Senate \ntradition and the protection of minority rights. In their agreement the \nbipartisan coalition say the following:\n\n       We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.\n       We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the \n     traditions of the United States Senate that we as Senators \n     seek to uphold.\n\n  I agree. Bipartisan consultation is consistent with the traditions of \nthe Senate and would return us to practices that have served the \ncountry well. They are right to urge greater consultation on judicial \nnominations.\n  In that regard, I was pleased to see the President respond to a \nquestion at a news conference 2 weeks ago by agreeing to consult with \nthe Senate about his nomination should a vacancy arise on the Supreme \nCourt. I see that as a positive development. More troubling are reports \nthat the White House plan does not include meaningful consultation at \nall, but a ``war room'' and some sort of preemptive contact to allow \nthem to pretend they consulted without anything akin to the kind of \nmeaningful consultation this important matter deserves. If the White \nHouse intends to follow that type of plan, it would be most \nunfortunate, unwise and counterproductive.\n\n  Though the landscape ahead is sown with the potential for controversy \nand contention should a vacancy arise on the Supreme Court, \nconfrontation is unnecessary. Consensus should be our mutual goal. I \nwould hope that the President's objective will not be to send the \nSenate nominees so polarizing that their confirmations are eked out in \nnarrow margins. This would come at a steep and gratuitous price that \nthe entire Nation would have to pay in needless division. It would \nserve the country better to choose a qualified consensus candidate who \ncan be broadly supported by the public and by the Senate.\n  The process begins with the President. He is the only participant in \nthe process who can nominate candidates to fill Supreme Court \nvacancies. If there is a vacancy, the decisions made in the White House \nwill determine whether the nominee chosen will unite the Nation or will \ndivide the Nation. The power to avoid political warfare with regard to \nthe Supreme Court is in the hands of the President. No one in the \nSenate is spoiling for a fight. Only one person will decide whether \nthere will be a divisive or unifying process and nomination. If \nconsensus is a goal, bipartisan consultation will help achieve it. I \nbelieve that is what the American people want and what they deserve.\n  If the President chooses a Supreme Court nominee because of that \nnominee's ideology or record of activism in the hopes that he or she \nwill deliver political victories, the President will have done so \nknowing that he is starting a confirmation confrontation. The Supreme \nCourt should not be an arm of the Republican Party, nor should it be a \nwing of the Democratic Party. If the right-wing activists who were \ndisappointed that the nuclear option was averted convince the President \nto choose a divisive nominee, they will not prevail without a difficult \nSenate battle. And if they do, what will they have wrought? The \nAmerican people will be the losers: The legitimacy of the judiciary \nwill have suffered a damaging blow from which it may not soon recover. \nSuch a contest would itself confirm that the Supreme Court is just \nanother setting for partisan contests and partisan outcomes. People \nwill perceive the Federal courts as places in which ``the fix is in.''\n  Our Constitution establishes an independent Federal judiciary to be a \nbulwark of individual liberty against incursions or expansions of power \nby the political branches. That independence is at grave risk when a \nPresident seeks to pack the courts with activists from either side of \nthe political spectrum. Even if successful, such an effort would lead \nto decision-making based on politics and forever diminish public \nconfidence in our justice system.\n  The American people will cheer if the President chooses someone who \nunifies the Nation. This is not the time and a vacancy on this Supreme \nCourt is not the setting in which to accentuate the political and \nideological division within our country. In our lifetimes, there has \nnever been a greater need for a unifying pick for the Supreme Court. At \na time when too many partisans seem fixated on devising strategies to \nforce the Senate to confirm the most extreme candidate with the least \nnumber of votes possible, I have been urging cooperation and \nconsultation to bring the country together. There is no more important \nopportunity than this to lead the Nation in a direction of cooperation \nand unity.\n  The independence of the Federal judiciary is critical to our American \nconcept of justice for all. We all want Justices who exhibit the kind \nof fidelity to the law that we all respect. We want them to have a \nstrong commitment to our shared constitutional values of individual \nliberties and equal protection. We expect them to have had a \ndemonstrated record of commitment to equal rights. There are many \nconservatives who can meet these criteria and who are not rigid \nideologues.\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\n  This is a difficult time for our country and we face many challenges. \nProviding adequate health care for all Americans, improving the \neconomic prospects of Americans, defending against threats, the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, the continuing upheaval and American \nmilitary presence in Iraq, are all fundamental matters on which we need \nto improve. It is my hope that we can work together on many issues \nimportant to the American people, including maintaining a fair and \nindependent judiciary. I am confident that a smooth nomination and \nconfirmation process can be developed on a bipartisan basis if we work \ntogether. The American people we represent and serve are entitled to no \nless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6390-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6390-S6391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been well over 3 years since the \nadministration began to hold detainees at the U.S. Naval Base in \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba. The first batch of then only 20 detainees arrived \nin January 2002. There are now more than 500 detainees at Guantanamo. I \ncannot give you an exact number because our own Government refused to \ntell the American people an exact number.\n  In fact, there is much that we do not know about our Government's \nactivities at Guantanamo. From the start, the administration's answer \nto every question regarding this secret detention facility has been: \nTrust us. Trust us that we know the law and that we will comply with \nit. Trust us to treat detainees humanely and in accordance with our \nlaws and treaties and the great and wonderful traditions of the United \nStates. Trust us that Guantanamo will make Americans safer. More than 3 \nyears later, the one thing we know for sure about Guantanamo is that \nany trust we may have had was misplaced.\n  First, the administration either did not know or did not follow the \nlaw. The list of reversals of this administration's policies and \npractices at Guantanamo is long. From the Supreme Court's rejection of \nthe claim that Guantanamo Bay is a land of legal limbo or, as one \nadministration official said, ``the legal equivalent of outer space,'' \nto a recent district court holding that the current military commission \nregulations are unlawful, there is much that needs attention and \ncorrection.\n  Secondly, the administration has not lived up to its promise to treat \ndetainees humanely. Even with the administration's continuing \nstonewalling against any independent investigation into the \nmistreatment of detainees, we continue to learn of more abuses on an \nalmost daily basis. Does anybody question that if American POWs were \nbeing treated in this way, we would have demonstrations in the streets \nof America, and everybody from the President down through every single \nMember of Congress would be up in arms and calling for changes? But \nwhen these actions take place at Guantanamo, the administration refuses \nto acknowledge any wrongdoing. The dangerous implications that this \nposture has for our own troops and citizens becomes more obvious every \nday.\n  Third, and this is the bottom line: Guantanamo has not made our \ncountry safer. It is increasingly clear that the administration's \npolicies have seriously damaged our reputation in the world, and they \nare making us less safe. The stain of Guantanamo has become the primary \nrecruiting tool for our enemies. President Bush often speaks of \nspreading Democratic values across the Middle East, but Guantanamo is \nnot a reflection of the values that he has encourages other nations to \nadopt. The United States has often criticized other nations for \noperating secret prisons where detainees are hidden away and denied any \nmeaningful opportunity to contest their detention. Now we have our own \nsuch prisons. Even if the administration fails to see the hypocrisy of \nthis situation, I can assure you, the rest of the world does not.\n  Guantanamo Bay, in addition to Abu Ghraib, is a national disgrace and \ninternational embarrassment to us, to our country's ideals, and a \nfestering threat to our security. It is a legal black hole that \ndishonors the principles of a great nation. America was once very \nrightly viewed as a leader in human rights and the rule of law, but \nGuantanamo has drained our leadership, our credibility, and the world's \ngood will for America at alarming rates. Even our closest allies cannot \ncondone the policies embraced by this Government, not to mention the \nsignificant damage that has been caused by allegations and proven \nincidents of detainee abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo. These \nare not the policies of a great and good nation such as ours. This is \nnot the American system of justice that I have grown up honoring and \nappreciating.\n  Within the last 2 weeks, I was at a meeting of NATO parliamentarians. \nThese are parliamentarians from the countries that are our closest \nallies. They are members of the NATO alliance with the United States \nand proud to be part of that alliance. Every one of them I spoke with \nsaid the same thing: How can America continue to be a beacon for \ndemocracy with the stain of Guantanamo? Some of these countries were \ncountries that originally had been behind the Iron Curtain. With the \nefforts of this administration and the Clinton administration, we see \nthem now as proud members of NATO. They look to the United States for \nleadership, and they ask us: Why Guantanamo?\n  The 9/11 Commission understood that military strength alone is not \nsufficient to defend our Nation against terrorism. There has to be a \nrole for working cooperatively with the rest of the world. In its \nreport, the Commission said that the Government ``must define what the \nmessage is, what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral \nleadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by \nthe rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors.'' \nGuantanamo Bay is not the way to do this.\n  The administration got itself into this mess because it refused to \naccept Congress as a partner in its so-called war on terror and \ninsisted on acting unilaterally. It would not even involve Congress, \neven though Congress is controlled by members of the President's party. \nFollowing the start of combat in Afghanistan in October 2001, I urged \nPresident Bush to work with Congress to fashion appropriate rules and \nprocedures for detaining and punishing suspected terrorists. All of us \nagree, if you have terrorists, if it is proven they are terrorists, \nthey should be detained and punished. As I noted at the time, our \nGovernment is at its strongest when the executive and legislative \nbranches of Government act in concert. Unfortunately, the President was \ndetermined to go it alone.\n\n  Up until now, this Republican-led Congress has been content to go \nalong for the ride. As the administration dug itself deeper and deeper \ninto a hole, we stood idly by. Instead of providing checks and \nbalances, we simply wrote one blank check after another.\n  This has to change. The Constitution provides that Congress, not the \nPresident, has the power to ``make Rules concerning Captures on Land \nand Water.'' Congress, not the President, has the power to ``define and \npunish Offenses against the Law of Nations.'' And perhaps most \nimportantly, Congress, not the President, has the power of the purse. \nMaybe each one of us should take a few moments and reread the \nConstitution that we are sworn to uphold.\n  What is the administration's plan for Guantanamo Bay, assuming there \nis one? What does the administration intend to do with the more than \n500 detainees still imprisoned there? How many will be released and \nwhen? How many will be charged and tried and when?\n  The administration consistently insists that these detainees pose a \nthreat to the safety of Americans. The Vice President said that the \nother day. If that is true, then one would have to assume we have \ncredible evidence to support it. If there is such evidence, then let's \nprosecute these people. If we have the evidence, prosecute them.\n  But we also know that some of the detainees have been wrongly \ndetained. I suspect there are others who have not yet been released \nagainst whom the evidence is weak at best. It is one thing if they are \nbeing detained in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. But if not, \nthey do not belong there.\n  Guantanamo Bay is causing immeasurable damage to our reputation as a \ndefender of democracy and beacon of human rights around the world. It \nis\n\n[[Page S6391]]\n\nbecoming a legal black hole, a rallying cry for our enemies, fueling \nhostilities against us and our policies.\n  We have always been able to say that those who strike out against us \ndo not uphold the rule of law as we do. We have always been able to \npoint out that the kind of actions they carry out are horrible, \nhorrific. And every one of us, Democrat and Republican, have found them \nabhorrent and have said so.\n  Yet the administration has not articulated a coherent plan to repair \nthe damage. Every one of us knows from what we hear around the world \nthat we have been damaged by Guantanamo. Why carry out acts that do not \nfollow our own laws, our own Constitution, our own tradition? We need a \nplan from the administration to repair this damage. The Congress has \nabdicated its oversight responsibility for far too long. The \nAdministration has placed this nation in an untenable situation, and it \nis time for Congress to demand a way out.\n  Mr. President, as I said, this doesn't reflect the feeling of just \nthe Democratic Senator from Vermont. Similar expressions have been made \nby Republicans and Democrats, leading people in this country, people I \nrespect greatly, who point out what we all know--and maybe we don't \nlike to talk about it--Guantanamo is a blot on the conscience of \nAmerica--a good and great conscience, one that has been a shining \nbeacon to so many countries. Let's not allow this blot. Let's take the \nsteps necessary to erase it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6391-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS ZOE DELL NUTTER\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the remarkable life \nof one of Ohio's most extraordinary women, Zoe Dell Nutter, a person \nwhom my wife Janet and I count among our very dearest friends.\n  Professional dancer and model, successful businesswoman, renowned \naviatrix, newspaper columnist and generous philanthropist, Zoe Dell \nNutter has been each of these and so much more.\n  Today, she has one more entry to her long list of credits, awards, \nand achievements--her 90th birthday. Zoe Dell's life has taken her to \nso many places, called her into so many fascinating career pursuits, \ndriven her to give so much back to her community, State, and Nation, \nand, lastly, rewarded her with so many accolades, honors along the way \nthat I could never do her story justice on this floor.\n  I will spend a moment describing the wonderful friendship Janet and I \nhave shared with Zoe Dell. It was truly a friendship at first sight \nwhen we all met on a long day back in 1979. Erv and Zoe Dell were the \nloves of one another's eyes, true life partners who shared the same \ndreams, interests, and passions through their marriage. Janet and I \nwere always so impressed with how supportive they were of one another \nand how proud and respectful they were of each other's careers. They \nhad a genuine concern for their family, extended family, and community. \nAbove all else, they were a truly devoted couple. And I know that the \nbond Janet and I forged with them is, in part, a reflection of the \ndevotion to each other we have treasured over the 42 years of our \nmarriage.\n  I would ask each of you here today to reflect on your own lives, and \non those special friendships that are so vital to your happiness. \nSometimes I think our fellow citizens do not realize that the most \nsignificant friendships enjoyed by those of us in public service are \nusually with people who are far removed from politics and governing. So \nit has been with the Nutters and the Voinovichs.\n  Of all the remarkable things Zoe Dell has done in her life, perhaps \nnothing else quite compares with her love for flying and her \naccomplishments both as a gifted aviatrix and a tireless champion of \naviation. She first took to the skies in the 1940s, when women were not \nexactly encouraged to be pilots. Zoe Dell persevered and excelled. And \nin so doing, she helped make it possible for little girls around the \nworld to add ``aviation'' to the list of dreams that they might dream.\n  One of Zoe Dell's greatest contributions to aviation was a dream of \nher own--a vision that the industry should have its own hall of fame. \nBecause of her, I became interested, as Governor, in helping to make \nher dream a reality in Ohio. And why not? Let me repeat the names of \nsome of America's foremost aviation pioneers: the Wright Brothers, John \nGlenn, Neil Armstrong, and, yes, Zoe Dell Nutter--Ohioans, one and all.\n  Janet and I worked tirelessly with Zoe Dell and Erv on the hall of \nfame project, but it was always Zoe Dell who was the heartbeat of the \ninitiative. We were successful in making it a true public-private \npartnership and today the Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton is a \nsparkling jewel in the crown of Ohio's contributions to aviation. Thank \nyou, Zoe Dell, one more time, for your vision, for your commitment, and \nfor your own numerous contributions to aviation.\n  Zoe Dell hung up her pilot's wings a number of years back. But I can \nguarantee you, she is wearing another set of wings that will be with \nher all the days of her life--angel's wings.\n  Janet and I treasure our friendship with Zoe Dell. And I am humbled \nto place this tribute into the Congressional Record, acknowledging the \nvenerable milestones Zoe Dell Nutter has reached on this day, and, more \nimportantly, a life so fully lived.\n  May she enjoy many more years of good health and God's blessing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6391-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6391-S6392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LATVIA, UKRAINE, RUSSIA, JORDAN AND IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the Memorial Day recess my \ncolleagues from Idaho and South Carolina joined me on a trip to Europe \nand the Middle East to review political and economic developments in \nemerging democracies, and U.S. security and foreign assistance \nactivities that support the march of freedom in those regions. I want \nto take a brief moment to share with my colleagues some of the trip \nhighlights.\n  Our first leg took us to Latvia, where Senators Crapo and DeMint and \nI met with senior government officials and President Vaira Vike-\nFreiberga. Although a young democracy, Latvia is unquestionably headed \nin the right direction. A painful and horrific past under Soviet \noccupation has seemingly steeled in that country's national \nconsciousness a drive and determination toward freedom and free \nmarkets. Not surprisingly, Latvian officials today are keenly aware of \nevents in neighboring Russia, and expressed concern with what they \nperceive as growing authoritarianism in Moscow.\n  A member of NATO and the EU, Latvia recognizes that while it \ncontinues to make forward progress at home, including passage of \nimportant money-laundering legislation, it has an important role to \nplay in the region and beyond. I again want to express my heartfelt \nappreciation to the people of Latvia for their support of military \noperations in Iraq and democracy in neighboring Belarus, Ukraine, and \nGeorgia.\n  U.S. Ambassador Cathy Bailey and her staff, particularly Mark Draper, \ndeserve praise for representing America's interests in Riga ably, \ncontinuing to strengthen U.S.-Latvian bilateral relations, and \nproviding outstanding support throughout our visit, including setting \nup a meeting with the Belarusian opposition. I am particularly proud of \nCathy as she is a Kentuckian; she is doing the Commonwealth proud.\n  From Latvia we traveled to Russia, where the contrast between the two \ncountries was immediate. Although Moscow has physically changed since \nmy last visit in 1993, a bumbling Soviet-era bureaucracy and suspicion \nof the United States unfortunately remain.\n  Cooperation on issues of mutual importance to the United States and \nRussia must continue, including countering terrorism, preventing the \nproliferation of weapons and materials of mass destruction, and dealing \nwith the challenges of Iran and North Korea. However, concerns \nexpressed in Latvia--and later in Ukraine--on the rollback of democracy \nin that country were underscored in a meeting we had with a dynamic \nmember of Russia's Duma, and the 9-year prison sentence handed down \nto ex-YUKOS tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky while we were in Moscow.\n\n  I echo the calls by President Bush and Secretary of State Rice for \ngreater support and respect for democracy and the rule of law by \nPresident Putin and\n\n[[Page S6392]]\n\nthe Russian Government. I would only add that with respect to regional \nrelations, it is in Russia's interest that its neighbors are \ndemocratic. It is my view that greater freedom can provide the \nstability that the Kremlin apparently seeks in Ukraine, Georgia and \nelsewhere.\n  In Ukraine, we met with a broad range of government and former \ngovernment officials to discuss the Orange Revolution, and the need for \ncritical economic reforms that Ukraine must implement in order to \nfulfill its aspirations for entry into the WTO, EU and NATO. While it \nis clear that President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Tymoshenko \nunderstand the hard work that lies ahead, they--and other key leaders--\nmust keep their collective noses to the grindstone to implement \neconomic reforms as quickly as possible.\n  As a long time Ukraine-watcher, it is my hope that Yushchenko and \nTymoshenko do not repeat the mistakes of previous governments that led \nto massive corruption and political shenanigans following independence \nin 1991. The recent failure of the Rada to pass intellectual property \nrights legislation--which is essential to WTO entry--is a cause for \nconcern. However, Ukrainians should know that America is ready and \nwilling to help further freedom in their country. This was no more \nclearly demonstrated than through the $60 million provided for Ukraine \nin the recently passed emergency supplemental.\n  I know my fellow Senators will agree that U.S. Ambassador John Herbst \nand his staff deserve recognition for doing a great job. They made sure \nthat our visit included differing views on the Orange Revolution, \nincluding those of former President Leonid Kravchuck and Yushchenko-\nchallenger Viktor Yanukovych, both of whom were at dinner one night at \nthe Ambassador's house, and had very different views, obviously, than \nthose expressed by the President and Prime Minister.\n  From Ukraine we traveled to Jordan where we met with King Abdallah. \nWe discussed regional issues, particularly Iraq and prospects for peace \non the West Bank and Gaza. King Abdallah is clearly engaged on both \nissues and we appreciate that he continues to be a valued partner for \npeace.\n  Given aircraft mechanical problems, our visit to Iraq was somewhat \nabbreviated. Nonetheless, we departed Baghdad with an unmistakable \nconclusion: 2005 is a critical year for the future of democracy in that \ncountry--and for our own country's efforts to help the Iraqi people \nsecure the blessings of liberty. The Iraqi people face a number of \nlooming deadlines, including drafting a new constitution by August 15, \nholding a national referendum on the constitution by October 15, and \nconducting national elections to form a new government by December 15. \nSo they have several deadlines ahead of them on the road to democracy. \nThe participation of Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish representatives in this \nprocess is absolutely imperative. According to an Iraqi parliamentarian \nwe met, the Iraqi people are up to this challenge. They should know \nthat America will continue to stand with them.\n\n  In Baghdad, we met with David Satterfield, our Charge d'Affaires, \nGeneral George Casey, and General David Petraeus. The view expressed by \nour general officers in Baghdad--that the Iraqi Army has made \nconsiderable progress--was shared by the Commander of the Second Marine \nExpeditionary Force in Fallujah, General Steve Johnson.\n  In Fallujah, we met with a task force of Marines determined that the \nheroic combat operations required to take the city should be followed \nby successful reconstruction efforts. They told us that Iraqi forces \nare combat ready, and determined in the face of enemy opposition. \nRecent press reports regarding Operation Matador, and the discovery of \nan insurgent underground bunker system, reveal only a small part of the \ngreat work that our forces are doing in Anbar province.\n  On a personal note, in Fallujah I was reunited with 2LT Joe Bilby of \nthe Third Battalion, Eleventh Marine Regiment. This young officer once \nworked on my staff here in the Senate, heard the call of duty, and \nearned a commission in the Marine Corps. His unit is executing a \nmission critical to our success in Iraq. The people of Kentucky, and \nthe rest of the country, should be proud of Lieutenant Bilby and his \nMarine band of brothers.\n  Let me close by pointing out that critical to the success of freedom \nin any country is strong and effective leadership that includes the \npolitical will to implement needed political, economic and legal \nreforms. As in previous years, my staff and I will be using this \nmeasurement as we put together the fiscal year 2006 State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs appropriations bill in the weeks to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6392-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6392-S6398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CBO REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, at the time Senate Report No. 109-78 was \nfiled, the Congressional Budget Office report was not available. I ask \nunanimous consent that the report, which is now available, be printed \nin the Congressional Record for the information of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n     Energy Policy Act of 2005--As ordered reported by the Senate \n         Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on May 26, 2005\n       Summary: The legislation would authorize funding for \n     several programs aimed at energy production, conservation, \n     and research and development. It would authorize the use of \n     energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs), make several \n     changes to the regulatory framework governing the nation's \n     electricity system, and establish a mandate for the use of \n     renewable fuels.\n       Most of the bill's estimated costs would stem from changes \n     in spending subject to appropriation. We estimate that \n     implementing the bill would cost $5.1 billion in 2006 and \n     $35.9 billion over the 2006-2010 period from appropriated \n     funds, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n       CBO estimates that enacting the bill also would increase \n     direct spending by $728 million over the 2005-2010 period but \n     would reduce direct spending by $591 million over the 2005-\n     2015 period. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would \n     increase net revenues by $75 million in 2006 and would result \n     in a net loss of revenues totaling $1.2 billion over the \n     2006-2010 period and $1.0 billion over the 2006-2015 period.\n       The bill contains numerous mandates as defined in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) that would affect both \n     intergovernmental and private-sector entities.\n       CBO cannot determine the cost of all the mandates in the \n     bill because several of the requirements established by the \n     bill would hinge on future regulatory action about which \n     information is not available. Though CBO cannot estimate the \n     cost of each mandate, we expect that the total cost of \n     private-sector mandates in the bill would exceed the annual \n     threshold established in UMRA ($123 million in 2005, adjusted \n     annually for inflation). That conclusion is based on our \n     analysis of the renewable fuels standard, which would impose \n     substantial costs on the motor fuels industry.\n       CBO estimates, however, that the total cost of complying \n     with intergovernmental mandates in the bill would not exceed \n     the threshold established in UMRA ($62 million in 2005, \n     adjusted annually for inflation). The bill also would \n     authorize numerous grants and initiatives that would benefit \n     state, local, and tribal governments; any costs those \n     governments incur for these projects and initiatives would \n     result from complying with conditions for receiving this \n     federal assistance.\n       Based on its review of the bill, CBO expects that the \n     mandates contained in the bill's titles on renewable energy \n     (title II), nuclear energy (title VI), electricity (title \n     XII), and energy efficiency (title I) would have the greatest \n     impact on private-sector entities and state and local \n     governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of the legislation is shown in Table 1. The \n     costs of this legislation fall within budget functions 270 \n     (energy), 300 (natural resources and environment), 350 \n     (agriculture), 450 (community and regional development) and \n     800 (general government).\n     Basis of estimate\n       For this estimate, CBO assumes that the Energy Policy Act \n     of 2005 will be enacted near the end of fiscal year 2005. \n     Additionally, CBO assumes that the authorized and necessary \n     amounts will be appropriated for each year and that spending \n     will follow historical rates for ongoing activities. Table 2 \n     details the components of estimated spending subject to \n     appropriation under the bill. (Table 3, provided later, \n     details the bill's direct spending effects.)\n       Spending subject to appropriation--Overview\n       The bill contains several provisions that specify amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated for programs related to energy \n     research, development, production, and conservation. \n     Additionally, the bill would authorize unspecified amounts to \n     be appropriated for energy conservation, loan guarantees for \n     certain energy facilities and projects to develop innovative \n     technologies,\n\n[[Page S6393]]\n\n     incentives to use renewable energy, and several other energy \n     programs, studies, and reports. Assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts, CBO estimates that implementing these \n     provisions would cost $5.1 billion in 2006 and $35.9 billion \n     over the 2006-2010 period. The following two sections detail \n     the costs of specified and estimated authorizations.

conservation, development, production,\n  and science programs.\n\n       Spending subject to appropriation: specified authorizations\n       The legislation would specifically authorize the \n     appropriation of $36.6 billion over the next five years for \n     several energy-related programs. Assuming appropriation of \n     the authorized amounts, CBO estimates that implementing the \n     bill's programs with specified authorizations would cost $4.8 \n     billion in 2006 and $34.3 billion over the 2006-2010 period. \n     That estimate includes:\n       Nearly $2.5 billion for the Department of Energy's (DOE's) \n     energy conservation programs (title I);\n       Nearly $700 million for renewable energy grants and \n     research projects (title II);\n       $3.3 billion for programs related to federal oil and gas \n     resources and for financial assistance to coastal states \n     (title III);\n       $400 million to research and demonstrate new technologies \n     that use coal (title IV);\n       $134 million for programs to research and develop energy \n     resources on Indian lands (title V);\n       About $540 million for a new program to research, develop, \n     design, construct, and operate an Advanced Reactor Hydrogen \n     Cogeneration Project and $16 million for a nuclear \n     decommissioning project in Arkansas (title VI);\n       About $450 million for research and demonstration of \n     vehicles that use alternative transportation fuels (title \n     VII);\n       $2.8 billion for research, development, and demonstration \n     of hydrogen-based fuel technologies and infrastructure for \n     hydrogen fuels (title VIII);\n       $23 billion to research energy efficiency technologies, \n     renewable energy sources, fossil energy development, basic \n     science, and other energy sources and new technologies (title \n     IX);\n       $45 million to promote a technology infrastructure program \n     and support small business participation in DOE research \n     activities (title X);\n       About $300 million for training personnel to work in the \n     energy technology industry, and providing awards and \n     fellowships in science, mathematics, and energy education \n     (title XI); and\n       About $40 million for incentive payments for advanced power \n     technologies (title XII).\n       Spending subject to appropriation: Estimated authorizations\n       Based on information from DOE, the Department of the \n     Interior (DOI), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \n     other affected agencies, and industry sources, CBO estimates \n     that implementing the provisions of the bill that are subject \n     to appropriation and have no specified authorization level\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\n     would cost $325 million in 2006 and $1.6 billion over the \n     2006-2010 period. Key components of this estimate are \n     described below.\n       Energy Conservation at Federal Agencies. Title I would \n     amend several energy conservation goals and requirements that \n     apply to the federal government. CBO estimates that \n     implementing those provisions would cost $500 million over \n     the 2006-2010 period, subject to appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts. Most of those goals, such as reducing \n     energy use by 2 percent per year relative to 2003 consumption \n     and purchasing energy-efficient products when economical, are \n     being pursued under current executive orders. Where \n     practical, the bill would require that hourly electricity \n     meters be installed at all federal buildings by 2012. Such \n     meters would provide data at least once daily and measure \n     hourly consumption of electricity. The data would be \n     available to facility energy managers.\n       Based on information from the DOE, we assume that it would \n     only be economical to meter 20 percent of the government's \n     inventory of 500,000 buildings and that installing meters \n     would cost, on average, $4,000 per building. We assume that \n     meters would be installed in 20,000 buildings per year until \n     2012, when the project would be complete. We estimate that \n     implementing the metering provisions of the legislation would \n     cost $57 million in 2006 and $323 million over the 2006-2010 \n     period. CBO estimates that other requirements in this title, \n     such as providing technical assistance to states, \n     establishing new programs and rules for making products more \n     energy-efficient, and monitoring the equipment installed \n     using energy savings performance contracts would cost $19 \n     million in 2006 and $177 million over the next five years.\n       Based on experience in the private sector, metering the \n     hourly electricity use of buildings can lead to reduced \n     energy consumption and reduce costs enough to recoup the cost \n     of installing meters within two to four years. It is possible \n     that this requirement could lead to a future reduction in \n     appropriations for energy use in federal buildings, but any \n     such savings would depend on how metering information is used \n     by federal agencies. Additionally, metering can reveal where \n     energy use is high, but capital investment and other changes \n     in how federal buildings consume energy would likely be \n     needed to achieve savings. In any case, any savings are not \n     likely to be significant over the next five years because \n     most of the new metering and required capital investment \n     would not be completed until the end of that period or after \n     2010.\n       Loan Guarantees for Innovative Technologies. The bill would \n     establish a credit assistance program for energy production \n     technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and employ \n     new or significantly improved technologies over those \n     currently available. Currently, DOE has no authority to \n     provide credit assistance and has developed no plans for how \n     it would use this authority. For this estimate, we assume DOE \n     would provide an 80 percent guarantee of loans worth about \n     $3.75 billion over the 2006-2010 period. Assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that \n     implementing this provision would cost $400 million over the \n     2006-2010 period and an additional $200 million after that. \n     CBO assumes--after providing loan guarantees for $3.75 \n     billion worth of projects over the next five years--that \n     DOE's credit assistance under the program would probably \n     accelerate after that period as the department gained \n     experience. The department could offer more or less credit \n     assistance than we have assumed here. All costs of such \n     credit assistance would be subject to appropriation.\n       Description of Loan Guarantee Program. The bill would \n     provide DOE with broad authority to make loan guarantees to a \n     variety of energy projects, ranging from renewable energy \n     systems, to advanced nuclear energy facilities, integrated \n     coal gasification combined-cycle technology, petroleum coke \n     gasification technology, and carbon sequestration technology, \n     as well as other new technologies. The legislation sets no \n     limits on the number of projects, or total principal that \n     could be guaranteed, nor does it indicate any priority for \n     one type of project over another.\n       Under the bill, DOE could not guarantee loans for more than \n     80 percent of a project's cost; it could sell, manage, or \n     hire contractors to take over a facility to recoup losses in \n     the event of a default, or it could take over a loan and make \n     payments on behalf of borrowers prior to a default. Such \n     payments could result in DOE effectively providing a direct \n     loan with as much as a 100 percent subsidy rate--essentially \n     a grant--that could be used by the borrower to payoff its \n     debts.\n       Under the Federal Credit Reform Act, funds must be \n     appropriated in advance to cover the subsidy cost of loan \n     guarantees, measured on a present value basis. The costs of \n     such subsidies could vary widely depending on the terms of \n     the contracts and the financial and technical risk associated \n     with different types of projects. According to Standard and \n     Poor's, the cumulative default risk for projects rated as \n     speculative investments can range from about 20 percent to \n     almost 60 percent, depending on a project's cash flows and \n     contractual terms. Subsidy costs also are affected by amounts \n     that could be recovered by the government in the event of \n     default, which in turn depend on the value of the security \n     backing the guarantee as well as contractual protections. For \n     this estimate, CBO assumes that, over the next five years, \n     DOE would not provide guarantees to projects with a subsidy \n     cost greater than 20 percent.\n       The bill would authorize DOE to accept payments from \n     borrowers sufficient to cover the subsidy cost of loan \n     guarantees. However, because the technologies covered by the \n     program would be new and would be seeking government backing, \n     CBO expects that projects seeking a guarantee would not be in \n     a position to fund the federal subsidy cost of a loan \n     guarantee. The bill specifies that DOE shall charge fees to \n     cover the costs of administering the credit program.\n       Types of Projects Guaranteed. The legislation contains \n     general guidelines that projects must meet to qualify for \n     credit assistance and specifies criteria for selecting at \n     least two coal gasification projects. For purposes of this \n     estimate, we assume that DOE would guarantee about $3 billion \n     in coal gasification projects, which would include the two \n     specified in the legislation and at least one other project. \n     We also assume that the department would use the authority in \n     the bill to provide loan guarantees for $625 million worth of \n     renewable energy systems, such as biomass or geothermal \n     electricity plants.\n       Coal Gasification. Gasification projects require large \n     capital investments, ranging from over $500 million for a 400 \n     megawatt gasification plant to $1 billion or more for a plant \n     that would produce electric power and other fuels using \n     petroleum coke. Such gasification technologies are not new--\n     they have been tested and deployed to some extent in other \n     countries--but they have not been proven economically \n     competitive in the United States. Profitability would depend \n     on numerous factors, including future electricity and fuel \n     prices; the price, quality, and availability of feedstocks; \n     and various regulatory approvals.\n       For this estimate, CBO assumes that DOE would provide an 80 \n     percent guarantee on investments totaling about $3 billion \n     over the next five years, which would include the planning \n     and construction of the two coal gasification plants \n     specifically mentioned in the legislation and additional \n     investment in other clean coal technologies.\n       Given the current outlook for energy prices, CBO expects \n     that the credit risk of gasification loans would likely fall \n     within the middle of the range for speculative investments, \n     but the risk of default could be higher or lower depending on \n     the contract terms and specific technology. CBO estimates \n     that loan guarantees for such projects would probably \n     involve a 20 percent subsidy. Thus, we estimate that \n     implementing this provision would cost $350 million over \n     the 2006-2010 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts. Additional outlays of $150 million \n     would occur after 2010 as construction progressed on such \n     projects.\n       Renewable Energy. The legislation also would authorize DOE \n     to make loan guarantees for renewable energy projects such as \n     biomass and geothermal sources for electricity generation. \n     Such projects could range in cost from $10 million for a \n     small 5 megawatt geothermal plant to $250 million for an \n     ethanol production plant. We expect that subsidy rates for \n     loans guaranteed under this title would be 20 percent. For \n     this estimate, we assume that $625 million worth of renewable \n     energy projects would receive an 80 percent loan guarantee \n     over the next 5 years. Such loan guarantees for renewable \n     energy systems would cost $50 million over the 2006-2010 \n     period, and an additional $50 million after that period.\n       Nuclear Energy. Because of DOE's support of emerging \n     nuclear technology through a current program called Nuclear \n     Power 2010, we expect that the department would use the \n     program to provide a guarantee to at least one new nuclear \n     facility over the 2011-2015 period. Such a guarantee could be \n     for more than $2 billion and carry a significant subsidy cost \n     (perhaps as much as 30 percent).\n       Indian Energy Programs. Title V would authorize the \n     Department of the Interior to provide grants and loans to \n     Indian tribes for energy resource development projects. That \n     title also would authorize DOE to provide loan guarantees for \n     energy development projects on Indian land and to establish \n     an Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. In total, CBO \n     estimates that these programs would cost $21 million in 2006 \n     and $244 million over the 2006-2010 period.\n       DOI Grants and Loans. The bill would authorize DOI to \n     provide loans and grants to Indian tribes for energy resource \n     development and integration and regulation of tribal energy \n     resources and to develop energy resource agreements through \n     leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way. Based on \n     information from DOI, CBO estimates that such grants and \n     loans would cost about $11 million in 2006 and $97 million \n     over the 2006-2010 period.\n       DOE Loan Guarantees. Title V would authorize the Secretary \n     of Energy to guarantee up to $2 billion in loans for energy \n     projects on Indian lands. Based on information from the \n     Council of Energy Resource Tribes, CBO expects that DOE would \n     provide loan guarantees for a variety of projects on Indian \n     lands, including electricity transmission lines, fossil fuel \n     electricity generation, and renewable fuels. CBO expects that \n     the subsidy cost of loans guaranteed under this program could \n     range from 2 or 3 percent for routine conventional projects \n     to 50 percent or more for unproven technologies.\n       For this estimate, CBO assumes that about half of the \n     program would provide loan guarantees for electricity \n     transmission lines,\n\n[[Page S6395]]\n\n     which should pose relatively little credit risk under \n     standard contract terms. We assume that the remaining loan \n     guarantees would be divided between fossil fuel electricity \n     generation and renewable fuel projects. Under these \n     assumptions, we estimate that the average subsidy cost for \n     loans guaranteed under the program would be 10 percent. CBO \n     expects that loans would be disbursed over the next 10 years, \n     and we estimate that the loan guarantee program would cost $7 \n     million in 2006 and $132 million over the 2006-2010 period, \n     assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts for the \n     estimated subsidy costs.\n       Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. The bill also \n     would authorize DOE to establish a new office that would be \n     responsible for promotion and development of Indian tribal \n     energy concerns. Based on information from DOE, CBO estimates \n     that the salaries, expenses, benefits, space, and travel \n     costs of the DOE employees that would administer such \n     programs would be about $3 million annually.\n       Renewable Energy Production Incentive (REPI). The REPI \n     program currently provides cash payments to public utilities \n     and electric cooperatives that generate energy using \n     renewable sources. The payment is based on the annual \n     kilowatt-hours of electricity generated using qualified \n     renewable energy sources. Section 202 would reauthorize the \n     REPI program for an additional 20 years, and make Indian \n     tribes eligible for the program. Annual funding appropriated \n     for the program has not kept pace with applications for \n     payment from eligible utilities. Specifically, eligible \n     utilities have generated electricity from renewable resources \n     since 1994 in an amount that qualifies for about $76 million \n     in REPI payments that have not been appropriated. Based on \n     information from DOE, CBO estimates that fully funding this \n     program, including the backlog of applications, would cost \n     $70 million in 2006 and $163 million over the 2006-2010 \n     period.\n       Cellulosic Biomass and Cane Sugar Loan Guarantee Program. \n     Section 204 would authorize DOE to issue loan guarantees to \n     help finance the construction of facilities to produce fuel \n     ethanol from agricultural residue. The development of such \n     facilities poses some risk mainly because the technology that \n     would be used to process ethanol from such sources is new and \n     is not well-proven.\n       For this estimate, we expect that such facilities would be \n     debt-financed and sponsors would recover costs through the \n     sale of ethanol. Prices for ethanol have a history of \n     fluctuating widely and the likelihood of future fluctuations \n     could contribute additional credit risk for such a project. \n     Moreover, the cash flow for these projects also would rely \n     heavily on the cost of purchasing feedstock. According to \n     DOE, a plant's reliance on feedstock from these sources would \n     increase a project's credit risk because prices for feedstock \n     can become competitive if demand for such products increases.\n       Under credit reform procedures, funds must be appropriated \n     in advance to cover the subsidy cost of loan guarantees, \n     measured on a present value basis. Because of the significant \n     level of risk associated with these types of projects, the \n     costs of subsidizing such loan guarantees could vary widely. \n     At worst, the government could absorb all of the risk, \n     effectively converting the loan guarantees into grants. This \n     provision would authorize DOE to issue loan guarantees \n     limited to $250 million per project. However, the provision \n     does not set any limits on the number of loan guarantees that \n     could be made. Under this legislation, an applicant for a \n     loan guarantee would have to be currently operating an \n     existing facility that produces at least 50,000 gallons of \n     ethanol per year.\n       CBO estimates that, over the next five years, DOE would \n     probably provide loan guarantees for three projects, each \n     with a total construction cost of about $250 million. Because \n     the bill also would require applicants to contribute at least \n     20 percent of the project's total cost, CBO estimates that \n     the value of each loan guarantee would be about $200 million. \n     In addition, based on information from DOE, CBO assumes that \n     the department would seek projects with a financial outlook \n     similar to those of bonds rated B- or better by companies \n     such as Standard and Poor's and Moody's. Projects with this \n     rating typically have a cumulative default risk of over 40 \n     percent. Under those assumptions, CBO estimates that loans \n     guaranteed under the bill would be likely to have a subsidy \n     rate between 15 percent and 20 percent and would cost $110 \n     million over the 2006-2010 period.\n       Electricity Regulations. Title XII would require the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish \n     several new rules for managing the nation's electricity \n     system and governing the business practices of the \n     electricity industry. Such rules would affect transmission \n     services, construction and siting permits for building new \n     transmission lines, and the reliability of the nation's \n     electricity transmission infrastructure. The bill also would \n     repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, \n     require FERC to take over certain regulatory procedures \n     currently undertaken by the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, and amend the Public Utilities Regulatory \n     Policies Act.\n       Based on information from FERC, CBO estimates that \n     implementing these provisions would cost $11 million in 2006 \n     and $47 million over the 2006-2010 period. Such costs would \n     cover additional data processing and storage, additional \n     staff, and travel related to the agency's new duties. Because \n     FERC recovers 100 percent of its costs through user fees, \n     such additional costs would be offset by an equal change in \n     fees that the commission charges. Hence, these provisions \n     would have no net budgetary impact.\n       Other Provisions. The bill includes several provisions that \n     would authorize various new studies, reports, and activities \n     related to energy consumption and production. Those \n     provisions would authorize federal agencies to:\n       Establish new programs related to federal oil and natural \n     gas resources;\n       Authorize a direct loan to upgrade a nonoperational clean-\n     coal technology plant in Alaska to a traditional coal-fired \n     electricity plant;\n       Reorganize certain offices within DOE; and\n       Prepare several other studies and reports on energy \n     resources and efficiency.\n       Based on information from the agencies that would be \n     responsible for implementing these provisions, CBO estimates \n     that these activities would cost $43 million in 2006 and $176 \n     million over the 2006-2010 period, subject to the \n     availability of appropriated funds.\n       Direct spending and revenues\n       Several provisions in the bill would affect direct spending \n     and revenues. The estimated effects of these provisions are \n     shown in Table 3. The bill would establish a mandate for the \n     use of renewable motor fuels, provide permanent authorization \n     for the use of energy savings performance contracts; \n     establish an Electric Reliability Organization to manage the \n     reliability of the nation's electricity system; allow the \n     Western Area and Southwestern Power Administrations to accept \n     up to $100 million in financing from private sources for \n     electricity transmission projects; make changes to federal \n     programs related to oil and natural gas; and require the \n     Rural Utilities Service to change the terms of certain loans.\n       CBO estimates that enacting the bill also would increase \n     direct spending by $728 million over the 2005-2010 period but \n     would reduce direct spending by $591 million over the 2005-\n     2015 period. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would \n     increase net revenues by $75 million in 2006 and would result \n     in a net loss of revenues totaling $1.2 billion over the \n     2006-2010 period and $1 billion over the 2006-2015 period. In \n     addition, we estimate that new civil penalties imposed by the \n     bill would result in an increase in revenues of less than \n     $500,000 annually.\n\n                                TABLE 3.--ESTIMATED DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUE EFFECTS ON THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                    By fiscal year in millions of dollars--\n                                                      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013     2014     2015\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nRenewable Fuels Requirement and Agricultural Support\n Programs:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.......................        0        0      -59     -164     -366     -569     -669     -697     -750     -768     -771\n    Estimated Outlays................................        0        0      -59     -164     -366     -569     -669     -697     -750     -768     -771\nEnergy Savings Performance Contracts:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.......................        0        0      301      307      314      320      327      334      341      348      355\n    Estimated Outlays................................        0        0      256      306      313      319      326      333      340      347      354\nElectric Reliability Organization:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.......................        0      100      102      104      106      108      110      113      115      117      120\n    Estimated Outlays................................        0      100      102      104      106      108      110      113      115      117      120\nFinancing of Federal Electricity Transmission\n Projects:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.......................        0        0       50        0       50        0        0        0        0        0        0\n    Estimated Outlays................................        0        0       10       20       30       20       20        0        0        0        0\nFederal Oil and Natural Gas Programs:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.......................        0        8        7       10        9       12        5       11        8       10        7\n    Estimated Outlays................................        0        8        7       10        9       12        5       11        8       10        7\nAssistance for Rural Communities with High Energy\n Costs:\n    Estimated Budget Authority.......................       46        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0\n    Estimated Outlays................................       46        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0\n      Total Changes in Direct Spending Under the\n       Energy Policy Act of 2005:\n        Estimated Authorization Level................       46      108      401      257      113     -129     -227     -239     -286     -293     -289\n        Estimated Outlays............................       46      108      316      276       92     -110     -208     -240     -287     -294     -290\n \n\n[[Page S6396]]\n\n \n                                                                 CHANGES IN REVENUES \\1\\\n \nRenewable Fuels Requirement..........................        0        0      -64     -264     -509     -754     -262        0        0        0        0\nElectric Reliability Organization--Fees Charged on           0       75       77       78       80       81       83       84       86       87       89\n Electricity Consumers...............................\n    Total Changes in Revenues Under the Energy Policy        0       75       13     -186     -429     -673     -179       84       86       87       89\n     Act of 2005.....................................\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Net of income and payroll tax offsets.\n\n       Renewable Fuels Requirement and Agricultural Support \n     Programs. CBO estimates that enacting section 204 would lower \n     direct spending by about $4.8 billion over the next 10 years \n     and lower revenues by about $1.9 billion over the same \n     period.\n       Section 204 would require that motor fuels sold by a \n     refiner, blender, or importer contain specified amounts of \n     renewable fuel. The required volume of renewable fuel would \n     start at 4 billion gallons in 2006, escalate to 8 billion \n     gallons for 2012, and increase thereafter at the rate of \n     growth in gasoline consumption. CBO expects that the use of \n     renewable fuels would be significantly affected starting in \n     2007, when the bill's renewable fuel requirement would exceed \n     the amount of renewable fuel use CBO estimates under current \n     law.\n       CBO expects that most of the fuel produced to meet the \n     requirements under the bill would be ethanol. Because ethanol \n     is primarily derived from corn, demand for corn would rise \n     with the requirement to use more ethanol. CBO expects that \n     com prices would increase up to 10 percent by the end of the \n     2007-2015 period. Accordingly, the costs of federal programs \n     to support farm prices and provide income support to \n     agricultural producers would fall over the 2007-2015 period. \n     CBO estimates that spending for farm price and income \n     supports would decline by about $4.8 billion over the 2007-\n     2015 period.\n       Section 204 also would affect revenues. Because ethanol-\n     blended fuels are taxed at a lower rate than gasoline, \n     receipts from taxes on motor fuels would change when ethanol \n     use changes. CBO estimates that increased ethanol use would \n     reduce revenues starting in 2007, and continue affecting \n     revenues through part of 2011. Although ethanol use would \n     increase significantly under the bill, the special tax \n     treatment of ethanol fuels under current law will expire at \n     the end of calendar year 2010. Therefore, changes in ethanol \n     use would not significantly affect federal revenues after \n     that time.\n       Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs). The bill \n     would provide authorization for the use of energy savings \n     performance contracts through 2016. Under current law, the \n     authority to enter into such contracts expires at the end of \n     fiscal year 2006. Overall, CBO estimates that entering into \n     ESPCs would increase direct spending by $256 million in 2007 \n     and $2.9 billion over the 2005-2015 period.\n       ESPCs enable federal agencies to enter into long-term \n     contracts with an energy savings company (ESCO) for the \n     acquisition of energy-efficient equipment, such as new \n     windows, lighting, and heating, ventilation, and air-\n     conditioning systems. Using such equipment can reduce the \n     energy costs for a facility, and the savings from reduced \n     utility payments can be used to pay the contractor for the \n     equipment over time. Because the government does not pay for \n     the equipment at the time it is acquired, the ESCO borrows \n     money from a nonfederal lender to finance the acquisition and \n     installation ofthe equipment. When it signs the ESPC, the \n     government commits to paying for the full cost of the \n     equipment as well as the interest costs on the ESCO's \n     borrowing for the project. Since the ESCO faces higher \n     borrowing costs than the U.S. Treasury, total interest \n     payments for the equipment acquisition will be higher than \n     if the government financed the acquisition of the \n     equipment directly with appropriated funds.\n       The obligation to make payments for the equipment and the \n     financing costs is incurred when the government signs the \n     ESPC. Under current law, agencies can use ESPCs to acquire \n     new energy-efficient equipment, paying over a period of up to \n     25 years without an appropriation for the full amount of the \n     purchase price. Thus, consistent with government accounting \n     principles, CBO believes that the budget should reflect that \n     commitment as new obligations at the time that an ESPC is \n     signed and that the authority to enter into these contracts \n     without budget authority for the full amount of the purchase \n     price constitutes direct spending.\n       CBO's estimate of direct spending reflects an amount equal \n     to the cost of the energy conservation measures as installed, \n     plus the portion of borrowing costs attributable to contract \n     interest rates that exceed U.S. Treasury interest rates. \n     (Borrowing costs equivalent to the amount of Treasury \n     interest that would be paid if the equipment were financed \n     with appropriated funds are not counted against this \n     authority, consistent with the budget scorekeeping of regular \n     interest costs associated with federal spending; that is, \n     Treasury interest effects are not counted as a direct cost or \n     savings to any particular legislative provision.)\n       Since 1988, the Department of Energy estimates that \n     agencies have entered into ESPCs valued over $800 million, \n     $252 million of that in 2003 alone. CBO estimates that, \n     because the federal building inventory is aging, those \n     contracts would continue to be used--over time at roughly the \n     same rate as currently used--about $300 million in 2007 and \n     increasing with anticipated inflation in each of the \n     following years. Thus, we estimate that extending the \n     authorization for ESPCs would increase direct spending by \n     $2.9 billion over the 2007-2015 period.\n       Electric Reliability Organization. The bill would authorize \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to exercise \n     authority over the reliability of the nation's electricity \n     transmission system through the establishment of an Electric \n     Reliability Organization (ERO). Under the bill, FERC would \n     select an organization to become the ERO based on several \n     criteria, including the ability of the organization to charge \n     fees to end users of the electricity system to cover its \n     costs. CBO believes the ERO's collections and spending should \n     be included in the federal budget because this new entity \n     would conduct inherently governmental activities that could \n     not be undertaken by a purely private organization. FERC \n     would approve and enforce the collection of fees charged by \n     the ERO.\n       Based on information from the North American Electric \n     Reliability Council (NERC), CBO estimates that the newly \n     formed ERO and its regional affiliates would spend between \n     $75 million and $150 million a year. For this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that spending by the ERO and its regional affiliates \n     would start at $100 million a year and increase by the rate \n     of anticipated inflation. Thus, we estimate that spending by \n     the ERO would total about $100 million in 2006 and $1.1 \n     billion over the next 10 years.\n       Because the ERO and the regional organizations created by \n     it would be governmental in nature, CBO believes that the \n     collection of these fees should be recorded as revenues in \n     the budget. Based on information from NERC, CBO estimates \n     that net revenues collected by an ERO and its regional \n     organizations would total $75 million in 2006, $391 million \n     over the 2006-2010 period, and $820 million over the 2006-\n     2015 period.\n       Currently, the federal power marketing administrations, \n     including the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Bonneville \n     Power Administration, pay dues to the regional affiliates of \n     NERC. We would expect that those payments would continue and \n     would increase under the new regulatory scheme established by \n     the ERO. Any increase in those fees would be offset by \n     changes in the rates charged to customers of the federal \n     agencies.\n       Financing of Federal Electricity Transmission Projects. The \n     bill would authorize DOE's Western Area and Southwestern \n     Power Administrations to accept from private entities up to \n     $100 million to assist in the design, development, \n     construction, and operation of transmission projects that \n     would contribute to reducing congestion on existing \n     electricity lines. Such financing would be equivalent to \n     incurring new federal debt, and the spending of such borrowed \n     amounts should be recorded in the budget as direct spending. \n     We estimate that such spending would cost $10 million in 2007 \n     and $100 million over the 2007-2015 period.\n       Federal Oil and Natural Gas Programs. Title III would make \n     several changes to federal programs related to the production \n     of oil and natural gas. Several ofthese provisions would \n     provide private producers of those resources with various \n     forms of royalty relief or other credits that would reduce \n     federal receipts, particularly over the next few years. By \n     creating incentives for greater production of oil and natural \n     gas, CBO expects that net receipts from royalties would \n     eventually increase under some of those provisions, but not \n     for several years. Based on information from DOl, CBO \n     estimates that these provisions would result in a net loss of \n     offsetting receipts (a credit against direct spending) \n     totaling $8 million in 2006 and $87 million over the next 10 \n     years.\n       Assistance for Rural Communities with High Energy Costs. \n     Section 210 of the bill would require the Rural Utilities \n     Service (RUS) to change the loan terms offered to eligible \n     electric cooperatives in Alaska that currently have loans \n     provided by that agency. The bill would require that the term \n     of loans be changed to reduce the electricity rates charged \n     to customers. Under the Federal Credit Reform Act, the cost \n     of a loan modification is the change in the subsidy cost of \n     the loan (on a present value basis) because of the modified \n     loan terms. CBO estimates that the cost of this provision \n     would be $46 million and would be recorded in 2005, the \n     assumed year of enactment.\n       Based on information from RUS, CBO estimates that six \n     utilities would be eligible for the assistance authorized by \n     the bill. The bill would require that the agency provide\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\n     such assistance through deferrals, extensions, or reductions \n     of loans. Currently, the six eligible borrowers have a total \n     outstanding principal of $57 million, at an average interest \n     rate of about 3.5 percent. It is possible that the agency \n     could decide to provide zero-interest loans, or lengthen the \n     term of loans, thereby reducing payments owed to the \n     government. The legislation would authorize the agency to \n     forgive the full amount of the outstanding principal without \n     recourse to the borrowers. CBO assumes that the cooperatives \n     in the highest distress areas would apply for loan \n     forgiveness and the remaining cooperatives would apply to \n     receive zero-interest loans. CBO estimates that the net \n     present value for all payments that would have been provided \n     under current law results in a cost to the government of $46 \n     million, which would be recorded in 2005, the assumed year of \n     enactment.\n       Civil Penalties. The bill also could affect governmental \n     receipts and direct spending by establishing and increasing \n     certain civil and criminal penalties. CBO estimates that any \n     resulting increase in receipts and spending would be less \n     than $500,000 annually. Such penalties would be established \n     for violations of regulations relating to: Violations of the \n     Price-Anderson Act, Nuclear safety at nonprofit institutions, \n     willful destruction of a nuclear facility, the reliability of \n     the nation's electricity system, market trading of \n     electricity, and the sale of renewable fuels.\n       Section 385 would raise the maximum civil and criminal \n     penalty amounts imposed for violations of the Natural Gas Act \n     (NGA) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Currently the \n     maximum amount FERC may assess varies depending on the \n     violation, however, most fall between $500 and $25,000 per \n     violation. The bill would increase those amounts to as much \n     as $1 million for violations of the NGA. Based on information \n     from FERC, CBO expects that the penalty increases and the \n     additional civil penalty authority would serve as a \n     significant deterrent so that firms would very likely comply \n     with the regulations, resulting in no significant effect on \n     revenues.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: The bill \n     contains numerous mandates as defined in UMRA that would \n     affect both intergovernmental and private-sector entities.\n       CBO cannot determine the cost of all the mandates in the \n     bill because several of the requirements established by the \n     bill would hinge on future regulatory action about which \n     information is not available. Though CBO cannot estimate the \n     cost of each mandate, we expect that the total cost of \n     private-sector mandates in the bill would exceed the annual \n     threshold established in UMRA ($123 million in 2005, adjusted \n     annually for inflation). That conclusion is based on our \n     analysis of the renewable fuels standard, which would impose \n     II substantial costs on the motor fuels industry.\n       CBO estimates, however, that the total cost of complying \n     with intergovernmental mandates in the bill would not exceed \n     the threshold established in UMRA ($62 million in 2005, \n     adjusted annually for inflation). The bill also would \n     authorize numerous grants and initiatives that would benefit \n     state, local, and tribal governments; any costs those \n     governments incur for these projects and initiatives would \n     result from complying with conditions for receiving this \n     federal assistance.\n       Based on its review of the bill, CBO expects that the \n     mandates contained in the bill's titles lion renewable energy \n     (title II), nuclear energy (title VI), electricity (title \n     XII), and energy efficiency (title I) would have the greatest \n     impact on private-sector entities and state and local \n     governments.\n       Renewable Energy (Title II)--Renewable Fuels Standard\n       Section 204 would impose a private-sector mandate on \n     domestic refiners, blenders, and importers of gasoline by \n     requiring that gasoline sold or dispensed to consumers in the \n     contiguous United States contains a minimum volume of \n     renewable fuels. The bill also II would establish a credit \n     trading program for renewable fuels to allow producers who \n     use more ethanol than would be required to sell credits to \n     producers who would be in deficit. Those credits could only \n     be used in the same year they are generated. The required \n     volume of renewable fuel would start at 4.0 billion gallons \n     in 2006 and increase to 8.0 billion gallons by 2012. CBO \n     expects that the renewable fuels requirement would be met in \n     2006 without additional costs to the industry. The industry \n     would begin to experience additional costs in 2007 as it \n     begins to blend or purchase greater amounts of gasoline \n     containing renewable fuels than it would in the absence of a \n     standard. Based on Department of Energy estimates of the \n     price impacts of similar renewable fuels standards on \n     gasoline prices, CBO estimates that the direct costs of the \n     renewable fuel requirement on private-sector entities would \n     exceed UMRA's annual threshold for private-sector mandates.\n       Nuclear Matters (Title VI)--Increase in the Annual Premium\n       Under current law, in the event that losses from a nuclear \n     incident exceed the required amount of private insurance, \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensees (both public and \n     private) are assessed a charge to cover the shortfall in \n     damage coverage. Section 603 would increase the maximum \n     annual premium from $10 million to $15 million. CBO has \n     determined that raising the maximum annual premium would \n     increase the costs of existing mandates and would thereby \n     impose both intergovernmental and private-sector mandates \n     under UMRA. Because the probability of a nuclear accident \n     resulting in losses exceeding the amount of private insurance \n     coverage is low, CBO estimates that the annual costs for \n     public and private entities of complying with the mandates \n     (in expected value terms) would not be substantial over the \n     next five years.\n       Electricity (Title XII)\n       Mandatory Reliability Standards. Section 1211 would require \n     users of the bulk-power system to comply with standards \n     issued by a newly established Electric Reliability \n     Organization designated by the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission. Those users include intergovernmental entities \n     such as municipally owned utilities as well as private-sector \n     entities, including utilities, nonutility generators, and \n     marketers. Currently, the North American Electric Reliability \n     Council (NERC), a voluntary organization, promotes \n     electricity reliability. According to several industry \n     experts, almost all public and private-sector users of the \n     bulk power system voluntarily comply with standards issued by \n     NERC. The mandate would impose no significant additional \n     costs in the short term relative to current practice since \n     the ERO is not expected to significantly change current \n     standards. In the future, market conditions may prompt the \n     ERO to impose stricter standards to maintain reliability. In \n     that case, costs for users of the bulk power system-that \n     could otherwise elect to disregard NERC standards under \n     current law--could increase substantially.\n       Mandatory Assessments. Section 1211 would direct the ERO to \n     assess fees and dues to cover the costs of implementing and \n     enforcing ERO standards. Although there is some uncertainty \n     as to how those fees would be assessed, the most likely \n     scenario is that the ERO would assess fees on its members, \n     which is the current practice of NERC. As NERC members \n     include both public and private entities, such fees would \n     constitute intergovernmental and private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA.\n       CBO estimates that the increment in fee collections for the \n     proposed compliance, monitoring, ``and enforcement activities \n     under the bill would be about $50 million annually. Based on \n     industry data, CBO assumes that roughly 80 percent to 85 \n     percent of the collections would be borne by the private \n     sector and another 10 percent to 14 percent would be borne by \n     state and local government entities. The remainder would be \n     paid by federally owned entities.\n       Regulatory Fees. The bill would require FERC to assume \n     certain regulatory procedures that are currently under the \n     jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In \n     addition, the bill would require FERC to establish new rules \n     for managing the nation's electricity system and governing \n     the business practices of the electricity industry. Under \n     current law, FERC has the authority to collect fees from \n     investor-owned utility companies to offset its costs. The \n     duty to pay those fee increases would impose a private-sector \n     mandate on those entities. Based on information from FERC, \n     CBO expects that investor-owned utilities would have to pay \n     $11 million in 2006 and $47 million over the 2006-2010 \n     period.\n       State Authority Over Electric Utilities. Section 1221 would \n     preempt state authority to take action to ensure the safety, \n     adequacy, and reliability of electric service within that \n     state if the state's actions are inconsistent with the \n     federal reliability standards. This preemption of state \n     authority would impose no additional costs on state \n     governments.\n       Sections 1251, 1252, and 1254 would require state \n     regulators to review the use of net metering, time-based \n     metering, demand-response systems, and interconnection \n     services before permitting electric utilities to implement \n     these federal standards. These sections contain \n     intergovernmental mandates because they would increase a \n     state's responsibilities under the existing mandates in the \n     Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act. However, CBO \n     estimates that the states' costs to review additional \n     standards would not be significant.\n       Jurisdiction over the Termination Payments of Certain \n     Contracts. Section 1270 would grant the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission exclusive jurisdiction to determine \n     whether the requirement to pay termination payments under \n     certain contracts entered into between sellers and buyers of \n     wholesale electricity was unjust and unreasonable. These \n     contracts are currently before the Bankruptcy Court in the \n     Southern District of New York. FERC has asserted jurisdiction \n     over termination payments under wholesale power contracts for \n     periods a seller was found to be in violation of Commission \n     orders. While legislative provisions that would severely \n     limit or extinguish a person's rights in court have been \n     considered to be mandates under UMRA, CBO cannot determine if \n     the language in this provision would extinguish the sellers' \n     rights before the Bankruptcy Court or would simply make clear \n     FERC's jurisdiction over the termination payments.\n       Energy Efficiency (Title I)\n       Energy Conservation. Section 135 would direct the Secretary \n     of Energy to prescribe energy conservation standards \n     restricting ``standby-mode'' energy consumption of household \n     and commercial appliances. According to industry sources and \n     DOE, up to\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\n     9,000 types of household and commercial appliances could be \n     affected by this provision, and further, many such products \n     may require significant modification to meet the standard for \n     energy consumption in standby mode. DOE has not yet \n     determined how it would implement this provision. Therefore, \n     we cannot estimate the incremental cost to the industry of \n     meeting such requirements.\n       If DOE applies standards to the majority of products \n     potentially affected, costs to industry could be substantial. \n     The magnitude of the costs also depends on the stringency of \n     new standards that would affect the appliance manufacturers. \n     For example, the bill would require DOE to apply new energy \n     conservation standards to certain furnaces. Roughly three \n     million oil, gas, and electric furnaces would have to comply \n     with the new standards. According to a DOE report, the \n     incremental costs to manufacturers of improving energy \n     efficiency could range from $5 to $175 per unit, depending on \n     the level of the standard that must be met. If DOE applies \n     relatively high efficiency standards to the appliances \n     covered under the bill, the incremental costs to the industry \n     could be large, and thus could exceed UMRA's threshold for \n     private-sector mandates.\n       In prescribing the energy conservation standards required \n     under sections 135 and 136 for household appliances and \n     consumer products, the Secretary would preempt state and \n     local energy efficiency standards currently in place for \n     those products and appliances. CBO estimates that no costs \n     would result from this preemption.\n       Testing Requirements. Section 135 would direct the \n     Secretary of Energy to prescribe energy efficiency testing \n     requirements for appliances specified in the bill and future \n     appliances to be determined by the Secretary. The provision \n     would require manufacturers of those appliances to have their \n     appliances tested to determine energy efficiency ratings. The \n     testing and rating would be conducted by the DOE. CBO \n     estimates that the cost to comply with the mandate to have \n     appliances tested would not be large.\n       Ban of Mercury Vapor Lamp Ballasts. Section 135 would \n     prohibit the manufacturing and importing of mercury vapor \n     lamp ballasts after January 1, 2008. A ballast is an \n     electrical device for starting and regulating fluorescent and \n     certain other lamps. The mercury vapor lamp ballast has been \n     decreasing in its share of the market for ballasts during the \n     last 20 years. Moreover, according to industry contacts, few, \n     if any mercury vapor lamp ballasts are imported into the \n     United States. The majority of such ballasts are manufactured \n     in the United States for domestic use. According to industry \n     sources, mercury vapor lamp ballasts are now only \n     manufactured for rural street lights and residential \n     floodlights. Based on information provided by industry and \n     government sources, the value of annual shipments of such \n     ballasts amounts to about $15 million. The cost of the \n     mandate, measured in lost net income to the industry, would \n     be less than that amount.\n       Energy Efficiency Resources Program. Section 141 would \n     require ratemaking authorities for gas and electric utilities \n     (including states, local municipalities, or co-ops) to either \n     demonstrate that an energy efficiency resource program is in \n     effect or to hold a public hearing regarding the benefits and \n     feasibility of implementing an energy efficiency resources \n     program for electric and gas utilities. CBO estimates no \n     significant costs would result from this requirement.\n     Previous CBO estimates\n       Federal budget effects\n       On April 19, 2005, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. \n     1640, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as ordered reported by \n     the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 13, 2005. \n     Like this legislation, H.R. 1640 would authorize \n     appropriations for a wide array of energy-related activities. \n     Differences between the estimates of spending subject to \n     appropriation under this bill and H.R. 1640 reflect \n     differences in authorization levels, particularly for the \n     Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and activities \n     related to science and coastal impact assistance.\n       Like H.R. 1640, this legislation would authorize FERC to \n     establish an ERO to oversee the nation's electricity \n     transmission system. Both bills would authorize the new \n     organization to collect and spend fees (which would be \n     classified as revenues). However, H.R. 1640 would cap those \n     fees at $50 million a year. This legislation contains no such \n     cap; therefore, our estimates of direct spending and revenues \n     related to the proposed ERO are higher than under H.R. 1640.\n       CBO previously completed two cost estimates for bills that \n     would permanently authorize the use of ESPCs: H.R. 1640 and \n     H.R. 1533, the Federal Energy Management Improvement Act of \n     2005. CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 1533, as \n     ordered reported by the House Committee on Government Reform, \n     on April 13, 2005. Provisions of this legislation and H.R. \n     1533 related to ESPCs are similar; however, H.R. 1640 would \n     cap total payments under ESPCs at $500 million a year. \n     Therefore, our estimate of spending for ESPCs is lower under \n     H.R. 1640 than under this bill or H.R. 1533. Also, this bill \n     would authorize the use of ESPCs through 2016.\n       Finally, on May 23, 2005, CBO transmitted a cost estimate \n     for S. 606, the Reliable Fuels Act, as ordered reported by \n     the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on March \n     16, 2005. Like this legislation, S. 606 would require that \n     motor fuels sold by a refiner, blender, or importer contain \n     specified amounts of renewable fuel but with two key \n     differences. First, the required level of renewable fuels \n     under this bill would be higher than under S. 606. Second, S. \n     606 would allow producers of motor fuels to accumulate \n     ethanol-use credits for exceeding the ethanol target in any \n     year. Under S. 606, such credits could be used in subsequent \n     years to meet the ethanol target. In contrast, this \n     legislation contains no such provision for use of credits \n     over multiple years. As a result, CBO expects that demand for \n     corn-based ethanol under this bill would increase more than \n     under S. 606, leading to higher demand for corn and, \n     subsequently, a larger decrease in federal spending to \n     support farm prices and provide income to farmers.\n       Mandates\n       The bill includes many of the same state and local mandates \n     as in H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as approved by \n     the House Committee on Resources on April 20, 2005. However, \n     the estimate of state and local mandates in this bill is not \n     identical to the statement included in CBO's cost estimate \n     for that earlier legislation. Section 1502 of H.R. 6 is not \n     included in this bill. That provision would shield \n     manufacturers of motor fuels and other persons from liability \n     for claims based on defective product relating to motor \n     vehicle fuel containing methyl tertiary butyl ether or \n     renewable fuel. That provision in H.R. 6 would impose an \n     intergovernmental mandate as it would limit existing rights \n     to seek compensation under current law.\n       The state and local mandates in this bill that are the same \n     as the mandates in H.R. 6 include the increase in the \n     retrospective premiums, the mandatory reliability standards \n     and assessments, the state authority over electric utilities, \n     and the energy conservation provision. In contrast, section \n     141 of the legislation was not included in H.R. 6. That \n     provision would require ratemaking authorities for gas and \n     electric utilities (including states, local municipalities, \n     or co-ops) to either demonstrate that an energy efficiency \n     resource program is in effect or to hold a public hearing \n     regarding the benefits and feasibility of implementing an \n     energy efficiency resources program for regulated and \n     nonregulated electric and gas utilities. CBO estimates that \n     no significant costs would result from this requirement.\n       Regarding private-sector mandates, most of the mandates \n     contained in the bill were also contained in the legislation \n     considered in the House. H.R. 6 and H.R. 1640 contain \n     a mandate establishing a renewable fuel standard for motor \n     fuels, which would impose costs on refiners, importers, \n     and blenders of gasoline similar to the one in the \n     Renewable Fuels title of this bill. However, the renewable \n     fuels standard in the House bills would require the \n     industry to use a lower yearly level of renewable fuels \n     than the standard contained in this bill.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to cosponsor this \nlegislation, the ``Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund Maintenance Act'', \nwith my friend and Commerce Committee Chairman, Ted Stevens, as well as \nmy other Senate colleagues. As most people know, after the terrible \nincident involving the Exxon Valdez, Senator Stevens championed the \npassage of the Oil\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\nPollution Act of 1990, OPA 90, as well as the mechanism for providing \nfunding for the cleanup of oil spills.\n  That mechanism, known as the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, is now \nin danger. In a recent report to Congress, the United States Coast \nGuard predicted that the Fund will run out of money before 2009. Given \nthe recent spate of costly spills around the country, it may run out \nsooner. We simply cannot allow this to happen. The fund provides a \ncritically important safety net. It aids the cleanup of oil spills and \nprovides compensation to those harmed, particularly where no \nresponsible party is identified or the responsible parties have \ninsufficient resources.\n  Since the passage of OPA 90, we have significantly reduced the number \nand volume of oil spills in the U.S. Unfortunately, thousands of \ngallons of oil continue to be spilled into our waters every year, and \nthe cost of cleanup has increased substantially. The amount of oil \ncarried by tank vessels to and within the U.S. is predicted to \nincrease. While we pray that we will never have another major oil \nspill, we must be ready to respond if necessary.\n  The bill introduced today would reinstate an expired fee on oil \ncompanies of 5 cents per barrel of oil. The fee, which ceased January \n1, 1995, would increase the maximum principal amount of the fund from \n$1 billion to $3 billion, and if the fund drops below $2 billion, the \nfee would automatically be reinstated without the need for additional \nlegislative action. Five cents a barrel translates to approximately \n$0.0011 per gallon of gas--or one eighth of one cent--and is worth \nabout 3 cents per barrel in 1990 dollars. This is substantially less \nthan the original rate of 5 cents.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to take up this issue and pass this \nlegislation without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6399-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TAIWAN AND CHINA\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in recent weeks Lien Chan of Taiwan \nundertook the task of meeting with key leaders in the People's Republic \nof China. This was no small task as the gulf between the two sides is \nmuch wider than the Strait of Formosa.\n  The substantive accomplishments of Chairman Lien's recent mission to \nmainland China surely put to rest any accusations that the event was \nlittle more than a symbolic gesture. In fact, the practical results \nshould have a very positive impact on cross-strait trade, tourism, and \nculture if momentum can be maintained.\n  First and foremost, an essential mechanism of dialogue has been \nestablished, overcoming obstacles of politics and history. The \nprecedent has been set. Further talks between mainland China and Taiwan \nshould follow as a matter of course, to address a range of issues of \nmutual concern, provided there is enough goodwill on both sides. \nHowever, I think it is important to note that these meetings did not \ninclude elected officials of the Government of Taiwan. Although these \ninitial talks were an important step, it is essential that future talks \nbetween Taiwan and China include the rightly elected leaders of Taiwan \nfor there to be any real substance and hope for change.\n  Second, it seems that certain basic principles have been addressed \nthat should help Taipei and Beijing re-open negotiations on an equal \nfooting, even though they still disagree on the meaning of ``one \nChina'' and what Taiwan's international status is. The basic concept of \nending hostility and promoting cooperation has been embraced. Both \nsides believe it is a mistake to let small details create a deadlock \nforever, and that is a key principle for progress.\n  Third, even people who insist that all talk is meaningless unless it \nleads to policy changes should be able to admit that eliminating and/or \nreducing trade barriers on farm products, like fruit, is a concrete \nachievement. Both sides gain from such actions, and it sets a good \nexample for further progress later on down the road.\n  Fourth, it is to be commended by any free society when a tightly \ncontrolled country like mainland China agrees to negotiate to allow its \npeople to tour a democracy like Taiwan. Who knows what the long-term \nimplications may be, when those who know few liberties are one day \nallowed to visit and see for themselves what real freedom feels and \nlooks like.\n  Finally, even the most humorless critics surely must admit that \n``panda bear diplomacy'' still trumps political stalemate and \nhostility. Critics can call it symbolism, but even symbolism has \ndefinite practical value when it lifts spirits and relaxes tensions.\n  History will record that this mission was blessed with genuine \nsubstance as well as great potential in building bridges where none \nexisted before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6399-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6399-S6400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESS COLUMNS ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a column published recently by Lino A. \nGraglia in the Wall Street Journal, and another by Charles Krauthammer \nin the Washington Post, frame particularly well the debate we are \nhaving in the Senate on judicial nominations. I ask unanimous consent \nthat these columns be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 24, 2005]\n\n            Our Constitution Faces Death by Due ``Process''\n\n                          (By Lino A. Graglia)\n\n       The battles in Congress over the appointment of even lower \n     court federal judges reveal a recognition that federal judges \n     are now, to a large extent, our real lawmakers. Proposals to \n     amend the Constitution to remove lifetime tenure for Supreme \n     Court justices, or to require that rulings of \n     unconstitutionality be by more than a majority (5-4) vote, do \n     not address the source of the problem. The Constitution is \n     very difficult to amend--probably the most difficult of any \n     supposedly democratic government. If opponents of rule by \n     judges secure the political power to obtain an amendment, it \n     should be one that addresses the problem at its source, which \n     is that contemporary constitutional law has very little to do \n     with the Constitution.\n       Judge-made constitutional law is the product of judicial \n     review--the power of judges to disallow policy choices made \n     by other officials of government, supposedly on the ground \n     that they are prohibited by the Constitution. Thomas \n     Jefferson warned that judges, always eager to expand their \n     own jurisdiction, would ``twist and shape'' the Constitution \n     ``as an artist shapes a ball of wax.'' This is exactly what \n     has happened.\n       The Constitution is a very short document, easily printed \n     on a dozen pages. The Framers wisely meant to preclude very \n     few policy choices that legislators, at least as committed to \n     American principles of government as judges, would have \n     occasion to make.\n       The essential irrelevance of the Constitution to \n     contemporary constitutional law should be clear enough from \n     the fact that the great majority of Supreme Court rulings of \n     unconstitutionality involve state, not federal, law; and \n     nearly all of them purport to be based on a single \n     constitutional provision, the 14th Amendment--in fact, on \n     only four words in one sentence of the Amendment, ``due \n     process'' and ``equal protection.'' The 14th Amendment has to \n     a large extent become a second constitution, replacing the \n     original.\n       It does not require jurisprudential sophistication to \n     realize that the justices do not decide controversial issues \n     of social policy by studying those four words. No question of \n     interpretation is involved in any of the Court's \n     controversial constitutional rulings, because there is \n     nothing to interpret. The states did not lose the power to \n     regulate abortion in 1973 in Roe v. Wade because Justice \n     Harry Blackmun discovered in the due process clause of the \n     14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, the purported basis of the \n     decision, something no one noticed before. The problem is \n     that the Supreme Court justices have made the due process and \n     equal protection clauses empty vessels into which they can \n     pour any meaning. This converts the clauses into simple \n     transferences of policy-making power from elected legislators \n     to the justices, authorizing a Court majority to remove any \n     policy issue from the ordinary political process and assign \n     it to themselves for decision. This fundamentally changes the \n     system of government created by the Constitution\n       The basic principles of the Constitution are representative \n     democracy, federalism and the separation of powers, which \n     places all lawmaking power in an elected legislature with the \n     judiciary merely applying the law to individual cases. \n     Undemocratic and centralized lawmaking by the judiciary is \n     the antithesis of the constitutional system.\n       The only justification for permitting judges to invalidate \n     a policy choice made in the ordinary political process is \n     that the choice is clearly prohibited by the Constitution--\n     ``clearly,'' because in a democracy the judgment of elected \n     legislators should prevail in cases of doubt. Judicially \n     enforced constitutionalism raises the issue, as Jefferson \n     also pointed out, of rule of the living by the dead. But our \n     problem is not constitutionalism but judicial activism--the \n     invalidation by judges of policy choices not clearly (and \n     rarely even arguably) prohibited by the Constitution. We are \n     being ruled not by the dead but by judges all too much alive.\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\n       Because most of the Supreme Court's activist rulings of \n     unconstitutionality purport to be based on a 14th Amendment \n     that it has deprived of specific meaning, the problem can be \n     very largely solved by simply restoring the 14th Amendment to \n     its original meaning, or by giving it any specific meaning. \n     The 14th Amendment was written after the Civil War to provide \n     a national guarantee of basic civil rights to blacks. If a \n     constitutional amendment could be adopted reconfining the \n     14th Amendment to that purpose or, better still, expanding it \n     to a general prohibition of all official racial \n     discrimination, the Court's free-hand remaking of domestic \n     social policy for the nation would largely come to an end. If \n     the justices lost the ability to invalidate state law on the \n     basis of their political preferences, their ability and \n     willingness to invalidate federal law on this basis would \n     likely also diminish.\n       Plato argued for government by philosopher-kings, but who \n     could argue for a system of government by lawyer-kings? No \n     one can argue openly that leaving the final decision on \n     issues of basic social policy to majority vote of nine \n     lawyers--unelected and life-tenured, making policy decisions \n     for the nation as a whole from Washington, D.C.--is an \n     improvement on the democratic federalist system created by \n     the Constitution. Yet that is the form of government we now \n     have.\n       The claim that the Court's rulings of unconstitutionality \n     are mandates of the Constitution, or anything more than \n     policy preferences of a majority of the justices, is false. \n     Rule by judges is in violation, not enforcement, of the \n     Constitution. Ending it requires nothing more complex than \n     insistence that the Court's rulings of unconstitutionality \n     should be based on the Constitution--which assigns ``All \n     legislative Power'' to Congress--in fact as well as name.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 10, 2005]\n\n                      From Thomas, Original Views\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Justice Thomas: ``Dope is cool.''\n       Justice Scalia: ``Let the cancer patients suffer.''\n       If the headline writers characterized Supreme Court \n     decisions the way many senators and most activists and \n     lobbying groups do, that is how they would have characterized \n     the Supreme Court decision this week on the use of medical \n     marijuana in California. It was ruled illegal because the \n     federal law prohibiting it supersedes the state law \n     permitting it. Scalia agreed with the decision. Thomas \n     dissented.\n       In our current, corrupted debates about the judges, you \n     hear only about results. Priscilla Owen, we were told (by the \n     Alliance for Justice), ``routinely backs corporations against \n     worker and consumer protections.'' Well, in what \n     circumstances? In adjudicating what claims? Under what \n     constitutional doctrine?\n       The real question is never what judges decide but how they \n     decide it. The Scalia-Thomas argument was not about concern \n     for cancer patients, the utility of medical marijuana or the \n     latitude individuals should have regarding what they ingest.\n       It was about what the Constitution's commerce clause \n     permits and, even more abstractly, who decides what the \n     commerce clause permits. To simplify only slightly, Antonin \n     Scalia says: Supreme Court precedent. Clarence Thomas says: \n     the Founders, as best we can interpret their original intent.\n       The Scalia opinion (concurring with the majority opinion) \n     appeals to dozens of precedents over the past 70 years under \n     which the commerce clause was vastly expanded to allow the \n     federal government to regulate what had, by the time of the \n     New Deal, become a highly industrialized country with a \n     highly nationalized economy.\n       Thomas's dissent refuses to bow to such 20th-century \n     innovations. While Scalia's opinion is studded with \n     precedents, Thomas pulls out founding-era dictionaries (plus \n     Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention, the \n     Federalist Papers and the ratification debates) to understand \n     what the word commerce meant then. And it meant only ``trade \n     or exchange'' (as distinct from manufacture) and not, as we \n     use the term today, economic activity in general. By this \n     understanding, the federal government had no business \n     whatsoever regulating privately and medicinally grown \n     marijuana.\n       This is constitutional ``originalism'' in pure form. Its \n     attractiveness is that it imposes discipline on the courts. \n     It gives them a clear and empirically verifiable \n     understanding of constitutional text--a finite boundary \n     beyond which even judges with airs must not go.\n       And if conditions change and parts of the originalist \n     Constitution become obsolete, amend it. Democratically. We \n     have added 17 amendments since the Bill of Rights. Amending \n     is not a job for judges.\n       The position represented by Scalia's argument in this case \n     is less ``conservative.'' It recognizes that decades of \n     precedent (which might have, at first, taken constitutional \n     liberties) become so ingrained in the life of the country, \n     and so accepted as part of the understanding of the modern \n     Constitution, that it is simply too revolutionary, too \n     legally and societally disruptive, to return to an original \n     understanding long abandoned.\n       And there is yet another view. With Thomas's originalism at \n     one end of the spectrum and Scalia's originalism tempered by \n     precedent--rolling originalism, as it were--in the middle, \n     there is a third notion, championed most explicitly by \n     Justice Stephen Breyer, that the Constitution is a living \n     document and that the role of the court is to interpret and \n     reinterpret it continually in the light of new ideas and new \n     norms.\n       This is what our debate about judges should be about. \n     Instead, it constantly degenerates into arguments about \n     results.\n       Two years ago, Thomas (and Scalia and William Rehnquist) \n     dissented from the court's decision to invalidate a Texas law \n     that criminalized sodomy. Thomas explicitly wrote, ``If I \n     were a member of the Texas Legislature, I would vote to \n     repeal it.'' However, since he is a judge and not a \n     legislator, he could find no principled way to use a \n     Constitution that is silent on this issue to strike down the \n     law. No matter. If Thomas were nominated tomorrow for chief \n     justice you can be sure that some liberal activists would \n     immediately issue a news release citing Thomas's ``hostility \n     to homosexual rights.''\n       And they will undoubtedly cite previous commerce clause \n     cases--Thomas joining the majority of the court in striking \n     down the Gun Free School Zones Act and parts of the Violence \n     Against Women Act--to show Thomas's ``hostility to women's \n     rights and gun-free schools.''\n       I hope President Bush nominates Thomas to succeed Rehnquist \n     as chief justice, not just because honoring an originalist \n     would be an important counterweight to the irresistible \n     modern impulse to legislate from the bench but, perhaps more \n     importantly, to expose the idiocy of the attacks on Thomas \n     that will inevitably be results-oriented: hostile toward \n     women, opposed to gun-free schools . . . and pro-marijuana?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6400-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6400-S6401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VETERANS HEALTHCARE AND EQUITABLE ACCESS ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on a matter of great \nimportance, the state of care received by America's veterans. On April \n28. I proudly introduced the Veterans' Healthcare and Equitable Access \nAct of 2005, which will honor America's veterans with the dignity and \nrespect they have earned. This legislation was inspired by my work on \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I have had the privilege to \ncome face to face with real heroes, like injured veterans returning \nfrom the battlefield and grieving survivors who proudly and bravely \ncarry the memory of a fallen soldier with them as they struggle to move \non. I have been moved by this experience and I offered this bill to \nhonor their sacrifice and their struggles.\n  The Veterans' Healthcare and Equitable Access Act of 2005 takes a \ncomprehensive approach to fix some of the major problems facing \nveterans today. Since I was a member of the House of Representatives, I \nhave supported mandatory funding, and the legislation I have introduced \nunderscores that commitment. The widening gap between demand for care \nand funding is a problem that must be faced head on and dealt with \nbefore it spirals out of control. The Veterans' Healthcare Eligibility \nAct and the Veterans' Millennium Healthcare Care and Benefits Act \nchanged the nature of the VA, but did not change the manner in which \nthe VA was funded. That is why I support mandatory funding for \nveterans' healthcare, so the VA can finally provide care to those who \ncared for us.\n  This bill will also end another problem that has plagued veterans in \nmy home state for years: access to quality healthcare and equitable \nreimbursement for travel expenses. My legislation will allow rural \nveterans who are enrolled in the VA to obtain health care at local \nmedical facilities closer to home or to travel to a VA facility and \nrecelve travel reimbursements at the same rate as Federal employees.\n  The veterans population is aging and we are losing great men and \nwomen every day. Today, the GI's who fought in Vietnam are reaching the \nage of retirement and Medicare eligibility. It is therefore unfair to \nask the VA to shoulder a cost that Medicare should help pay for. Aging \nveterans are seeking care at the VA because it is one of the best care \nproviders in the country. As I see it, the VA and Medicare need to \nshare this cost in order to provide excellent care to those who need it \nmost.\n  In March, I met Major Tammy Duckworth, an Army pilot who lost both of \nher legs after a rocket propelled grenade hit the Black Hawk helicopter \nshe was in while flying in the skies above Iraq. Although now a double \namputee, she is determined to both walk and fly helicopters again. \nMajor Duckworth has my full support, but needless to say her life has \nbeen changed forever. That is why the legislation I introduced would \nrequire that a service member who has lost a limb from a service-\nconnected injury receive\n\n[[Page S6401]]\n\na disability rating of not less than 50 percent. This is our way of \nsaying thank you and helping our veterans achieve their dreams.\n  Some of the hardest hit victims of this war are not soldiers or \nveterans, but survivors of the fallen. These brave men and women need \nour help. This year I voted to extend survivor benefits from $12,000 to \n$100,000 and to extend military housing privileges from 6 months to 1 \nyear. To complete our support for survivors, my bill will extend \nchildcare privileges for survivors from 6 months to 2 years in any \nFederal childcare program, giving surviving family members the help \nthey need to grieve, heal, and move on from a painful loss.\n  Mr. President, legislation such as this is not without costs and it \nwill require the Senate to make difficult choices. Sending troops into \nharm's way is a difficult choice, even when that choice is clearly \njustifiable, like it is in Iraq and Afghanistan. But taking care of \nveterans and their families is not a difficult choice, it is one we \nmust embrace. As General Omar Bradley once said: ``We are dealing with \nveterans, not procedure--with their problems, not ours.''\n  Scripture tells us there is a time for everything, a time for peace \nand a time for war. America is facing a time of war, and we are \nfighting an evil and determined enemy. We have to ensure that the men \nand women who are bearing the burden of this war are cared for and are \nconfident they can count on their government in their hour of need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement be entered into the \nRecord as if read.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6401-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE NORTHERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S SOFTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I wish today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town of \nKennebec, SD. Kennebec has a strong sense of past and anticipates a \nbright future.\n  Since 1924, Kennebec has been the county seat for Lyman County, \nlocated in central South Dakota. Few people lived in the area prior to \nthe town's establishment in 1905, as it was challenging to import the \nsupplies necessary to sustain a substantial population. In 1905, \nhowever, railroad tracks were laid through the area, thus making it \nsignificantly easier for residents to build homes and other structures, \nsince materials no longer needed to be hauled in from surrounding towns \nand cities. The railroad and influx of people mark the birth of \nKennebec. By 1907, Kennebec was a bustling prairie town full of diverse \nand eager residents.\n  As years passed and the town flourished, a number of businesses \nopened, such as the hardware store operated by Albert Williamson. In \naddition to running the hardware store, Williamson also edited and \nprinted the county newspaper known as the Prairie Sun. Also around this \ntime, Sam Abdnor built and operated a store that survives to this day \nas the Kennebec movie theatre. Many of my colleagues will recognize the \nsurname ``Abdnor'' and will recall that former U.S. Senator Jim Abdnor \nhails from Kennebec. He served admirably as Lt. Governor, in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives for 8 years and in this body for an additional \n6 years, having never forgotten the community of Kennebec or its \npeople.\n  In the town's early days, there was only a single doctor in Kennebec, \nand water had to be hauled by horse-drawn wagons from wells over a mile \nand a half to the north of the community. All other needs were met by \nthe railroad, which delivered merchandise to the stores and shops, as \nwell as thousands of tons of coal, which was required to heat homes in \nKennebec during the long winters. Not only did the railroad allow \nimports into town, but it also fostered the transport of Kennebec's \nmain exports, which included cattle, sheep and hogs.\n  Kennebec had no electrical power until 1914, when John Spotts of \nArmour, SD moved into town. Spotts bought a track of land southeast of \nKennebec and built a two-story brick building with a full size \nbasement. The upper floors provided a dance floor and silent movie \ntheater for Kennebec residents, while the basement served as the first \nelectric power plant in the town.\n  After a hundred years, Kennebec supports a population of over 280 \ncitizens and continues to modernize and improve itself in its role to \nserve the farmers and ranchers throughout the region. Kennebec's proud \ncitizens celebrate their 100th anniversary on June 18, 2005, and it is \nwith great honor that I share with my colleagues the achievements made \nby this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6401-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6401-S6402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE CITY OF RELIANCE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I \npublicly recognize the 100th anniversary of the founding of the city of \nReliance, SD. It is at this time that I would like to draw your \nattention to and commemorate the achievements and history of this \ncharming city on the western prairie, which stands as an enduring \ntribute to the moral fortitude and pioneer spirit of the earliest \nDakotans.\n  Located in Lyman County in western South Dakota, the original town-\nsite of Reliance was plotted in the summer of 1905 after officials \ndecided the new railroad's route would not include the already-\nestablished towns in the area. As a result, a new town was created on \nthe homestead of Mr. C.C. Herron in order to service the Milwaukee \nRailroad. This original town-site, located on the southwest quarter of \nSection 21, encompassed a mere eight blocks. However, several additions \nwere made to this small city between 1905 and 1910 with the help of the \nMilwaukee Land Company. Today, the town is nearly one square mile in \narea.\n  Reliance's early years proved to be incredibly prosperous. The Dirks \nMercantile Company, a two-story building used for general store \nbusiness and public gatherings, was a central part of life in the early \nyears of this small city. An advertisement in the Lyman County Record \nstated that Dirks Mercantile Company ``would buy anything you wanted to \nsell and sell anything you wanted to buy.''\n  Reliance grew rapidly and in less than a decade came to include two \nsaloons, two blacksmith shops, two banks, two lumberyards, a livery \nbarn, three stores, two hardware stores, one creamery, three elevators, \none harness shop, one cafe, and two hotels.\n  Like many small agricultural communities in the area, Reliance \nexperienced a great deal of economic prosperity in the years after \nWorld War I. In 1918, the town became the first in Lyman County to \nprovide a 4-year accredited high school.\n  Today, Reliance is a popular fishing spot thanks to the dam built by \nthe Works Project Administration (WPA) during the 1930s. The dam was \nheavily stocked with several species of fish and provides sportsmen \nwith the opportunity to enjoy the recreational treasures of South \nDakota.\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\n  While the small city of Reliance boasted a population of 317 at its \npeak in 1920, the town has seen small declines in recent years, and is \nhome to 206 residents today. Despite its small size, in the years since \nits founding, Reliance has proven its ability to thrive and serve \nfarmers and ranchers throughout the region. The proud residents of \nReliance will celebrate their vibrant history and the legacy of the \npioneer spirit to which our small cities stand as a living shrine with \nits 100th anniversary on July 25, 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6402-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE TOWN OF PRESHO, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to honor and \npublicly recognize the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town of \nPresho, SD. As the 100th anniversary approaches, Presho looks back on a \nproud history and looks forward to a promising future.\n  Named by the town's first Postmaster, Chris Hellekson, Presho is \nnamed for the extinct county in which it was originally located, Presho \nCounty. Now located in Lyman County, Presho was platted in June of 1905 \nwhen the Milwaukee Land Company purchased a plot of land from Sidney F. \nHockersmith. On November 9, 1905, the Milwaukee Land Company divided \nthe land into 16 lots and held a public auction. Peter B. Dirks and \nE.M. Sedgwick purchased the first lot for $500, and within eight \nminutes of completing the sale, Presho's first bank was moved onto the \nsite, having already completed its initial transaction while en route.\n  Despite being only .7 square miles in area, Presho drew an enormous \npopulation as newcomers took the Milwaukee Railroad as far west as it \nwent. Until 1906, the westernmost point was Presho, SD. Once the \nrailroad was extended farther, however, Presho's population, which \ntotaled 2,000 at its peak, gradually decreased. Currently, about 600 \nresidents live in this flourishing community.\n  One of the town's most notable historic events was its first Fourth \nof July celebration and auto race, which took place in 1906. In fact, \nit is thought that this auto race is the first ever held west of the \nMissouri River. At least 5,000 people were in attendance.\n  Mr. President, Presho's proud residents celebrate their community's \ncentennial anniversary on July 4, 2005, and it is with great honor that \nI share with my colleagues the history of this great community. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6402-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CAM NEELY'S INDUCTION INTO THE NHL HALL OF FAME\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Cam Neely was recently inducted into \nthe Hockey Hall of Fame. That is the highest honor for a professional \nathlete, but I believe it is appropriate for us to honor him in the \nHalls of Congress as well. Cam Neely is a special citizen, one worthy \nof recognition and emulation.\n  As a hockey player, Cam Neely was unique. His rare combination of \nstrength, size and skill made him difficult to stop and feared by all \nopponents. Whether fighting through pain or battles on the boards, Cam \nNeely's play taught us the meaning of hard work and perseverance. His \ncareer may have been cut short by injury, but there is no doubt that \nCam Neely was one of the finest players to wear a Boston Bruins \nuniform, and indeed one of the greatest ``power forwards'' ever to play \nthe game.\n  Since hanging up his skates, Cam Neely has devoted his life to \nservice. The Cam Neely Foundation has raised over $11 million in the \nlast decade to help cancer patients and their families during \ntreatment. Thousands of New England families have found hope during \ndifficult times due to the generosity and hard work of Cam Neely.\n  In his first career, Cam Neely brought us all the joy of victory. In \nhis second career, Cam Neely brings joy to families who need it most, \nwhile providing a model of service to his countless fans. Cam Neely is \nan American in whom we can all be proud and who deserves our \nrecognition today for a career that has been hall of fame in every \nrespect. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6402-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S LACROSSE\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, on May 22, 2005, the women's \nlacrosse team from Northwestern University captured the NCAA Division I \nchampionship. This was the first championship for the Wildcats' women's \nlacrosse team and the first women's lacrosse champion to come from \noutside of the eastern time zone.\n  This championship also marks a milestone for Northwestern sports. It \nis the first ever women's team championship for the university and only \nthe second team championship in school history. The men's fencing team \nwas national champion in 1941.\n  This talented and dedicated team from the great State of Illinois \nsecured the championship by defeating traditional lacrosse powerhouses, \nDartmouth and Princeton. The Wildcats completed their undefeated, 21 \nwin season with a 13-10 victory over defending champion Virginia. Since \nregaining varsity status in 2002, this outstanding program has taken \nonly four seasons to capture the championship.\n  Congratulations to Abby Bangser, Donna McCann, Sarah Albrecht, \nKristen Kjellman, Sara Crosby, Aly Josephs, Kristen Boege, Ashley \nKoester, Courtney Koester, Hilary Alley, Ashley Gersuk, Courtney Flynn, \nChristy Finch, Lindsey Munday, Emily Lovett, Laura Glassanos, Shelby \nChlopak, Kaitie Lenahan, Lynda McCandlish, Abby Alley, Sarah Walsh, \nLindsay Finocchiaro, Jenny Bush, Fallon McGraw, Quinn Cammarota, \nLindsay North, Meredith Philipp, Hannah Whitman, Rebecca Zazove, Annie \nElliott, Bailey Su, Kate Darmody, Minnie Doherty, Kim Corcoran, Head \nCoach Kelly Amonte Hiller, Assistant Coach Alexis Venechanos, Assistant \nCoach Danielle Shearer, and Assistant Coach Scott Hiller.\n  Please join me in congratulating the Northwestern women's lacrosse \nteam on its historic championship season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/13/senate-section/article/S6402-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6402-S6404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2545.

A bill to expand access to affordable health care and to \nstrengthen the health care safety net and make health care services \nmore available in rural and underserved areas; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, in introducing the Access to \nAffordable Health Care Act, a comprehensive, seven-point plan that \nbuilds on the strengths of our current public programs and private \nhealth care system to make quality, affordable health care available to \nmillions more Americans.\n  One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to \naffordable health care for all Americans. There are still far too many \nAmericans without health insurance or with woefully inadequate \ncoverage. As many as 45 million Americans--almost 16 percent of our \npopulation--are uninsured, and millions more are underinsured.\n  Health care coverage matters. The simple fact is that people with \nhealth insurance are healthier than those who are uninsured. People \nwithout health insurance are less likely to seek care when they need \nit, and to forgo services such as periodic check ups and preventive \nservices. As a consequence, they are more likely to be hospitalized or \nrequire costly medical attention for conditions that could have been \nprevented or treated at a curable stage. Not only does this put the \nhealth of these individuals at greater risk, but it also puts \nadditional pressure on our hospitals and emergency rooms, many of them \nalready financially challenged.\n  Compared with people who have health coverage, uninsured adults are \nfour times, and uninsured children five times, more likely to use the \nemergency rooms. The costs of care for these individuals are often \nabsorbed by providers and passed on to the covered population through \nincreased fees and insurance premiums.\n  Maine is in the midst of a growing health insurance crisis, \nwith insurance premiums rising at alarming rates. Whether I am talking \nto a self-employed fisherman, a displaced worker, the owner of a \nstruggling small business, or the human resource manager of a large \ncompany, the soaring costs of health insurance is a common concern.\n\n  Maine's employers are currently facing premium increases of as much \nas 20 percent a year. These premiums have been particularly burdensome \nfor small businesses, the backbone of the Maine economy. Many small \nbusiness owners are caught in a cost-squeeze: they know that if they \npass on the premium increases to their employees, more of them will \ndecline coverage. Yet these small businesses simply cannot afford to \nabsorb double-digit increases in their health insurance premiums year \nafter year.\n  The problem of rising costs is even more acute for individuals and \nfamilies who must purchase health insurance on their own. Monthly \nhealth insurance premiums in Maine often exceed a family's mortgage \npayment. It is no wonder that as many as 150,000 Mainers are uninsured. \nClearly, we must do more to make our health care system more efficient \nand health insurance more available and affordable.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act, which we are introducing \ntoday, is a seven-point plan that combines a variety of public and \nprivate approaches to make quality health care coverage more affordable \nand available. The legislation's seven goals are:\n  No. 1. To expand access to affordable health care for small \nbusinesses;\n  No. 2. To make health insurance more affordable for individuals and \nfamilies purchasing coverage on their own;\n  No. 3. To strengthen the health care safety net for those without \ncoverage;\n  No. 4. To expand access to care in rural and under-served areas;\n  No. 5. To increase access to affordable long-term care;\n  No. 6. To promote healthier lifestyles;\n  And No. 7, to provide more equitable Medicare payments to Maine \nproviders to reduce the Medicare shortfall, which has forced hospitals, \nphysicians and other providers to shift costs onto other payers in the \nform of higher charges, which, in turn drives up health care premiums.\n\n  Let me discuss each of these seven points in more detail.\n  First, our legislation will help small employers cope with rising \nhealth care costs.\n  Since most Americans get their health insurance through the \nworkplace, it is a common assumption that people without health \ninsurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that most uninsured \nAmericans are members of families with at least one full-time worker. \nAs many as 82 percent of Americans who do not have health insurance are \nin a family with a worker.\n  Uninsured working Americans are most often employees of small \nbusinesses. In fact, some 60 percent of uninsured workers are employed \nby small firms. Smaller firms generally face higher costs for health \ninsurance than larger firms, which makes them less likely to offer \ncoverage. Small businesses want to provide health insurance for their \nemployees, but the cost of often just too high.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help small employers \ncope with rising costs by providing new tax credits for small \nbusinesses to help make health insurance more affordable. It will \nencourage those small businesses that do not currently offer health \ninsurance to do so and will help employers that do offer insurance to \ncontinue coverage for their employees even in the face of rising costs.\n  Our legislation will also help increase the clout of small businesses \nin\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\nnegotiating with insurers. Premiums are generally higher for small \nbusinesses because they do not have as much purchasing power as large \ncompanies, which limits their ability to bargain for lower rates. They \nalso have higher administrative costs because they have fewer employees \namong whom to spread the fixed cost of a health benefits plan. \nMoreover, they are not as able to spread the risks of medical claims \nover as many employees as large firms.\n  Our legislation will help address these problems by authorizing \nFederal grants to provide start-up funding to States to assist them \nwith the planning, development and operation of small employer \npurchasing cooperatives. These cooperatives will help to reduce health \ncare costs for small employers by allowing them to band together to \npurchase health insurance jointly. Group purchasing cooperatives have a \nnumber of advantages for small employers. For example, the increased \nnumber of participants in the group help to lower the premium costs for \nall. Moreover, they decrease the risk of adverse selection and spread \nthe cost of health care over a broader group.\n\n  The legislation would also authorize a Small Business Administration \ngrant program for States, local governments and non-profit \norganizations to provide information about the benefits of health \ninsurance to small employers, including tax benefits, increased \nproductivity of employees, and decreased turnover. These grants would \nalso be used to make employers aware of their current rights under \nState and Federal laws. While costs are clearly a problem, many small \nemployers are not fully aware of laws that have already been enacted by \nboth States and Federal Government to make health insurance more \naffordable. For example, in one survey, 57 percent of small employers \ndid not know that they could deduct 100 percent of their health \ninsurance premiums as a business expense.\n  The legislation would also create a new program to encourage \ninnovation by awarding demonstration grants in up to 10 States \nconducting innovative coverage expansions, such as alternative group \npurchasing or pooling arrangements, individual or small group market \nreforms, or subsidies to employers or individuals purchasing coverage. \nThe States have long been laboratories for reform, and they should be \nencouraged in the development of innovative programs that can serve as \nmodels for the Nation.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will also expand access to \naffordable health care for individuals and families.\n  One of the first bills I cosponsored as a Senator was legislation to \nestablish the State Children's Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP, which \nprovides insurance for the children of low-income parents who cannot \nafford health insurance, yet make too much money to qualify for \nMedicaid. This important program has provided affordable health \ninsurance coverage to an estimated six million children nationwide, \nincluding almost 13,000 who are currently enrolled in the MaineCare \nprogram. Even so, nationwide, millions of qualified children have yet \nto be enrolled in this program, many because their parents simply don't \nknow that they are eligible for the assistance.\n  Our legislation builds on the success of this program and gives \nStates a number of new tools to increase participation. The bill \nauthorizes new grants for States and non-profit organizations to \nconduct innovative outreach and enrollment efforts to ensure that all \neligible children are covered. States would also have the option of \ncovering the parents of the children who are enrolled in programs like \nMaineCare. States could also use funds provided through this program to \nhelp eligible working families pay their share of an employer-based \nhealth insurance plan. In short, the legislation will help ensure that \nthe entire family receives the health care they need.\n\n  And finally, to help make health coverage more affordable for low- \nand middle-income individuals and families who do not have employer-\nprovided coverage and who are not eligible for the expanded public \nprograms, our legislation would provide an advanceable, refundable tax \ncredit of up to $1,000 for individuals earning up to $30,000 and up to \n$3,000 for families earning up to $60,000. This could provide coverage \nfor up to 6 million Americans who would otherwise be uninsured for one \nor more months, and will help many more working lower-income families \nwho currently purchase private health insurance with little or no \ngovernment help.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Insurance Act will also help to \nstrengthen our Nation's health care safety net by doubling funding over \n5 years for the Consolidated Health Centers program, which includes \ncommunity, migrant, public housing and homeless health centers. These \ncenters, which operate in underserved urban and rural communities, \nprovide critical primary care services to millions of Americans, \nregardless of their ability to pay. About 20 percent of the patients \ntreated at Maine's community health centers have no insurance coverage \nand many more have inadequate coverage, so these centers are a critical \npart of our Nation's health care safety net.\n  The problem of access to affordable health care services is not \nlimited to the uninsured, but is also shared by many Americans living \nin rural and underserved areas where there is a serious shortage of \nhealth care providers. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act \ntherefore calls for increased funding for the National Health Service \nCorps, which supports doctors, dentists, and other clinicians who serve \nin rural and inner city areas.\n  The legislation will also give the program greater flexibility by \nallowing National Health Service Corps participants to fulfill their \ncommitment on a part-time basis. Current law requires all National \nHealth Service Corps participants to serve full-time. Many rural \ncommunities, however, simply do not have enough volume to support a \nfull-time health care practitioner. Moreover, some sites may not need a \nparticular type of provider--for example, a dentist--on a full-time \nbasis. Some practitioners may also find part-time service more \nattractive, which, in turn, could improve recruitment and retention. \nOur bill therefore gives the program additional flexibility to meet \ncommunity needs.\n\n  Long-term care is the major catastrophic health care expense faced by \nolder Americans today, and these costs will only increase with the \naging of the baby boomers. Most Americans mistakenly believe that \nmedicare or their private health insurance policies will cover the cost \nof long-term care should they develop a chronic illness or cognitive \nimpairment like Alzheimer's Disease. Unfortunately, far too many do not \ndiscover that they do not have coverage until they are confronted with \nthe difficult decision of placing a much-loved parent or spouse in \nlong-term care and facing the shocking realization that they will have \nto cover the costs themselves.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will provide a tax credit \nfor long-term care expenses of up to $3,000 to provide some help to \nthose families struggling to provide long-term care to a loved one. It \nwill also encourage more Americans to plan for their future long-term \ncare needs by providing a tax deduction to help them purchase long-term \ncare insurance.\n  Health insurance alone is not going to ensure good health. As noted \nauthor and physician Dr. Michael Crichton has observed, ``the future of \nmedicine lies not in treating illness, but preventing it.'' Many of our \nmost serious health problems are directly related to unhealthy \nbehaviors--smoking, lack of regular exercise and poor diet. These three \nmajor risk factors alone have made Maine the state with the fourth \nhighest death rate due to four largely preventable diseases: \ncardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes. \nThese four chronic diseases are responsible for 70 percent of the \nhealth care problems in Maine.\n  Our bill therefore contains a number of provisions designed to \npromote healthy lifestyles. An ever-expanding body of evidence shows \nthat these kinds of investments in health promotion and prevention \noffer returns not only in reduced health care bills, but in longer life \nand increased productivity. The legislation will provide grants to \nStates to assist small businesses wishing to establish ``worksite \nwellness'' programs for their employees. It would also authorize a \ngrant program to support new and existing ``community partnerships,'' \nsuch as the Healthy Community Coalition in\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\nMaine's Franklin County, to promote healthy lifestyles among hospitals, \nemployers, schools and community organizations. And, it would provide \nfunds for States to establish or expand comprehensive school health \neducation, including, for example, physical education programs that \npromote lifelong physical activity, healthy food service selections, \nand programs that promote a healthy and safe school environment. \n\n  Finally, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act would promote \ngreater equity in Medicare payments and help to ensure that the \nMedicare system rewards rather than punishes States like Maine that \ndeliver high-quality, cost-effective Medicare services to our elderly \nand disabled citizens.\n  According to a study in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, Maine ranks third in the Nation when it comes to the \nquality of care delivered to our Medicare beneficiaries. Yet we are \n11th from the bottom when it comes to per-beneficiary Medicare \nspending.\n  The fact is that Maine's Medicare dollars are being used to subsidize \nhigher reimbursements in other parts of the country. This simply is not \nfair. Medicare's reimbursement systems have historically tended to \nfavor urban areas and failed to take the special needs of rural States \ninto account. Ironically, Maine's low payment rates are also the result \nof its long history of providing high-quality, cost-effective care. In \nthe early 1980s, Maine's lower than average costs were used to justify \nlower payment rates. Since then, Medicare's payment policies have only \nserved to perpetuate the gap.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 did take some significant \nsteps toward promoting greater fairness by increasing Medicare payments \nto rural hospitals and by modifying geographic adjustment factors that \ndiscriminated against physicians and other providers in rural areas. \nThe legislation we are introducing today will build on those \nimprovements by establishing State pilot programs that reward providers \nof high-quality, cost efficient Medicare services. It will also \nestablish a program to expand graduate medical education programs in \nrural and underserved areas of the nation.\n  Mr. President, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act outlines a \nblueprint for reform based on principles upon which I believe a \nbipartisan majority in Congress could agree. The plan takes significant \nstrides toward the goal of universal health care coverage by bringing \nmillions more Americans into the insurance system, by strengthening the \nhealth care safety net, and by addressing inequities in the Medicare \nsystem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1226. A bill to provide jurisdiction over Federal contractors who \nengage in human trafficking offenses; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nContractor Extraterritorial Jurisdiction for Human Trafficking Offenses \nAct of 2005, which builds upon bipartisan efforts to combat the \nabhorrent practice of human trafficking.\n  Human trafficking is unfortunately among the fastest growing \ninternational criminal activities. According to the U.S. State \nDepartment's 2005 Trafficking in Persons Report, 600,000 to 800,000 \nvictims are transported across international borders each year. These \nvictims often come from the world's most vulnerable populations and \nregions affected by wars or humanitarian disasters.\n  With the promise of well-paying jobs, victims are often enticed to \nforeign countries, where upon arrival, their passports or travel papers \nare confiscated, and they are forced, many times beaten, until they \nagree to work without pay or serve as prostitutes. The perpetrators of \nhuman trafficking are typically motivated by profits derived from the \nuse of forced labor or commercial sex exploitation. Because one of the \ncommon motivations of trafficking is forced prostitution: 80 percent of \nthe victims are women and 50 percent of the victims are children.\n  In 2001, awareness of human trafficking grew in London during a \nmurder investigation where the victim was a small African boy. While \ntrying to determine the identity of the victim, investigators \ndiscovered that, in London alone, 300 African children between the ages \nof 4 and 7 could not be accounted for. That staggering statistic \nprovides an insight into the pervasiveness of child trafficking and \ndemonstrates that it can occur in all countries, including the most \naffluent.\n  This issue has long been a concern of mine. Nearly 6 years ago, I \nlearned of a human trafficking ring that enslaved foreign workers and \nsmuggled them to the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, \nCNMI. The workers were forced to work in factories or serve as \nprostitutes. Senators Frank Murkowski, Jeff Bingaman, and I introduced \nS. 1052 to tighten immigration law in the CNMI to prevent future human \ntrafficking rings. Although our bill passed the Senate, it was not \ntaken up in the House.\n  Unfortunately, that was only one of numerous human trafficking \nconspiracies discovered within the United States. The State Department \nestimates that 14,500 to 17,500 human trafficking victims are brought \ninto our country every year.\n  We cannot address this issue without recognizing the efforts of my \nfriend and departed colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, who through his \nleadership, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of \n2000, P.L. 106-386, was enacted. This law first established our \nNation's commitment to the prosecution of traffickers and the \nprotection of victims of trafficking.\n  Since 2000, and the passage of this Act, there has been a surge in \ngovernment activity relating to the prevention and prosecution of human \ntrafficking offenses. In 2003 alone, there were approximately 3,000 \nconvictions of human traffickers worldwide.\n  We have learned a great deal more about the conditions under which \nmembers of a population are likely to become victims of trafficking. \nThose who are displaced from their homes or suffering from poverty are \nmuch more likely to become victims of trafficking. Unfortunately, \nmilitary forces and organizations charged with protecting and providing \nfor vulnerable populations have, at times, actually encouraged the \ntrafficking of humans.\n  There have been instances in the Congo and in Bosnia where increased \ndemand for prostitution and forced labor caused by foreign peacekeeping \ntroops and humanitarian aid workers accelerated the exploitation of \nalready vulnerable populations.\n  There have even been reports where contractors, working on behalf of \nthe United States Government, have contributed to, and even \nparticipated in, the trafficking of humans abroad. Nothing is more \ncontrary to the freedoms we cherish than the trafficking of humans, \nwhich is why I introduce today the Federal Contractor Extraterritorial \nJurisdiction for Human Trafficking Offenses Act.\n  My bill closes a loophole in U.S. criminal law. Under current law, \nFederal contractors who engage in human trafficking offenses abroad are \nsubject to prosecution in the United States only if ``employed by or \naccompanying the Armed Forces.'' The bill closes this loophole by \npermitting the prosecution of Federal contractors of ``any executive \nagency.''\n  I believe all U.S. contractors should be treated the same, and all \nshould be held to the same standards. A paycheck from the United States \nshould never be used to purchase a human life.\n  I wish to point out that this legislation respects the sovereignty of \nforeign governments to prosecute these crimes locally. If a prosecution \nhas occurred or is pending by the foreign government, U.S. authorities \nare precluded from prosecuting except upon approval of the U.S. \nAttorney General.\n  Rather, my measure authorizes the prosecution of a U.S. contractor \nwho engages in human trafficking abroad but flees the foreign country \nto avoid prosecution. This happened, according to at least one report, \nwhere an employee of a Federal contractor in Bosnia bought a woman to \nserve as a sex slave. This individual fled the country after local \nauthorities discovered the crime, and he returned to the U.S. to avoid \nprosecution. My bill would empower U.S. prosecutors to bring such an \nindividual to justice.\n  Mr. President, I ask by unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\n                                 S. 1226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve quality in health care by providing \nincentives for adoption of modern information technology; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce the \n``Health Information Technology Act of 2005'' with my friend and \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. This legislation will reduce costs \nfor our businesses, improve systems for our providers, and improve \nquality of care for patients.\n  We know we need to reduce health care costs in this country. In 2004, \nUnited States national health expenditures, known as NHEs, amounted to \n$1.8 trillion, or about $6,300 per person, accounting for 15.8% of our \nGDP. This is almost twice the average among European Union countries.\n  And costs are expected to continue to skyrocket. The Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, estimates that by 2013, NHEs in \nthe United States will reach $3.4 trillion and account for 18.8 percent \nof our GDP.\n  It is without question that the increasing cost of employer-based \nhealth insurance hurts the global competitiveness of U.S. companies. \nGeneral Motors now spends more than $1,500 per vehicle on health care \ncosts, while their non-U.S. based competitors spend as much as $1,000 \nless.\n  Our large companies certainly aren't alone in struggling to meet the \nhealth care needs of their employees--the average member of the Small \nBusiness Association of Michigan, SBAM spends nearly $8,000 per \nemployee per year on health insurance premiums. SBAM explains very \nclearly one of the reasons for these high costs: ``the way in which \nhealth care information is communicated is expensive, inefficient, and \nmany times simply does not happen.''\n  The members of the Health Information Technology Leadership Panel, \nconvened pursuant to the National Coordinator for Health Information \nTechnology's Framework for Strategic Action, recently agreed that \n``increasing health care costs pose a great and growing challenge to \ntheir industries and the broader U.S. economy..''.\n  But it's not just the level of health care spending--at the same time \nthat we are spending twice as much as many other countries, 45 million \nof our citizens lack health insurance, and a recent national study by \nRAND suggests that U.S. adults receive only 55 percent of recommended \ncare.\n  The answer is not to cut payments or to ask patients to take less \ncare, but to ensure the right information is where it needs to be at \nthe time it needs to be there so that providers can give the best \npossible treatment and care. That will both reduce costs and improve \nquality of care.\n  However, most of our Nation's health care providers don't have access \nto information technology and services because it's hard enough just to \nkeep up with their daily costs, much less to invest in something new.\n\n  And, there's another reason providers haven't been quick to adopt \nthese systems. The nature of our health care system means that in large \npart the value of these technologies--through the lower costs they will \nachieve--accrue to the payers of health care, rather than to the \nproviders.\n  The costs of necessary information not being available are great. Too \noften, care is duplicated like an x-ray given twice, because an \nemergency room doctor didn't have the results of an earlier x-ray, or \nthe best and most appropriate care isn't given. Our health care \nprofessionals can't possibly provide the best care if they don't have \ncomplete and accurate information about the patient sitting in front of \nthem.\n  Multiple studies have found that as much as $300 billion is spent \neach year on health care that does not improve patient outcomes on \ntreatment that is unnecessary, inappropriate, inefficient, or \nineffective.\n  A March 2001 Institute of Medicine, IOM, study concluded that in \norder to improve quality, there must be a national commitment to \nbuilding an information infrastructure. An October 2003 Government \nAccountability Office report found that the benefits of an electronic \nhealthcare information system included improved quality of care, \nreduced costs associated with medication errors, more accurate and \ncomplete medical documentation, more accurate capture of codes and \ncharges, and improved communication among providers enabling them to \nrespond more quickly to patients' needs.\n  By providing the most appropriate care at the most appropriate time, \nwe can reap huge savings. A January 2005 Report by the Center for \nInformation Technology Leadership, CITL, found that moving to \nstandardized health information exchange and interoperability would \nsave nearly $80 billion annually in the United States.\n  The benefits of adoption and use of health care information \ntechnologies, systems and services will be widespread: employers will \nrealize cost savings, clinicians will gain new electronic support tools \nand patient information to help guide medical decisions, and patients \nwill benefit from a more efficient health care system and from a safer \nhealth care system with fewer unnecessary treatments and more attention \nto preventive care. And, taxpayers and our federal programs will \nbenefit. Researchers have suggested that up to 30 percent of annual \nMedicare health care spending could be saved by eliminating unnecessary \nand duplicative procedures, and improving quality by eliminating \nerrors.\n  The benefits of health information technologies and services become \nmost compelling on an individual level. I met an extraordinary woman \njust a month ago. Renae Wallace, a small business owner in Kingsley, MI \ntold me about her son Randall. Randall is just about to turn 8, but \nbecause he was born with complex heart and lung defects, he has seen \nthe inside of a surgery room more times than most people see in a \nlifetime.\n\n  Renae takes her son to providers in Traverse City, Grand Rapids, and \nAnn Arbor. But because there is no way for these providers to talk to \neach other, she has to carry around a file two inches thick of medical \nrecords--X-rays, MRI scans, surgical notes--on Randall. Otherwise, the \nhealth care professionals who are taking care of Randall wouldn't have \nthe benefit of the results of the treatment that Randall has gotten \npreviously. Because they wouldn't have all the information they need, \nRandall might not get the most appropriate care. Renae has made sure \nthat all of the providers taking care of her son have as much of the \ninformation as possible--but it would make a lot more sense if the \ndoctors and hospitals and nurses were able to\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\nhave that information without Renae having to carry it around.\n  We need to ensure that our health care professionals have all of the \nrelevant clinical information available to them in whatever setting a \npatient needs care, at the time the patient needs the care so that they \ncan provide the best and most appropriate treatment possible. We know \nthat adoption of health information technology can play a critical role \nin improving patient outcomes and at the same time greatly reduce \ncosts. But it can't happen without the federal government playing a \nrole.\n  The members of the Health Information Technology Leadership Panel \nconcurred that without Federal leadership, neither their individual \ncompanies nor the industrial sector as a whole can achieve the breadth \nof HIT adoption that would be required to realize the needed \ntransformation of health care.\n  The bill that Senator Snowe and I are introducing recognizes that \nboth Federal leadership and Federal investment are necessary and \nappropriate. The focus of the investment provided by the ``Health \nInformation Technology Act of 2005'' is on improving health care for \npatients with heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and other diseases and \nconditions by driving transformation of systems in physician offices \nand other health care settings. Our bill includes a number of funding \nincentive approaches intended to improve health care through adoption \nof information technology.\n  First, we create a 5-year, $4 billion competitive grant program for \nhospitals, physicians, skilled nursing facilities, community health \ncenters and community mental health centers to offset investments in \nnew technologies and information services. Importantly, the grant \nprogram is funded by a mandatory appropriation from the Medicare trust \nfunds. This is critical to ensuring that funds will actually be \navailable for the grant program. It also makes sense as the trust funds \nwill see savings through lower outlays due to less duplicative and \nunnecessary care.\n  The grant program would authorize funding for the: purchase, lease, \nand installment of computer software and hardware and related services; \nupgrade of existing computer technology; purchase communications \ncapabilities necessary for clinical data access, storage, and exchange; \nservices associated with acquiring, implementing, operating, or \noptimizing the use of new or existing computer software and hardware \nand clinical health care informatics systems; provision of education \nand training for staff on information systems and technology designed \nto improve patient safety; and purchase, lease, subscription, \nintegration service of clinical decision support tools that provide \nongoing continuous quality improvement functions.\n  Second, we allow accelerated depreciation of qualified health care \ninformation system expenditures in 2005-2010.\n  Third, we adjust Medicare payments to providers who use HIT that \nimproves the quality and accuracy of clinical decision-making. We begin \nby addressing payments for treatment of Medicare beneficiaries with \nheart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease because we know these conditions consume a large \nportion of our Medicare resources.\n  We know that the Medicare program will reap the benefit of providers \nusing health information networks. The Office of the National \nCoordinator for Health Information Technology said on March 2 of this \nyear that the annual savings attributable to widespread electronic \nhealth record adoption are likely to lie between 7.5 percent-30 percent \nof annual health care spending.\n  It only makes sense to establish new payment codes to account for the \ncosts of purchasing and using health information technology and \nservices with patient-specific applications.\n  Our legislation also will make it much easier for physicians and \nother health care professionals to treat patients by reducing the \ncommunication barriers that currently exist. The ``Health Information \nTechnology Act'' provides that the Secretary shall adopt data standards \nfor interoperability between providers and links funding to the \nadoption of those standards.\n  We know that electronic health care information systems can reap huge \nbenefits. The GAO found these systems improve quality of care, reduce \ncosts and improve communication among providers.\n  But we also know that we can't expect our health care providers to \nmake this investment alone as they struggle to meet their daily needs. \nOur country must have a national commitment to building an information \ninfrastructure, and the Federal Government needs to step up to the \nplate and provide much-needed funds to get the ball rolling.\n  We could only have dreamed about clinical computerized information \nsystems when the Medicare and Medicaid programs began. Today, we have \nthem at our disposal. The sooner we get them into our hospitals, \nphysician offices, nursing homes, community health centers and \ncommunity mental health centers, the sooner our patients, providers, \nand pocketbooks will see the rewards.\n  I am very pleased to announce the support of the following \norganizations: American College of Physicians, Federation of American \nHospitals, National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare, the \nNational Association of Children's Hospitals, American Heart \nAssociation, National Rural Health Association, National Business \nCoalition on Health, American Academy of Family Physicians, National \nAssociation of Community Health Centers, American Health Care \nAssociation, IBM, Health Vision, Healthcare Information and Management \nSystems Society, eHealth Initiative, AdvaMed, American Health \nInformation Management Association, Verizon, Altarum, Michigan Health \nand Hospital Association, Automation Alley, Small Business Association \nof Michigan, Detroit Chamber, Michigan State Medical Society, Detroit \nMedical Center, Marquette General Health System, Oakwood Healthcare \nSystem, Henry Ford Health System, MPRO, Michigan's Medicare Quality \nImprovement Organization; Microsoft Corporation, Axolotl Corp, Delmarva \nFoundation, Dell Inc, DiagnosisOne, Greenway Medical Technologies, \nHealthInsight, Healthgate, Inland Northwest Health Services, Kyrptiq, \nLumetra, Medical Review of North Carolina, Misys Healthcare Systems, \nNational Alliance for Primary Care Informatics, Partners Healthcare \nSystem, Siemens Corporation, Philips Medical Systems, WebMD \nCorporation, and the Virgin Islands Medical Institute.\n  I am also very pleased to have the support of the AFL-CIO, Trinity \nHealth, NextGen, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American Association \nof Homes and Services for the Aging, St. John Health, Michigan Primary \nCare Association, the American Health Quality Association, and Comtek \nand look forward to receiving their forthcoming letters.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the bill and additional \nmaterial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to by printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  American Academy\n\n\n                                         of Family Physicians,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Stabenow and Snowe: On behalf of It he 94,000 \n     members of the American Academy of Family Physicians, \n     congratulations on the introduction of the Health Information \n     Technology Act. The AAFP strongly supports this legislation \n     and we would be pleased to help you in your efforts to have \n     Congress pass it.\n       The legislation recognizes that the main obstacles to \n     widespread adoption of electronic health record systems are \n     the significant up-front costs and the lack of general \n     interoperability of many fragmented electronic systems. In \n     the first case. the estimated costs of about $25,000 per \n     physician to purchase an electronic health record system is a \n     serious problem for family physicians in small practices that \n     have very tight financial margins in which to operate. In the \n     second case, even if the financing is available, a family \n     physician will be reluctant to invest in health information \n     technology that cannot communicate with a nearby lab or the \n     specialist across town.\n       By helping physicians with the financing of these systems \n     and by facilitating the development of interoperability \n     standards, your legislation would go a long way to improving \n     the quality and efficiency of health care delivery in this \n     county.\n       Thank you for your leadership in this effort. We are \n     committed to working with you\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\n     to secure passage of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Michael Fleming,\n     Board Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                               Community Health Centers, Inc.,\n\n                                      Bethesda, MD, June 13, 2005.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow, On behalf of health centers all \n     across the country and the 15 million Americans who rely on \n     them for health care, I want to express our strong support \n     for the ``Health Information Technology Act of 2005.'' The \n     legislation would help to ensure that health centers have the \n     additional resources they need to further harness the \n     potential of information technology to improve the overall \n     quality of health care delivered to patients in underserved \n     communities.\n       Health centers recognize the value of healthcare \n     information technology in facilitating the delivery of cost-\n     effective, quality health care services. Indeed, through \n     participation in the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration's Health Disparities Collaboratives, health \n     centers have demonstrated reductions in disparities and \n     improved access to services through the use of electronic \n     patient registries. However, the high cost of establishing \n     these IT. systems throughout the entire health center is a \n     significant barrier for centers with few financial resources.\n       With that in mind, NACHC applauds you for including health \n     centers as eligible recipients of competitive grant funding \n     and tax incentives for the design and installation of new \n     healthcare IT systems, the upgrade of existing computer \n     hardware and software, and training and education of health \n     center staff. We also appreciate that your legislation would \n     require the establishment of national healthcare IT standards \n     that promote the interoperability of health care information \n     across all health care settings within 2 years.\n       Thank you once again for introducing the ``Health \n     Information Technology Act of 2005.'' We stand ready to work \n     with you to advance this vital legislation in the 109th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel R. Hawkins, Jr.,\n       Vice-President for Federal, State, and Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Health Care Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2005.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the American Health \n     Care Association (AHCA) and the National Center for Assisted \n     Living (NCAL), the nation's largest association representing \n     providers of quality long term care, I am writing to \n     acknowledge our support for the ``Health Information \n     Technology Act of 2005.''\n       This legislation, which you will soon introduce, has the \n     potential to transform health and long term care by utilizing \n     information technology to allow for the seamless transfer of \n     health data while guaranteeing privacy and security. By \n     creating incentives for providers to acquire health \n     information technology and ensuring interoperability, you are \n     taking critically important steps to improve patient safety \n     and quality. With provisions such as allowing accelerated \n     depreciation of qualified health care information system \n     expenditures, you've clearly fast tracked the potential of \n     this legislation reaching its ultimate goals.''\n       Senator Stabenow, AHCA and NCAL fully support and commend \n     you for the leadership you are providing with the \n     introduction of the ``Health Information Technology Act of \n     2005.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Hal Daub,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                           IBM\n\n                                   Washington, D.C., June 9, 2005.\n     Hon.

Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senators Snowe and Stabenow: On behalf of IBM, I would \n     like to congratulate you on the introduction of the ``Health \n     Information Technology Act of 2005, and we support its \n     passage.\n       The Act includes number of funding incentive approaches \n     intended to stimulate healthcare improvements enabled by \n     information technology. Most important, the Act would adjust \n     Medicare payments to providers who participate in a health \n     information network that improves the quality and accuracy of \n     clinical decision-making. With so many Americans in this one \n     program, creating rewards for quality in Medicare will have a \n     lifesaving impact for patients throughout the country.\n       The Act also authorizes grants for information technology \n     software, hardware, and services to improve quality in health \n     care and patient safety. Eligible grantees would include \n     hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, federally qualified \n     health centers, physicians, and physician group practices. \n     Funding would be authorized for the years 2006 to 2010 as \n     part of the Medicare program as permitted within the Budget \n     Reserve Fund enacted in the 2006 Budget Resolution.\n       The legislation would also reduce the communication \n     barriers that make it difficult for physicians to treat \n     patients. The Act provides that the Secretary shall adopt \n     data standards for interoperability between providers and \n     links funding to the adoption of those standards. At the same \n     time, the Act would implement procedures for the Secretary to \n     accept the optional submission of data derived from health \n     care reporting requirements. The funding will allow providers \n     to adopt technology with standards that promote the efficient \n     exchange of data.\n       Finally, the Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code to \n     permit the expensing of health care informatics systems that \n     meet standards adopted by the Secretary of HHS.\n       We thank you for advancing these important Medicare-related \n     provisions and look forward to supporting the Act's passage \n     this Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Christopher Caine,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Government Programs.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Stabenow and Snowe: Healthvision, Inc. is \n     dedicated to providing and supporting connected healthcare \n     communities where information can be securely shared among, \n     physicians, patients, consumers, hospitals and other \n     interested constituents in the healthcare landscape. We \n     congratulate you both for introducing The Health Information \n     Technology Act. This legislation would provide grants to \n     physicians, hospitals and skilled nursing facilities for \n     purposes of improving patient safety and reducing medical \n     errors.\n       We understand the positive role that health information \n     technology (HIT) can play in promoting safety and the quality \n     of care. We also are cognizant that financial barriers \n     prevent physicians and patients from receiving and utilizing \n     health information technology that is important to reducing \n     medical errors and creating efficiencies in the healthcare \n     system. The Health Information Technology Act (HIT Act) \n     provides a solution to overcoming the barriers that prevent \n     the use and utilization of HIT to improve healthcare. By \n     providing incentives for providers to adopt HIT, promoting \n     the adoption of national data and health communication \n     standards to facilitate interoperability, leveraging federal \n     investments in Medicare and Medicaid and creating special set \n     asides for certain groups including rural providers and \n     health professional shortage areas, the HIT Act provides \n     considerable leverage to help build momentum in improving \n     healthcare as we know it today.\n       Quality and safety challenges, according to the Institute \n     of Medicine, cause an estimated 44,000 to 98,000 deaths \n     yearly due to medical errors. Legislation to adopt HIT is \n     essential to improving healthcare by replacing antiquated \n     paper records with electronic patient records that can be \n     shared across healthcare communities and among the necessary \n     stakeholders in such communities.\n       The Healthcare Information Act of 2005 would be an \n     important step toward addressing some of the quality and \n     safety challenges identified by the Institute of Medicine. It \n     is our belief that upfront investment in HIT will improve the \n     quality of care, while returning savings through reductions \n     in clinical and administrative costs over time.\n       We applaud your leadership and look forward to working with \n     you to provide incentives for adoption of modern health \n     information technology to improve the quality of healthcare.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Scott Decker,\n       President and Chief Executive Officer.\n     Jonathan Teich,\n       Sr. Vice President and Chief Medical Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           eHealth Initiative,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2005.\n     Hon.

These \n     quality and safety Challenges according to the Institute of \n     Medicine, cause an estimated 44,000 to 98,000 deaths yearly \n     due to medical errors.\n       Various studies have shown the potential of health \n     information technology to make improvements in healthcare \n     quality. For example, a rural community hospital prevented \n     administration of over 1,200 wrong drugs or dosages using \n     automatic identification technology and wireless scanners to \n     verify both the identities of patients and their correct \n     medications (GAO-04-224).\n       The Health Information Technology Act of 2005 would be an \n     important step toward addressing some of the quality and \n     safety challenges identified by the Institute of Medicare.

HIMSS members are very \n     aware of the need for catalyst legislation to improve patient \n     safety and cost effective healthcare in the U.S. Legislation \n     like the Health Information Technology Act of 2005 provides \n     the type of congressional leadership that will improve \n     healthcare delivery for the nation.\n       HIMSS supports the concepts of this legislation because it \n     represents a positive step forward in the national agenda to \n     provide a catalyst to encourage substantial investments into \n     information technology and management systems to improve the \n     quality, safety, and efficiency of patient care. Through our \n     members and the Society's advocacy outreach, we will continue \n     to support and work for the bill's passage.\n       We are particularly encouraged by the provisions in the \n     legislation to create a grant program to infuse almost $4 \n     billion in federal funding into the provider community to \n     encourage adoption of information systems and services, as \n     well as the emphasis on interoperability that address the \n     needs of providers in diverse geographic settings, including \n     setting aside at least 20 percent for rural communities.\n       The HIMSS Board of Directors applauds your efforts in \n     realizing and acting on the need for infuse federal funding \n     into the provider community to adopt much needed information \n     technology.\n       We look forward to working with you to gain additional \n     healthcare industry support for the legislation.

I may be reached at \n     517/703-86009 if you would like to discuss this matter in \n     further detail.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Brian Peters,\n                                  Senior Vice President, Advocacy.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator Stabenow \nof Michigan, in introducing the ``Health Information Technology Act of \n2005'', which will serve to improve the quality of health care through \nimplementation of information technology; IT, in hospitals, health \ncenters and physician practices throughout the country. At a time when \nthe Institute of Medicine (IOM) has reported that up to 98,000 \nAmericans die each year due to medical errors, we cannot afford to \nwait. When we also consider the escalating cost of health care in this \ncountry, we must recognize that this level of growth in spending has \ncreated a crisis. Information technology is one solution, and this \nlegislation will assert the federal government's role in providing \nleadership in this area and provide financial incentives to spur rapid \nadoption of information technology in medicine. Our legislation is \nnecessary because as a nation we face two stark problems.\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\n  The first of these is a serious patient safety problem. The good news \nis that solutions exist: We have the technological ability to \ndramatically reduce medical errors and thus save lives. Many have heard \nabout how drug interactions can be avoided by software systems which \ncheck a patient's prescriptions for hazards. Yet there are so many \nother applications which can improve health. For example, by reviewing \nand analyzing information, a health provider can help a patient better \nmanage chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, and avoid \nadverse outcomes.\n  Our second major problem is the escalating cost of health care. Costs \nare reduced when tests don't have to be repeated and data isn't \ndelayed. In fact, a patient may obtain faster, higher quality care \nwhen, for example, multiple practitioners can review diagnostic test \nresults right at their desktops. In an age where millions of Americans \nshare family pictures over the internet in seconds, isn't it long past \ntime that a physician should be able to retrieve an x-ray just as \neasily?\n  The President certainly recognizes the disparity in technology in \nhealth versus other parts of our economy. He has declared a goal for \nevery American to have an electronic medical record within 10 years. I \nconcur--we need this and more. In fact, once that record is in place we \ncan do so many things better. From preventing drug interactions, to \nmanaging chronic diseases, to simply helping providers operate more \nefficiently. Most of us have been told at one time or another, ``we're \nwaiting to get the test results mailed'', or ``we're still waiting for \nyour chart''. Health care is one of the last bastions of such \ninefficiency.\n  The bad news is that high start-up costs and a lack of standards have \nprevented us from reaping the benefits of new technologies. I am \ncertainly looking forward to the progress we will make with Dr. David \nBrailer heading the new Office of the National Coordinator for Health \nInformation Technology at the Department of Health and Human Services. \nThe President has made technology implementation a priority, and there \nis no doubt that a lack of standards has prevented IT adoption by many \nhealth care providers. One must know that a system purchased will be \ncompatible with others, and that--no matter what may happen in the \nfuture to a vendor--the huge investment one makes in building an \nelectronic medical record won't be lost. In other words, your system \nmust be able to communicate with other systems, and your investment in \nbuilding electronic medical records must be preserved. So when a \npatient moves, their electronic ``chart'' should be able to move right \nalong with them, and their continuity of care shouldn't be interrupted.\n  Yet standards alone aren't enough. Today many providers are \nstruggling to make these investments, and for those which serve \nbeneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP, it can be exceedingly \ndifficult.\n  The legislation which we are introducing today will bring the \nsolution within our reach. In the last Congress I worked with Senator \nBob Graham to introduce legislation which provided a grants program to \ngive assistance to hospitals and long term care facilities to enable \ninvestment in IT. As I join today with Senator Stabenow to introduce \nthis legislation, we have made several crucial enhancements to the \nprevious bill. The legislation now includes both federally-qualified \nhealth centers and community mental health centers as eligible to \nreceive IT grants. In addition, physician practices can also \nparticipate. All three are key treatment environments where both costs \nand errors must be addressed.\n  Our new legislation even provides an alternative to those for-profit \nproviders who do not wish to apply for a grant. Under this bill, such \nproviders will be able to expense the cost of a qualified system.\n  The legislation supports expenditures for a variety of expenses \nrequired to implement health care information technology. These include \nsuch components as computer hardware and software, plus installation \nand training costs. In addition, when installed we require that every \nsystem must meet the HHS Secretary's interoperability standards.\n  We know we will realize significant savings through information \ntechnology. On that there is bipartisan consensus. Yet as providers are \nfacing even declining payment rates, they also are told they must \ninstitute changes in the way they practice, including implementing \ninformation technology. We know that much of the savings in health care \nIT will accrue to the patient and payer--in such aspects as fewer \nduplicate tests, greater efficiency, and better health management. Thus \nit is appropriate that the Federal Government would assist with the \noften prohibitive start-up costs--particularly for those who serve \nbeneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP.\n  I again want to stress the first goal of this legislation: To help \nbuild a safer medical-delivery system. The great successes of our \nhealth care system are largely due to our highly committed and talented \nhealth care professionals. The problem we are addressing today is not \ntheirs, but is an endemic weakness of the system they depend upon. \nHowever, to utilize the solution, the Federal Government must step \nforward and provide the leadership necessary to make system changes a \nreality.\n  When the Medicare and Medicaid programs began, we could only have \ndreamed about computerized clinical information systems. Now, today, we \nhave this technology at our disposal, and I strongly believe that we \ncannot afford to delay implementation.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend, \nmodify, and expand the credit for electricity produced from renewable \nresources and waste products, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Faced with uncertainties in electricity energy markets, \nturmoil in the Middle East, the need to cut back on the fossil fuel \nemissions linked to global warming, air pollution that contributes to \nhigh rates of asthma and fills even our national parks with smog, the \nUnited States must diversify its energy supply by promoting the growth \nof renewable energy.\n  Since 1999, Las Vegas electricity rates have increased by 50 percent. \nIn the same time period, natural gas prices across Nevada rose 45 \npercent. We need to change the energy equation. We need to diversify \nthe nation's energy supply to reduce volatility and ensure a stable \nsupply of electricity. We must harness the brilliance of the sun, the \nstrength of the wind, and the heat of the Earth to provide clean \nrenewable energy for our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with Senators \nFeinstein, Cantwell, Snowe, Jeffords, Lieberman and Kerry that expands \nthe existing Section 45 production tax credit for renewable energy \nresources to cover all renewable energy resources. Our legislation \naccomplishes this by ensuring that geothermal, incremental geothermal, \nsolar, open-loop biomass, incremental hydropower, landfill gas, and \nanimal waste to the list of renewable energy resources that would \nqualify for a production tax credit.\n  Our legislation also makes the production tax credit permanent to \nsignal America's longterm commitment to renewable energy resources. The \nexisting production tax credit will expire at the end of the year. \nSince it inception in 1992, the production tax credit has expired and \nbeen renewed three times--in 1999, 2001, and 2004. Development of wind \nenergy has closely mirrored these renewal cycles. Clearly, the private \ninvestment necessary to develop renewable energy resources requires the \nbusiness certainty afforded by a long-term extension of the production \ntax credit. Our bill allows for co-production credits to encourage \nblending of renewable energy with traditional fuels and provides a \ncredit for renewable facilities on Native American and Native Alaskan \nlands.\n  In northern Nevada, the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe is working with \nAdvanced Thermal Systems to develop geothermal resources on Indian \nlands that will spur economic development by creating business \nopportunities and jobs for tribal members.\n  This legislation also provides production incentives to not-for-\nprofit public power utilities and rural electric cooperatives, which \nserve 25 percent of the Nation's power customers, by allowing them to \ntransfer their credits to taxable entities. The good news is that the \nproduction tax credit for renewable energy resources really works to \npromote the growth of renewable energy.\n  In 1990, the cost of wind energy was 22.5 cents per kilowatt hour \nand, today, with new technology and the help of a modest production tax \ncredit, wind is a competitive energy source at approximately 5.5 cents \nper kilowatt hour. In the last 5 years, wind energy has experienced a \n30 percent growth rate. The production tax credit provides 1.8 cents \nfor every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced. Similar to wind \nenergy, this credit will allow geothermal energy, incremental \nhydropower, and landfill gas to immediately compete with fossil fuels, \nwhile biomass will follow closely behind. The Department of Energy \nestimates that we could increase our geothermal energy production \nalmost tenfold, supplying ten percent of the energy needs of the West. \nAs fantastic as it sounds, enough sunlight falls on 100 square miles of \nsouthern Nevada that--if covered with solar panels--could power the \nentire Nation.\n  Let's never lose sight of the fact that renewable energy resources \nare domestic sources of energy, and using them instead of foreign \nsources contributes to our energy security. Renewables provide fuel \ndiversify and price stability. After all, the fuel--from the wind, the \nsun, and heat from the core of the earth--cost nothing. And they \nprovide jobs, especially in rural areas that have been largely left out \nof America's recent economic growth. The production tax credit for \nrenewable energy resources is a powerful, fast-acting stimulus to the \neconomy. According to the Western Governors Association, the Department \nof Energy's Initiative to deploy 1,000 Megawatts of concentrated solar \npower in the Southwestern area of the United States by the year 2006 \nwould create approximately 10,000 jobs and estimated expenditures of \nmore than $3.7 billion over 14 years.\n  Nevada has already developed 200 megawatts of geothermal power, with \na longer-term potential of more than 2,500 megawatts; this development \nwill provide billions of dollars in private investment and create \nthousands of jobs. Our production tax credit means immediate economic \ndevelopment and jobs.\n  In the U.S. today, we get 2 percent of our electricity from renewable \nenergy sources like wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. But the \npotential for much greater supply is here. For example, Nevada could \nuse geothermal energy to meet one-third of its electricity needs, but \ntoday this source of energy only supplies 2 percent. I am proud to say \nthat Nevada has adopted one of the most aggressive Renewable Portfolio \nStandards in the Nation, requiring 15 percent of the State's \nelectricity needs be met by renewable energy resources in 2013.\n  After pouring billions of dollars into oil and gas, we need to invest \nin a clean energy future. Fossil fuel plants pump over 11 million tons \nof pollutants into our air each year. Federal energy policy must \npromote reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. By including landfill \ngas in this legislation, we systematically reduce the largest single \nhuman source of methane emissions in the United States, effectively \neliminating the greenhouse gas equivalent of 233 million tons of carbon \ndioxide.\n  Medical studies have revealed an alarming link between soot particles \nfrom power plants and motor vehicles and lung cancer and heart disease. \nThe adverse health effects of power plant and vehicle emissions cost \nAmericans billions of dollars in medical care, and our cost in human \nsuffering is immeasurable. Simply put, the human cost of dirty air is \nstaggering. If we factor in environmental and health effects, the real \ncost of energy becomes apparent, and renewable energy becomes the fuel \nof choice.\n  America's abundant and untapped renewable resources can fuel our \njourney into a more prosperous and safer tomorrow without compromising \nair and water quality. Renewable energy is a critical component of a \nsuccessful, forward-looking, and secure energy policy for the 21st \nCentury.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

JAMES EXON\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 170, which was submitted \nearly today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 170) relative to the death of J. \n     James Exon, former United States Senator for the State of \n     Nebraska.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on Friday, Nebraska lost one of the most \ndominant political figures in our State's history. Former two-term \nGovernor and three-term U.S. Senator Jim Exon passed away in Lincoln at \nthe age of 83.\n  Many in this Chamber today served with him and knew him well. Those \nwho served with Jim Exon remember a serious and dedicated public \nservant who enjoyed life and loved his State.\n  Jim's voice was strong, and he spoke clearly and directly. No one \never had to guess where Jim Exon stood. As a Governor and a Senator, he \nfought for balanced budgets and restrained Government spending.\n  In the Senate, from his seat on the Armed Services Committee, he was \na passionate advocate for a strong national defense. As a member of the \nCommerce Committee, he was a protector of our natural resources, and he \nhad the foresight to author the Communications Decency Act.\n  Mr. President, today, when politics is too often a race to the lowest \npolitical common denominator, Jim Exon was a very effective leader, a \npartisan leader who always played it straight. He never lost an \nelection. He won five statewide elections in Nebraska, more than any \nother Nebraskan. Under Jim Exon's leadership, the Democratic Party \nbecame the dominant party in Nebraska for 25 years.\n  Anyone who knows Nebraska understands what a remarkable \naccomplishment that was. He did it by listening to the people. He did \nit by being a leader.\n  I was Jim Exon's replacement in the Senate in 1996. Over the last 9 \nyears, I came to know him well and respect his judgment. We did not \nalways agree, but I always appreciated the opportunities I had to visit \nwith Senator Exon on a wide range of issues. A child of the plains and \na veteran of World War II, he is part of a generation of Americans who \nunderstood leadership, sacrifice, and war. In his later years, Jim Exon \nhad much to say. And I had an opportunity to listen.\n  The voice and wisdom of Jim Exon and his generation is slipping away \nfrom us at a time of unparalleled change in our world. Just as with Jim \nExon, while this great generation is still with us, we need to listen \nclosely to them. I did listen to Jim Exon.\n  As a small businessman, two-term Governor and three-term Senator, \nJames Exon, along with his wife Pat, served his State, his Nation, and \nthis institution with distinction. He will be missed by the Nebraskans \nhe served so well and loved so much.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 170) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 170\n\n       Whereas J. James Exon served in the United States Army \n     Signal Corps from 1942-1945 and in the United States Army \n     Reserve from 1945-1949;\n       Whereas J. James Exon served as Governor of the State of \n     Nebraska from 1971-1979;\n       Whereas J. James Exon served the people of Nebraska with \n     distinction for 18 years in the United States Senate where he \n     was a proponent of a strong national defense and \n     knowledgeable source on geopolitical matters;\n       Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow \n     and deep regret the announcement of the death of the \n     Honorable J. James Exon, former member of the United States \n     Senate.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate \n     these resolutions to the House of Representatives and \n     transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the \n     deceased.\n       Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it stand \n     adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of the \n     Honorable J.
