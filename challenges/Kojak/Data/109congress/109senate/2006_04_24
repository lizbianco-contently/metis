Mr. President, I spent the recess traveling in Nevada--Las \nVegas, North Las Vegas, Boulder City, Henderson, my hometown of \nSearchlight, and I also traveled to Pahrump, Reno,\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\nFernley, Yerington, Fallon, and Hawthorne. These are all very different \nplaces, but not once in any of these cities where I met with people \nduring the days, and in the evenings on occasion, not once did anyone \ntalk to me about eliminating the estate tax, flag burning, or gay \nmarriage.\n  Instead, throughout Nevada I was constantly asked about skyrocketing \ngas prices. My daughter-in-law, Amber, lives in Reno with my son with \ntheir four children. She has never talked to me about anything \npolitical in the many years we have known one another. But at dinner on \nEaster Sunday, she wanted everybody to hear, including me, how fed up \nshe was with gas prices. She said that this is wrong and something has \nto be done about it.\n  She was speaking for millions of Americans. Even though she is the \none who mouthed the words to me, this conversation could have taken \nplace anywhere in America, at any dinner table, rich or poor. So not \nonce did anyone in any of these Nevada cities talk to me about the \nestate tax, flag burning, and gay marriage. Instead, throughout Nevada \nI was constantly asked about these skyrocketing gas prices, the \nintractable war in Iraq, taxes, immigration, education, health care \nand, of course, homeland security.\n  I share this short report of my trip home because I am concerned \nabout the Senate schedule in the coming months, and certainly in the \nnext 5 weeks. All of us in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, spent \nthe last 2 weeks listening to what our constituents wanted to talk \nabout, issues they care about. Now that we are back in Washington, when \nwe look for these issues on the Senate calendar, they are nonexistent.\n\n  According to what I have read in the press in the last week, the \nmajority leader is clearing time on the Senate schedule for what I \ndescribe as pet issues of the rightwing, issues such as a \nconstitutional amendment to ban flag desecration--Mr. President, I \nagree with that; I have voted for that--a constitutional amendment to \nestablish a Federal definition of marriage, and the estate tax \nreduction.\n  Each of these controversial issues has merit. There is no question \nabout that. Each issue has a lot of merit. But do they trump gas \nprices? I don't think so. Do they trump homeland security? I don't \nthink so. Do they trump a full, complete discussion on the Iraq war? By \nthe way, that war, in a few short months, will have taken longer than \nWorld War II, in which the Presiding Officer flew airplanes. That \nAmerican cause took about 3\\1/2\\ years. We are approaching that time \nwith this war--a war that has already cost our country more than the \nSecond World War. It is now costing us about $120 billion a year, $10 \nbillion a month.\n  Do these issues have precedence over public education? I don't think \nso; over our polluted skies, where asthma for children is becoming \nendemic? I don't think it does trump that. How about our country's \nshaky economy? Should we have a complete discussion on that? Do these \nissues trump our having raised the debt ceiling to $9 trillion? I don't \nthink so. Does a constitutional amendment to ban same sex marriage have \na higher priority than a debate on high gas prices? No. Does a \nconstitutional amendment on flag burning have more precedence than \nimmigration? No. Does a constitutional discussion on the estate tax, \nlegislating a reduction in the estate tax, have more precedence, more \nimportance than a discussion on health care? I don't think so.\n  We have only about 15 very short weeks left in this session of \nCongress. Regardless of your position, the majority leader's \nconstitutional amendments and his saying he will bring the estate tax \nmatter to the floor, there are serious issues of importance to millions \nof Americans. Surely we can all agree that they are not among the most \npressing problems facing America today and the Senate's attention in \nthese few remaining weeks that we have is best focused on the needs of \nthe American people.\n  This morning, in a letter, I asked the majority leader to drop his \nplan to bring these partisan issues before the Senate and to commit to \nbringing the people's priorities to the floor instead. That is not an \noutrageous request. I guarantee you that if we could put this issue \nbefore a jury of the American people, overwhelmingly Democrats and \nRepublicans would agree with my suggestion to the majority leader that \nwe work on these real issues rather than these three issues that I have \ndiscussed.\n  We need to approach these last few weeks in a bipartisan way, and we \nare reaching out to the majority to let us tackle the urgent issues \nfacing our country, and there are urgent issues facing our country. \nAmericans are frustrated with the direction in which America is headed. \nWe are frustrated equally with the performance of the Bush White House \nand the Republican Congress.\n  With just a few months remaining before we adjourn, the 109th \nCongress is going into the history books as the country's least \nproductive Congress in the more than 200 years we have been a country. \nIn fact, the 109th Congress is on track to exceed the famous do-nothing \nCongress of 1948, and there have been articles written on that. I am \nnot making it up.\n  This Congress has worked on class action and bankruptcy, legislation \nthat benefits big business. I have helped with that, but we need to do \nsomething to help the vast majority of the American people. To check \nthese off as being great accomplishments, I don't think that is right.\n  The Senate, thanks to Democrats, did pass lobbying ethics reform \nlegislation, known as the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. \nBut as yet we have not heard a single word from the House on this \nissue. And passing important legislation such as the Honest Government \nAct has proved to be the exception and not the rule.\n  Congress has not passed a budget. We haven't completed last year's \nbudget, as a matter of fact, and, I might add, the ethics legislation \nwe passed in the Senate has yet to be considered in the House.\n  America can do better. America can do much better.\n  This week the supplemental appropriations bill will be on the floor. \nIt is important legislation, especially since President Bush refused to \nput the cost of the war of Iraq or the cost of helping the Katrina \nvictims in his budget. Why? Can you imagine that, we are doing a \nsupplemental appropriations bill on matters that should have been in \nthe budget that was brought before the Congress some time ago. Why is \nit done this way? It is done this way to try to disguise the staggering \ndeficits this administration has run up.\n  The best example I can give to the American people is what would \nhappen if they did their budgeting the way the White House does its \nbudgeting. We make so much money in our household, but to make our \nbudget complete, what we are going to do is eliminate our car payments \nand our house payments. That, in fact, is what the President has done. \nHe had a budget, but he eliminated the cost of the war in Iraq and the \ncost of the Gulf catastrophe, and now we are coming up here in the last \nfew weeks before the Pentagon runs out of money to say we have to do \nit, it is an emergency. It is not an emergency. We had a bill. We \nshould have taken it up as part of our ordinary cost of Government. \nJust as I explained, how can a person who has a household budget \neliminate car payments or house payments or any other example? That is \nwhat this White House has done, and it is wrong.\n  But in spite of the President's budget gimmicks, Democrats look \nforward to the debate on the supplemental. We have a number of what we \nbelieve are tough and very smart amendments that we will offer to \nprotect the American people, address the situation in Iraq, and provide \nrelief from the energy crisis here at home.\n  When the Senate is finished with this supplemental, Democrats will \ninsist the majority leader put his partisan agenda on the back burner \nand continue to focus the Senate on issues of urgent national \nimportance.\n  I believe we as a Senate owe it to the American people to focus on \ntheir needs and not waste a single day working on partisan needs. We \nare asking in a bipartisan manner to reach out to the American people \nand say: We have something that will help you.\n  What this would mean, though, is setting aside issues such as the \nmarriage amendment and tackling an issue such as gas prices. The price \nof gas has increased 100 percent--100 percent--during this President's \nlast 5 years in\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\noffice--35 cents to 50 cents in the last month, and over the weekend 10 \nor 15 cents.\n  In San Diego, I heard this morning, the highest price as of yesterday \nwas about $3.10 a gallon. Nevada is not far behind. There are places in \nNevada charging over 3 bucks a gallon for gasoline.\n  Today many families are paying $100 to fill their gas tanks, only to \ndrive to work, pick up the kids, and whatever they have to do to get to \nand from work--$100. People say: Why don't they buy a car that doesn't \nuse so much gas? That is for them to decide, and they are getting no \nhelp from this administration to establish CAFE standards so that cars \nare more fuel efficient.\n  It takes $100 to fill many of the vehicles in America today. These \nprices are taking an enormous toll on the pocketbooks of hard-working \nAmericans. They are even more difficult for families to swallow given \nthe headlines that Exxon sent their chief executive officer into \nretirement with a more than $400-million golden parachute. That is \nabout a half billion dollars to retire. Golden parachute is what you \nget upon retirement, about a half a billion dollars.\n  There is nothing wrong with corporate profits. I am all for Americans \nhaving retirement security. But does anyone think it is fair to have \nconsumers pay $100 a week to fill their fuel tanks and the big energy \nbosses fill their bank tanks with hundreds of millions of dollars?\n  We on a bipartisan basis need to work to provide consumers relief at \nthe gas pump. It is much more important than measures to appease a few. \nWe ask, on behalf of America, that the majority move to legislation \nthat allows us to pass a Federal law with teeth and resources to go \nafter price gougers regarding fuel, the profiteers, the energy market \nspeculators.\n  We ask the Republican majority to debate a windfall profits tax. With \na windfall profits tax, we can take big oil's excess profits and give \nthem right back to consumers in rebates or use them to build \nalternative and renewable fuel facilities.\n  If the greedy oil companies won't invest their billions in profits in \ndelivering affordable domestic fuels for America, then maybe America \nneeds to take some of the windfall profits and put them to better use.\n  I worked a lot putting myself through school. I worked for Standard \nstations. I worked for Chevron Oil. I worked in all kinds of gas \nstations pumping gas, changing oil, lube jobs, and tires. My brother \nran a service station for many years. Back then, oil companies made \nabout 4 or 5 cents a gallon on gasoline. Gasoline then was cheap. Now \nwith gas $3 a gallon or more, they still make the same amount of money. \nThe service station operator still makes the same amount of money on $3 \na gallon. He makes 3 or 4 cents a gallon. So when you fill up the car \nwith gasoline, don't be mad with that corner service station because \nExxon and all these other big oil companies are the greedy ones taking \nall the obscene profits. They are not going to the guy you are going to \nask to wash your windows or to fill up at tank No. 6 and you pump it \nyourself.\n  We ask the Republican majority to bring before the Senate legislation \nthat will secure America's energy future so we can put an end to the \ncycle of higher and higher gasoline prices. If the majority so moved, \nthe Senate could develop a more aggressive national energy policy that \nwould deliver affordable, clean energy from domestic sources now, not \nin 30 years or whenever the oil company CEOs decide the time is right. \nWe cannot produce our way out of the oil problems we have. We in \nAmerica, including the oil they say is in Alaska, have less than 3 \npercent of the reserves in the world. We can't produce our way out of \nour problems. We have to look to alternative energy sources.\n\n  It is terrible to think that American consumers are sending billions \nand billions of dollars overseas to pay for oil and some of that money, \nI am told, may be getting into the hands of violent anti-United States \ngroups.\n  Even if that is not true, wouldn't it be better if we were like \nBrazil, a country that is areawise bigger than the United States with \nlots of people? Brazil is energy independent. They produce oil, but \nthey also have determined that they are not going to import oil. And as \nof this coming June, just a few weeks from now, they will be totally \nenergy independent. They started a number of years ago an alternative \nenergy program, and it worked.\n  Brazil, this huge country, heavily populated, large in area, is \nenergy independent. Think what America would be if we did not have to \nuse 21 million barrels of oil a day, over 60 percent of which we \nimport. Brazil is an example. It can be done.\n  National security is another issue that deserves considerable time on \nthe floor in the remaining months. I am confident we will ultimately \npass the supplemental for our troops, and the majority has pledged to \nbring the Defense authorization bill to the floor. I heard that \nearlier. That was the plan before we left for our recess. I hope that \nis true. Bring it to the floor, when? Do we want to wait, as we did \nlast year, until the fall, leaving our troops, veterans, and families \nwithout the resources they need? I hope not.\n  Unlike last year, I hope the Defense authorization bill will not be \npushed aside for other less important business. The troops are \ndepending on us. It is so important. It was wrong to wait as long as we \ndid last year. It sets up pay for the troops and what new equipment \nthey need. It authorizes what the appropriators must come forward with \nto help our brave men and women.\n  I also hope we can pass last year's intelligence authorization bill. \nInteresting. Now, more than any other time, we are dependent on our \nintelligence for our security. What does that mean? It means our spies, \nour satellites, the other activities we do to make America safe. But \nbecause of the majority, we have not brought an intelligence bill \nbefore the Senate. Why? Because they are afraid amendments will be \noffered on prison abuse scandals and on how intelligence was \nmanipulated prior to going to war. We have not even had an intelligence \nauthorization bill. Right now we are in danger of not passing that \nimportant bill for the first time in 28 years because Republicans have \nbeen unwilling to hold the Bush White House accountable for its conduct \nin the war in Iraq and the war on terror.\n  For the first time in 28 years, we are not going to take up this most \nimportant bill dealing with the safety and security of our Nation. I \nask: Is it important we do that? Is it more important we do that or \ntalk about same-sex marriage or the estate tax which will affect a \nfraction of a percent of the American people, a tiny fraction of the \nAmerican people? I think it is more important we deal with \nintelligence, the intelligence authorization bill.\n  Health care: Shouldn't we dive into health care and talk about it? \nThat is something when you go home--and home can be anyplace in our 50 \nStates--whether you are a big company, a little company, a rich man, a \npoor woman, it doesn't matter, people are concerned with the cost of \nhealth care. Surely we can agree that health care problems in our \ncountry are far more important than a handful of amendments to please \nthe rightwing.\n  We need a real health care debate, not a 2- or 3-day minidebate. The \nmajority leader said he will bring to the Senate floor a health care \nbill, the Enzi bill. He said we are going to do it during this work \nperiod.\n  The Enzi bill threatens existing coverage for everyone who has State-\nregulated health insurance. It is touted as a cure for the problems \nsmall businesses have in providing coverage to their employees, but it \nwould actually expose small businesses to fraud and leave self-employed \nindividuals with the same, if not more, problems than they have right \nnow.\n  We all agree small businesses need health care relief. All businesses \nneed health care relief. But the Enzi approach is not the way to move \nforward. Senator Durbin has a bill in committee that will provide small \nbusinesses with the same kind of options Senators have. Why don't we \nbring them to the floor and debate them together and find out what is \nthe best of the two or what is the best mix of the two. With the Enzi \nand Durbin bills we can, and we can also consider other problems facing \nour health care system, such as lowering drug prices, health care \ncosts, expanding coverage, and fixing the President's botched Medicare \ndrug program.\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\n  And if we are going to talk about health care, isn't it about time--\nisn't it about time--we got to stem cell research? We are approaching \nMay 24, the 1-year anniversary of the House passing their stem cell \nbill, and we still haven't seen it in the Senate. Ask any of the \nNevadans with whom I visited if they are more interested in seeing the \nSenate spend its time on issues of stem cells, an issue that offers \nhope to millions and millions of Americans suffering from heart \ndisease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig disease, diabetes, or if \nthey would rather see the Senate spend its remaining days debating \nsame-sex marriage? The answer is obvious. I hope the majority leader, \nwho said he supports stem cell research, will allow us to move forward \nwith the House bill. Stem cell research offers hope to millions of \nAmericans, and the Senate must not stand in its way.\n\n  Immigration. President Bush likes to point fingers on immigration and \nmany other issues. I repeat: President Bush likes to point his finger \non immigration and many other issues. Isn't it about time we move \nbeyond that? Isn't it about time we pass comprehensive immigration \nreform that will secure our borders and secure our country?\n  Before we left for our 2-week break, we had a bipartisan immigration \ndeal that was blocked by a handful of Republican Senators. That \narrangement would have sealed our porous borders, given 12 million \nundocumented workers a reason to come out of the shadows, and provided \npersonnel to enforce our laws, so existing ``employer sanctions'' would \nbe more than just words. It also had a very important provision to take \ncare of guest workers.\n  The Senate can move forward on immigration if the President will \nstand up to those in his party who are filibustering reform and tell \nthem to quit standing in the way of America's security.\n  It is my understanding that the President gave a speech in Orange \nCounty, CA today. By the way, that is where San Diego is, where the \nhighest gas prices are in the country, and maybe he should have spent a \nfew minutes talking about that. Speaking about immigration, the \nPresident said he wants to do something about security. We all want to \ndo something about securing our borders; everybody does. Is that a \nstand of integrity and courage? No. Everybody wants to do something \nabout protecting our porous borders. The President says he wants to do \nsomething about a guest worker program. What? What does he want to do? \nIt is easy for him to criticize. What does he want to do? Let us know \nwhat he wants to do. He is the leader of his party. He never got \ninvolved in the immigration debate until the two votes had taken place, \nand then he was a great finger pointer.\n  It is interesting. In all that I have heard when the President talks \nabout immigration, what does he say about the 12 million who are here \nwho are undocumented? What does he want to do? His party is split. What \ndoes the President of the United States want to do? What does he want \nto do on security? He wants to protect our borders. So do we. What does \nhe want to do with guest workers? Rather than just words, tell us what \nhis program is. He has a staff of thousands. Have a few of them come up \nand tell us what the President wants on a guest worker program. It \nappears he doesn't want anything. But does he want us to do anything \nwith the 12 million? Let him take a stand on that.\n  The Martinez bill that came before the Senate was not supported by \nany of the Republicans. The Martinez bill had a provision for 7,000 new \nworkers via Immigration and Naturalization, and their sole function \nwould be employer sanction enforcement. I thought that was a step in \nthe right direction. Does the President want that? Does he want \nstronger employer sanctions? I repeat: What does he want regarding \nimmigration? I think he has to move beyond security, because all 100 \nSenators want that.\n  Finally, if we are going to do taxes, let's do something that will \nmake a difference for those who need it. Talk to any economist and they \nwill tell you that in America today, the rich are getting richer, the \npoor are getting poorer, and the middle class is being squeezed. Could \nwe spend a little bit of time here on the Senate floor talking about \ntax relief for the middle class, this vanishing breed we have in \nAmerica? It is not much of a distinction anymore to be a millionaire; \nit is whether you are a multibillionaire. That is what gets some \nattention. A millionaire is not much anymore; there are lot more of \nthem. The poor are getting poorer and poorer, the rich are getting \nricher and richer, and the middle class is being squeezed.\n  We could start this tax debate by fixing the AMT, the alternative \nminimum tax. AMT was originally established to ensure that millionaires \npaid their fair share. But because AMT income levels were not indexed \nfor inflation, it has essentially become a tax increase for millions of \nmiddle-class families. That was never its purpose, and we should fix it \nand fix it quickly.\n  Tax fairness should be the Senate's focus, not immoral, unfair tax \nbreaks that will benefit a privileged few, which is further \nexacerbating the problem we have in America today where the rich are \ngetting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is \ngetting squeezed, squeezed, squeezed.\n  So in the weeks ahead, we are ready--the Democrats are ready--to work \nwith the majority on the real issues facing our country. Let's spend \nsome time here debating these issues, legislating high gas prices and \nimmigration and improving our Nation's security. We want to put \npolitics aside and take up the real work facing our country.\n  With the right priorities and the right commitment from the majority, \nwe can move America in the right direction and give the people the real \nsolutions they need. America can do better, and we can do it together. \nThat is what we need: bipartisanship, working together on America's \nproblems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3408-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3408-S3409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE SENATE AS A SAUCER\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, an oft-repeated metaphor compares the U.S. \nSenate to a saucer in which a hot liquid is poured to cool. The \nearliest known written version of this story appears in an 1871 letter \nfrom constitutional law professor Francis Lieber to Ohio Representative \nand later President James A. Garfield. Lieber recounted a story he had \nheard about Thomas Jefferson's visit to Mount Vernon where Jefferson \ndisagreed with Gen. George Washington over the need for a bicameral \nlegislature, and Washington's response:\n  ``You, yourself,'' said the General, ``have proved the excellence of \ntwo houses this very moment.''\n  ``I,'' said Jefferson. ``How is that, General?''\n  ``You have,'' replied the heroic sage, ``turned your hot tea from the \ncup into the saucer, to get it cool. It is the same thing we desire of \nthe two houses.''\n  The Washington-Jefferson dialogue drew further attention in the \nwritings of the late 19th century American historian Moncure D. Conway, \nwho altered the language and the beverage:\n\n       There is a tradition that on his return from France, \n     Jefferson called Washington to account at the breakfast table \n     for having agreed to a second chamber.\n\n  ``Why,'' asked Washington, ``did you pour that coffee into the \nsaucer? Why did you do that?''\n  ``To cool it,'' answered Jefferson.\n  ``Even so,'' said Washington, ``we pour legislation into the \nsenatorial saucer to cool it.''\n  Francis Lieber never discovered the source of this delicious \nanecdote, but whether or not the incident really occurred, the story \nhas been widely embraced because it conveys the essence--the essence--\nyes, the essence--of the U.S. Senate. What is the essence? It is a \ndeliberative body. It is a deliberative body sheltered from shifting \npublic opinion by longer and staggered terms, and originally by being \nelected via the State legislatures. It serves as a counterbalance to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives.\n  The saucer story explains, in simple terms, the significance of the \nSenate, from its origins through its evolution into the most powerful \nupper body of any national legislature in the world. Do you get that? \nThink about that.\n  Senators and other close observers of the institution have grappled \nwith their own ideas about the Senate seeking to highlight its unique \nand enduring attributes, and to explain its role\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\nin the American system of checks and balances. What is it? What is it? \nWhat is it that makes the Senate stand apart from other legislative \nbodies? What is it? What is it that makes the Senate stand apart from \nother legislative bodies? Why have its seemingly arcane rules and \ntraditions survived, and what purpose do they serve? Over the next few \nmonths, the Lord willing--\n\n  You see, from the Book of James in the Bible, don't say ``I'll go \nhere'' or ``I'll go there,'' to this city or that city, and I will be \nthis or that. You better qualify that. As my old mom used to say: \nRobert, you must say, ``if the Lord willing.'' If the Lord wills it, \nyou will do thus and so--if the Lord willing, or God willing. That has \nstuck by me all through these 80 and more years: If the Lord wills it.\n  Over the next few months, the Lord willing--I can't say that. You \nknow, if I say over the next few months, who knows? But, if the Lord \nwills it--God willing, in other words--over the next few months I plan \nto offer a series of addresses in which I shall sample these ideas of \nthe Senate with some explanation of each observer. Their ideas have \nranged from the necessity of the Senate to its role as a balance wheel \nwith the ``people's House,'' the other body. They have focused on the \nrules of the Senate and its civility and decorum. They have viewed the \nSenate as a protector of constitutional liberties, a source of \nstability, and a product of politics.\n  As a deliberative body, the Senate has been hailed as a place for \nsecond thoughts, as a continuing body, and as an institution that \nvalues its traditions. The form of Senate elections, changed by \nconstitutional amendment, and the rules for unlimited debate and \ncloture have been adjusted over the years, but the Senate still differs \nin fundamental ways from the House of Representatives. It stands out, \nthe Senate does--the Senate stands out as a body of individuals with \npeculiar folkways that have fostered what has been described as the \n``Senate type.''\n  A body of equals among individuals and among States, the Senate has \nbeen a difficult institution to lead. Its deliberations have frustrated \nimpatient Presidents. Well, who cares? Senators don't care if they \nfrustrate Presidents. Presidents come and go. Senators may stay on and \non and on.\n  Its deliberations have frustrated impatient Presidents, leaders of \nthe House, and even, yes, leaders of the Senate who seek speedy \nenactment: Let's get it done. We are in a hurry. Let's get it done. Do \nit now.\n  Remember that TV advertisement which said, ``Do it now, do it here; \ndo it now, do it now?''\n  There have been many efforts to modernize the Senate in order to meet \nnew challenges. I have been here a long time. I have seen these efforts \non the part of Senators. Some of them come over from the House of \nRepresentatives. They want to make this body into another House--let's \nget it done. Get it done; do it now; do it here; fast.\n  Yes, there have been many efforts to modernize the Senate in order to \nmeet new challenges. Able leaders have demonstrated courage and skill \nin forging alliances and building friendships to pass legislation. I \ndid that when I was leader of the Senate. I forged alliances with such \nand such a Senator. I forged an alliance. Despite more than two \ncenturies of pressure to change and ``modernize''--let's put quotation \nmarks around that word, ``modernize''--despite more than two centuries \nof pressures to change and ``modernize,'' the Senate, as an \ninstitution, remains remarkably similar to the body created at the \nConstitutional Convention in 1787. It retains all of its original \npowers, including providing advice and consent--yes. You said it. You \nbetter read that again in the Constitution. It retains all of its \noriginal powers, including providing advice and consent to Presidents \non nominations and on treaties, serving as a court of impeachment--you \nbetter believe it, Mr. President. The Senate can send you home. You \nbetter believe that.\n  If the House impeaches you, the Senate will try you. The Senate, \ndon't forget it, serves as a court of impeachment and has an equal say \nwith the House on legislation. The Senate has an equal say with the \nother body on legislation.\n  As my statements in the weeks ahead--Lord willing, God willing--will \nsuggest, the distinctive features of the Senate have survived for so \nlong because they have purpose and will endure as long as they serve \nthe good of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3409-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3409-S3411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the same Bush administration that so \ntragically bungled the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has now \nbungled its way to $3 per gallon gasoline. Unless you were a hermit \nliving in a cave last summer, you couldn't have missed how miserably \nthe administration has failed in its approach to natural disasters. Now \nit is clear to anyone who fills up at a gas pump that this \nadministration is also failing in its approach to energy. In both cases \nthe administration had advanced notice that a major problem was \nimminent and in both cases the administration failed to take action to \nhead off the problem before it became a major crisis for the American \npeople.\n  For Hurricane Katrina, disaster experts had testing that predicted in \nthe spring what could happen, but the administration ignored the \nwarnings of its own experts as major hurricanes were heading toward the \ngulf coast. If anything, the administration's failure to take action to \nprevent gas shortages and price spikes is even more indefensible \nbecause they had more advanced warning and greater certainty that the \nproblem was coming.\n  The Bush administration knew last summer--almost 9 months ago--that \ngasoline shortages and price spikes would hit hard this spring. If ever \nthere was a time to be watchful about oil markets, it has been during \nthe past months as markets have gyrated virtually nonstop with one \ninternational crisis after another.\n  Nigeria has lost a quarter of its output, Iraq's oil production has \nfallen below prewar levels to its lowest point in a decade, Iran says \nsomething warlike about its nuclear program, and oil prices shoot up \n$10 per barrel, and today Venezuela announced that it will move toward \nnationalizing its oil industry and will cut output, which should put \neven more pressure on supply and demand.\n  Yet even with all of this turmoil in world oil markets, the key \nwatchdogs at the Energy Department, at the Environmental Protection \nAgency, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are all absent \nwithout leave. No one is home minding the store when it comes to our \noil and gasoline markets.\n  Never before has there been an administration with so much expertise \nin the oil industry. The President and the Vice President of course \nknow a great deal about the oil sector. The Secretary of State was a \ndirector of Chevron and actually has an oil tanker named after her. The \nlist goes on and on. But none of this expertise seems to be being used \nto help consumers at the gas pump.\n  The administration's recent inaction in the face of soaring prices is \nonly the latest in a long line of failures. In what is a virtual rite \nof spring, gas prices typically spike as refineries shut down for \nmaintenance to switch over to summertime gasoline blends. That has \nhappened each of the last several years, and in each instance the \nadministration has done nothing to help consumers at the pump. But this \nyear the administration had good reason to know that a ``perfect energy \nstorm'' would hit the consumer this spring, and it was clear that \nspikes would be even worse than prior years.\n  For example, the Wall Street Journal reported on August 12, 2005:\n\n       A provision in the massive energy bill that cleared \n     Congress last week is likely to shrink the nation's gasoline \n     supplies next spring and could boost prices 8 cents a gallon \n     or more.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal went on to describe the likely impact of \neliminating the requirement to use cleaner burning additives in \ngasoline, saying:\n\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\n\n       United States gasoline production would fall short of usual \n     levels by about 158,000 barrels a day--the equivalent of \n     losing output from four major refineries.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal quoted an official from Valero Energy \nCorporation, the Nation's largest refiner, who said:\n\n       The price of gasoline ``will definitely go up,'' estimating \n     the potential rise at 8 cents per gallon.\n\n  Because of the new regulations for gasoline, there would not only be \nreduced supply but also lots of new hassles in supplying fuel at the \nlocal level. Gasoline additives would no longer be added at the \nrefinery and transported in pipelines. Instead, ethanol would have to \nbe shipped separately and blended locally, creating new challenges and \nnew logistical hurdles for getting the fuel to America's gasoline \nstations.\n  With all of this disruption and all of these new challenges to \naddress, it was clear to the oil industry that the energy equivalent of \nanother category 5 hurricane would be hitting gasoline consumers around \nthis time of the year. It should have been clear to the Bush \nadministration as well. But following the same game plan they have used \nfor last year's hurricanes, the administration waited until after the \nstorm hit to respond. In fact, gasoline consumers are still waiting for \nhelp at the pump.\n  The two major hurricanes that hit the gulf coast last summer only \nmade this spring's supply situation worse because those storms shut \ndown a number of refineries and reduced oil and gas supplies. Coming in \nthe wake of these storms, the impact of the new gas rules would only \ntighten further what was already a tight market for gasoline, and it \nshould have been clear to the watchdogs in the Bush administration for \nmonths and months.\n\n  The record is clear as to what the facts were that the administration \nhad some time ago. First, if the administration had read its own \nreport, it would have known that gulf coast oil and gasoline production \nwould not be fully restored by this spring. Congress knows this because \nthe administration sends weekly reports to the Congress with updates on \nthe situation. Yet again the administration failed to take any action \nto head off the problem before consumers got hit again.\n  If the administration had read its own report, it also would have \nknown that the impact of the new gasoline rule would be substantial, \nequivalent to 2 percent of the Nation's gasoline supply overall, and 10 \npercent of the supplies in areas with smog problems. This information \nhas been in Energy Department reports as well. Once again, there was no \nresponse from the administration.\n  Finally, if the administration had read its own reports and \npublications, the administration would have known that finding \nalternatives to replace these supplies would not be easy. In fact, a \nstudy by the U.S. Department of Energy estimated that it would take 4 \nyears for refiners to find substitutes for the most commonly used \ngasoline additive known as MTBE.\n  In fact, the new rules are likely to be a double whammy for \nconsumers. They tighten not only domestic supplies but also the \navailability of imports that were so crucial for supplying U.S. \nconsumers following last year's hurricanes. That means the impacts will \nbe similar to last year's hurricanes. But the same solution to address \nthe problem won't be available this year.\n  As the president of Petroleum Industry Research Institute pointed out \nlast summer, in the past the United States has imported gasoline from \nEurope to deal with this particular issue and prevent shortages. But at \nthis point we may not be able to do that since European refiners use \nMTBE.\n  When you add it all up, the administration's record of bungling on \ngas supply and prices is extraordinary. They have known since last \nsummer that there would be a big problem for consumers this spring. \nThey knew that the problem had gotten even bigger since the hurricanes \nlast fall. They knew it was going to take a long time to solve the \nproblem and that what was done last fall to increase supply after the \nhurricanes might not be an option this spring.\n  But yet with all of the advance warnings and red lights flashing, the \nadministration still sat on its hands. At a minimum, the administration \nshould have convened the National Petroleum Council to seek advice and \ncounsel on what options might be available to help consumers at our \ngasoline stations this spring.\n  But as we have seen all too often, the administration doesn't look to \noutside advice, and even more rarely does it listen to it. And there is \nlittle reason to believe the major oil companies, which have such a \nvoice in American politics, would urge the administration to take any \nkind of significant step to help the consumers.\n  So what can be done now that predicted gasoline shortages and price \nspikes are upon us? What could we have prevented or certainly out of \nthis time period helped to minimize the harm that consumers are facing? \nThose steps weren't taken, and the challenge is to put in place the \nbest possible steps now to try to ameliorate a very bad situation that \ncould have been minimized.\n  First, the administration should grant waivers of requirements to use \nethanol in gasoline in areas where it is contributing to shortages or \nprice spikes at the gas pump.\n  Section 1501 of last year's Energy bill provides the administration \nwith this authority in cases where there is inadequate supply or where \nthe mandate would severely harm the economy. Both of these criteria \nhave already been met in a number of areas on the west coast and \nelsewhere in our country.\n  For example, my home State of Oregon isn't required to have ethanol \nin our gas to meet air quality standards. We also have little in-State \nethanol production. So ethanol has to be transported into Oregon, \nlargely from the Midwest, for blending into our gas supply. Waiving the \nrequirement to have ethanol in Oregon gas would also free up supplies \nfor other parts of the country. That reduces demand. And by simple \nsupply and demand, that could serve to reduce prices around the \ncountry. It would also help to bring down the cost of gasoline in \nOregon by eliminating the transportation costs of shipping ethanol from \nthe Midwest.\n\n  Second, the administration should take steps to go after those who \nare speculating right now in our country's oil markets. In the press, \nfor example, speculation is continually cited as a factor in the high \noil and gasoline prices. For example, in last week's Wall Street \nJournal, there was a report:\n\n       Crude oil closed above $70 a barrel for the first time, \n     highlighting a phenomenon reshaping the petroleum world: \n     Investment flows into oil futures are supplanting nitty-\n     gritty supply and demand data as prime drivers of prices.\n\n  Last fall, former ExxonMobil chairman, Lee Raymond, the $600 million \nman, testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nthat speculation in oil markets was inflating prices by $20 per barrel. \nThat inflated oil price, in return, raises gasoline prices at the pump \nby 50 cents a gallon. Yet the administration has done little to \ninvestigate speculation or to stop this activity.\n  To the contrary, on this question of speculation in the oil sector, I \nquestioned the Bush administration's witness from the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission last September. I asked specifically what the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission was doing to investigate reports \nof oil traders making extraordinary profits immediately following \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. My question was about reports that there \nare traders who made so much money that week that they won't have to \npunch a ticket for the rest of the year.\n  Here is what the witness representing the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission said from the Bush administration:\n\n       Granted, a number of them made money, and that is how they \n     do their job, that they earn a return from providing this \n     service.\n\n  So the CFTC's response to reports of traders taking advantage of the \nworst natural disaster in our country's history to make extraordinary \nprofits is: Well, they were just doing their jobs.\n  If that is the market at work, clearly it is not working for the \nAmerican people who saw gasoline prices shoot up above $3 per gallon \nafter last year's hurricanes and again this spring. The regulators of \noil and gas markets need to rein in speculation, not defend it.\n  Another step that could help address speculation would be to have \ngreater\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\ntransparency in our oil markets. For example, pension funds and other \ninstitutional investors are buying oil as part of their investment \nportfolio, and this has created additional pressure on supply and \nprices. Institutional money managers now hold between $100 billion and \n$120 billion in commodities investments, at least double the amount 3 \nyears ago, and up from $6 billion in 1999. More transparency about \nthese transactions would help both the American consumer and the \ninvestors by reducing volatility while stabilizing prices.\n  Finally, for the long term, Congress should repeal oil tax breaks, \nbreaks the industry executives told me when I questioned them in an \nopen hearing they did not even need. Those unneeded oil tax breaks \nshould be replaced with incentives to use biofuels that can replace \nsupply lost from eliminating MTBE from gasoline.\n  These actions would address the immediate supply and price problems \nthat the administration has failed to address since last summer. It \nwill give the biofuels market incentives to do more research and \nincrease production of cleaner alternatives to replace MTBE in the \ngasoline supply.\n  My guess is, and I am happy to see my friend who has an enormous \namount of expertise on this issue in the Senate. Over the next few \nweeks, we will hear a lot of debate about price gouging and \nexploitation. There is no question in my mind that there are certainly \npeople trying to exploit the situation and trying to take advantage of \nthese extraordinary circumstances we see in our energy markets.\n  A significant part of these problems such as the change from MTBE to \nethanol, problems that we knew about a year ago, that the Wall Street \nJournal was reporting on, could have been minimized if those folks in \nthe Bush administration, at the Department of Energy, at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, at the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, if they had been on deck doing their job to stand up for \nthe American people, these problems would not be so serious today.\n  Yet the same people who bungled the response to those hurricanes last \nsummer are bungling America on its way up to $3-per-gallon gasoline. I \ndon't think that ought to be acceptable to any Senator. On a bipartisan \nbasis we can force those watchdogs in the Bush administration to get \nback to the post and stand up for the public.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3411-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3411-S3414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 14 years ago, when I was the U.S. \nSecretary of Education, I received an invitation to the annual Italian-\nAmerican dinner in Washington, DC. To tell the truth, I really didn't \nwant to go because there are lots of dinners in Washington, DC, and the \nhours were long when I was working in the President's Cabinet. I wanted \nto stay home with my wife and children. But that year, 1992, the dinner \nwas in honor of my law school roommate, Paul Tagliabue, who is known to \nmost Americans as the commissioner of the National Football League and \nthe person who likely will be presiding over his last NFL draft this \nweekend.\n  So I decided I would go to this one more long, I expected, \nWashington, DC, dinner in honor of my friend Paul Tagliabue. When I got \nthere, the place was bursting with enthusiasm. Nobody could have \ndoubted that it was the Italian-American dinner. Italian-ness was \neverywhere. Stallone was there, Pelosi was there, Justice Scalia was \nthere and, of course, the National Football League commissioner Paul \nTagliabue was there. It was wonderful, and I was delighted that I went.\n  The room was filled with emotion. But the reason I tell this story is \nthat the height of emotion on that emotional evening was when everybody \nin the room paused, put their hands over their hearts, and said the \nPledge of Allegiance to the American flag and sang ``The Star-Spangled \nBanner.'' There were a lot of tears at that moment. The point of it is \nthat in that room of people who were so proud of the country of Italy, \nfrom where they had come or their parents or grandparents had come, and \nthere was no mistaking that they were proud to be from Italy, but they \nwere prouder to be American.\n  I mention that because this week we will begin to discuss immigration \nagain. I believe we are missing the fundamental issue in the \nimmigration debate. Of course, border security is important. Of course, \na proper allocation of temporary students and temporary workers is \nimportant. There will be a lot of debate about what defines amnesty in \nany sort of legislation. But I believe the real underlying emotion in \nthe immigration debate, the part that we are missing, is the question \nof how many new men and women can we absorb at one time in this \ncountry. How many men and women can come into this country and become \nAmericans and accept the rights and responsibilities of citizenship? I \nbelieve what underlies a lot of the emotion, a lot of the concern about \nthe debate we are having, is that Americans are afraid that we may be \nexceeding that limit. They want to make certain that almost all of \nthose who come to live here expect sooner or later to become Americans, \nto accept the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.\n  My rough calculation is that, in a country of about 300 million \npeople who live in the United States of America today, about 10 percent \nof us are not citizens of the United States.\n  We have about 570,000 students from other countries. They are welcome \nhere. They help improve our standard of living while they are working \nhere, and when they go home, they usually spread our values better than \nany foreign aid we have ever passed.\n  We have about 500,000 temporary workers of one kind or another who \nare important to our free market system.\n  We have 11.6 million permanent legal residents, people with so-called \ngreen cards, some of whom are on their way to becoming citizens. But an \nincreasing number of them are not electing to become citizens of the \nUnited States.\n  Then we have 10 million or 12 million people who are illegally here. \nThey are here mostly to work. Some estimates are that they comprise \nabout 5 percent of our workforce.\n  So, all in all, that is probably more or less 30 million people of \nthe 300 million of us who live here who are not citizens of the United \nStates, and there are another 2 or 3 percent of us who are dual \ncitizens, citizens of the United States and of another country.\n  An important part of this debate is, how many is too many?\n  We know the benefits of immigration in the United States of America. \nWe call ourselves a nation of immigrants, and we say that proudly. That \nspunk, bravery, and courage that caused people to come and still come \nto our country has defined our character. No other country in the world \nbelieves anything is possible, that anyone of any background can rise \nto the top.\n  My grandfather, who was a railroad engineer, used to say: Aim for the \ntop, there is more room there. Most people think that is a silly \nstatement. But we don't. That is an essential part of the American \ncharacter. A lot of it comes from being a nation of immigrants. The \ndiversity that comes into our country because of immigration makes our \ncountry more interesting. I once heard Robert Mondavi, the famous \nCalifornia winemaker, say that--and excuse me in Iowa for saying this--\n20 years ago we could not get a good meal in Des Moines, and into Des \nMoines came people from different cultures and different countries, and \nthey brought their own recipes. And what makes the food so good today \nin Des Moines, said Mr. Mondavi, is not that one was an Indian dish or \na Sri Lankan dish or a French dish or a Colombian dish, but they mixed \nit together and created an American cuisine.\n  The diversity brought to us by people regularly coming to our country \nmakes a difference. And then the patriotism that comes from those who \nbecome new citizens enriches us. Our most patriotic citizens are often \nthose who have just become citizens, reminding those of us\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\nwho have been here, as our family has for seven, eight, nine \ngenerations, that it is nothing to be taken for granted. As our \npopulation growth reduces in this country, and in our free market \nsystem as we produce a disproportionate number of the new jobs here, we \nfind new workers coming into our country, whether they are skilled \nworkers helping to win new jobs or win Nobel Prizes or whether they are \nunskilled workers who add to our free market system.\n  We know the value of immigration to the United States. We know two \nother things as well. One is that those who come here expect to come to \na nation that honors the rule of law. In many cases, immigrants have \ncome here fleeing a nation that didn't have rule of law, where you \nmight be ordered to this place by the whim of a dictator or a potentate \nor someone who was above the law. That is what most people are fleeing \nfrom--nations and countries without the rule of law. It is important \nthat we honor the rule of law here.\n  New Americans, new people who come to live here understand very well \nthat they have the freedom to drive across State lines, but they cannot \nrun a stop sign. They have the freedom to make contracts with whom they \nplease, but they have to keep the contract. They have a second \namendment right to own a gun, but they cannot shoot anybody. This is a \nnation that honors the rule of law, and new immigrants and those who \nare already here understand that.\n  The other thing is that new people coming into our country for the \nmost part understand as well as we do, those of us who are already \nhere, that we are a nation based upon an idea. We are not a tribe. We \nare not a racial culture. Our ancestry isn't what's most important to \nus. What matters to us most is the motto that is engraved in stone \nabove the Presiding Officer's desk, ``E Pluribus Unum''--from many, \none. This country's most magnificent accomplishment is that we have \ntaken people from all different parts of the world and turned this into \none Nation. We have done this by insisting that new citizens become \nAmericans.\n\n  Becoming American--those two words have always been serious business \nin this country. In Valley Forge in 1778, as I mentioned on this floor \nseveral times, George Washington and his officers took an oath whereby \nthey renounced their allegiance to their former ruler--King George \nIII--and pledged their allegiance to this new country. Ever since \nthen--since 1795 at least--the oath of allegiance that new citizens \nhave taken has been essentially the oath of allegiance that George \nWashington and his officers took. They didn't renounce--in the case of \nthose at the Italian-American dinner--their Italianess; they are proud \nof that. But they renounce loyalty to the Italian government and pledge \nallegiance to this country. They are clear about that, and we have been \nclear about that for more than 200 years.\n  When we have large numbers of new people coming into our country, as \nwe did just 100 years ago, which was the last time we had such a large \npercentage of foreign-born people living in the United States, we went \nto great efforts to try to help them become Americans. Albert Shanker, \nthe late president of the American Federation of Teachers, once said in \na meeting in Rochester, which I attended, that the common school, our \npublic school, was created primarily for the purpose of helping \nimmigrant children learn the three Rs--reading, writing, and \narithmetic--and what it meant to be an American, with the hope they \nwould go home and teach their parents. The common school was an \n``Americanizing'' institution. So was Ford Motor Company 100 years ago, \nas were many businesses.\n  Robert Putnam, in his book ``Bowling Alone,'' talked about how in \nthis country civic associations such as the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, \nBoys and Girls Club, and Rotary Club were all set up with the idea of \nreminding ourselves--those who are already here--to help new people \ncoming into our country learn what it means to become an American, to \nlearn our common language, learn our history, and to learn the \nprinciples that unite us as a country.\n  Other countries now are looking at the American experience and \nwishing they had some of it. Last year, France and England experienced \ngreat difficulties with the bombing in the London subways and the riots \nin France. What was it about? It was about people who had come from \nother countries to live in France and England and who didn't feel part \nof the country. They wanted to feel French; they wanted to feel \nEnglish. People are starting to think how do you become French or \nEnglish or German, when 5 or 6 years ago you had to be the son or \ndaughter of a German in order to be a German. How do you become \nJapanese or Chinese? That is a foreign concept in most countries. It is \nhard to become German or French or Japanese.\n  But to become a citizen of the United States, you must become an \nAmerican. We don't want to lose that. That should be the central focus \nof any immigration debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  I was in Rome last week, and I visited with our Ambassador to Rome, \nwho is the grandson of an Italian immigrant. He said they have formed a \ncouncil there in Italy to try to deal with the problem of how do you \nbecome Italian because Italy needs more people. It has a population of \n58 million, the second lowest birth rate in Europe, the largest \npercentage of elderly, 2.9 million legal immigrants, over 500,000 \nillegal immigrants, increasingly Muslim. A large number of Muslims--1.5 \nmillion--who live there don't feel they are a part of Italy. If Italy \ndoesn't have people coming from other countries, the number of people \nwho live in Italy will go down and down and so will their economy. They \nformed a council in Italy. Four people who were Muslims and who live in \nItaly were sent to the United States, and one who came back--a woman \nfrom Algeria who came to Italy when she was 14 and is now 30--said to \nour Ambassador to Italy: For the first time, I feel Italian. He asked \nwhy. She said: When I went to America, the Muslims I met there felt \nAmerican. They may be against the war in Iraq, but they all thought of \nthemselves first as Americans.\n  That is a concept which we don't dare lose. All of us know that the \nimportance of becoming American has been gradually diminishing in our \nculture, especially since the 1960s. Our schools don't teach U.S. \nHistory in the way they once did and in the way they should. In fact, \nthe lowest score our high school seniors have on national tests is not \nin math, not in science, it is in U.S. History. Our colleges don't \nrequire a course in U.S. History. Our colleges of education don't turn \nout very many teachers of U.S. History.\n  In an age of globalization, some people say, well, nationality \ndoesn't really make much difference.\n  Increasingly, official business in States and counties is conducted \nin more than our common language, English. Even some of our political \nleaders extol diversity over unity. They extol the pluribus over the \nunum.\n  Make no mistake, diversity is important to the United States. It is a \ngreat advantage to us, but diversity is not our greatest strength. \nJerusalem is diverse. Iraq is diverse. The Balkans are diverse. Our \nmost magnificent accomplishment and greatest strength, and one we \nshould not forget during this debate, is that we have taken all this \ndiversity and formed it into one nation.\n  That is why I was pleased to see that the Senate adopted, before the \nimmigration bill got off track, an amendment I proposed with a number \nof other Senators that would help prospective citizens become \nAmericans. It would do it in a number of ways.\n  In the first place, it would raise to the level of law George \nWashington's oath, slightly rewritten, the same oath that a half \nmillion to a million new citizens have taken every year, an oath that \nrecognizes that someone has waited that 5 years, learned English to an \neighth-grade level, passed a test in our history, demonstrated their \ngood character, and said: I foreswear allegiance from where I came, and \nI pledge allegiance to the United States.\n  The amendment, which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, would also \ncreate grants to prospective citizens who needed help learning English. \nIt would reduce from 5 years to 4 years the amount of time you need to \nwait to become a citizen if you were fluent in English. That is a level \nhigher than eighth grade. It would create a foundation to help with \ngrants to encourage the teaching of civics and English in the same way \nthat we did throughout\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\ncivic organizations 100 years ago in this country.\n  In addition, we should also look carefully at other parts of what we \ndo in our Government. We should have more support for English as a \nsecond language in the schools. We should not have waiting lines of \nadults who want to learn English in this country, our common language. \nPeople want to learn it. We should help them.\n  We should have more summer academies for outstanding teachers and \nstudents of American history and civics. This Congress approved that \nfor the first time last year. We will have two this summer. We should \nhave many more. And we should do more teaching through the traditional \nAmerican history program that Senator Byrd and others put into the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  Those things do cost money, but in a $2.6 trillion budget, surely we \ncan find something to take out so we can put those things in because \nnothing, I submit, is more important than making sure our children know \nwhat it means to be an American and to know that our new citizens do as \nwell.\n  I am here today to remind myself and my colleagues of that story of \nmy visit to the Italian-American dinner 14 years ago. I wish every \nMember of the Senate could have been there. I wish they could have seen \nthe pride in the Italian-ness of all there to honor Paul Tagliabue, \nJustice Scalia, now the ranking Democrat in the House Nancy Pelosi, and \nSylvester Stallone. It is important to be reminded that in that room, \nthe greatest emotion was for the Pledge of Allegiance to the United \nStates of America. They may be proud of where they came from, but they \nare prouder of where they have come.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have two articles printed, one \nentitled ``Citizenship is the Key'' by Noah Pickus, who is the \nassociate director of the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University \nand who writes about the importance of hometown associations in the \nUnited States that link immigrants to their native community and \nculture while serving as a vehicle for engagement with American \nsociety.\n  He says:\n\n       All of these approaches--new citizenship processes, new \n     structures and strategies for incorporation and new \n     coalitions--can focus our attention on the important and \n     difficult work of building a nation here at home.\n\n  And secondly, an article from the Memphis Commercial Appeal about the \nteacher Christine Byrd who teaches children in Memphis who don't know \nEnglish, our common language of English, and she wrote down what \nimmigrant children have told her about their first impressions of \nAmerica. It reminds us of the strength and vitality of new people \ncoming here.\n  ``You can take a shower with hot and cold water running at the same \ntime,'' said a third grader from Sudan.\n  ``You can have a fluffy towel to dry after a shower,'' said a first \ngrader from Nigeria.\n  ``You can go to school for free,'' said a student from Vietnam.\n  ``You can go to a pet store and buy a pet,'' said a student from \nChina.\n  ``You can be rescued by the [Transportation Department] on the \nfreeway,'' said a student from Vietnam.\n  ``You can have ice cream any time you want,'' said a student from \nChina.\n  I ask unanimous consent these articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From Newsday, Apr. 9, 2006]\n\n                         Citizenship is the Key\n\n                            (By Noah Pickus)\n\n       Citizenship has become the most controversial element in \n     current immigration reform. The House has passed an \n     ``enforcement-first'' bill that would effectively preclude \n     citizenship for illegal immigrants or foreign workers, and \n     the Senate is grappling with various proposals that could \n     legalize the status of some or all illegal immigrants who are \n     already in the United States and create new guest-worker \n     programs.\n       The key issue this legislation faces whenever it finally \n     gets to a conference committee will be whether illegal \n     immigrants or guest workers should be allowed to apply for \n     citizenship and under what conditions.\n       This attention to citizenship is surprising, given that \n     most of the public debate has turned on questions of \n     economics, security and border enforcement. It also marks a \n     significant break from the last major debate over illegal \n     workers, the 1986 Immigration and Reform Control Act. Then, \n     advocates for amnesty pressed for legal status, not \n     citizenship, arguing that the latter was passe in a global \n     world and that illegal immigrants' economic and social ties \n     demanded full legal recognition.\n       More recently, Mexican President Vicente Fox has said that \n     Mexicans in the United States are ``not going to become \n     American citizens, nor do they want U.S. citizenship. What \n     they are interested in is having their rights respected.'' In \n     this, he has been joined by business interests whose primary \n     goal is to secure a steady stream of low-wage workers.\n       Whether legalization or guest worker programs are a good \n     idea will rightfully be the subject of much debate in the \n     coming weeks. But if we are to have them, it is critical to \n     ensure that citizenship rather than merely legal status or \n     labor eligibility is our common goal.\n       Most Americans don't favor temporary guest worker programs \n     or simple amnesty programs. They want immigrants who work \n     hard and have put down roots to further invest in creating \n     stable neighborhoods and manageable schools, and in becoming \n     American. By contrast, even if a temporary worker program \n     operated effectively, it would create large numbers of \n     immigrants who are, by definition, transient.\n       If, as seems likely, workers who put down ties in a \n     community don't go home at the end of their work permit, we \n     are creating the conditions for continued social disorder. If \n     citizenship is not a realistic goal for illegal immigrants \n     who have been in the United States for some time, or for \n     future guest workers, we risk creating the same \n     disenfranchised underclass of immigrants that is roiling \n     Europe.\n       As important as a pathway to citizenship is, though, \n     building a common sense of citizenship and identity will \n     require an active commitment on the part of both immigrants \n     and citizens.\n       Our naturalization process needs to offer a real \n     opportunity for civic learning and social cohesion. The \n     process now is characterized by frustrated administrators, \n     poorly funded providers of civic and English classes, \n     doubtful citizens and, most especially, confused and worried \n     immigrants. (Although little noticed, one part of the current \n     immigration reform bill would establish a foundation to \n     support the activities of the Office of Citizenship and \n     provide grants for organizations to offer civics, history and \n     English courses.)\n       We also need to learn from past integration efforts that \n     instruction in lofty principles isn't sufficient to \n     incorporate newcomers. Immigrants need structures and \n     strategies for negotiating the often bewildering challenges \n     of making a new life in a new place.\n       One hundred years ago, during the last major wave of \n     immigration, Jane Addams understood how poor, uneducated \n     immigrants had to be enticed into the public realm by \n     appealing to their pressing private concerns. She recognized \n     that domestic issues of child care, nutrition and housing had \n     to be linked to broader lessons about personal and social \n     responsibility.\n       This approach is needed again today, especially in bridging \n     the gap between immigrant and native-born communities. For at \n     least the last decade or so, Americans have been worrying \n     about the erosion of community ties, civic institutions and \n     social trust. What has been too easily overlooked in these \n     debates is that there are sources of social capital even in \n     beleaguered immigrant communities.\n       There are, for instance, more than 1,500 hometown \n     associations in the United States that link immigrants to \n     their native community and culture while serving as vehicle \n     for engagement with American society. If American civic \n     groups joined forces with these associations, they could turn \n     a legalization program into an integration movement. Instead \n     of treating legalization as evidence of our inability to \n     control our borders, they could use it as a vehicle for \n     building coalitions in support of a common citizenship.\n       All of these approaches--new citizenship processes, new \n     structures and strategies for incorporation and new \n     coalitions--can focus our attention on the important and \n     difficult work of building a nation here at home.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      With English as Their Second Language, Relating Comes First\n\n              (By Ruma Banerji Kumar and Halimah Abdullah)\n\n       Apr. 11, 2006.--Christine Byrd started speaking gibberish.\n       That's what it sounded like to the 15 or so teachers who \n     were in a training session with her on a recent Friday.\n       Byrd was actually speaking Vietnamese. She asked the group \n     simple questions: their names, the date.\n       The teachers started feeling uneasy. Some began to write \n     nervously on paper, randomly guessing at what she was asking \n     of them. Others stared blankly.\n       Byrd works in the Memphis city school office that trains \n     and supervises teachers working with foreign-language \n     speaking students. She had just taught the group a key \n     lesson: how it feels to be an immigrant child in a foreign \n     place.\n       ``When you don't understand the language spoken all around \n     you, you don't have any foothold,'' said Byrd's supervisor, \n     Andrew Duck. ``You're hearing sounds, but you're not able to \n     relate them to anything. It causes a little bit of fear, \n     uneasiness.''\n       To drive the lesson home, Byrd also shared with teachers a \n     diary she's kept of what immigrant children have told her \n     about their\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\n     first impressions of America. It's an account she has \n     collected over the past decade.\n       The children use simple words.\n       They are grateful for basic opportunities.\n       Understanding that mindset, Byrd says, will help teachers \n     meet the needs of students who are sometimes enigmas to them.\n       The words of the children take on particular significance \n     this week, as an estimated 1 million immigrants rally across \n     the country for reform in the way the law classifies and \n     treats those who enter American borders illegally.\n       Byrd's journal is called ``Only in America.''

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord an editorial from the Wall Street Journal, dated April 18, \nentitled ``Democracy by Decree.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 18, 2006]\n\n                          Democracy by Decree\n\n       Miracles do happen. In Los Angeles last week a state judge \n     lifted a consent decree issued in 1991 after parents filed a \n     lawsuit claiming that public schools in poor neighborhoods \n     had too few experienced teachers. The court has since ordered \n     the school district to spend an average of $11 million a year \n     on teacher training in certain schools. And now, almost 15 \n     years later, the judge has finally declared herself satisfied \n     and declined to extend the decree for another five years.\n       Other locales aren't so lucky. Consent decrees are judicial \n     decrees that enforce agreements between state and local \n     governments and the parties suing them. But such decrees have \n     proliferated to the extent that judges are micromanaging many \n     public institutions in the name of protecting ``rights.'' And \n     they're costing taxpayers money and infringing on the right \n     to self-government.\n       In New York, a 1974 federal consent decree has mandated \n     bilingual education in the city's schools for more than 30 \n     years--even though many parents want no part of it. In \n     Tennessee, a federal consent decree from 1979 prevents the \n     state from requiring generic, rather than brand-name, drugs \n     for Medicaid patients despite the fact that this is standard \n     practice for many private drug plans and other state Medicaid \n     programs. And in Los Angeles, a 1996 consent decree has \n     forced the Metropolitan Transit Authority to spend 47% of its \n     budget on city buses no matter what the MTA deems to be its \n     priorities.\n       New York Law professors David Schoenbrod and Ross Sandler \n     call this ``democracy by decree,'' or the process by which \n     public-policy decisions are taken out of the hands of elected \n     legislators and left to an unelected judiciary. Their 2002 \n     book of that name is the inspiration for legislation \n     introduced in the Senate last month that would limit the use \n     of federal consent decrees.\n       The legislation's sponsors are Tennessee Republican Lamar \n     Alexander and Arkansas Democrat Mark Pryor. It's no \n     coincidence that both Senators were once state officials. \n     ``I'm looking at this as a former Governor,'' says Mr. \n     Alexander. ``The idea is to try to let those who are elected \n     make policy unencumbered by courts.'' Mr. Pryor is a former \n     Arkansas Attorney General. Similar legislation is pending in \n     the House.\n       Consent decrees can be a huge burden on state and local \n     officials. They sometimes last for decades, long after the \n     officials who agreed to them have left office. Newly elected \n     officials often find themselves locked in by the decrees, \n     unable to put in place policies they were elected to \n     implement. Outgoing officials have been known to sign their \n     names to such decrees in an effort to force their successors \n     to go along with policies they oppose.\n       One part of the Alexander-Pryor solution is term limits--\n     either four years for a decree, or the expiration of the term \n     of the highest elected official who signed his name to it. \n     Their legislation also sensibly shifts the burden of proof \n     for modifying or ending the decree to plaintiffs from state \n     and local governments.\n       The legislation endorses the view of a unanimous Supreme \n     Court, which in 2004 called for limiting decrees. It warned \n     in Frew v. Hawkins that federal consent decrees could \n     encroach on state and local power. They may ``improperly \n     deprive future officials of their designated and executive \n     powers,'' the Court said. They may also lead ``to federal \n     court oversight of state programs for long periods of time \n     even absent an ongoing violation of the law.''\n       There are federal consent decrees in force in all 50 \n     states, with judges running prisons, schools, welfare \n     agencies, health-care systems and more--based on the advice \n     of the advocates who brought the original lawsuits. It's time \n     to turn those jobs back to the elected lawmakers, and it's \n     good to see at least someone in this ostensibly conservative \n     Congress show some modesty about federal authority.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 25 of us in the Senate have introduced \nS. 489, a bipartisan piece of legislation--Senators Kyl and Cornyn on \nthe Republican side and Senators Pryor and Nelson on the Democratic \nside, and a number of others--to try to put some reasonable limits on \nthe use of Federal court consent decrees that take away from elected \nofficials and State and local government the right to make policy \ndecisions that they make so they can get on with their business without \nundue interference from the courts. It is based on a scholarship book \ncalled ``Democracy by Decree'' by two former lawyers for the National \nResources Defense Council, David Schoenbrod and Ross Sandler.\n  Their scholarship has been applauded by a broad range of people, \nincluding former New York City Mayor Ed Koch and former Senator Bill \nBradley. It talks about the importance of taking Federal court consent \ndecrees, which can be very useful tools, and making certain they don't \nlast forever.\n  To use a one-paragraph example:\n\n       In New York, a 1974 federal consent decree has mandated \n     bilingual education in the city's schools for more than 30 \n     years--even though many parents want no part of it.\n\n  In Tennessee--my State--a Federal consent degree from 1979 prevents \nthe state from requiring generic, rather than brand-name, drugs for \nMedicaid patients despite the fact that this is standard practice for \nmany private drug plans and other State Medicaid Programs.\n  While the State waited for a Federal court to decide how much it \nwanted to intervene, it was costing the State enough to give every \nTennessee teacher that year a $700 pay raise.\n  And in Los Angeles, a 1996 consent decree has forced the Metropolitan \nTransit Authority to spend 47 percent of its budget on city buses no \nmatter what the MTA deems to be its priorities.\n  In the House of Representatives, the Republican whip, Roy Blunt, is \nthe principal sponsor. Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Nashville, is the \nprincipal Democratic sponsor. Representative Cooper says this bill is \nabout keeping democracy fresh. It has had hearings in the Senate. It is \nscheduled for markup. It is a good, reasonable bill. It is making \nprogress in the House.\n  We are going to have to bring the growth of Medicaid spending under \ncontrol over the next several years. We cannot ask State governments to \ndo that unless we give them more authority over their own decisions. \nThis bill would help do that.\n  I call this editorial to the attention of my colleagues.\n  I thank the Republican whip for granting me this extra time.\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, freedom took another important step \nforward this past Saturday in Iraq. Last December, we witnessed \nmillions of free and brave Iraqi citizens defy the terrorist death \nthreats and go to the polls to elect a parliament. Since that election, \nIraqi political leaders have been hard at work forging a government \nthat reflects the will of the Iraqi people.\n  This Saturday--unfortunately, it took a while to get there--we were \nfinally able to celebrate the good news. Iraqis have made major \nprogress toward achieving the goal of having a government in place. \nIraqi political leaders reached an important agreement for the top \nleadership post for a national unity government.\n  Iraq will retain the experienced hand of Jalal Talabani as President, \nand the new Prime Minister Jawad al-Maliki appears to be a reformer, \nrespected by all sides, who will hopefully have the credibility and the \nauthority to shape a strong government with the power to take on the \nmajor issues facing that country.\n  The new Iraqi leadership has the will of the people at its back. They \nunderstand that democracy requires the courage to reach consensus. Over \nthe next 30 days, they must fill the remaining slots of the cabinet and \nbegin to address the challenges that grip that country.\n  Freedom and stability in Iraq is bad news for the terrorists. A \nstable, strong Iraq will unite its people against continued violence. A \nstable, strong Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror and a beacon \nof democracy in the Middle East. A stable, strong Iraq that cracks down \non the terrorists in its midst will make the region and the world more \nsecure.\n  Aside from the Iraqis themselves, much credit for this triumph in \nIraq goes to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Her skillful \ndiplomacy appears to have been a crucial ingredient in breaking the \nlogjam.\n  Much credit also goes to our U.S. Ambassador there, Zalmay Khalilzad, \nfor his tireless efforts. And, of course, President Bush's continuing \nresolve to defy terrorism and terrorist-friendly regimes and to support \nfreedom and democracy has inspired and strengthened everyone in the \nprocess.\n  As we celebrate the victory in Iraq, we are mindful that much hard \nwork certainly lies ahead. Terrorist violence in Iraq continues. Some \nsay the momentum from the three successful elections of last year each \none drawing greater levels of turnout than the one before has been \nsquandered with the last 4 months of political bickering. The new Iraq \nleaders must be sure not to squander any more by failing to assemble a \ngovernment in a timely manner.\n  Although we are cautious, I think we should also be optimistic. \nAmerica will continue to stand beside Iraq in the days ahead. I remind \nanyone who thinks this new government took too long to form that \nAmerica also had a rocky start at its beginning. People forget that \nfrom the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution was 11 years, \nand from the Declaration of Independence until George Washington \nactually took office was 13 years.\n  Freedom, however, is worth the wait. The incoming Prime Minister \nappears to understand that he must form a consensus government, one \nthat must reach out to Iraq's many ethnic and religious groups as his \ncountry begins its journey of democracy.\n  I was heartened by the promise he made this weekend. Here is what he \nhad to say. He said:\n\n       We are going to form a family that will not be based on \n     sectarian or ethnic backgrounds. . . .Those who take \n     responsibility in the new government will be representing the \n     people, not their parties.\n\n  The new Prime Minister, al-Maliki, has the right attitude, and that \nattitude should continue to guide the new government in the days ahead.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating the people of \nIraq for spurning the terrorists and continuing down the road to \ndemocracy.\n  Most of all, I wish to express my profound gratitude for our troops \nin Iraq. It has been their strength and courage that has made progress \non the road to freedom possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3415-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HEAD START IN MONTANA\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, each year since 1988, April 21 has been \ndesignated as Youth Service Day. This day is especially important for a \ngroup of Montanans in Billings, MT, who have been working with children \nsince 1966. On April 21, the staff of Head Start, Inc. in Billings \ncelebrated their 40th anniversary. I rise today to congratulate them on \ntheir past efforts and to express my support for another 40 years of \nservice.\n  We have all seen the positive impact that Head Start has on children \nand families throughout Montana. This Federal program provides child \nand family development services by helping children under the age of 5 \nto develop the skills they will use throughout their formal education \nand for the rest of their lives. Head Start in Billings was recently \nrecognized as among the top 2 percent of Head Start programs \nnationwide. Their continued dedication to excellence is deserving of \nrecognition and praise, and I am honored to rise on their behalf.\n  While celebrating this milestone of service to Montana, these \ndedicated staff members recognized a very special volunteer named \nThelma Adolph. Thelma, who volunteers through Head Start's Foster \nGrandparents program, has given her time for 20 straight years. She has \ntouched the lives of countless children, and it is no exaggeration to \nsay that the world is a better place because of her. Such dedication is \nall the more impressive because Thelma is 93 years old.\n  And so, I ask my colleagues to share my gratitude for the efforts, \ndedication and excellence of Head Start and Thelma Adolph. I thank them \nall for their hard work and dedication on behalf of Montana's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3415-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3415-S3416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               91ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \ncommemorate April 24, 2005, the 91st anniversary of the beginning of \nthe Armenian genocide. I do so because I believe it is necessary to \nrecognize and ensure that similar atrocities do not happen in the \nfuture.\n  No one knows this better than the 500,000 Armenians who are living in \nmy home State of California. These men, women, and children are a \nshining example of the backbone of our society and serve as a symbol of \nperseverance and determination.\n  Their ancestors came to our country to build a better life for \nthemselves and their families, and today, Armenian-Americans recognize \nthat the repercussions of allowing aggression and injustice against \nethnic, religious, or minority groups to persist can be dire.\n  During the Armenian genocide, which took place between 1915 and 1923, \nover a million Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven \nfrom their homes.\n  We must never again allow a human tragedy to occur on this scale. It \nis unacceptable to witness thousands of innocent victims suffer and die \nwithout taking any action.\n  And I know this issue not only resonates with the Armenians in \nCalifornia but with everyone in the country. Every day, numerous \nconstituents from different backgrounds call my office asking what \nCongress and the administration are doing to prevent genocide from \noccurring again.\n  It is absolutely essential that we do not let history repeat itself. \nWe can--and we must--do better.\n  The Armenian-American community knows this all too well and today, we \nstand with them in commemorating the start of the Armenian genocide. So \nlet us renew our commitment to support those around the world who face \npersecution and even death simply because of who they are. We will \nnever forget the Armenian genocide, and we look to the present and \nfuture with a newfound sense of hope and optimism so that we may have \nthe strength to stand up and prevent such atrocities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to commemorate the \n91st anniversary of the Armenian genocide on April 24th. This \nanniversary offers an opportunity for us to renew our\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\nefforts to achieve--finally--genocide recognition for the Armenian \npeople.\n  Ninety-one years ago, the Ottoman Turks began their systematic effort \nto eradicate the Armenian people. From 1915 until 1923, 1.5 million \nArmenians were tortured and killed; men were separated from their \nfamilies and murdered; women and children were forced to march across \nthe Syrian desert without water, food, or possessions; many died of \nhunger or thirst or were killed when they lagged behind during the \nforced marches into the desert.\n  The brutality of the genocide was atrocious. But the inhumanity \ncontinues today because the Turkish Government refuses to acknowledge \nthe massacres as genocide. The wounds cannot heal until the Armenian \npeople receive recognition.\n  The Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the 20th century. But \nas we have seen, it was not the last. As we know, if we ignore \ninjustice, we are likely to see it repeated. In his justification for \nthe Holocaust, Adolf Hitler said, ``Who, after all, speaks today of the \nannihilation of the Armenians?'' And today, we see ongoing atrocities \nin the Darfur region of Sudan, with innocent civilians being murdered. \nIn the 108th Congress, I cosponsored a resolution declaring that the \natrocities in Darfur constitute genocide.\n  I am currently a cosponsor of a resolution calling the President to \nensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects \nappropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to \nhuman rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the record \nof the United States relating to the Armenian genocide and the \nconsequences of the failure to realize a just resolution. And I have \nsigned onto a letter urging President Bush to honor the historic \nleadership of the United States in defending human rights and to \nproperly characterize the atrocities against the Armenian people as \ngenocide in his April 24th statement.\n  Every year, we move closer to recognition of the Armenian genocide. \nBut every year, we wonder how long it will take the Government of \nTurkey to acknowledge the genocide.\n  We need genocide recognition to honor those 1.5 million Armenians who \nlost their lives and to honor the survivors who are still with us \ntoday. We need recognition to send a message to the 8 to 10 million \nArmenians worldwide that they have not been forgotten. We need genocide \nrecognition to remind the world that crimes against humanity are crimes \nagainst us all. And we need genocide recognition because it is the \nright thing to do.\n  By acknowledging this genocide for what it is, I hope that we are \nable to help create a more just and humane world.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, on behalf of the Armenian population of \nRhode Island and Armenians around the world, I want to recognize the \n91st anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  Ninety-one years ago today, April 24, the Young Turk leaders of the \nOttoman Empire summoned and executed over 200 Armenian community \nleaders. By 1923, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were murdered, and \nanother one half million were exiled, affecting the lives of every \nArmenian in Asia Minor.\n  Author John Minassian, a survivor of the 1915 Armenian genocide, \ntells of his experience. ``These fine people were now being made into \nrefugees only because they had clung to their ancient beliefs and the \nfaith of their ancestors. They marched proudly under a yoke of hatred, \nprejudice and bigotry, their morale high, their spirit as yet unbroken. \nThey knew that their only `crime' was being Armenian.''\n  The Armenian genocide was condemned at the time by representatives of \nthe British, French, Russian, German, and Austrian Governments, both \nfoes and allies of the Ottoman Empire.\n  Today, as a cosponsor of S. Res. 320, I call on the President to \nensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects \nappropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to \nhuman rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the record \nof the United States relating to the Armenian genocide.\n  Armenian soldiers have supported Operation Iraqi Freedom as part of \nthe Polish-led multinational division in south-central Iraq. Working as \ntruck drivers, bomb detonators, and doctors, Armenia has not allowed \nothers to be left helpless as they were nearly a century ago. The \nUnited States is proud to have Armenia as an ally in the rebuilding and \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  So as history does not repeat itself, we must study and remember the \nevents of our past. In instances such as the Armenian genocide, all \nnations must educate their youth in the hatred, the wrongdoing, and the \noppression to deter future atrocities against humanity. Not more that \ntwo decades after the Armenian genocide, Hitler said to his generals on \nthe eve of sending his death squads into Poland, ``Go, kill without \nmercy . . . who today remembers the annihilation of the Armenians.'' We \nremember the Armenians.\n  Menk panav chenk mornar.

Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow Rhode Islanders, I \nwish to recognize the 2550th anniversary of the Buddha, the Khmer New \nYear.\n  This cultural celebration highlights the rich heritage of Cambodian \nAmericans, while recognizing contemporary Khmerian accomplishments. \nAncient dance, music, and religious traditions of the Cambodian \ncommunity are the focus of the holiday.\n  The festivity, celebrated in the reprieve between the harvest and the \nweeks referred to as the ``rainy season,'' is an occasion for Cambodian \nAmericans to pass their customs to future generations while \nsimultaneously allowing all Cambodians to share their culture with \nother Americans.\n  Traditionally, the anniversary of the Buddha affords Cambodians a \nchance to give thanks, reflect, and welcome the spirit Tevada Chhnam \nThmey. Also, in accordance with tradition, scores of Cambodian \nAmericans will gather with family and friends to visit the wat, the \nlocal spiritual center, to offer food to their clergymen, pray for \nancestors, give charity to the less fortunate, forgive the misdeeds of \nothers, and thank elders for their knowledge and care.\n  The Khmerian New Year ceremonies and activities demonstrate that each \nyear brings new opportunities for charity, peace, and happiness. As we \ncommemorate this important time, let us reflect on our Nation's \ncontinued efforts to promote universal human rights and democratic \nprinciples. Let us also take this opportunity to honor the Cambodian \nAmericans currently serving in the U.S. armed services, for their daily \nsacrifice in protecting our freedom.\n  Finally, I would like to wish all Cambodian Americans happiness, \nprosperity, and good health in this, the Year of the Dog.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3416-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3416-S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO REVEREND ROGER PATRICK JOSEPH DORCY\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nrecognizing the Reverend Roger Patrick Joseph Dorcy.\n  The Reverend Roger Patrick Joseph Dorcy was born to Michael and Ellen \nDorcy on July 4, 1946. Named for his Aunt Patricia, Patrick Joseph \nDorcy was the third youngest of 14 siblings.\n  Growing up in Omaha, NE, he attended Holy Cross School, Creighton \nPreparatory School, and Mount Michael Abbey.\n  From 1967 to 1969 he worked for Senator Robert F. Kennedy in New York \nand Washington, DC.\n  He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from St. Meinrad \nSchool of Theology in Indiana and completed post-graduate work at \nCatholic University of America in Washington, DC.\n  Prior to his ordination to the priesthood he was a member of the \nOrder of St. Benedict, St. Meinrad Archabbey. It was there he took the \nname Roger. Brother Roger was one of the order's youngest teachers, the \nArchabbey architect, a paramedic, and a firefighter.\n  When he left the Monastery, he moved to Colorado where he taught \ntheology and English at St. Scholastica Academy in Canon City, CO. \nFinally answering his call, at the age of 33, Roger Patrick Dorcy was \nordained a priest in the Diocese of Pueblo, Colorado, on January 29, \n1980.\n  He served as pastor at Sacred Heart Church and campus minister at \nAdams State College in Alamosa, CO. He was\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\nassociate pastor at St. Leander's and Our Lady of Guadalupe Churches in \nPueblo. For 12 years he was the pastor of Our Lady of the Meadows \nChurch in Pueblo; during that time he also served as the dean of the \nPueblo Deanery of the Diocese of Pueblo.\n  In 2003 he was appointed rector of the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, \nDiocese of Pueblo.\n  In addition to his parish life in Alamosa and Pueblo, he was a leader \nwith the Southwest Liturgical Conference, the National Association of \nClinical Pastoral Ministers, the Federation of Diocesan Liturgical \nCommissions, the National Catholic AIDS Network, and the Southern \nColorado AIDS Project.\n  In 1993 he completed his sabbatical in clinical pastoral ministry at \nImmanuel Medical Center in his hometown of Omaha. Later, he served as \nBishop Tafoya's community liaison for AIDS Ministry; as president of \nthe Sangre De Cristo Hospice Board; and was a board member of St. Mary \nCorwin Medical Center since 2000.\n  He died on July 23, 2005, at the age of 59. The Reverend Roger \nPatrick Dorcy was a monk, a priest, a teacher, an actor, an architect, \na healer, a leader; his vocation was dedicated to the healing of bodies \nand souls. On April 22, 2006, the communities of Pueblo and Colorado \ncelebrated his legacy by naming St. Mary Corwin Medical Center's newly \nconstructed, state-of-the-art cancer center, The Reverend Roger Patrick \nDorcy Cancer Center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3417-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING MANA DE SAN DIEGO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a wonderful \norganization in my home State of California, MANA de San Diego, as it \ncelebrates its 20th anniversary.\n  MANA de San Diego is one of 20 regional chapters throughout the \nUnited States operating under the auspices of the MANA National Latina \nOrganization. MANA, short for hermana, or sister in Spanish, was \nfounded in 1974 by Mexican-American women and was later expanded to \ninclude Latinas of all descent. Today, it serves as the single largest \norganization of Latinas in the United States. MANA provides an \nimportant voice for women at local, State, and national levels.\n  The San Diego Chapter of MANA, founded in 1986, has played an \nimportant role in the civic development of San Diego's large Latina \ncommunity. In 2000, Latinas made up 12.5 percent of San Diego's \npopulation of more than 2.8 million. MANA de San Diego encourages its \nmembers to actively participate on boards, commissions, and with civic \nand educational organizations in order to improve the quality of life \nfor all San Diegans. Each year, MANA de San Diego recognizes local \nwomen in the law, education, government, and education at a ``Brindis'' \nor toast event. The ``Brindis'' not only helps to raise money for the \nscholarship program but brings together successful women and students.\n  Through a variety of programs, such as the mentorship program \n``Hermanitas,'' MANA de San Diego empowers Latinas and encourages \neducational pursuits. The program exposes young women to arts and \nculture, higher education opportunities, careers, and leadership \nopportunities they might not otherwise experience. Hermanitas \nparticipants tour major universities in San Diego to help them \nvisualize where they can attend school. Since 1991, MANA de San Diego \nhas given more than $140,000 in scholarships to Latinas. This is \nparticularly important given that Latinas drop out of high school at a \nhigher rate than any other group in the United States. In addition, \nMANA de San Diego promotes increased awareness of Latina health issues \nthrough its Annual Women's Health Fair.\n  Recently, MANA de San Diego partnered with Girl Scouts San Diego- \nImperial Council to create the Cesar Chavez Community Service patch. \nThe purpose was to create a patch to honor and encourage Girl Scouts to \nlearn about Cesar Chavez. Girl Scouts throughout the Nation will be \nable to earn a new patch in recognition of outstanding community \nservice. The students in the Hermanitas program worked closely with \ntheir mentors and the council to design this patch. Together, they \ncreated the rules to award the patch.\n  Organizations such as MANA should be recognized for the critical role \nthey play in strengthening the Latina community in California and the \nUnited States. I salute the women of MANA de San Diego for their \npassionate commitment to the advancement of Latinas and tireless \nefforts to improve the broader San Diego Community. I wish the \norganization great success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3417-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HOGAN'S HARDWARE\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Hogan's Hardware has enjoyed a long and rich \nhistory in my home State.\n  In April of 1946, Marvis and Florence Hogan opened Hogan's Hardware \nfor business in Kadoka. Now some 60 years later Florence, her son \nBaxter, daughter Randi, and her son-in-law Don are keeping the business \ngoing strong.

The citizens of Parker have seen rapid economic \ngrowth in their community, with over 10 businesses opening their doors \nin 2005.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nvolunteers of St. Francis Medical Center and St. Francis North Hospital \nin Monroe, LA. Beginning April 23 and ending April 29, this great \norganization will observe National Volunteer Week. Today, I would like \nto spend a few moments highlighting the importance of their efforts.\n  Sponsored by the Points of Light Foundation and Volunteer Center \nNational Network, National Volunteer Week began in 1974. President \nRichard Nixon signed an executive Order establishing an annual \ncelebration of volunteering. Every President since then has signed a \nproclamation promoting and recognizing National Volunteer Week during \nthe third week of April. The theme for this year, ``Inspire by \nExample,'' reflects the opportunity volunteers have to bring joy and \nhope to the people they serve, as well as to inspire others to serve.\n  National Volunteer Week allows volunteer centers, nonprofits, \nhospitals, faith-based organizations, and schools to recognize their \nown volunteers and support thousands of service projects in the \ncommunity. This week, America has the pleasure of celebrating more than \n64 million volunteers who use their time and talent daily to make a \nreal difference in the lives of the children, adults, and elderly whom \nthey serve.\n  I applaud the volunteers of St. Francis Medical Center and St. \nFrancis North Hospital in Monroe for their continued service to the \ncitizens of their community. Their hard work and dedication is \nsomething we all appreciate and celebrate as we recognize National \nVolunteer Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3417-5", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3417-S3418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BICENTENNIAL OF ST. CHARLES PARISH\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nbicentennial of St. Charles Parish. As one of the\n\n[[Page S3418]]\n\noriginal 19 parishes created from the Territory of Orleans, St. Charles \nwill celebrate its 200th anniversary in 2007.\n  St. Charles Parish was created in 1807 from the ``Cote des \nAllemands,'' or county of the German Coast, which begins 25 miles above \nthe city of New Orleans and extends along both sides of the Mississippi \nRiver for 40 miles toward Baton Rouge. It contained a rich mixture of \nGermans, French Creoles, French Acadians, and Free Blacks and thrived \nas an agricultural center whose produce fed the city of New Orleans.\n  In 1720, 21 German families from the Rhine region of Germany settled \non the west bank of the Mississippi River. These families had suffered \nhorribly during the Thirty Years' War and fled by the thousands to the \nNew World. These original German settlers were given small plots of \nland by Mr. Law's Company of the Indies.\n  By 1721, 330 German immigrants, also with the Company of the Indies, \narrived in Louisiana. A year later, Germans from John Law's Arkansas \nConcession arrived in New Orleans demanding passage to Europe. Due to a \nlack of ships and supplies, Louisiana Governor Bienville persuaded them \nto remain, and they eventually joined the other German settlers along \nthe banks of the river. In 1765 and 1766, the first Acadians arrived in \nthe area, and they too were given land along the river, and joined the \nGermans in raising the fruits and produce that was used to feed the \ncity of New Orleans. This produce business along with tobacco, indigo, \nand lumber made the area a major component in the growth and \ndevelopment of Louisiana.\n  Later the parish turned from an agricultural to an industrial \neconomic base where new opportunities opened in large-scale oil \nproduction. The economic base of St. Charles Parish now centers around \nenergy and petrochemical industries, and recent years have seen the \nparish's economy diversify into the areas of technology and \ntransportation. The region has also been rated in the top 10 percent of \nbest places to live in the United States by the Places Rated Almanac.\n  Today, I would like to applaud the good people of St. Charles Parish \non their bicentennial and wish them continued prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3418-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3418-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3418-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 11, 2006, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4979.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit \nmanipulation of caller identification information; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, American consumers and public \nsafety officials find themselves confronted by yet another fraudulent \nscam\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\nin the digital age. This time the scam is known as caller I.D. \n``spoofing.'' Today I am introducing a bipartisan bill with Senator \nSnowe, the Truth in Caller I.D. Act of 2006, to put an end to \nfraudulent caller I.D. spoofing.\n  It seems like every week we hear of new threats to our privacy and \nnew ways to use the Internet to endanger consumers' financial security \nand physical safety. For several years now, I have been fighting back, \npushing legislation to combat frauds such as identity theft and the \nunauthorized sale of consumer telephone records. Now it is time to \nfight caller I.D. spoofing.\n  What is caller I.D. spoofing? It is a technique that allows a \ntelephone caller to alter the phone number that appears on the \nrecipient's caller I.D. system. In other words, spoofing allows someone \nto hide behind a misleading phone number to try to scam consumers or \ntrick law enforcement officials. As the Miami Herald wrote on March 12, \n2006, caller I.D. spoofing gives ``debt collectors, telemarketers, and \neven scam artists the upper hand in the wearisome game of phone call \n`gotcha'.''\n  Beyond that scenario, let me give you a few shocking examples of how \ncaller ID spoofing has been exploited in recent months: In one \ndangerous hoax, a sharp-shooting SWAT team was forced to shut down a \nneighborhood in New Brunswick, NJ, after receiving what they believed \nwas a legitimate distress call. But what really had happened was that \nthe caller used spoofing to trick law enforcement into thinking the \nemergency call was coming from a certain apartment in that \nneighborhood. It was all a cruel trick perpetrated with a deceptive \nphone number.\n  In another example, a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives was \nthe victim of a sophisticated spoofing plot. It appears that fraudsters \nplaced thousands of spoofed calls to the Member's constituents. In each \ncase, the fraudster made it look like the phone call was dialed from \nthe Member's office, and in each case the fraudster bad-mouthed the \nMember to the constituent on the other end of the line. The Member \nfound out about this after his congressional office got angry phone \ncalls from constituents.\n  In yet another instance, identity thieves bought stolen credit card \nnumbers. They then called Western Union, set up caller I.D. to make it \nlook like the call originated from the card holder's name, and used the \ncredit card number to order cash transfers, which the identity thieves \nthen picked up.\n  While these examples are serious enough, think about what would \nhappen if a stalker used caller I.D. spoofing to trick his victim into \nanswering the telephone or giving out sensitive personal information. \nThis could put peoples' lives in danger.\n  According to experts, there are countless Internet Web sites--going \nby names like Tricktel.com or Spooftech.com--that sell their services \nto criminals and identity thieves, or even bill collectors and private \ninvestigators. Any person can go to one of these Web sites, pay money \nto order a fake phone number, tell the Web site which phone number to \nreach, and then place the call through a toll-free line. The recipient \nis then tricked when he or she sees the misleading phone number on his \nor her caller I.D. system.\n  In essence, these Web sites provide the high-tech tools that identity \nthieves need to do their dirty work. Armed with a misleading phone \nnumber, an identity thief can call a consumer pretending to be \nrepresentative of the consumer's credit card company or bank. The thief \ncan ask the consumer to authenticate a request for personal account \ninformation. Once an identity thief gets hold of this sensitive \npersonal information, he can access a consumer's bank account, credit \ncard account, health information, and who knows what else.\n  Even if a consumer doesn't become a victim of stalking or identity \ntheft, there is a simple concept at work here. Consumers pay money for \ntheir caller I.D. service. Consumers expect caller I.D. to be accurate \nbecause it helps them decide whether to answer a phone call and whether \nto trust the person on the other end of the line.\n  If the caller I.D. says that my wife is calling me, when I pick up my \nphone, I expect my wife to be on the other end of the line. Instead, we \nhave fraudsters and others who want to abuse the system and disguise \ntheir true identities. That defeats the whole purpose of caller I.D.\n  Unfortunately the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade \nCommission have been slow to act. Those agencies have not yet brought \nany enforcement actions against caller I.D. spoofers.\n  In the meantime, many spoofing companies and the fraudsters that use \nthem believe that their activities are legal. Well, it is time to make \nit crystal clear that caller I.D. spoofing is not legal.\n  How does the bipartisan Truth in Caller I.D. Act of 2006 address the \nproblem of caller I.D. spoofing?\n  Quite simply, this bill plugs the hole in the current law and \nprohibits anyone from using caller identification services to transmit \nmisleading or inaccurate caller I.D. information. This prohibition \ncovers traditional telephone calls or calls made using Voice-Over-\nInternet, VOIP, service.\n  Senator Snowe and I don't intend to ban all caller I.D. spoofing. \nInstead, our bill recognizes that there are legitimate law enforcement \nuses for spoofing. And the bill requires the Federal Communications \nCommission to create appropriate exceptions for legitimate business \npurposes, after hearing public comment on the issue.\n  Anyone who violates this antispoofing law would be subject to a \npenalty of $10,000 per violation or up to 1 year in jail, as set out in \nthe Communications Act. Additionally, the bill empowers States to help \nthe Federal Government track down and punish these fraudsters. The more \nlaw enforcers out there to enforce this law, the better.\n  I note that Chairman Barton of the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee just introduced a similar bipartisan antispoofing bill, which \nhe expects to pass the House in short order. I invite my colleagues to \njoin Senator Snowe and myself in supporting the Truth in Caller I.D. \nAct of 2006.

A bill to grant rights-of-way to owners of dams located in \nthe Bitterroot National Forest in the State of Montana, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bitterroot \nNational Forest Dam and Reservoir Maintenance Act. The are 17 \nreservoirs in the Bitterroot National Forest and Selway-Bitterroot \nWilderness Area. These reservoirs not only predate the 1964 Wilderness \nAct and creation of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, many predate \nthe designation of the Bitterroot National Forest. The reservoirs \ncontinued use is fundamental to a stable agricultural economy for the \nBitterroot Valley in western Montana. In addition, these reservoirs \nprovide multiple benefits to the people, economy, and natural \nenvironment of Montana in the form of ground water recharge, flood \ncontrol, and increased late summer streamflows that support riparian \nand fishery habitat needs. In addition, the reservoirs ensure we \nmaintain our open spaces by allowing sustainable family ranches and \nfarms to continue instead of subdivisions.\n  When the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area was adopted as the first \ncongressionally designate wilderness area, access roads or trails were \nnot specifically identified for access to these dams. Clearly the 1964 \nWilderness Act does provide for some level of access to these existing \nreservoirs for inspection and maintenance. Subsequent wilderness \nlegislation establishing wilderness areas after 1964 have excluded \n``cherry-stem'' roads and trails to dams just like these in the \nBitterroot thus avoiding the problem we have in Montana.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture, through the USDA-Forest Service, must \nprovide access to these dams. Currently, the exact level of access is \nundefined and debated with each request. For each dam access request \nthe Forest Service must comply with the National Environmental Policy \nAct, the Endangered Species Act, the Federal Dam Safety Act, and the \nWilderness Act. To do so the agency must prepare an environmental \nassessment or environmental impact statement for the proposed access. \nThis often requires months to complete and is subject to appeal and \nlitigation by those opposed to motorized access to the dams, and in \nsome cases those opposed to the use of the existing water rights.\n  This legislation will clarify that the administration of the \nreservoirs and rights of ways should reside with the State of Montana \nlike all other water rights. The legislation also establishes right of \nways for the reservoirs and access routes to the reservoirs that would \npre-empt the Wilderness Act, and National Environmental Policy Act. \nThis bill will allow for an efficient means for irrigation companies to \naccess the reservoirs to complete inspections, and conduct safety and \noperation maintenance work in a timely manner.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to secure passage \nof this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 2634. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to strike the \nterm of the positions Under Secretary for Health and the Under \nSecretary for Benefits and simplify appointments to such positions; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I wish to introduce a simple, but I \nthink an important piece of legislation which, if enacted, will affect \njust two positions at the Department of Veterans Affairs: the Under \nSecretary for Health and the Under Secretary for Benefits. My bill \nwould abolish the 4-\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\nyear term limit on service in each position and remove the requirement \nthat a search commission be assembled to identify candidates for either \nof the positions if a vacancy in the position occurs.\n  As some of my colleagues may know, VA has thirteen positions in its \ncentral office for which Presidential nomination and Senate \nconfirmation are required. There are seven Assistant Secretaries, a \nGeneral Counsel, three Under Secretaries, a Deputy Secretary, and, of \ncourse, a full Cabinet level Secretary. Only the Under Secretaries for \nHealth and Benefits are given statutory terms of office. All of the \nother positions, two of which are superior offices and one of which is \na fellow Under Secretary, serve at the pleasure of the President.\n  In addition, under current law, if a vacancy occurs in either one of \nthe two offices I have just mentioned, the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs must establish a commission made up of various interested \nindividuals to recommend not less than three persons to the President \nfor the job. If the President does not care for the list of persons \nprovided by the commission, the President may request that the \ncommission recommend additional individuals from which he can choose a \nnominee.\n  I believe the two changes I am proposing are warranted and deserve my \ncolleagues' support for a number of reasons. First, and most important \nto me, is that the Constitution gives the President of the United \nStates the power to nominate and with advice and consent of the Senate, \nappoint Officers of the United States. There is no requirement that any \nof the candidates be identified, vetted, or recommended by an extra-\nconstitutional commission. In fact, recommendation and vetting is the \npower granted to the United States Senate through our advice and \nconsent role.\n  I find it interesting that the President today can choose a nominee \nfor Chief Justice of the United States, Attorney General, Secretary of \nState, Ambassador to the Court of St. James and other incredibly \nimportant high offices of this government without a statutorily \nrequired search commission. Yet these two Under Secretaries at VA must \ngo through this vetting process before even being identified to the \nPresident for his consideration of a nomination.\n  I believe that it is our responsibility as elected representatives of \nthe people to determine who is suitable for an appointment to a high \noffice of public trust. The people, rightfully, hold us accountable for \nthe performance of appointed officials. They do not hold commissions \naccountable. Certainly, the President and Senators are free to seek out \nthe views of any number of interested parties before deciding whom to \nnominate or whether to vote to confirm that person. But those outside \nconsultations should be encouraged and welcomed, not obliged by law.\n  The second reason I believe my colleagues should support this bill is \nthat the language of the statute with respect to the commission and the \nterm limits is at best unclear and at worst confusing.\n  The law requires the Secretary to establish a commission to identify \npotential nominees when ``a vacancy in the position occurs or is \nanticipated''. The law also allows the President to reappoint the \ncurrent office occupant for like periods. This raises the vexing \nquestion of whether there is an anticipated vacancy, requiring the \nappointment of the search commission to identify potential nominees, \njust because a term is expiring. If the answer is yes, then I ask if \nthat answer is different if the President intends to nominate the \ncurrent office occupant for an additional term?\n  Clearly, it seems absurd to me to require a search commission to \nidentify a suitable candidate for nomination if the President has \nalready identified the current office occupant as his chosen nominee. \nStill, more confusing is what occurs if the President nominates the \ncurrent office holder prior to the expiration of his or her term but \nthen the term expires before the Senate has had the opportunity to act \non the nomination. This scenario is actually not an absurd legal ``what \nif'' but an actual current problem.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the President nominated Daniel Cooper to serve \na 4-year term as Under Secretary for Benefits. Mr. Cooper was already \nthe Under Secretary at the time of his nomination. Thus, there was no \nvacancy in the office and none was anticipated since he was being \noffered as his own replacement. So, no search commission is required \nunder law.\n  Yet, now Mr. Cooper's term has expired and the Senate has yet to act \non his nomination. So, technically, there is now a vacancy requiring a \nsearch commission to identify a nominee. But, as I have just explained, \nthe President has already nominated someone. So, with the concurrence \nof my ranking member, Senator Akaka, I advised the White House that \nthere was no need for a search commission. But, the fact that the \nconversation had to occur shows the need for a change in this law. Of \ncourse, my preferred course would be to just eliminate the law as I am \nnow proposing.\n  Mr. Cooper's nomination has actually brought to light another reason \nthat I believe we should eliminate the term limits on the positions. \nThat is that the term adds a huge political element to the process of \nattempting to keep on a successful officeholder as in the case of Mr. \nCooper. While not revealing any confidences or singling out individual \nSenators, I do not think my colleagues would be surprised to hear that \nsince being nominated for an additional term Mr. Cooper has been \nsubject to some political bargaining by Senators who seek to have him \ntake some actions in his official capacity before they will vote to \nkeep him on in his job. I understand that happens often around here. \nAnd I don't begrudge it in general. But, I think the opportunities for \nsuch actions should be minimized to the extent possible, especially \nwhen there is no question as to the nominee's qualifications or \nsuccessful performance in office. If he or she is doing well, then, \nunder my bill, the President would presumably retain his or her \nservices. If not, then he or she should be removed, immediately. Not at \nthe end of a term.\n  That brings me to my final reason for this legislation. I simply \nbelieve that senior governmental officials should serve in those \npositions only so long as they hold the confidence of the President of \nthe United States. If the President loses confidence in any of his \nsenior leadership, he or she should remove those individuals from those \nposts.\n  I understand that there are those who believe that this action would \nmake the positions inherently political. I offer two thoughts to those \nwho hold this belief. First, in 1988, when VA was elevated to cabinet \nlevel status through Public Law 100-527, the law required that the \nPresident appoint individuals to these two offices ``without regard to \npolitical affiliation or activity and solely on the basis of integrity \nand demonstrated ability.'' I am not proposing to change any of those \nrequirements. Even if I was proposing such a change, certainly the \nSenate could impose such a condition prior to any confirmation.\n  Second, I firmly believe that some political responsibility also \nleads to greater performance by officeholders and accountability to \nCongressional oversight. I think you all know that improved performance \nand bureaucratic accountability at VA are annual demands of our \nVeterans service organizations. I believe this change will move us one \nstep closer to addressing their concerns.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the outset of my statement, this is a \nsimple bill. But, just like the old saying that if you watch the \npennies the dollars will take care of themselves, I believe that if we \nmake the simple, but necessary improvements to VA's operations and \nmanagement structure, the entire system will improve on its own. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill as one step towards overall \nimprovement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Cantwell, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 2635. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe transportation fringe benefit to bicycle commuters; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nSnowe, Collins and Cantwell in introducing the ``Bicycle Commuters \nBenefit Act of 2006''.\n  I know that I am speaking for many people in this country who want to \ndo something concrete about our Nation's\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\ndependence on oil and gas. They do not think our national energy policy \nis doing enough. They are eager to do things that make them feel like \nthey can take responsibility for overcoming their dependence on oil and \ngas. As gas prices continue to climb this spring and summer, more and \nmore people are going to be looking for something that they can do to \nfree themselves from this dependency. The bill I am introducing today \ngives Americans more incentive to give up the cars and trucks that they \ndrive to and from work everyday and get on their bicycles instead.\n  According to recent Census reports, more than 500,000 people \nthroughout the United States commute to work by bicycle. They are \nfreeing themselves from sitting in traffic. They are saving energy and \novercoming their dependence on oil and gas. They are getting exercise; \navoiding obesity and helping us keep our air clean and safe to breathe.\n  Yet they are commuting by bicycle at their own expense. Their fellow \nemployees who take mass transit to and from work have an incentive \ncreated in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century that \nenables their employers to pay for their bus or subway ride. This \nincentive is great for mass transit commuters but it discourages people \nfrom riding their bikes to and from their jobs. The Bicycle Commuters \nBenefits Act of 2006 will eliminate this discrimination against bicycle \ncommuters.\n  The bill extends the fringe benefit that employers can offer their \nemployees for commuting by public transit, to those who ride their \nbicycles to and from their jobs. Our bill amends the tax code so that \npublic and private employers can offer their employees a monthly \nbenefit payment that will help them cover the costs of riding their \nbikes, instead of driving and parking their cars where they work. The \nbill also provides employers the flexibility to set their own level of \nbenefit payment up to a specified cap amount. That way, employers and \ntheir employees can decide how much of an incentive they need to stop \ndriving and start riding their bikes. Those who currently ride the bus \nand/or subway to work would also gain an extra incentive to ride their \nbikes. Employers can deduct the cost of their benefit payments from \ntheir taxable income. This reduces the taxes that they pay to the \nFederal Government. And, in turn, employees will receive anywhere from \n$40-$100 per month as a non-taxable benefit, to help them pay for the \ncosts of riding their bikes.\n  I think that this is a fair and modest proposal that will reward \nemployees who ride their bikes to and from their jobs.\n  Our Senate bill matches HR 807 that was introduced during the first \nsession of the 109th Congress by my fellow Oregonian, Congressman Earl \nBlumenauer. He has 47 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle and \nevery part of the United States eager to offer bicycle commuters the \nsame incentive that I want to give commuters who take mass transit.\n  In addition, our bill is supported by many regional and national \nbicycling organizations such as Cycle Oregon, the Bicycle \nTransportation Alliance, the League of American Bicyclists, the \nWashington Area Bicyclist Association and hundreds of Capitol Hill \nemployees who commute by bike to work every day.\n  When you think about it and you look around our cities, the taxpayers \nhave paid for millions of dollars of bike trails in all of America's \nurban areas and major job markets. Now, bicycle commuters will have an \nextra incentive to use them to commute to and from their jobs.\n  One week from today, we will start celebrating May as ``National \nBike-to- Work'' month. I can't think of any better way to commemorate \nthis special month than by introducing this legislation. I look forward \nto working with our colleagues to see this legislation pass.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2635\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

BECKER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about \nthe extraordinary career of Federal Judge Edward R. Becker who was \nappointed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania in 1970, was elevated to the Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit in 1982, was Chief Judge of the Circuit Court from \nFebruary 1998 until May 2003, and continues to serve as a Senior Judge.\n  In addition to his 35-plus years on the Federal bench, he also has \nthe distinction of being the 101st United States Senator. Some, who \nhave laid claim to the position of 101st Senator, have enhanced their \nstatus. To identify Judge Becker as the 101st Senator is to enhance the \nstatus of the United States Senate.\n  Judge Becker became a member of the Senate's family by his \nnegotiating, cajoling, and writing most of Senate Bill 852 dealing with \nasbestos reform. At my request, he convened the so-called \nstakeholders--that is, the manufacturers, labor--AFL-CIO, insurers and \ntrial lawyers--in his Philadelphia chambers for 2 days in August 2003 \nto preside over discussions leading to the structuring of the asbestos \nreform bill.\n  Thereafter, on about 50 occasions, frequently with my being present, \nhe continued to preside over negotiations with stakeholders in meetings \nattended by 20 to 50 interested parties. Beyond that, he met with \nnumerous individual Senators, representatives of the stakeholders on \ndozens of occasions, and continuously counseled Judiciary Committee \nstaff for almost 3 years. When the legislation was in committee and on \nthe Senate floor, Judge Becker was at my side continuously counseling \non the next steps to be taken to promote the bill's passage.\n  He undertook this arduous extra assignment in addition to his \njudicial duties notwithstanding the fact that he was undergoing \ntreatment for prostate cancer.\n  When told of Judge Becker's contribution to this important \nlegislation, President George Bush inscribed a tribute to Judge Becker \non the face of Senate Bill 852 designating it as the ``Becker Bill''.\n  I first met Ed Becker in the fall of 1950 when we rode the Frankford \nelevated train, public transportation, together for about an hour each \nmorning from Northeast Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania. \nHe graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Penn in 1954 and, again with academic \ndistinction, from the Yale Law School in 1957, which we again attended \ntogether. We were colleagues in a celebrated debate against the Norfolk \nMassachusetts State Prison team in 1952 before approximately 800 \ninmates, truly a captive audience. The prison team took the affirmative \non the subject: Resolved that the Communist Party should be outlawed. \nEditors from the then-five Boston newspapers voted 4 to 1 that the \nprisoners won the debate.\n  Following graduation from law school, he had a distinguished law \npractice in the partnership of Becker, Becker and Fryman, his father \nand brother-in-law. He was active in politics, becoming a Republican \ncommitteeman, as his father was before him. He worked the rowhouses in \nNortheast Philadelphia going door to door seeking new registrations and \nsupport for his Party. He undertook kamikaze candidacies for State \nSenate and City Council on the Republican ticket in Philadelphia, a \ncity totally dominated by Democrats. He represented the Republican \nParty as counsel in complex court proceedings.\n  He was a lawyer's lawyer, just as he later became a judge's judge. I \nturned to him for counseling and representation when the Supreme Court \nof Pennsylvania on three occasions in 1967 ruled on my status a to be a \ncandidate for mayor while continuing to serve as district attorney. The \nPhiladelphia Home Rule Charter prohibited any city officer from being a \ncandidate for any other office. With his assistance, we won all three \ncases. If I had followed his political advice as well as his legal \nadvice, I probably would have been elected mayor; but who knows what \nwould have happened after that.\n  When appointed to the Federal Bench in 1970 at the age of 37, he \nmerited the position both in terms of exceptional competency and \nextraordinary contribution to his party. No one in my experience has \nmerited the appointment to the Federal bench more than Judge Becker on \nboth counts.\n  Judge Becker and I have been good friends, really best friends, in \nthe intervening years. Our wives were school-girl classmates. Joan \nLevy, now Specter, sat next to Flora Liman, now Becker in alphabetical \norder in Olney High School.\n  As Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, he \nbrought many innovations. In 2002, he was the recipient of the coveted \nEdward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award with his \nselection as the most distinguished Article III Judge out of 862 then \nsitting ``whose career has been exemplary, measured by their \nsignificant contributions to the administration of justice, the \nadvancement of the rule of law, and the improvement of society as a \nwhole.''\n  He brought to the bench a prodigious work ethic. He is never without \na stack of briefs which he reads whenever he has a moment to spare. At \nPhiladelphia Eagles' football games, he would read those briefs during \nhalftime preferring them to the dancing cheerleaders. He would even \nsneak a peak--I mean a peak at the briefs--during the incessant \ntimeouts for the endless commercials.\n\n  Among his landmark decisions are three opinions adopted by the \nSupreme Court on cutting-edge issues. He pioneered new law on the \nreliability of scientific evidence which formed the basis for Justice \nBlackmun's decision in 1993 in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals. \nSimilarly, he originated the rationale on class action certification \nadopted by Judge Ginsburg in 1995 in Georgine v. Amchem Products. When \nhe disagreed with seven other Circuit Courts of Appeals, the Supreme \nCourt followed his judgment on ERISA Standards of Review in Firestone \nTire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch. He was consistently recognized by the \nUniversity of Chicago Law Review as being among the three Circuit \nJudges most often cited by the Supreme Court.\n  His 2,000 judicial opinions, filling many volumes on law library \nshelves, are legendary--long, thorough, analytical with many footnotes. \nHis masterful handling of Japanese electronics case produced four \nopinions exceeding 2,000 pages having ruled three times on complex \nevidentiary issues before granting summary judgment in a highly unusual \ncase. His versatility was demonstrated when he once wrote an\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\nopinion in rhyme. When he is not up to going to the courthouse these \ndays, he participates by telephone on the oral arguments and the \nconferences where the three judge panel discuss the cases.\n  Among his many accomplishments is his talent to play by ear any song \nknown in the American repertoire. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates has chosen him as the Court's pianist for their periodic sing-\nalongs. Rivaling his attributes as a jurist, Justice David Souter wrote \nin May 2001 in a University of Pennsylvania Law Review ``Tribute to the \nHonorable Edward R. Becker'': ``I've never heard anyone call for a tune \nthe Judge didn't know; never have I seen him read a sheet of music.'' \nEdward R. Becker is truly the personification of the Renaissance man.\n  Recently, he undertook a new challenge by testifying and organizing a \npanel of judges to appear before the Judiciary Committee in support of \nthe nomination of Third Circuit Judge Samuel Alito for the Supreme \nCourt. He did so out of conviction that Judge Alito was being unfairly \ncriticized. Based on working with him for over 15 years, he advised the \nJudiciary Committee that after oral arguments, when the three panel \njudges would retire to deliberate, Judge Alito had an open mind, no \nagenda and was a superb jurist. That panel of current and former Third \nCircuit judges, led by Judge Becker, provided important testimony for \nthe Judiciary Committee, leading to Judge Alito's confirmation.\n  For a man with such achievements, Judge Becker remains the model of \nmodesty and humility. He continues to live in an unpretentious house in \na working-class neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia where he moved \nwith his parents when he was 3. Even as the Chief Judge of the Circuit, \nhe continued to ride public transportation to the Federal Courthouse, \nsurprising fellow riders to see a man of his prominence sitting among \nthem. He is the quintessential family man, with an accomplished wife, \nthree professional children and four adorable grandchildren.\n  When his friends enjoy a variety of cocktails, his favorite drink \ncontinues to be ``Schuylkill punch,'' which translates into \nPhiladelphia tap water.\n  When I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's last year, I followed his advice \non how to cope. He was an inspiration and model to me.\n  Watching close friends suffer and die from cancer, and from my own \nexperience with Hodgkin's, all of that has reinforced my determination \nto work to secure sufficient funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth to conquer cancer and other maladies.\n  In 1970, President Nixon declared war against cancer. If the United \nStates had approached that war with the same intensity we do other \nwars, the cure for cancer would have been found long ago.\n  Two years ago I saw my chief of staff, Carey Lackman, a beautiful \nyoung woman of 48, die from breast cancer. A few months later, I saw \nthe same fate for Paula Kline, the wife of my son's law partner.\n  Visiting Judge Becker at his home last Saturday, I saw a large stack \nof briefs on his desk and observed him carrying on his judicial duties \nfrom his living room with determination and gusto, notwithstanding his \nprostate cancer. From my own experience with Hodgkin's, I know cancer \ncan be beaten. From watching Judge Becker, I have seen him beat cancer \nfor more than 3 years.\n  My statement today has the dual purpose, No. 1, of recognizing and \nacknowledging the public service and contributions of a truly great \nAmerican, and, No. 2, urging my Senate colleagues who have come to \nknow, admire, and respect Judge Becker to support adequate funding to \nwin the war against cancer.\n  I thank the Chair. In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I express my regret that I don't have \neyes in the back of my head.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I always thought you did.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, \nis standing right behind me. I should have felt the radiation of his \npowerful personality. I yield to my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania. Before he leaves the Chamber, I want to applaud the work \nSenator Specter has done in getting these judges confirmed. It has been \nheavy lifting. We all know that. We also know probably from looking \nback, when we look back 10 years or 20 years from now on \naccomplishments, that perhaps getting these judges confirmed will be \nthe major accomplishment of this legislative session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3429-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3429-S3431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IRAQ UPDATE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am always distressed with the media and \nthe way they are misrepresenting what is going on in Iraq, and \nparticularly the accomplishments this last weekend. It is hard to \nbelieve.\n  On Saturday, the Iraqi Parliament, which was elected last December, \nconvened to fill the top Government leadership positions. Exemplifying \nthe democratic traditions beginning to take root in Iraq, the Iraqi \nParliament successfully negotiated these nominees, clearing the way for \nthe first permanent, popularly elected Government in Iraq's history.\n  The first permanent, popularly elected Government in Iraq's history--\nthat is mind boggling.\n  In addition, I want to commend our soldiers in the theater. Without \ntheir brave efforts, this progress would have been impossible.\n  I just returned from my 11th trip to the Iraqi AOR. I come back, and \nI remember the stories that are told by our different troops there. \nSome of the things they come up with are amazing--the anecdotal things, \nstories that are comparable to the stories we heard back during World \nWar II.\n  American soldiers continue to clear out terrorist strongholds, \nallowing democracy a chance to flourish. The accomplishments of \nAmerican soldiers have permitted Iraqis the opportunity to vote and \nelect a parliament that has now produced leaders of this nation's \nnational unity government. It has been a long road getting to this \npoint, and we have further to go. There are some major hurdles these \nnew leaders must keep in mind. These are Iraqi leaders. These are the \nelected leaders. For the first time in Iraq's history, they must build \nconsensus for reigning in the militias, protecting critical \ninfrastructure such as oil pipelines, preserving human rights for all \nIraqi citizens, implementing necessary reforms to revive the civil \neconomy, and, perhaps most importantly, the new leaders must inspire \nconfidence in the permanent Government.\n  While what these seven nominees put forward on Saturday represents a \nhuge political breakthrough, challenges lie ahead for both Iraq's new \nleadership and our troops stationed there. Our best men and women \ncontinue to serve valiantly in some of the most trying conditions. Some \nhave been gravely wounded, and some have paid the ultimate price. The \nquestion you hear quite often is, they say, Is it worth it? It is \nimpossible for me to answer that question on an individual basis, when \nyou think about the depth of suffering of a wife or a child or a \nfather, the loss of a loved one. I mourn that we have lost even one \nlife, but I do not regret the cause in which that life is lost.\n  I will say that as America's elected leaders, we have been chosen to \nuse our best judgment in these most difficult choices. Throughout \nhistory people have chosen to take an uncompromising stand in what they \nbelieve in. They have done this because they understand some things are \nso valuable that we must risk everything to preserve them.\n  Can the cost of preserving freedom ever be too great? That is a \nquestion I wrestle with day and night. As I do, I am sure other members \nof our Government and military leaders do the same.\n  I know freedom cannot be imposed, but I also know the thirst for it \ncannot be quenched. If September 11 showed us anything, it was that we \naffect and are affected by the rest of the world. Standing by and \nhoping for the best is not an option. When it comes to fighting \nterrorism around the world, we are involved, whether we like it or not, \nand the quicker we wake up to this reality, the better chance we have \nat setting\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\nthings on the right course. The American public must be as resolute in \nthis mission as our troops on the ground.\n\n  President Bush has stood stalwartly behind our troops and the Iraqi \npeople and measurable progress has been achieved. It would be \nappropriate to list a few of these. You don't get this from the media, \nso you are going to have to get it from the floor, from those who have \nbeen over there personally and witnessed things happening.\n  Iraq's first Ambassador to the United States in 15 years presented \nhis credentials to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at a State \nDepartment ceremony on April 11.\n  The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq calculated that nearly \n11.9 million Iraqis--approximately 75 percent--voted in the December \n2005 elections. This represents an increase of about 4 million voters \nfrom the January 2005 election.\n  Since June 2004, when the Coalition transferred sovereignty, Iraqi \npeople elected an interim government in January 2005, drafted and \nratified a constitution in October 2005, and elected a 4-year, \nconstitutionally based Government in December 2005.\n  There have been strong, positive economic changes as well. Iraq's \neconomy is recovering after 30 years of dictatorship and lack of \ninfrastructure maintenance. In 2005, the Iraqi economy grew an \nestimated 3 percent in real terms. The International Monetary Fund \nanticipates the Iraqi economy will grow by more than 10 percent in \n2006. Certainly the Presiding Officer, one of the greatest economists \nof this body, understands the significance of the accomplishments in \nthe economy of Iraq.\n  Under Saddam Hussein's regime, Iraqis' standard of living \ndeteriorated rapidly. Iraq's per capita income dropped from $3,800 in \n1980--higher than Spain at that time--to $715 in 2002, which is lower \nthan Angola. Today economic recovery is picking up, with gross domestic \nproduct growing from $18.9 billion in 2002 to $33.1 billion in 2005.\n  Before liberation, Iraq's cities suffered from inadequate sewage \nsystems. The United States has helped Iraqis build or repair sewage \ntreatment plants for 5.1 million Iraqis. U.S.-funded projects have \nimproved access to clean water for 3.1 million people.\n  You almost have go to there and see these people, and see what they \nare doing now that they say they couldn't have done. It is very \ndifficult for an American to walk through the streets--whether it is \nTikrit, Fallujah, Baghdad, or anywhere else--without people running up \nto you and saying my daughter can now get married, our girls can now go \nto school, now we have water we can drink, now we have a sewage system \nthat we haven't had since the end of the regime of Saddam Hussein.\n  I think the greatest miracle of Iraq which the ``cut and run'' caucus \nrefuses to acknowledge has been the performance of the security forces. \nCoalition military commanders are focused on developing Iraqi police \nforces, and are helping Iraqis develop a disciplined force that \nprotects the rights of all Iraqis. One-hundred thirty Iraqi Minister of \nDefense combat battalions are now rising up from just a handful in \nAugust 2004. Of the 110 bases operated by Coalition forces, 34 have \nbeen closed and transferred to the Iraqis. That is something we have to \nunderstand. We were manning 100 percent of the bases of operation, and \na third are now being taken care of by the Iraqis.\n\n  Thirteen Iraqi brigade headquarters and fifty battalions have assumed \nbattle space. They are taking care of their own battle space. Iraqi \nforces control 65 percent of Baghdad.\n  I recall meeting General Madhi in Fallujah. At that time he had been \nworking as a brigade commander for Saddam Hussein. He hated Americans \nuntil Saddam came down and General Madhi became the brigade commander \nfor security forces in Fallujah. He started training with the Marines \nin Fallujah. They call it embedded training. They get in there with \nhim. They worked together and they became so close that when we rotated \nthe Marines out of Fallujah, they got together and they cried.\n  That same general, General Madhi, was transferred to Baghdad where he \ntook over the security, starting from the east to the western part of \nBaghdad, and now has control of 65 percent of the eastern part of \nBaghdad. We do not have Americans doing that. We have Iraqis doing \nthat. There are more than 250,000 trained and equipped Iraqi security \nforces, up from 115,000 16 months ago.\n  I stood here 3 months ago and talked about my experiences with the \ncommanders in the field. They have a good answer to the question that \nkeeps being asked each Member of the Senate: When will they be on their \nown and handle their own security? How long will it be? Not many \npoliticians want to give the answer to something like that. I don't \nmind doing it because I think it is a good idea of what the answer is.\n  I remember talking to the commanders in the field over the last \nseveral years and they have consistently said if we get to the point \nwhere we can have 11 divisions of Iraqis trained and equipped--that \ntranslates to 325,000--they will be ready to take over their own \nsecurity. That does not mean all Americans will leave. We still have \nAmerican troops and an American presence in Bosnia, Kosovo, Sinai, and \nother places, but they are not doing the security there.\n  At that time when we get to the point where they have 11 divisions, \nwhich should be by the end of this year, or at the very latest by \nmidyear of the following year, they will be able to handle their own \nsecurity.\n  Something heretofore considered to be virtually impossible is going \nto happen. One of the main problems with this war is how the media is \nfocused on weapons of mass destruction. We never should have been \ntalking about weapons of mass destruction. We know Saddam Hussein had \nweapons of mass destruction. We know that some 4,000 of their own \npeople were killed with weapons of mass destruction. We know in the 8-\nyear Iran-Iraq war, over 100,000 Iranians were killed with weapons of \nmass destruction. We know they had them. There is no question. That was \nnot the important thing.\n  The important thing in Iraq is that the most sophisticated training \nwas taking place, training people to be sophisticated terrorists in \ncities such as Samarra, Ramadi, and Salman Pak, where they had the \nmajor trading areas. They are not training anymore. One Iraqi defector, \nCAPT Sabah Khodada, observed foreign Arabs being trained in hijackings, \nkidnapping of airplanes, trains, public buses, planting explosives in \ncities, and suicide operations. It could very well be most likely that \nis where the training took place that caused their successful attack on \nAmerica's soil on September 11. Very likely it was. That is what they \nwere teaching at that time.\n  We went into Iraq and we confiscated 2 million ``exploitable'' \ndocuments that we are still analyzing. Some of the documents have \nalready proven the existence of the camps.\n  I want to lay out the facts. We know Saddam was giving money to the \nPalestinian families of suicide bombers. We know Saddam violated \nnumerous U.N. resolutions since the end of Operation Desert Storm. We \nknow the air defense forces would regularly shoot at our airplanes. We \nknow he tortured, abused, murdered, and massacred many thousands of his \nown people.\n  I ask a very important question. Where would we be now if we had not \ngone into Iraq? The answer will be left up to history to decide. \nProbably we will never know. We know we have not been attacked on our \nterritory since September 11. My own personal belief is the work we \nhave done, the successes in Iraq have been responsible for that great \nvictory.\n  I returned from my 11th trip to the Iraqi AOR. I met with the people \nover there, including General Madhi. However, the cut-and-run caucus \ncan only think of surrender. They are still out there. Recent casualty \nrates exposed the insurgents' true intentions.\n  A lot of people are concerned, as I am, about the Americans, but if \nyou see what has happened in the first 3 months of this year, in \nJanuary and February and March of this year, the insurgents, the \nterrorists have been able to successfully kill 112 U.S. forces. \nHowever, during that same period of time they have killed 2,720 Iraqi \ncivilians and security forces. What a huge change from the past.\n\n  We need to judge the insurgencies not by what they claim but who they \nactually are attacking. This is an\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n\nenemy that we cannot surrender to or give ground to. Their objective is \nfear. Their method is death. They will never be appeased. If we were to \nwithdraw early, we would abandon Iraq to violence, but we also would \ncause irreparable damage to this country.\n  It is not about Iraq, it is about defending America. We were attacked \non our soil. The cut-and-run caucus is always there. Surrender is \nalways their option. They are appeasers. An appeaser is someone who \nthrows his friend to the alligators hoping they eat him last. No man \nlives when freedom fails. The best men rot in filthy jails. Those who \nyell, ``appease, appease,'' are hanged by those they tried to please.\n  My wife and I have been married 46 years. We have 20 kids and \ngrandchildren, and I say this: We are winning the war on terror, and \nwinning it in their territory. I ask God to richly bless the \ndecisionmakers and the troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3431-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there have been several speeches today--I \nwas not here, but I got a briefing--about the high gasoline prices, and \nI want to clarify some of the comments raised by the minority leader \ntoday and his Members in the press.\n  The minority is so eager to blame others for high gas prices they \nseem to ignore the fact that they do not bother to consult the media \nwhen they have a deadline. I am more interested in reducing high \ngasoline prices for American families than to bluster the selfish \npolitical advantage, unlike the minority.\n  I took the time to consider the nonpartisan experts of the Energy \nInformation Administration and what they had to say. According to the \nEIA, there are three reasons leading to high gasoline prices. First, \nthe Nation has not fully recovered from hurricane damage. Twenty \npercent of the domestic oil production and three refineries, \nrepresenting nearly 5 percent of refining capacity, remain offline. \nHowever, offshore production is resuming and refineries are restarting. \nThe EIA points out that the industry delayed maintenance to maximize \nproduction following the hurricanes. Today they must switch over to \nsummer blends.\n  Yet the focus is on the politics. The senior Senator from New York \ncharged the refiners are purposely withholding capacity from \ntraditionally operating at 90 percent to the current operation of 85 \npercent. In demanding an investigation, that Senator also implied that \nthe refiners should not maintain their facilities to ensure a safe work \nenvironment for employees or they should not switch to special summer \nblends.\n  One thing was clear. The senior Senator from New York did not bother \nto consider the fact that nearly 5 percent of domestic refining \ncapacity is still offline due to hurricanes. Mr. President, 90 percent \nminus 5 percent equals 85 percent, as the investigation found.\n  Second, companies are increasing inventories to hedge against \npotential disruption in the future. Most of the time, the minority \nwould call such risk management responsible but not when they celebrate \nthe misfortune of the American people.\n  The third reason has to do with MTBE, and I won't get into that. I \nwill only say this. I am the chairman of a committee that is called the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. It is our responsibility to \nhandle most of the problems. We are in an energy crisis. There is no \nquestion about it. But for any Democrat to stand on the floor of this \nSenate and try to point the finger at Republicans for high gasoline \nprices is really absurd.\n  I have sat there and watched the votes take place. We are not able to \nvote on ANWR in northern Alaska. Right down party lines, Republicans \nare supporting it, the Alaskans are supporting it, the Democrats are \nopposing it. We are not able to go offshore and take advantage of the \ntremendous reserves that are there. It is right down party lines. Right \ndown party lines they stopped us from being able to have tax incentives \nto go after marginal production.\n  I am from a State that has marginal production. There is a statistic \nthat if we had all the marginal production flowing today that has been \nplugged in the last 10 years, it would be more than we are currently \nimporting from Saudi Arabia.\n  Lastly, in the area of nuclear energy, it goes right down party \nlines.\n  I had a refinery bill that would have coupled with some of the closed \nmilitary bases and said cities can use EDA grants to go in there and \nset up refineries and employ people and increase our refining capacity, \nand it was blocked right down party lines.\n  So the Democrats are clearly responsible for these problems we have \nin trying to increase the productivity, increase the production that is \npotentially out there today.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/24/senate-section/article/S3431-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
