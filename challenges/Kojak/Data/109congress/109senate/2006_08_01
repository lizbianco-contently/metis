Mr. President, this morning we will immediately return to \ndebate on S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security bill.\n  Yesterday, the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 72 to 23 invoked \ncloture on the bill. Under last night's order, we will proceed to vote \non passage of the bill at 5 o'clock today. Senators will be able to \ndeliver their comments on the bill throughout the day, and the time \nwill be equally divided until 5 p.m.\n  As I stated yesterday, we have other important issues to consider \nthis week before leaving. With respect to that, a lot of colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle have come up and asked about how I plan to \nproceed this week on the pensions bill and the so-called trifecta bill, \nboth of which came over from the House Friday night.\n  I talked to the distinguished minority leader about the best way to \nproceed over the next few days, given everyone's curiosity. I will have \nmore to say about that schedule later today. As we talk more about \nthese bills in our various caucuses, when it comes to these two items, \nI should take a couple of minutes to lay out a few things.\n  As I have said consistently since Saturday morning, my priorities are \nsimple. We are going to complete action on a very important retirement \nsecurity bill which protects the pensions of literally millions of \nAmericans before we leave.\n  Second, to test the Senate's views on the so-called trifecta bill, a \npackage which includes a final resolution of the death tax issue, as \nwell as extension of various tax policies critical to Americans who are \ntrying to create businesses, to start a business, to raise a family, to \nget that first job, and to invest and save for the future; this package \nalso addresses the minimum wage increase. It is what we are calling--\nthe press started calling and now we are referring to it as the \ntrifecta package.\n  I want to be crystal clear--and my colleagues know this because a lot \nof them are making plans for the recess--that this week will be the \ntime and the floor will be the place for the Senate to decide once and \nfor all whether to act on this trifecta bill or to kill it.\n  First things first. The pensions bill itself is an important bill \nwhich, as I mentioned, affects the lives of millions of Americans. It \nis a must-pass bill. It must pass this week. If we fail to act, \nbillions of dollars of new debt will be thrown onto the Federal \nTreasury, and\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\nthat would be irresponsible. I think everyone recognizes that.\n  I know there are those in the minority who argue that the best thing \nto do is stop the pensions bill and then to try to put the tax \nextenders on it. But that would put the retirement future of millions \nat risk, and that is unacceptable. Others in the minority are arguing \nthat they can return to conference on pensions to haggle further on \npensions and change this or that or to talk about the taxes. I didn't \nknow exactly what we would do if we went back to conference with that; \narguments such as where is the best place to have a clam bake. For the \nrecord, I would like to have my clam bakes in New Hampshire. Going back \nto the conference means waiting until at least September, and that type \nof ``kick the can down the road'' mentality won't work. It is what \nhappens too much around here--another hearing, another negotiation, \nanother delay. That is going to have to stop, and the Senate must clear \nthe pensions bill clean so the President can sign it this month. We \nwill act on pensions. We will get it done without amendment.\n  Senators are elected to debate, yes, but also to decide and to vote \nand to act. So we will also vote this week on whether to stop a \nfilibuster on what I referred to as the trifecta bill. I don't want \nanybody to be mistaken. If the Senate kills the trifecta bill, we will \nnot return to it this year. That means we would have no permanent death \ntax reform, no tax policy extenders, and no minimum wage increase. It \nis now or never. It is this week. Members need to understand that, \nespecially Members who think we can delay and put off and try to \ndivide. We will be addressing it this week. That is why it will be a \nvery important vote on Friday. There are not going to be second \nchances. There are not going to be last-minute side deals or new \nunanimous consent agreements or other motions to proceed--nothing. This \nis going to be it.\n\n  The House has acted on a bipartisan basis to pass this bill, and now \nwe have to decide as a body on whether to act as well. We will make \nthat decision this week. It will be decided in that vote on Friday.\n  In the Senate, we have a bipartisan majority that supports fixing the \ndeath tax--a permanent solution for the death tax, fixing it forever.\n  We have a bipartisan majority that supports the tax policy extenders. \nWe have a bipartisan majority that supports handling the minimum wage. \nNow let us see that bipartisan majority stand up, express themselves, \nand act this week. It is our time to choose.\n  Let's pass pensions without amendment, but stop the filibuster on the \ntrifecta bill. Nothing more and nothing less will honor the heritage of \nthe Senate which has been handed to us by those before us and those who \nwill one day hold our seats. More importantly, acting now will resolve \nretirement security for millions of Americans. It will help those take \nthat first step on the lowest rung of the economic ladder. It will keep \ntax policy focused on growing our economy and creating new jobs. And it \nwill finally bring fairness to that wrongful tax on death.\n  It is going to be a very important week with the vote we will have \nthis afternoon. It started with the vote yesterday. I believe it will \nbe a very productive week for all of us on the Senate floor addressing \nconcerns, both economic concerns as well as other concerns, that the \nAmerican people feel in their everyday lives.\n  Before closing, there is an issue that we finished with last week on \nthe floor of the Senate but which we have not fully addressed until we \nget this bill to conference, so that we can join the child custody bill \nwe passed last week, so that we have expressed the will of the floor of \nthe Senate, and so we can address in conference marrying our bill to \nthe House bill so this important bill will become the law of the land.\n  We attempted to go to conference last week. There was objection on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Request--H.R. 748\n\n  At this point, I once again ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to consideration of H.R. 748; provided that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 403, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill then be read a third \ntime and passed, and the Senate then insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees with the ratio of 7 to 5.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, on behalf \nof several Senators on this side of the aisle, I might say the bill \nthat was brought to the floor is a bill which is fatally flawed. It is \na bill which would have allowed a parent who was guilty of a crime \nagainst his child, a parent guilty of incest, would have been allowed \nto file a lawsuit against someone trying to help the victim of his \ncrimes. Fortunately, an amendment was considered and unanimously passed \nhere which addressed this fatal flaw in this bill. There are several on \nthis side of the aisle who are working to receive an assurance from the \nRepublican leader that this matter will not go forward in conference \nuntil this fatal flaw is removed in the bill. And until that agreement \nis reached, I believe--and others do, too--that it would be a terrible \ninjustice for us to consider a bill which would allow this circumstance \nto continue. And until that agreement is reached, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me point out on this objection we heard \nthat this bill did pass this body last week by a vote of 65 to 34. It \nhas the overwhelming support of the American people. Over 80 percent of \nAmericans clearly support this bill. It passed with strong bipartisan \nsupport in the House of Representatives in I guess April of last year. \nSo now is the time with the House having expressed its will for the \nSenate to express its will to go to conference, and then we can work \nout the disagreements that have been expressed between the two. Now is \nnot the time to go back. It is a modest piece of legislation, very \nbalanced, and it simply prohibits transporting a minor child across \nState lines for an abortion to get around a State law requiring \nparental notification or consent of that child for that child's \nabortion. It does not change any State law or policy but helps ensure \nthat those State laws are honored.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the Democrats are objecting to what \nwould be the normal course of events in taking this bill to conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8478-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my friend, the distinguished majority \nleader, has laid out a program for the Senate to follow this week. As \noutlined by my friend, it is Alice in Wonderland. He talks about \nCongress and the Senate being a deliberative body, as well as it should \nbe, and it has not been in recent years because of the Republicans' \ndesire to do as little as possible.\n  Take, for example, my friend's statement about pensions. Last Friday, \nconference was agreed upon--working for months and months to come up \nwith an agreement that affects 45 million Americans. It is so \nimportant. We talked a lot about the airlines. That is important to the \nairlines, but a lot of other companies also benefit from this.\n\n  The conference was agreed to. The Democrats and Republicans were \nready to sign. I wasn't there. I don't know who walked in, whether it \nwas the Senator from Tennessee or the chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, but someone said, no, we are not going to agree to the \nconference. Even though you have agreed on it, we are stripping all the \nextenders from this. The conference, in effect, is over.\n  Now to come to the Senate and say it is a take-it-or-leave it deal is \na little hard to comprehend. We have a freestanding bill. If we want to \nbe the Senate, as we are supposed to be, it is subject to amendment. A \nconference report is not. The pension thing was all worked out until \nthe Republican majority decided they had to get back to the road to \nlegislative heaven, and the only road to legislative heaven in this \nRepublican-dominated Congress is to repeal the estate tax. So the \nconference report affecting 45 million people was thrown in the garbage \nto take care of 81 people, the richest people in America. That is what \nthis is all about.\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\n  The minimum wage they bring to the Senate is a travesty. The State of \nNevada is an example. Everyone knows Las Vegas and Reno are based on \ntourism. Thousands and thousands of people work in Reno and Las Vegas \nfor tips. In Nevada, those tips are not counted against your minimum \nwage. It is the same in six other States: California, Montana, \nWashington, Oregon, and Minnesota. Tourism is a big deal and the State \nlegislatures there did not want minimum wage to be counted against \ntheir tips. Where are the States rights we hear so much about from our \nfriends on the majority side? They wiped this out with the bill they \nsent to the Senate.\n  If this minimum wage passed, it would be a disservice and an unfair \nstatement to the people of Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Montana, \nCalifornia, and Minnesota. To think we have a minimum wage package that \nis good is a joke, an absolute joke. It is spread out over a longer \nperiod of time and it penalizes seven States.\n  Right now, as we speak, people are being killed in Iraq. Our soldiers \nare being killed in Iraq. It is nighttime in Iraq. They have not \nfinished the body count as to the deaths that occurred in the last 24 \nhours. Well over 100 Iraqis have been murdered or killed one way or the \nother by the sectarian violence. We have been told by our military \ncommanders, and they have sent a letter to the President of the United \nStates, saying they need $17 billion yesterday. They want an emergency \nsupplemental to take care of the equipment our soldiers are using in \nIraq. The President has kept that in his bottom drawer someplace. It \nhas not come to the Senate. I am sure he will wait until after the \nfiscal year has ended, as he has done in the past. Iraq is not part of \nhis normal budget even though the war is going into the fifth year. \nShouldn't we be working on that, rather than the Republicans' \ndomination of time in this Senate with the estate tax repeal? We have \nspent more time on the estate tax than any other issue. It shows the \ndifference between the two parties. We are concerned about the poorest \nof the poor; they are concerned about the richest of the rich. The rich \nin America are getting richer--all the statistics show that--the poor \nare getting poorer, and the middle class is being squeezed. For the \nRepublican leader to come to the Senate and say this is a take-it-or-\nleave package, you take the estate tax repeal--and it has these other \nlittle goodies they have stuck in it--take it or leave it, and as soon \nas we finish that, you can take or leave the pension bill that was once \nresolved Friday until they had to get back on the road to legislative \nheaven with the estate tax repeal--to say that is a take it or leave it \nis truly Alice in Wonderland. This is not the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will briefly respond on a couple of \nissues. Things have moved very quickly and, as the Democratic leader \nknows, not as anticipated exactly as of midpoint last week for all \nsorts of different reasons--in part because of the House departure--and \nthings have changed. I am very certain at this juncture the choices \nlaid out before the Senate are appropriate choices, that each Senator \nwill be able to come to the Senate and express in what direction they \nwant to go.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader says that extenders were stripped \nout of the pension bill. Let's be very clear that the pension bill that \npassed the House of Representatives did not have tax policy extenders \nin it; the pension bill that passed the Senate did not have the tax \nextenders policy in it. So it is a little bit hard to strip out \nextenders from a pension bill that did not exist in a Senate or House \nbill.\n  My distinguished colleague mentioned the pension bill. Things are \ngoing well in conference on the pension bill. I argue that on the \npension bill they continue, even through all the other disagreements on \nthe pension issue itself, to go very well. The decisions were made on \nthe substance of the pension bill, with Democratic Senators in the room \nand Republican Senators in the room, both in discussion throughout. I \nam very comfortable with the pension bill in the nature of the \nconference. But where the conference broke down is on the other issues, \nthe tax extenders that were not in either pension bill.\n\n  Repealing the death tax, the third issue that the distinguished \nleader mentioned, I make it clear it is an important issue. I think the \ntax is wrong, it is unsafe, it discourages savings and investment, it \npunishes farmers and small business people in this country. We have \nlegitimate disagreement about that. I feel strongly about that. Yes, I \nthink the whole tax should be thrown away. It should be buried forever. \nHowever, we came to the Senate floor and could not get 60 votes. We got \n55 votes, including the ranking member on the Committee on Finance who \nsaid it is important to bury that death tax forever.\n  But in the best spirit of compromise, we understand that right now \nthis Senate will not repeal it forever and, therefore, after a lot of \ndiscussion between both sides of the aisle, we have come back with a \ncompromise that basically is not a total repeal, but it does prevent \nthe death tax rate from rising, after it disappears 1 year, from up to \n55 percent in 1 year with the exemption dropping down to $1 million. It \ngives a permanent solution. The details of that, as mentioned \nyesterday--and I am sure people will talk about it today--it is a fair \ncompromise, and a permanent solution with some certainty for people, \nfor the farmers, for the small business people out there today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me finish responding to my distinguished colleague.\n  The minimum wage that he called ``a joke,'' that we put in the \ntrifecta bill, or the House put in the trifecta bill, which we will be \nvoting on on Friday, to call a minimum wage that, it is their No. 1 \nissue. I have made it clear, again and again, going to the other side, \nWhat are your issues? The No. 1 issue from that side of the aisle is to \nincrease the minimum wage, again and again and again.\n  To have this opportunity now to take their No. 1 issue, with the \nissue that is very important to us, that focuses on small business and \nfarms, and take their No. 1 issue and put them together, to me is in \nthe best spirit of this Senate. I would not call it a joke when you \nincrease the minimum wage today from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 an hour. \nYes, it is over 36 months. Yes, we do include the minimum wage tip \ncredit which we feel is very important to small businesses. Yes, there \nis relief for small businesses who might say out there, we cannot \nafford this increase in minimum wage in the tax extenders package where \nwe have a 15-year depreciation to give some help to those people who \nmight be affected by increasing the minimum wage in a detrimental way, \nbut I would not call it a joke. It is their No. 1 issue. To put it \ntogether in one bill that we can take forward, to me, is in the great \nspirit of coming together in this Senate.\n  We come to the fifth item the Democratic leader mentioned, ``other \nissues'' that we are not concentrating on. Again, if you look at this \nmonth, we look at the infrastructure in this country, we passed the \nWater Resources Development Act, a bill very important to our waterways \nand support of the infrastructure to promote economic growth. The \nEnergy bill we will be voting on today we have spent a lot of time on, \nbut it has the potential for putting a billion barrels of oil not \navailable today out on the markets, 5.6 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas which is not available today. If you talk to farmers, the high \nprice of natural gas today drives up that cost of fertilizer, so it is \nimportant that we will deliver on that today.\n  I mentioned earlier issues I know the other side diminishes in \nimportance, but that child custody bill that does address issues \naround, yes, the sanctity of life, but what State laws say in people \ntrying to circumvent the State laws with regard to parental consent and \nabortion passed this Senate. The Adam Walsh Sex Offenders National \nRegistry bill addressed a real problem in this country. We have 100,000 \nsex offenders circulating and we do not know where they are today. We \naddressed that in the Senate last week.\n  We continue to address the issues important to real people right now \nwith regard to their cost of living, to hopefully lower natural gas \nprices in the Senate today, to address the values they care about when \nyou talk about parental consent for abortion, people trying to \ncircumvent those laws, and\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\nsexual predators; or when you talk about the infrastructure of our \nwaterways and our waterway development, again, which promotes economic \ngrowth. I would be hard pressed to say we are not addressing the issues \nthat mean something to the average, hard-working taxpayer out there \ntoday.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would ask the majority leader, since he called for the \ncomplete repeal of the estate tax, when President Bush took office, our \nnational debt was about $5 trillion; now it is nearing $9 trillion. In \n6 years it has gone from $5 trillion to $9 trillion. What you have \nproposed in the Senate will add at least $1 trillion more to the \nnational debt. Is there any limit to the amount of debt you would leave \nto future generations to give tax breaks to wealthy people?\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I think the misrepresentation of the issue \nwe are going to be voting on, on Friday, that has just been made by the \nassistant Democratic leader needs to be addressed.\n  Right now, the bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is \naround--the cost of this death tax permanent fix--is around $267 \nbillion; again, not the $1 trillion that has been laid out. And the \nissues of the dollars and the cents we can argue. What we start with, \nthough, is the individual out there, who is running that farm, who is \nrunning that small business, who has been taxed again and again and \nagain, is actually taxed on their death for a second time, a third \ntime, a fourth time, and it is just wrong. I would argue it is wrong \nwhatever the price is, although the price is about a quarter of the \nfigure he put forward. It is important for us to act on what is right \nand what is wrong. That is why, on this Friday, we will be doing just \nthat.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Just to clarify the numbers, because I do think the \nassistant Democratic leader has thrown a bit of a straw dog out there \nin his numbers, as to the death tax, as it is presently structured \nunder today's law, the exemption is about $2 million. If we do not put \nin place this change in the death tax, the exemption will go back to $1 \nmillion. The tax rate on dollars over the $2 million today goes up to \nabout 46 percent, I believe. If we do not put in place this change, the \ntax rate would go up to 60 percent on everything over $1 million, \npotentially.\n  What the proposal before us will be is to raise the $2 million limit \nup to $3.5 million, or an increase of $1.5 million, which is basically \na small family restaurant or a small family farm or a small family \nbusiness. It is not to repeal the tax; it simply is to say to people \nwho have small businesses: You will not be wiped out. Your family won't \nbe wiped out by estate taxes which would be 60 percent of the value of \nthat business over $1 million, potentially. Is that not true?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is absolutely true. And I think as we \nenter this debate over the course of the week, with a lot of these \nstraw men that are being thrown out, we will have the opportunity to \ntalk about and address the reality of what the costs would be. I think \nthat is important. We have to address that. Our fiscal responsibility \nhas to be there--but ultimately how it affects that individual farmer, \nwho is out there, who dies, and has saved, has invested, has grown that \nfarm or that small business, and has already paid taxes on what they \nproduced, and to be able to pass that on to their children--again, not \ntotally free because we have certain limits. Although I would argue we \nought to repeal it totally, that is not what is on the floor. The \ncompromise is on the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the majority leader would yield further, \nthere is no total repeal; is that not correct? What is happening is the \ntax is being reformed to reflect the fact there has been an increase in \nvalue in assets for especially small businesspeople, especially small \nfarmers, and we are trying to protect those families from having their \nbusinesses wiped out. So the first $3.5 million, no, there would not be \na tax, but over that there would be a tax?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is exactly right. What is important is \nthe permanent solution. Right now, it is absurd to think we almost have \nto have three types of planning for when you die: over the next 3 \nyears, as these prices come down; and then total elimination for a \nyear; and then jump back up to a rate of, as my distinguished colleague \nfrom New Hampshire said, as high as 60 percent in 1 year, with that \nexemption falling back down to $1 million.\n  So what we propose, what we will be voting on now--and then that is \nit, that is it for this year--is a permanent solution to give certainty \nso people will know what the laws are, what the taxes will be, and \nclearly relieve most of the incentive that discourages savings and \ninvestment.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the majority leader will yield for one or two more \nquestions. I would also ask, on this minimum wage issue, which the \nDemocratic leader has dismissed as irrelevant or ineffective, by my \ncalculation, a $2.15 increase--I believe that is what it is; maybe it \nis 10 cents--on a $5 basis is about a 40-percent increase. That is not \nan insignificant increase in the minimum wage, to raise it by 40 \npercent, is it?\n  Mr. FRIST. It is not. It is either a percentage or the amount $2.10 \nfor every hour you are working if we pass it this week. It is the law \nof the land, by the way, if we pass it this week as it is written. We \nare talking about a 2.10 absolute. But also it is a percentage \nincrease. It is huge. Everybody needs to realize, right now this is \ngoing to be the law of the land. The House has already passed it. If we \npass it, it is. That will go up, as both that percentage as well as \nthat amount, $2.10. For every hour you are working, you are going to be \ngetting more money.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the majority leader will yield for one more question \nrelative to the budget issues here. We have heard from the other side, \nalmost interminably, about the need for pay-go and to live by pay-go. \nIs it not true that these tax cuts within this proposal meet the pay-go \nscorecard?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, absolutely. And this has been very \ncarefully crafted to make sure we do meet those criteria. The real \nbeauty of what is on the table--again, it is three different bills, but \neach has been addressed very carefully, such as pay-go, such as \naddressing the No. 1 issue from the Democrats on the minimum wage, \nadding the tax extenders. We have not talked very much about those, but \nit includes everything from State and local sales tax deductions to the \nresearch and development tax credit, which is simplified and extended--\nabsolutely critical, as we hear from the high-tech people across this \ncountry in terms of investing for the future to create jobs. The \ncollege tuition deduction is in there; the work opportunity tax credit; \nthe welfare-to-work tax credit; the depreciation for restaurants in 15 \nyears; the timber capital gains; the mine safety tax incentives; the \nteachers' classroom expenses deduction; combat pay applies to EITC; the \ngulf opportunity zone--that is, the Katrina tax credits. That is what \nwe will be voting on today: the permanent death tax relief, the \nextension of the tax relief, and the minimum wage increase.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield for another question?\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the leader share my view that one of the things \nwe hear the most from our constituents as we go about the country is: \nWhy can't you people in the Senate do things on a bipartisan basis? And \nI heard the leader indicate earlier that we obviously have bipartisan \nsupport for the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, we have bipartisan \nsupport for the tax extenders, bipartisan support for the minimum wage, \nand, yes, bipartisan support for a permanent reduction in the death \ntax.\n  Why in the world--with bipartisan support for all of these three \nmeasures which the leader has put on the agenda for the last week \nbefore the August break--why in the world shouldn't we come together on \na bipartisan basis and do something together that would be \noverwhelmingly popular with the American people? We have seen the poll \ndata on the death tax. Even after Americans understand it does not \napply to them, they hate the tax and despise it because they think they\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\nshouldn't have to visit the IRS and the undertaker on the last day. And \nwe are not even, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, \npermanently repealing it, which would be our first choice but, rather, \ngetting a permanent reduction. The minimum wage is overwhelmingly \napproved, and we have taken Senator Kennedy's figures. What part of \n``yes'' do our friends on the other side not understand?\n  So I would just ask my friend, the majority leader, if he can think \nof any rationale why the Senate, any reason why the Senate should not \ncome together--with bipartisan support existing for all of these \nmeasures--this week and have one of the Senate's finest moments, \noperating on a bipartisan basis to do some series of things that are \nimportant for America?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would just very briefly respond that my \ndistinguished colleague from Kentucky really captures the point. Not \nonly is it bipartisan support, but it is bipartisan majority support \nfor each of these. Remember, for a total repeal, we got, in essence, 55 \nvotes--for total repeal--and we are coming back with the compromise. \nThe extension of the tax relief and the long list I went through are \nissues we have addressed before, and we are extending them because they \nare so popular in terms of bipartisan support. And the minimum wage \nincrease is an issue that has bipartisan majority support.\n  Each of these issues has been addressed in some shape or form. I am \nsure some people would come back and say we need to spend more time and \nlet's put it off until September and let's delay. Each of these issues \nwe have addressed. And there has been an appropriate compromise that is \nbeing brought forth that people will be voting on this Friday.\n  So I think it does capture, potentially, if we continue to work in a \nbipartisan way, the very best of what this body is all about. And it is \ncompromise. It is vote. It is action. It is addressing the concerns of \nthe everyday people out there today who do scratch their heads at times \nand say: Now is the time for us to act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Again, we live in this ``land of Oz.'' The conferees had \nsigned off on the conference report dealing with pensions. Basically, \nthere had been an agreement, and they were going to put in that, as \nconferences are able to do, the extenders. They all worked out. We \nwould have been voting on that today. But they wanted the extenders to \nhelp the ``pathway to heaven''--the ``legislative pathway to heaven''--\nof the Republicans on the estate tax, so that was taken away.\n  Mr. President, if you are working at one of the hotels in Las Vegas \nor one of the resorts in the State of Washington or Oregon or Minnesota \nor California and this minimum wage passes, you would get a decrease in \nyour minimal salary. It does not sound very good to me. And I think I \nwould class it and the people in Nevada and those other six States \nwould say it is a joke. How could you pass something saying it helps \nme; I get a pay decrease. The minimum wage bill they have here is not \nonly spread out over 3 years--different from ours--it also penalizes \nseven States.\n  For the majority leader to say that minimum wage is our No. 1 issue, \nit is one of our No. 1 issues. We have a lot of No. 1 issues. We care \nabout the health care of this Nation--46 million people with no health \ninsurance. We care about the kids being able to go to college. We care \nabout stem cell research, which the President vetoed. That could be a \nNo. 1 issue. I think Iraq is a No. 1 issue--2,600 dead Americans, more \nthan 20,000 wounded, costing $3 billion a week. I think that is a No. 1 \nissue.\n  I did not invent for this Congress the name ``the do-nothing \nCongress.'' Pundits all over America call this the do-nothing Congress \nbecause we have done nothing. We have been in session very few days. We \nhave accomplished virtually nothing. And that is why it is called the \ndo-nothing Congress.\n  Now, we did not--my friend, the distinguished minority whip, the \nassistant Democratic leader, did not invent the cost of this bill. It \nis every place, in editorials all over the country--``bad bargain'' in \nthe Washington Post, it is referred to. And in here it talks about the \nmeasure would cost $753 billion. No, it is not total repeal; it is only \n80 percent repeal: $753 billion.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: House estate tax proposal \nhas essentially the same long-term costs as earlier version.\n  For the people watching this, Mr. President, understand what has \nhappened, as has been pointed out by the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois this morning. During the 6 years President Bush has been in \noffice, the debt has skyrocketed, almost doubled: $9 trillion. Now, \nremember, during the Clinton years, the last 3 years President Clinton \nwas President, the debt was paid down. So it is great for them to talk \nabout pay-go. And as the majority leader mentioned, the death tax he \ndoes not like, he does not care how much it costs, he said here right \nnow.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I asked the majority leader a question. I said: Since we \nare adding to the debt which we are leaving to our children and \nfamilies, is there any limit to the amount of debt you would create in \nAmerica to provide tax breaks for people who are the wealthiest? And he \nwould not reply to that, which suggests to me--I would ask the Senator \nfrom Nevada--that when the majority leader and the majority whip both \nsaid they really favor repeal of the estate tax--repeal, complete \nrepeal of the estate tax--that they are prepared to incur whatever debt \nis necessary and leave that to future generations in order to benefit \nthe wealthy few in America.\n  We have reports from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that \nthe number of people to be benefited in 1 year in America from this \nestate tax reform is 8,200 people. The average benefit by estate tax \nreform, as they call it, would be $1.4 million for each one of those \npersons.\n\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada, if the majority party in the Senate \nis not even sensitive to the fact that they are now leaving three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars of debt for our children and future \ngenerations to benefit 8,200 families, is this pay as you go? And if it \nis pay as you go, how are the Republicans paying for their reform or \nrepeal of the estate tax?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, like they pay for everything else. My \n16 grandchildren are going to be paying for it, and their children are \ngoing to be paying for it. You talk about a death tax; the estate tax \nis not a death tax. What this Republican-dominated Washington has done \nin the last 6 years has passed on a birth tax to my children, their \nchildren, my grandchildren, and their children.\n  It is obvious what the priorities of this Republican Senate and the \nRepublican House are: to take care of the fat cats, the rich people. \nThat is what it is all about. They know this minimum wage legislation \nthey sent us is flawed. It eliminates an increase for the hard-working \npoorest of the poor in seven States, and it is spread out over 3 years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, over what period of time \nhave the Democrats in Congress been asking for an increase in the \nminimum wage and over what period of time have Republican Presidents \nand the Republican-led Congress said no repeatedly to an increase in \nthe basic $5.15 minimum wage? How long have we been asking for a \nstraight-up vote on increasing the minimum wage?\n  Mr. REID. It has been about 10 years. As I said here yesterday, I \ndon't know why, even though it is a flawed measure they sent us, I \ndon't know why they have moved forward. Maybe it is because we stood up \nand said there will be no congressional pay raise until the minimum \nwage is increased or maybe it is because Oprah did a show on this last \nweek or maybe it is a combination of both.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, when the Democrats said \nthere will be no congressional pay raise until the minimum wage goes \nup, and all of a sudden the interest in the minimum wage was rekindled \non the Republican side of the aisle, now that the Republicans have said \nwe ought to spread the increase in the minimum wage over 3 years, \nperhaps the congressional pay raises should be spread over a 3-year \nperiod of time. There should be some symmetry if there is an \ninsensitivity to what the lowest paid workers are receiving. I ask the \nSenator from Nevada\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\nif that is a proposal we ought to consider.\n  Mr. REID. Of course, we should consider it.\n  I say through the Chair to my friend from Illinois, we are in this \npredicament because the Republicans have put us here. We are spending \nan inordinate amount of time on seeing if they can run up a debt of \napproximately $1 trillion to the American people to take care of 8,100 \npeople. That is why we are here. It is not because of the minimum wage; \nthey hate the minimum wage. You know that, I know that. It is not \nbecause of the extenders. The extenders are good for most everybody. \nThat is why they put it on the pension bill in conference. We are here \nbecause of the estate tax repeal. That is what this is all about. All \nthe rest is fluff. As I say, the dominating issue of this Republican \nSenate has been estate tax repeal. That means more to them than \nspending time debating the war in Iraq. It means more to them than \ntalking about health care.\n  It means more to them, certainly, than talking about global warming \nbecause, according to them, it doesn't exist. It certainly has taken \naway time to talk about why the President vetoed stem cell. This issue \nrelating to the estate tax has taken care of everything for them. That \nis their No. 1 issue. You talk about the minimum wage being our No. 1 \nissue. They don't have No. 2, 3, 4, 5, like we do. Estate tax is it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Our agenda has been \nvery clear. It has been clearly articulated and, as people look back, \nas they look forward, they will see how all the pieces come together \nbecause each time we take a bill to the floor there is a complaint. On \nchild custody, there is obstruction; we are going to stop it. But it is \nclear to the American people. When we go back to our States and talk to \nthe people, they get it. The Democratic leader is right in many ways. \nHe says Iraq and dead Americans--the words he used--$3 billion, all of \nwhich I look at as securing America's homeland and those enduring \nvalues of freedom and liberty that we know are so important to our \ngeneration and that next generation. That is what this war on terror is \nabout. It is the No. 1 issue, securing America's homeland. I will come \nback to that in a second.\n  I hope we can address supporting our troops overseas in the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill, this week. We need to do \nthat this week as well. We could go to that tonight. I will talk to \nChairman Stevens as soon as I finish here to see if we can take that to \nthe floor tonight and address it over the next couple of days.\n  Securing America's homeland, we addressed in part through our border \nsecurity bill, and addressing immigration, we did spend several weeks \non the floor of the Senate.\n  The second thematic is securing America's prosperity. By prosperity, \nthe other side wants to talk about rich people because they know it has \nconnotations to it and the sound bites work. But if you look at what we \nare doing, we are talking about people at the lowest rung of the \neconomic ladder. We are talking about small businesspeople. We are \ntalking about people who feel the squeeze that we know they feel \nbecause of energy prices and because of health care. Although they can \nsay we are not addressing those, at 5 o'clock today we are voting on \nthe bill that can have the single greatest impact since our last Energy \nbill a year ago, which was very successful, a bill which has the \npotential for reducing that squeeze that people are feeling today when \nthey fill their tractors with fuel. We are addressing it on this floor.\n\n  We addressed health information technology, which I think is the \nsingle most incremental variable that can transform health care today \nin terms of improved quality, improved availability, and reduced cost, \nby getting rid of the waste and the abuse and even the fraud and the \nmedical errors that do typify our health care sector. We addressed that \nin the Senate. We passed it in the Senate, and the House passed it last \nweek. Now we can go to conference and pass it. So when we talk \nprosperity, too often the other side just talks about rich people. We \ntoo often talk about the 5.4 million jobs created--very, very \nimportant--the 4.7 percent unemployment rate, the lowest of the average \nof the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s--all very important. We are \naddressing what the average person, the typical taxpayer is feeling--\nenergy prices--on the floor of the Senate today.\n  We are addressing health care costs through health information \ntechnology by trying to take small business health plans to the floor \nbut having it stopped from consideration by the other side of the \naisle. People feel those health care costs.\n  The third thematic is securing America's values. We have securing \nAmerica's homeland, No. 1; securing prosperity, No. 2; and securing \nAmerica's values, No. 3. Last week, on child custody protection, it is \nbeing stopped by the other side of the aisle. This body has spoken, but \nit is being obstructed. The Adam Walsh child protection bill, passed, \nsigned by the President. We are going to continue to fight for \nAmerica's values.\n  I will close by saying, there is a lot we will be talking about over \nthe course of the week. I restate once again that vote will be Friday. \nAre we ready to address a permanent solution to the death tax this \nFriday? We are going to say yes or no. If it is no, we are not going to \ndo it this year. Extension of tax relief, the issues and the policies \nthat I outlined before, we are going to do them now, this week, or we \nare not going to do it, as well as the minimum wage. Remember, if we \npass it this week, or if we demonstrate that we are going to pass it \nthis week, people across this country who are making the minimum wage \nwill have that minimum wage go. It has already passed the House, from \n$5.15 to $7.25, a $2.10 increase, if we vote correctly on this Friday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wanted to correct the Record. I spoke \ninaccurately in that on the issue of pay-go, there is available under \npay-go approximately $300 billion to cover the cost of this tax bill. \nIn one 5-year period, it may be out of compliance, but over the entire \n10-year period, it is clearly within compliance.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we just heard an interesting exchange \nbetween the Democratic and Republican leaders about the week's agenda. \nThe Democratic leader indicated that this was a do-nothing Congress and \nin the same remarks he indicated he was going to try to keep us from \ndoing something this week. As the occupant of the chair has frequently \nsaid, block and blame. But the truth is, it must be confusing for the \npeople in the gallery and for those who might be watching on television \nto try to figure out in the middle of all this what is happening. Let \nme explain it again before addressing the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act, which is my principal reason for rising at this point.\n  This week, we are considering four bills, each of which enjoys \nbipartisan support: the Energy Security Act, which I will get back to \nin a minute, but also the Democratic version of the increase in the \nminimum wage, a tax extender bill that enjoys broad bipartisan support, \nand a modification and\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\npermanent reduction of the estate tax which also enjoys bipartisan \nsupport. So the Senate will have an opportunity, as the majority leader \npointed out, later this week to do what it is about to do at 5 o'clock \nthis afternoon on this important Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. We \nsaw a vote yesterday in which 20 Democrats joined all but one \nRepublican to discontinue debate and move toward passage of an \nextraordinarily significant Energy Policy Act. And there are a number \nof heroes and a heroine who have been involved in this process.\n  First, the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Domenici; this \nis a singular accomplishment for his leadership. He stepped into the \nbreach, was able to figure out exactly what the Senate could handle and \nwas willing to pass on a bipartisan basis some 3 or 4 months before an \nelection and carefully crafted a compromise that will succeed this \nafternoon in making a major step forward in addressing our shortage of \nboth domestic oil and natural gas.\n  Another hero in this story is the Senator from Florida, Mel Martinez. \nHe stepped up to the plate and protected the interests of his State by \ngetting a boundary around the gulf portion of Florida that ensures, up \nuntil 2022, that there be no exploration and drilling. There had to be \nDemocrats for this to go forward. Senator Landrieu was able to very \nskillfully line up, as of yesterday--and we assume many of those 20 \nDemocrats who voted for cloture yesterday will be there today--20 \nDemocrats for final passage. Her colleague, Senator Vitter, and, for \nthat matter, all of the gulf coast Senators who reached in to this \natmosphere and realized a significant accomplishment would be available \non a bipartisan basis that would benefit their States. And for other \nMembers of the Senate not on the gulf coast who realize that getting \nmoney for the Land and Water Conservation Fund is an important step \nforward, a kind of permanent revenue stream for land and water \nconservation, all of these forces came to work, and we had an example \nof the Senate working in its finest tradition on a bipartisan basis.\n  We will have that opportunity again at the end of the week, as the \nmajority leader pointed out, as we have our last chance this year to \nget an increase in the minimum wage, a permanent solution to the \nonerous death tax, which is coming back at a confiscatory rate in a few \nyears, and a tax extender package that is widely supported on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Hopefully, the Senate will not block and blame but act in the best \ninterest of the American people later in the week.\n  Now let me address my remarks specifically to the Gulf of Mexico \nEnergy Security Act. I know that some have said this bill goes too far \nand others have said it goes not far enough. With apologies to \nGoldilocks, I think this bill is just right.\n  We have only reached the point of what I believe will be final \npassage of this bill after the negotiation I described earlier in the \nbest tradition of the Senate--bipartisan negotiations producing an \nextraordinarily important piece of legislation. Senators from both \nparties have worked diligently and in good faith to craft legislation \nthat could win the support of as many Senators as possible. This bill \nhas the support of every single Senator from a Gulf State.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill and to have been involved \non behalf of the leadership in these seemingly endless discussions that \nwent on for the last couple of months in order to put this together.\n  I know a little something about marshaling support for a bill. \nBelieve me when I say, although this bill may not have in it everything \neveryone wants, it will greatly improve our country's energy \nindependence and move us toward greater economic prosperity and \nstronger national security. And it is absolutely the best bill the \nSenate could pass at this time.\n  High energy costs are hitting Americans in their pocketbooks because \nof supply problems for oil and for natural gas. This bill will begin to \nalleviate our supply problems and provide us with greater independence \nfrom foreign sources of energy. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act \nof 2006 will open up over 8.3 million acres of the Outer Continental \nShelf for energy exploration. The Department of the Interior estimates \nthat this area will yield at least 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.83 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas. That is more oil than the proven \nreserves in Wyoming and Oklahoma combined. That is enough natural gas \nto power nearly 6 million homes for at least 15 years.\n  The price of crude oil, as recently as mid-July, reached a whopping \n$77 a barrel. Compare that with the price of $34 a barrel in July 2004. \nIncreasing our domestic supply of oil is the only way, in the long \nterm, to bring those prices down. The same holds true for natural gas \nprices, which also have skyrocketed in the last few years.\n  As we all know, the price of natural gas is set domestically in \nAmerica, unlike the price of oil. So we can have a direct impact on \nnatural gas prices in America by increasing the supply. We all know we \nneed to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. The current \nstrife in the Middle East and the rising level of threatening rhetoric \nfrom Iran all affect the price of energy in the world market. The more \noil and gas we produce domestically, the more we can insulate ourselves \nfrom events over which we have little or no control.\n  Rising energy prices also threaten America's economic vitality. High \nenergy costs hamper our industrial competitiveness, as companies choose \nto produce goods in other countries where their costs will be much \nlower. For the goods produced here, prices are higher to take account \nof those higher energy costs.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that from 2000 to \n2005, this country lost 2.9 million manufacturing jobs, due in part to \nhigh energy costs. Not only will this bill alleviate that problem by \nboosting America's energy supply, it will also generate revenues from \nlease sales, all of which are brand new. And 37.5 percent of those \nrevenues will go to the Gulf States of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand Texas for coastal protection, restoration, and mitigation. Another \n12.5 percent of the revenues will go to the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, which will distribute the money to State and local governments \nfor the improvement of public parks and recreation areas.\n  Finally, the remaining 50 percent will go to the General Treasury of \nthe U.S. Government. Because this revenue comes from new leases, this \nwill be an increase of funds--an increase, new money--to the General \nTreasury.\n  I also remind my colleagues that S. 3711 ensures that we carry out \nthis energy exploration without sacrificing environmental concerns. \nThis bill will install a 125-mile buffer against energy development in \nwaters off of the coast of Florida, thanks to the negotiations of \nSenator Martinez, as I indicated earlier. He has protected the \ncoastland of his State. And the bill will extend until the year 2022 a \nmoratorium on energy development in certain areas of the gulf that this \nSenate has decided are too close to the coastline. Again, that is at \nthe insistence of Senator Martinez.\n  This bill should garner all of our colleagues' support. It takes a \nstep forward for our country's energy policy. I also thank the majority \nleader for all of his hard work to shepherd this bill to what I believe \nwe are going to witness this afternoon, which is a strong, bipartisan \nvote of support. The Senate should pass it. It will reduce America's \ndependence on foreign sources of energy, while strengthening our \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Republican whip for his \nremarks. I will address them in the same context, first, the earlier \ndebate, what we are considering in the business of the Senate this \nweek, and finally this bill that is pending before us.\n  What we have before us this week is a historic decision to make. It \nis a historic decision because, if the Republican majority prevails and \nif the bill, which they are asking us to pass, is enacted and signed by \nthe President, what we will do is add dramatically to the national debt \nof America.\n  This morning's Washington Post suggested that the repeal of the \nestate tax will cost us, with interest over a 10-year period of time, \nabout $750 billion.\n\n[[Page S8484]]\n\nThis Federal estate tax affects very few Americans--only those in the \nhighest income categories. It is a tax that is imposed on about 2 out \nof every 1,000 people who die in the course of a year--2 out of 1,000. \nSo 8,200 families each year will get a tax break if the Republican \nproposal is enacted. Those families, on average, will be spared paying \na Federal tax, on average, of $1.4 million.\n  When you project that over a long period of time, it means that we \nwill be paying out--I should say not collecting--$750 billion that \notherwise would have come into our Treasury. The responsible thing to \ndo, for either side of the aisle, if you are going to take $750 billion \nout of the Treasury, is either cut spending by that amount of money or \nimpose another tax, another revenue source. That would be pay-as-you-\ngo. So you would balance the books. You would say, for example, it is \nso important for us to reduce the taxes paid by 8,000 families a year--\nthe highest income families--that I would propose raising another tax \nor I would propose making a cut. But that is not what is happening.\n  What is happening has become the ordinary course of business under \nour friends on the Republican side of the aisle. They continue to spend \nmoney and they continue to cut taxes without any concern for the impact \non our national debt. Here is the record that Republicans have written \non the budget: 4 years in a row of record deficits in the United States \nof America. In the closing years of the Clinton administration--and you \ncan find this in the publications of our Government--we were generating \nsurpluses. For the first time, we had turned the corner; we were \nreducing the national debt of America, strengthening the Social \nSecurity trust fund, and we had reached a point where we were moving \nforward with confidence that Social Security would be stronger for \nyears to come and we would not be heaping more and more debt on our \nchildren. That was at the end of the Clinton administration.\n  Then came the Bush administration. President George W. Bush, in the 6 \nyears he has been President, in the 4 years the Republicans have been \nin charge in the Senate, has seen record deficits. The debt is \nprojected to soar under the Republican policies, this one-party rule in \nWashington--with the President's party in the White House, obviously, \nand in the Congress, the debt is projected to soar to more than $11 \ntrillion by 2011. It will more than double; their policies will more \nthan double foreign-held debt in 5 years, which I will speak to in a \nmoment. There will be little real revenue growth since 2000. Every \npenny of the Social Security surplus, $2.5 trillion, will be spent on \ntax cuts, such as these, for wealthy people in America; and we will \nfind that we are getting deeper and deeper in debt.\n  Let me illustrate that in a chart which Senator Conrad, our ranking \nDemocrat on the Budget Committee, uses. This is his ``wall of debt.'' \nThis indicates what has happened since 2000, when President Bush came \nto office. He faced $5.8 trillion in debt. That was the entire \naccumulated debt of America, $5.8 trillion, when President Bush was \nsworn into office. Now, by the year 2006, that number is up to $8.5 \ntrillion. Think about that. It went from $5.8 trillion up to $8.5 \ntrillion today--under the people in charge who call themselves ``fiscal \nconservatives.'' The debt of America, as projected under their \npolicies, will rise to the level of $11.5 trillion by 2011.\n  So by the policies President Bush and the Republicans in Congress put \ninto place when they came to Washington, projected out over the 10-year \nperiod--that is how we do our budgeting here--it doesn't quite double \nthe national debt, but it comes very close. Where do we get the money \nto do this? How can we continue to spend money we don't have? How can \nwe build up all this debt? Who is going to provide the mortgage for \nAmerica?\n  Well, it turns out that this President has found a source which he \nuses, which is historic. President Bush has turned to foreign \ngovernments to borrow money to sustain this overspending and cutting \ntaxes without cutting spending. President Bush has more than doubled \nthe amount of American debt held by foreign governments in 5 years. It \ntook 42 Presidents in the history of the United States 224 years to \nbuild up $1.1 trillion in indebtedness to foreign governments. This \nPresident, in 5 years, has more than doubled that amount.\n  So who are our bankers? Who are America's mortgagors? When you look \nat the world's biggest borrowers, the United States dominates the \nscene. We borrow more money from around the world than anybody; 65 \npercent of all of the borrowing in the world comes from the United \nStates. For instance, this estate tax repeal--by heaping on another \n$750 billion of debt on America that is not paid for and could rise as \nhigh as a trillion dollars, we have to turn to somebody and say loan us \nthe money so we can give a tax break to the wealthiest people in the \nworld. And we borrow more money than any other country. Other countries \npale in comparison in terms of how much they borrow. Who are these \nmortgagors, these bankers who come to our rescue and loan us the money? \nNo. 1, Japan; 2, China; 3, United Kingdom; 4, oil exporting countries--\na recurring theme in our policy, our dependence on oil exporters--South \nKorea, Taiwan, and so forth.\n  So what we are doing is asking them to loan us money so we can give \ntax breaks to wealthy people. That is what this choice is this week. \nHow bad is this? Well, the General Accounting Office Comptroller, \nGeneral Walker, chosen by the Republicans, a very bipartisan man--I \nrespect him. I wasn't sure when he came in if he had a political \nagenda, but he has been proven as a leader at the GAO who calls them as \nhe sees them. Sometimes his messages make Democrats happy, sometimes \nthey make Republicans happy. But I believe he does his best to be \nhonest and candid. He said:\n\n       ``Our problem is our large long-term deficit, and the \n     sooner we deal with that the better,'' said Comptroller \n     General David Walker. Walker warned of a false sense of \n     security. We are in much worse shape fiscally today than we \n     were a few years ago.\n\n  That was an interview in the L.A. Times of July of this year.\n  So this week, the Republicans will make this proposal: If we will \nagree to reduce and eliminate, in some cases, the estate tax on the \nwealthiest Americans who pass away--8,200 of them each year--then they \nwill agree to increase the minimum wage for workers across America.\n  The difference is stark when one looks at the beneficiaries. The \nnumbers tell the story: 8,200 families benefiting from a reduction in \nthe estate tax to the tune of 41.4 million each family by average; the \nminimum wage affects 6.6 million beneficiaries, and their average \nbenefit is $1,200. A $1,200 minimum wage increase; $1.4 million in \nestate tax relief or reduction for the wealthiest people. The ratio is \n1,000 to 1; 1,000 to 1 the benefit for the wealthier people in America \nfrom the estate tax versus the benefit from the minimum wage.\n  And who will pay for this repeal of the estate tax? Our children will \npay; the next generation will pay. America will go deeper into debt \nbecause the Republican leadership is going to add dramatically to the \nnational debt of America. That is not responsible. It really doesn't \nhave the best long-term interests of America in mind.\n  Many of us are concerned that those who work hard every day have been \nwaiting 9 years for an increase in the minimum wage. For 9 years, the \nRepublicans have stopped us from increasing the minimum wage. Imagine \nfor a moment, if you will, trying to live on $5.15 an hour. Who are \nthese people? They are the people who cleaned your hotel room this \nmorning. They are the folks who cleared the table of dishes when you \nwere finished at the restaurant. They are the ones who are watching \nyour children at the daycare center. They are the people who are \nprobably frying the hamburgers back in the little shop where you went \nin for lunch. They are making $5.15 an hour. That comes out to about \n$10,000 a year. Can you imagine? Can you imagine trying to get by, and \nimagine still if you have a child trying to get by?\n  For 9 years we said to the Republicans: Shouldn't we turn to the \nbipartisanship of increasing the minimum wage? That is just basic \nfairness, a humane approach to dealing with people. They have said no \nrepeatedly. It is one of the longest stretches of time in American \nhistory that we have failed to increase the minimum wage.\n  So now this week they have said: We have a bargain for you. If you \nwill cut\n\n[[Page S8485]]\n\nthe estate taxes on the wealthiest Americans, if you will build up debt \nfor future generations of $750 billion or more, if you will cause us to \nborrow more money from foreign governments to sustain this indebtedness \nin America, if you will do that, then we will consider giving some of \nthe hardest working, lowest paid Americans an increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  Doesn't this tell the story? Doesn't this tell the story between the \ndifferences between the two parties and their approach and attitude? We \nbelieve that an increase in the minimum wage is good for America and \ngood for people who get up and go to work every single day. We think it \nis good for families, and it is good for their children. We think it is \ngood for us in the long haul to reward work and to give a decent wage \nto people who get up and go to work. The Republicans, for 9 years, have \nsaid no.\n  We also think if you are going to cut taxes, for goodness' sake, why \ndon't we start by trying to help working families? Wouldn't we be \nbetter off as a nation to talk about tax cuts that are limited and \nfocused instead of these that are absolutely out of control? Wouldn't \nwe be better off as a country saying working families, middle-income \nfamilies could deduct the cost of college education expenses for their \nkids?\n  Isn't that a much better investment in our future than saying the \nwealthiest people in America, those who have benefitted the most from \nliving in this great Nation should be spared and resolved from paying \ntheir taxes to our Government?\n  Shouldn't we be helping these working families and small businesses \nwhen it comes to providing health insurance? That is an increasing cost \nfor most families, and certainly for small businesses. That is worthy \nof a tax break, one that means families will have peace of mind to have \nbasic health insurance. These are things that most Americans would \napplaud.\n  But, no, the Republican proposal is take it or leave it. You either \ngive a tax cut to the wealthiest Americans at great expense to our \nGovernment, increasing our national debt dramatically, or the \nRepublicans say: We won't increase the minimum wage for the hardest \nworking workers in America.\n  I think that is a terrible idea. I hope we come to our senses. I hope \nwe say to Republicans there is something more to life than rewarding \nthose who are the most comfortable in America.\n  This is a time in America's history when we are asking for sacrifice. \nWe are asking for great sacrifice from our men and women in uniform and \ntheir families, many of whom have given their lives for our country, \nmany of whom have left behind grieving families who will never get over \ntheir loss.\n\n  We usually say in time of war: America has to pull together; we all \nhave to sacrifice together. Back in World War II, there were savings \nbond drives, collection of metals that might be important in the war \neffort, and victory gardens. People really pulled together.\n  This administration and this Republican Congress see it differently. \nWhen they ask for the greatest sacrifice from families who provide our \nsoldiers and give them the support they need, they turn around and say \nto the wealthiest people in America: You don't have to sacrifice \nanything. In fact, we will give you a tax break.\n  This is the first President in the history of the United States of \nAmerica who has cut taxes in the midst of a war, the very first. For \nobvious reasons, it makes no sense. If you faced a medical crisis in \nyour family, if you faced medical costs in your family that exceeded \nyour health insurance, medical costs that might wipe out your life \nsavings, would you consider it responsible at that point to put an \naddition on your home or take a luxury vacation? No, you would make the \ncommonsense, reasonable decision that in time of great need we cannot \nafford luxuries.\n  But listen to this administration and this Republican Congress: In \ntime of war, a war that costs us $3 billion a week, they are proposing \ntax cuts for the wealthiest people in America. Think of it: the debt \nthat future American generations will face because of this war is going \nto be increased by this tax cut for the wealthiest people in America. \nIt tells the whole story about their priorities.\n  So as we bring this week in the Senate to a close before the August \nrecess, I believe there is a report card which the American people \nwould like to have us address. The first part of the report card is \nthis: What are you going to do about the war in Iraq? The Democrats \ncame together--the leadership in the House and the Senate--and said to \nthe President in a letter we sent just recently that it is time to \nstart bringing American troops home. We have lost 2,573 of our best and \nbravest. They are now in a crossfire of a terrible civil war where 100 \nIraqi civilians are being killed on average every single day.\n  We have had promises over and over again that the Iraqis will stand \nup and defend their own country. Yet they have not done it, at least \nnot to the extent where any American soldier has come home. It is time \nfor that to change.\n  It is time for change in Iraq. The Republicans don't want to address \nthis issue. During the debate on the Defense authorization bill, they \noffered no amendments in terms of Iraqi policy. They rejected our \neffort to start bringing American troops home this year. They say: We \nare going to stay the bloody course in Iraq.\n  It is sad. It is time for us to assess honestly our future in Iraq.\n  The scorecard would obviously go to energy costs. As I travel around \nIllinois, and other Senators in their States, people are paying more \nfor gasoline and hardships are being created. I was in Decatur, IL, on \nSaturday and had a roundtable. People came in and talked about the \nimpact of gasoline costs on their lives and businesses. There were \nbusinesses large and small. There was a trash hauling business which \nhas a lot of big scavenger trucks on the road around Decatur talking \nabout increased costs. A woman came in from the UPS with 700 trucks \nthat she moves around downstate Illinois and talked about the increased \ndiesel costs. We had concerns, as well, from our veterans. There was a \ngroup that forms an honor guard and volunteers to perform an honor \nguard at military funerals. They travel about 1,200 miles a year to 150 \nfunerals where they present the flag and have the appropriate \nrespectful sendoff for the veteran who has died, and they are talking \nabout the increased cost of gasoline.\n  Families and businesses, large and small, farmers--they are all \ntalking about that. Yet the best we can do for an energy policy is the \nbill pending on the floor which will allow more drilling in the Gulf of \nMexico but which will come up with only a few months' worth of natural \ngas for America and a few months' worth of oil.\n  We are not addressing the larger questions--questions, for example, \nabout why we don't have CAFE standards for more fuel efficiency and \nfuel economy for the cars and trucks that we drive. This Congress, this \nRepublican-led Congress has not seriously engaged in that conversation.\n  There is no conversation about giving businesses, small businesses \nacross America and the people of this country the same basic health \ncare protection that Members of Congress have.\n  That is what the Democrats believe we should do and move forward to \ndo as quickly as possible.\n  We also believe when it comes to jobs in this country, this is an \nissue often overlooked. Our Tax Code rewards companies that send jobs \noverseas, and that has to stop. We have to have an increase in the \nminimum wage and not be held at gunpoint to say you can only have it by \ncutting the estate tax. The agenda is clear for America, but it is not \nthe agenda of the Senate. That is why this November there is an \nappetite for change and leadership, a change in direction, a \nsignificant change for a new direction in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one thing we are about to do today after \nmany objections and difficulties over the years from the Democratic \nleadership is to pass a bill that will allow offshore production of oil \nand gas. It will absolutely positively affect the pocketbooks of \nAmerican citizens.\n  This is a bipartisan effort, although as one can see from my \ncolleague and his polemic--political polemic--that he just completed, \neven the Democratic leadership is not comfortable with making progress, \nbut many of the Members are.\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\n  Before I talk about the energy bill, I want to take a moment to \nrespond.\n  He talked about the war. We had a vote on withdrawal from Iraq. It \nwas 93 to 6 against that. We voted a year later on it again and only 13 \nDemocrats voted for it then.\n  We need to have more bipartisan work to accomplish issues that are \nimportant to the American people, and we can do it. But we are being \ndriven by the politics of elections, and I don't think it is healthy \nfor us. That is the way it goes around here, unfortunately. We will \ncontinue to proceed.\n  I just want to know how the Senator comes up with this number, 700-\nsomething billion dollars of costs for the partial repeal of the death \ntax. Who knows where that number came from? The Congressional Budget \nOffice which, in my view, tends to overscore, making it higher than \nreality, said it was $260 billion over 10 years. I submit that even \nthis is a high number. I submit also that we have voted in this body--\nand it is now the law of the United States--that in 2010 the death tax \nwill be completely eliminated. It phases out and goes to zero, but if \nwe don't do something about it permanently, it will go back to 55 \npercent. Plus, if a State has another 5 percent, such as Alabama does, \nthat is 60 percent of a person's net wealth confiscated by the \nGovernment. The polls show the American people are not happy with that. \nThey don't think that is legitimate.\n  So we spend a lot of time here figuring out how to make this death \ntax law stable so that people know what they are facing and what they \nare going to have to pay and what their families will have to pay.\n  We looked at it, and we have come up now with a flat rate of 30 \npercent for estates that would qualify at that level. That would be the \nmaximum rate--not 55 but 30, a compromise that deals with this \nextraordinary confiscation of wealth by the Government of people who \nhave worked hard, have paid their taxes, made money, paid a third of it \nto the Government, saved something for their children, and then the \nGovernment comes in and takes 55, 60 percent of it.\n  We do not think that is fair. The American people do not think that \nis fair. Polling data shows they do not think that is fair. This is a \nmatter we need to fix.\n  We have this zero rate out there at 2010, about a little over 3 years \nfrom now, that we need to fix--a permanent fix. We are on the verge of \ndoing that. We will have bipartisan support for that despite the \nassistant Democratic leader's arguments against it. We need to work on \nthese things. We can and will move forward with that proposal.\n  Also, our Democratic colleagues say they wanted the minimum wage \nraised, according to the Kennedy bill, and so as a compromise we \nproposed to do that and work that out. That is where the negotiations \nare going. Hopefully we will be successful in that.\n  Mr. President, I will talk briefly about some good news, for a \nchange.\n  We have had, I have to say, Members of this body--almost entirely on \nthe other side--who have blocked energy production in our country for a \nnumber of years. It has caused the cost of living and the price of \ngasoline, natural gas, and heating oil for Americans all over this \ncountry to go up.\n  What have we seen in the 10 years I have been here? We have seen \nthis. We have seen the proposals to produce oil and gas from the vast \nAlaskan ANWR region blocked. A substantial majority of Senators have \nvoted for it, but the Democrats have been able to block it with a \nfilibuster each time.\n  We have had a long-term battle on nuclear power, and just this last \nfall that battle broke in the right direction. We have not had a \nnuclear plant for over 30 years in this country. We are burning a lot \nof natural gas to generate electricity when it could be produced for a \nfourth or a fifth of that cost by nuclear power with no air pollution. \nAlso, it wouldn't drive up the cost of natural gas for heating our \nhomes. We have had that nuclear power blocked. Finally, we passed a \nbill that gave us the opportunity for more nuclear power. We now have \n18 different preliminary requests to develop new nuclear powerplants in \nAmerica, all filed within a year of the bill's passage. The Tennessee \nValley Authority in my home State--and we have two nuclear plants in \nAlabama--tells me that nuclear power comes in at 1.2 cents per kilowatt \nhour compared to 1.8 cents for coal--that is 50 percent higher for \ncoal--and natural gas at 6 cents, five times as much. We need more \nnuclear power. Finally, under the leadership of President Bush and this \nCongress, we have moved forward in that direction. That is positive.\n  We have also passed an energy bill that enhances wind, solar, and \nethanol, and included mandates that will cause us to utilize more of \nour domestically produced biofuels--something I support.\n  I have worked with Senator Evan Bayh, Senator Joe Lieberman, Senator \nSalazar, Senator Brownback, Senator Lindsey Graham and others on this \nissue. We have a bipartisan group to treat energy production as a \nnational security issue. And we should.\n  It requires conservation. It requires efficiency. It requires \nbiofuels. It requires enhanced production.\n  Nobody suggests our demands are going down. We can do better to \ncontain the growth in demand, and we should do everything possible to \ndo that, but the world is growing economically and more people are \nutilizing energy and it is causing shortages and driving up the price.\n  So let's celebrate a little bit. We had a vote yesterday. The \nopposition to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico has broken. It was, I \nbelieve, 72 to 23 against the filibuster of this bill. So I believe we \nare heading toward passage of it, and it is a fabulous thing. We would \nbe so much better off today had we passed this legislation 5, 6, 7, or \n8 years ago. But we have had a moratorium on drilling in huge portions \nof the Gulf of Mexico. Around Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nAlabama--off our shores, pretty far out in the gulf in most cases are \nsome 4,000 producing oil and gas wells. But a few areas of the Gulf of \nMexico, with very large reserves, have been under a moratorium. We have \nbeen blocked by law from having production in those areas. As a result, \nwe have sent around the world huge amounts of American wealth, the \nwealth earned by American citizens--huge amounts of that to other \nnations, many of them not friendly to us. As a result, it has made the \nprice of gasoline and natural gas for American citizens higher. It has \nresulted in many of my constituents and others around the country \npaying $50 or $75 more a month for gasoline so they can go back and \nforth to work--money they didn't have to spend on that a year or two \nago. Prices have gone up.\n  We have ceased to expand our domestic production. We have had to buy \nit on the world market, 60 percent from foreign nations, many of those \nhostile to us politically and otherwise. It is not a good thing.\n  One of the things we need to do is to make a step in the direction of \nproducing more at home. It is overdue. I am glad my colleagues on the \nother side have moved forward.\n  Once again, we had to reach a compromise. We talked with Senator \nMartinez and Senator Nelson of Florida and they have come around to \nthis 125-mile buffer zone around Florida. That is far more than I think \nis necessary, but certainly there are strong feelings in Florida about \nit. Under all the circumstances involved, I think it is a good \ndecision. I am prepared to go forward with that. I would like to see \nmore, but this, certainly, with 8.3 million acres that could be \nproduced, will provide an opportunity for us to get out there, prove \nthese reserves exist, and have production there.\n  I want to say one thing here. I want to be clear. This is very \nimportant. It is not correct it is exactly wrong, in fact--and it must \nnever be the policy of this Senate, this Congress, or this Government \nto conduct drilling anywhere for the purposes of helping oil companies. \nThat must never be our mission. Our mission must be to study what \nis happening in our country and in our world and to take actions that \nwill help reduce the cost of energy for American citizens. That is what \nour responsibility is. That is our duty.\n\n  Congress has created laws that put a moratorium from production on \nareas where large reserves exist. I don't know what oil companies may \ndesire to produce there. Most of them out there, I understand, are \nindependent firms doing the production, but regardless, whoever \nproduces it, that is not whom I am trying to help.\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\n  If we produce more natural gas in our domestic system, we help drive \ndown the cost of natural gas. In fact, this production could have a \nlarger impact on natural gas than it is likely to have on gasoline. It \nshould really have a positive impact on both.\n  Let me show this chart. I didn't realize this originally. I met a \nbusinessman in Alabama. He has a big chemical company, an international \ncompany. He was telling me how much his natural gas costs have gone up \nand he said it is hurting him. It is putting his business in a position \nwhere they might have to close it or cut back.\n  I said, Why? Aren't other places in the world paying more?\n  He said, No.\n  I suppose that is the first time I realized that fact. You know, for \ngasoline, we pay $3 a gallon here. It is $7 or $8, or more in Europe--\nmore in Japan, I think. So I have always thought we were cheaper.\n  But look at this chart. In the United States we are now at $8.85 per \nmillion Btus of natural gas. Lots of Americans heat their homes with \nnatural gas. Lots of American electricity is generated by natural gas. \nLots of businesses utilize great amounts of natural gas in their \nchemical and other processes that they need to be successful.\n  But look at these numbers. In Trinidad it is $1.60. Bolivia is $1.65. \nEven in England--the United Kingdom, it is $7. In Belgium, $6.95; in \nRussia, $1.20; Ukraine, $2.70. In the Gulf States, it is a little over \n$1. Even in China, it is $5.05. In Japan, it is $6.05.\n  If you are a business and you make fertilizer with natural gas--we \nmake fertilizer, plastics and other things from natural gas--it is \nclear that our corporations and businesses that hire Americans are \nhaving to pay more, as are consumers of natural gas, than many areas \naround the world.\n  I say that to say this has a potentially significant positive impact \nfor our economy if we can knock down the price of natural gas. Natural \ngas goes into pipelines. It is moved by pipelines throughout our \ncountry. We have the pipeline infrastructure. We have the pipelines on \nthe coast. We have a pipeline right now that runs from Mobile, AL, \nacross the gulf to take our natural gas that we produce--that Florida \ndoes not produce--to Florida so they can generate electricity or do \nother things with it in Florida. They can have their air conditioning \nrunning and live near the beach and be comfortable.\n  Somebody has been producing it. We have been producing it on the \nwestern part of the gulf. We need to produce it further toward the \nEast.\n  Natural gas is not easily transported. Only 2 percent of our natural \ngas comes from LNG, liquefied natural gas. That gas is cooled \ntremendously, it becomes a liquid instead of a gas, it is put in a \nship, and it is brought to the United States. Then it has to be heated \nup, returned to its gaseous state, and then put in the pipeline.\n  That is what we do. We do very little of that because natural gas is \nprimarily a domestic product. So the more natural gas we can produce in \nthe gulf, the more likely we will see these prices decline. If we have \nmore nuclear power to generate our electricity with rather than natural \ngas, we could also see a decline.\n  What I am saying is that I am not here, and the people in support of \nthis bill are not here, to say we want to help energy companies.\n  We want to create a market out there that would contain the rising \ncost of gasoline and natural gas.\n  I will note that it is a good thing for me that after all these \nyears, some 40 years of production in the gulf, some 4,000 wells that \nare offshore, that for the first time the Gulf States that have been \nbearing the brunt of this effort will receive some funds from it, 37.5 \npercent--a little more than a third of the value. Two-thirds will go to \nthe Federal Government, 63 percent will go to the Federal Government \nthrough either the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which will be \nspent all over the country on environmental matters, or for the General \nTreasury.\n  I think that is a good mix. I think it is fair. It will be limited, \nhowever, to be spent in the Gulf States for things that benefit the \nenvironment and the Nation. We have people from all over the Nation who \ncome and enjoy our coast. The funds will be utilized for coastal \nprotection, mitigation in damage to fish, wildlife, and natural \nresources, implementation of federally approved marine, coastal, or \ncomprehensive conservation management plans, and mitigation of offshore \ndrilling activities through funding of offshore infrastructure \nprojects.\n  Yes, for the first time there will be some sharing with the States on \nthis offshore production, but it is not a huge amount, No. 1.\n  No. 2, the funds are to be used for conservation-type programs that \nwill benefit the entire Nation.\n  In conclusion, I believe that what we are doing now is a direct \nresponse to the cries of Americans working citizens and middle-class \nAmericans who are concerned about their high heating costs. They are \nconcerned about their high gasoline costs. They are concerned about our \nwealth being transferred overseas--$200 billion a year is what we pay \nfor oil and gas around the world. If we can produce more at home, we \ncan help contain the cost of gasoline and natural gas, and maybe even \nreduce it. We can keep that wealth right here at home. We can create \ngood, high-paying jobs here. And those citizens with those high-paying \njobs will pay taxes to the Government so that we can have money in the \nU.S. Treasury instead of spending it in Venezuela and having it go into \nHugo Chavez's treasury.\n  I am excited about it. It is historic. I thank Senator Landrieu, and \nI thank other Democrats on their side that are now coming around to \nsupport it. Senator Landrieu has been our most knowledgeable supporter \non this issue for many years.\n  I believe we are going to make it happen today. It is going to be \ngood for America. It will be a bipartisan act, and we need to do more \nof that around here.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nhis statement about the efforts we are making today to reduce the price \nof natural gas and to use the revenues to pay the bills of the Federal \nGovernment, while at the same time to spend some of those dollars for \nconservation purposes, which is a subject that the Presiding Officer, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, has advocated both as a Member of the \nHouse and while he has been in the Senate.\n  I would like to speak today to the Energy bill, the Gulf of Mexico \nEnergy Security bill. I would like to speak on three points.\n  The first is to emphasize why it is important, exactly what are we \ndoing, and why is it important to the blue-collar workers, the chemical \nworkers, the autoworkers in Tennessee and in Michigan, to people who \nare trying to pay their home cooling bills as the temperature soars \nabove 100 degrees, and to farmers who have seen their fertilizer prices \ndouble in the last several years all because of the high price of \nnatural gas.\n  Second, I would like to put this single piece of legislation into \nsome perspective and reemphasize why it is the rest of the story. Most \nof what we are doing to try to reduce the price of natural gas came \nwith the comprehensive Energy bill last summer. This finishes the job--\nnot completely. We have more to do, but this is something we should \nhave done a year ago. We couldn't command 60 votes then. We didn't have \na formula for passing it in the Senate last year, so we left it undone. \nThis finishes that part of the job.\n  Third, I would like to say a word about what I like to call the \noutdoor recreation and conservation royalty that this legislation \nestablishes to help create soccer fields and city parks with what we \ncall the State side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This Fund, \nfor 40 years, has provided modest but very important Federal dollars to \nhelp Americans enjoy our outdoor spaces.\n  First, why is this so important? We hear a lot of talk about the high \ncost of gasoline because we are reminded of it all the time when we \nfill up our tank. It is $3 a gallon, or $2.80 or $3.10. We hear it \nmight go higher. All across the country in American restaurants people \nare eating out a little less and thinking a little bit more about long \ndrives because of the high price of gasoline.\n  What if the price of the gasoline at the pump were $7 a gallon? What \ndo\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\nyou suppose the reaction would be in the United States if the price of \ngasoline at the pump were $7 a gallon? That is exactly what the \nsituation was in terms of natural gas last year. The price of natural \ngas went up to $14 a unit.\n  Testimony before the Energy Committee showed that if we translated \nthat into gasoline prices, it would be the same thing as if gasoline \nprices were $7 a gallon.\n  That is how big the hurt is. Where does the hurt apply when the price \nof natural gas is too high, when it is $14?\n  Let's start with manufacturing jobs in this country. We hear a lot of \nspeeches being made about manufacturing jobs. Let's not send them \noverseas, people say. I agree with that. We don't want them to go \noverseas. What will send them overseas in the chemical industry? There \nare 1 million blue-collar and white-collar jobs--jobs at Eastman \nChemicals in east Tennessee. I have spoken about this many times on the \nSenate floor. My uncle used to work there. For three or four \ngenerations, Eastman Chemicals has been a part of east Tennessee and \nthe Great Smokey Mountains. People came to depend on Eastman Chemicals. \nIt led to strong families, high wages, good schools, and low crime \nrate. It is hard for people to imagine what life would be like in the \nAppalachian Mountains in upper east Tennessee if Eastman had not been \nthere for three or four generations.\n  But how long is Eastman going to stay in upper east Tennessee if the \nprice of natural gas is at $14? Not long, if what it does is make \nchemicals. The chief executive of Dow Chemical testified that when the \nprice is that high, his raw material cost is 40 percent of his costs.\n  When the price, as the Senator from Alabama was saying, of natural \ngas in other parts of the world is $2, $3, $4, or $5 a unit, and it is \n$14 here, where do you suppose the new chemical plants are going to be \nbuilt? Not here, not in Tennessee, not in New Hampshire, not in Kansas, \nnot anywhere. In fact, there are about 100 new chemical plants being \nbuilt around the world today. One is being built in the United States.\n\n  There are several reasons for that, but a primary reason is the \nunpredictable and high cost of natural gas. It is $7 or $8 today per \nunit. But our economy was built on $2 natural gas. Every little \naddition to costs in the manufacturing process increases the likelihood \nthat a job, or a plant will go to Mexico or some other place. It is \nincumbent upon us to do everything we can to keep the prices down: \nFirst, to stabilize and then begin to keep the price down.\n  That is why it is important to begin with manufacturing jobs, and not \njust the chemical industry.\n  At a roundtable I had with the Farm Bureau in Tennessee, the chief \nexecutive of Saturn, the auto manufacturing plant, said to me: We have \ndone about all we can to save on costs by efficiency. The price of \nnatural gas is raising the price of our cars. If you raise the price of \ncars and the supply parts are made in the United States, where do you \nsuppose they are going to be made? They are going to be made in some \nother country where the price of natural gas is a lot less than it is \nin the United States.\n  One-third of all the manufacturing jobs in Tennessee are automotive \njobs. In Tennessee, there are not just manufacturing jobs and \nautomotive jobs but jobs in our agricultural community. The Tennessee \nFarm Bureau was helping to sponsor that natural gas roundtable because \nin every part of a production-oriented enterprise, which agriculture \nis, energy adds to cost. It especially adds to cost when we are talking \nabout the price of fertilizer.\n  As with Eastman Chemicals, natural gas is the main raw material in \nmaking fertilizer. So we can begin to see pretty quickly why it is \ndifficult for our economy, on us as families and individuals for the \nprice of gasoline at the pump to be high. I would argue that it is even \nworse for us for the price of natural gas to be too high because of the \neffect of high natural gas prices on our jobs and because of its effect \non agriculture.\n  Finally, we are today reminded, certainly in Tennessee and in \nWashington with the heat going over 100 degrees, of the cost of heating \nour home in the winter and cooling our home in the summer, which many \npeople do with natural gas.\n  The price of natural gas is tremendously important. This legislation \nopens up the most promising new area for the most rapid large amount of \nnew natural gas that is under the control of the United States to come \ninto our system: 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico where we are \nalready busy producing a lot of oil and gas, where we know what we are \ndoing.\n  There are a lot of ways to talk about it, but one is to say it is \nenough to heat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years. Will this \nby itself stabilize the price of natural gas, by itself lower the price \nof natural gas back to $3 or $4? No. But it is an important part of the \nwhole picture--a part that was left undone last year when we passed the \ncomprehensive Energy bill.\n  That is my second point. Some have said we can't drill our way out of \nthis problem of high gasoline prices and high natural gas prices. I \nthink we agree on that. Nobody is suggesting that we do so, which is \nwhy we passed the comprehensive Energy bill last year. Here is what we \ndid.\n  We started with conservation. In fact, the name of the bill probably \nshould have been the Natural Gas Price Reduction Act of 2005 because \nthat is the way we began to think about it. We were looking for ways to \nproduce large amounts of clean, low-carbon, or carbon-free energy.\n  The United States of America uses 25 percent of all the energy in the \nworld. We are not on some desert island. We need a lot of energy. We \nincreasingly understand that it has to be reliable energy. And we \nincreasingly understand it has to be less expensive energy. Now we \nunderstand it has to be clean energy.\n  In the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in east Tennessee where I \nlive, we have too much sulfur, too much nitrogen, too much mercury in \nthe air. That produces asthma, that produces particulate matters which \nharms our health. The Smokies has become the most polluted national \npark in the country. So clean air is important.\n  A great many people are concerned about global warming--a majority of \nthis Senate is. That is why we in our bill said let's have more carbon-\nfree, low-carbon energy.\n  What did we say?\n  First, we had major incentives for conservation and efficiency. \nConservation is the place to start in any effort to have large amounts \nof reliable, low-cost, carbon-free energy.\n  Second, nuclear power. There is a renaissance of nuclear power in \nthis country. Hopefully, it will continue. Nuclear power not only \nproduces 20 percent of all of our electricity, it is 70 percent of our \ncarbon-free electricity.\n  If you care about global warming, for example, it is not enough just \nto care about it--we need to do something about it. The two ways to do \nsomething about it are conservation and nuclear power--at least in the \nnext generation.\n  Third, we had major incentives in the Energy bill last year for clean \ncoal. Many people prefer that as a strategy because it doesn't run into \nsome of the problems in waste disposal and the possibility of nuclear \nproliferation that nuclear power might.\n  But there are significant problems with clean coal. One is it is \ndirty. Even clean coal production is dirtier than nuclear power.\n  Finally, we don't know exactly what to do with all of that carbon we \nproduce.\n  We have some inventing to do in order to sequester and recapture the \ncarbon and perhaps bury it.\n  Because we wanted to get on with natural gas price reduction, we also \nmade it easier to bring in natural gas from other places in the world--\nfreeze it, bring it in, unfreeze it, put it in terminals, and put it \nback into our pipelines.\n  That is an elaborate process. But for the next 5 or 10 years, we are \ngoing to have to rely on that.\n  We did some things to make it easier for refineries to operate. There \nare a variety of other things we did. Last year, we did conservation, \nnuclear power, clean coal, liquefied natural gas--a number of other \nthings. But the one thing we didn't do enough about was more natural \ngas supply. We are not going to drill our way out of this problem. We \nare trying to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lower the price \nof natural gas in a variety of ways.\n  In this transition period, it helps to take the most obvious area of \nsupply\n\n[[Page S8489]]\n\nand take it and do something with it, which is what we are doing here.\n  My second point is we have to finish the job that we started last \nyear. I suspect--I know--there is much more to do. We should be more \naggressive with conservation and efficiency, more aggressive in support \nof nuclear power, more aggressive in research for clean coal. I would \nlike to see us accelerate our efforts for hydrogen fuel cell production \nand give more incentives for fuel-efficient cars as a way of dealing \nwith reducing our supply of oil on the transportation side. Here we are \ndoing what we need to do to finish the job.\n\n  Finally, I will say a word about where the money goes. Before the \nmoney goes into the Federal Treasury, it first goes into two important \nroyalties. Royalties are not a new concept. Land owners get royalties \nwhen someone finds oil or gas. Then the money goes to the production \ncompany or to the State or the Federal Government. The idea of State \nroyalties is not a new concept. If you are drilling for oil in Wyoming, \nthe first 50 cents of a dollar goes to the State for various purposes. \nIf you are drilling in Alaska, 90 cents goes to Alaska and the other 10 \ncents to the Federal Government.\n  Senator Domenici and the Framers of this piece of legislation wisely \nsaid the first 50 cents of the money we get from this deep sea \nexploration will go to the States. States along the gulf coast get the \nbulk of it, 37\\1/2\\ percent for wetlands, coastal renewal, and \nconservation purposes, and the other 12\\1/2\\ percent goes to the State \nside of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund was created by the Outdoor \nRecreation Resources Review Commission. It was recommended in 1958. It \nwas called the Rockefeller Commission, headed by Laurance Rockefeller. \nCongress enacted it in 1965. The idea was very simple. When we spend an \nasset, we create another asset.\n  In 1977, Congress authorized that one of the sources of funding for \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund would be receipts from the Outer \nContinental Shelf mineral lease--in other words, the kind of revenues \nfrom the oil and gas drilling we are authorizing today. Congress has \nauthorized in the law that we spend $450 million a year on the State \nside. It goes to States for city parks, soccer fields. The amount of \nmoney has gone up and down over time, so in 1985 and 1986 President \nReagan's Commission on Americans Outdoors, which he asked me to chair, \nand I did, recommended we make some of that money permanent. So for the \nfirst time in 40 years, this legislation does just that: 12\\1/2\\ \npercent of the revenues go for the State side of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  Exactly what are we talking about? Since 1964, the State side has \ncreated improved parks and forests in all 50 States, helped to create \nmore than 40,000 athletic and playing fields, 12,000 hiking trails, \n20,000 family picnic locations, 5,000 campgrounds, 10,000 swimming and \nboating facilities, and 600 hunting and nature areas.\n  In Tennessee, since 1965, our State has received 170 Land and Water \nConservation Fund grants totaling $67 million in Federal dollars. It \nhas been vital to stretch local matching dollars to fund the \nacquisition of parks, ballfields, trails, and playgrounds across \nTennessee.\n  The funding has been modest. The new funding in this bill is modest, \nbut it is important. It will grow over time. It has been recognized by \nthose who have worked for a long time to support the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  I have a letter from Patrick Noonan and Henry Diamond. Mr. Noonan is \nthe founder of the Conservation Fund and is chairman emeritus. Henry \nDiamond is the former commissioner of New York Parks and Environment \nand was involved in the writing of the original Land and Water \nConservation Fund in 1962. They say:\n\n       If the precedent of a conservation royalty can be \n     established, it would be an important first step in the right \n     direction, one that we have spent 40 years attempting to \n     achieve.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nMr. Noonan and Mr. Diamond, written in their individual capacities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    July 21, 2006.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington. DC.\n     Hon. Ken Salazar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Alexander and Salazar: We are writing to \n     express our strong support for the concept of permanent \n     federal funding for the state side of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund. If the precedent of a conservation royalty \n     can be established, it would be an important first step in \n     the right direction, one that we have spent 40 years \n     attempting to achieve.\n       We and others have long advocated the principle that some \n     of the funds from offshore oil and gas drilling should become \n     in effect a royalty for conservation and outdoor recreation, \n     providing a reliable and permanent stream of funding for the \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund. This basic concept was put \n     forward by the Rockefeller Commission to President Kennedy \n     and the Congress in 1962 and was also a primary \n     recommendation of President Reagan's Commission on Americans \n     Outdoors in 1986. Unfortunately, during the last 40 years, \n     the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been subjected to \n     the unreliable annual appropriations process. During recent \n     years, those appropriations have averaged less than $100 \n     million for the state side of the Land and Water Conservation \n     Fund and this the Administration recommended zero.\n       Our goal is full funding for both the federal and state \n     side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, each of which \n     is authorized at $450 million per year. At a minimum, we \n     believe there should be $125 million a year available for the \n     state side now and $450 million no later than 2017.\n\n     Sincerely,\n\n     Patrick F. Noonan.\n     Henry L. Diamond.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I salute Senator Domenici, Senator \nSessions, Senator Landrieu, Senator Vitter, Senator Martinez, and many \nothers who have worked hard on this piece of legislation.\n  Two years ago, the idea of giving additional authority for offshore \ndrilling for oil and gas was an unmentionable subject around here. No \none would bring it up in polite conversation.\n  Last year, with the price of natural gas reaching $14 a unit, we had \nabout 50 Senators who would support it, but that wasn't 60. Yesterday, \nI believe we had more than 70 on the cloture vote.\n  We recognize there are environmentally sound ways to go a long way \noffshore, as we are here, where we cannot see it from the shore, and \nlook for oil and gas. We have learned to do that in a way that is so \nsafe that less oil and gas seeps into the ocean from that process than \ncomes from natural seepage out of the ground. We have learned to do \nthat and to do that well.\n  We have also come a long way in recognizing that it is good policy to \nsay if we are going to spend an asset--and by that I mean create an \nenvironmental burden--drilling for oil and gas, we ought to create an \nasset and spend some of the money for wetlands in the more affected \nStates and through the State side of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund in all of the other States.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It helps blue-collar \nworkers. It helps farmers. It helps homeowners who are paying \nskyrocketing bills to deal with 100-degree heat. It helps reduce our \nreliance on parts of the world such as the Middle East where we should \nnot be importing as much oil and gas, and it establishes for the first \ntime good clear policy about how and when we take initial steps of \noffshore drilling. We not only should do it in an environmentally sound \nway, but we should use some of the revenue to create other conservation \nand outdoor recreational assets.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we heard debate start this morning on \npermanently cutting the estate tax. I heard some of my colleagues again \nthis morning refer to it as the death tax.\n  There is no death tax in America. We have no tax that applies at \ndeath. We do have an estate tax. We have a tax on wealthy accumulations \nthat occur in families. That tax does not affect an individual unless \nthey have at least $2 million. For a couple, that would be $4 million \nbefore they face any estate tax.\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\n  Of course, my colleagues know there are many ways you can further \nreduce the taxes that apply to wealthy estates. But the first thing we \nought to say clearly and directly to the American people is, there is \nno death tax. There is no tax that applies at death. None.\n  One of the most interesting stories I have heard was a colleague of \nmine who was at the airport. A baggage handler said to him: My God, you \nhave to get rid of that death tax. That is going to affect my family.\n  And my colleague said to him: Unless you have at least $4 million as \na family, you do not have to worry about any death tax because there is \nno death tax.\n  This baggage handler was completely shocked to hear there was no \ndeath tax. He has heard over and over and over there is a death tax. He \nbelieved it. Everyone in this Senate knows there is no death tax.\n  What is most extraordinary about the proposal before this Senate is \nthe context in which it occurs. Our country is deep in debt--deep in \ndebt. Now our friends on the other side, their idea in the last week we \nare in session for the next month is to come out here and put us deeper \nin debt. Dig the hole deeper and deeper and deeper. What an \nextraordinary proposal that is.\n  And for what purpose? To help the struggling middle class? No, no, \nthey are out of this. This is not even the upper class. This is the \nwealthiest among us. That is who this is designed to help.\n  Here is our current circumstance. The deficit last year was $318 \nbillion. The deficit for this year is now projected to be just under \n$300 billion, some modest improvement in the deficit.\n  But that completely misses the point because at the same time the \ndeficit is showing some modest improvement, the increase in the debt is \ngetting much worse. Last year, the debt increased by $551 billion. This \nyear, we now project the debt will increase by almost $600 billion.\n  Someone out there listening might say: How can that be? How can it be \nthe Senator is saying the deficit is less than $300 billion, but the \ndebt is going to increase by almost $600 billion? How can that be?\n  That is largely because under the President's plan, they are also \ntaking hundreds of billions from Social Security to use to pay other \nbills. All of it gets added to the debt. None of it gets counted for \nthe deficit.\n  This chart shows the deficit for 2006 just under $300 billion. Here \nis the amount added to the debt--almost $600 billion. And you can see \nthe biggest difference between the deficit and the increase in the debt \nis the amount of Social Security money that is being taken to be used \nfor other purposes: $177 billion in this 1 year alone, Social Security \nmoney taken to pay other bills. And, of course, it all gets added to \nthe debt. None of it gets counted to the deficit.\n\n  When one looks at what is happening to the debt, here is what one \nsees: We are building a wall of debt that is extraordinary. At the end \nof this President's first year in office, the debt was $5.8 trillion. \nWe do not hold him responsible for the first year. But at the end of \nthis year, the debt will have climbed to $8.5 trillion. And if the \nPresident's plan is put in place, for the next 5 years, the debt will \ngo over $11.5 trillion.\n  The debt under this President has taken off like a scalded cat, and \nat the worst possible time. The debt is increasing before the baby boom \ngeneration retires.\n  What are the implications of this rapidly rising debt? Well, one of \nthem is that increasingly we are borrowing this money from abroad. \nIncreasingly, we are going, hat in hand, all around the world borrowing \nmoney. This chart shows that it took 42 Presidents--all the Presidents \npictured here--224 years to run up $1 trillion of debt held abroad. \nThis President has more than doubled that amount in just 5 years. That \nis a completely unsustainable course. You go back to President Clinton, \nyou go back to the previous President Bush, you go back to President \nReagan, President Carter, President Lyndon Johnson, and all the other \nPresidents--224 years of American history--they ran up $1 trillion of \nexternal debt. This President, in just 5 years, has run up more than $1 \ntrillion of U.S. debt held abroad.\n  So what we see are these countries to which we now owe money. We owe \nJapan $638 billion. We owe China $326 billion. We owe the United \nKingdom almost $200 billion. We owe the oil exporters over $100 \nbillion. My favorite down here, the Caribbean banking centers, we owe \nthem over $60 billion. Mexico now is on the top 10 list of countries \nthat we owe money. We owe Mexico $43 billion.\n  I asked my staff the other day: What do we see in terms of our \nborrowing compared to other nations borrowing? Sometimes that is a good \nway to get a sense of where we stand. They came back with this answer. \nIt is not their numbers; it is the International Monetary Fund. It \nshows the percent of world borrowing by country. These are the world's \nbiggest borrowers. And who is No. 1? Our country. We borrowed over 65 \npercent of the money that was borrowed by countries last year--65 \npercent borrowed by our country. Turkey borrowed about 2 percent. I see \nthe United Kingdom borrowed about 4 percent. Spain was the next biggest \nafter the United States. We borrowed 65 percent of all the money that \nwas borrowed by countries last year. The next biggest was Spain at 6.8 \npercent; then the United Kingdom at just under 4 percent; then \nAustralia, just over 3 percent; France, under 3 percent; Italy, just \nover 2 percent; Turkey, just under 2 percent. The United States, 65 \npercent.\n  With all of this occurring, with the deficit skyrocketing--that is by \nhistorical comparison; yes, it improved somewhat over last year, but \nthese are the biggest deficits our country has ever run--and the debt \ntaking off like a scalded cat, what do our colleagues do in the last \nweek before we break for a month? They come out here and propose to \nvirtually eliminate the tax on wealthy estates. Now, there is an idea \nwhose time has come. While we cannot pay our bills now, while we are \nborrowing money from Japan and China, their answer is: Let's go give an \nenormous tax break to the wealthiest among us. And where will we get \nthe money to fill in the gap because we cannot pay our bills now? Let's \ngo borrow some more money from Japan and China. Let's go borrow some \nmore money from Japan and China. You would think you were in a movie--\nnot even a very good movie--that somebody had dreamt up if you were to \ndescribe what is going on here.\n  Our country is the biggest debtor nation in the world. Our colleagues \nhave cut the revenue, cut the revenue, cut the revenue, increased the \nspending, increased the spending, increased the spending; and now their \nanswer is: Let's cut the revenues some more, and let's cut it on the \nwealthiest of the wealthy, the top three-tenths of 1 percent of the \nestates in this country, because they are the only ones who are paying \nthe estate tax now.\n  Our friends say: Oh, no, my goodness, let's cut them some more. Let's \ncut them some more. The wealthiest among us have already gotten the \ngreatest benefit of the tax cuts that have been enacted--by far. Now \nthey say: Let's cut their taxes some more and borrow the money from \nChina and Japan. This is a farce--a farce--which is occurring here. And \nit is a disaster for the economic strength of our country.\n  Here is what the size of estates has to be before they pay any tax. \nWe are in 2006. These are the estate tax exemption levels under current \nlaw for a couple. Couples have to have $4 million before they pay a \npenny of estate tax--$4 million, not of gross assets, of net assets. \nThey have to have $4 million free and clear before they pay a dime. And \nin 2009, that will go up to $7 million.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle say: Whoa, that is not \nnearly enough. Let's jack this thing up dramatically. Let's lower the \nrates. Let's increase the exemptions. And let's borrow the money from \nChina and Japan. Now, there is a format to strengthen America.\n  The number of taxable estates is already falling very dramatically \nunder current law. In 2000, there were 50,000 taxable estates in the \nwhole country. This year, there will be 13,000 in the whole country.\n  Now, people say there is a death tax. There is no death tax. There is \nno tax that attaches to anybody at death in this country. The estate \ntax applies to\n\n[[Page S8491]]\n\npeople who have accumulated wealth. Good for them. I am glad for their \nsuccess. But does a further tax cut on multi-million dollar estates \nmake any sense for our country? Does it make any sense at all when we \ncannot pay our bills now that we would go out and dramatically cut \ntaxes on the very wealthiest among us who already have tax cut after \ntax cut after tax cut--let's give them one more--when we have to borrow \nthe money from China and Japan?\n\n  In 2009, the estimates are that there will only be 7,000 estates \ntaxable in the whole country. In 2009, only two-tenths of 1 percent of \nestates will be subject to tax. That is under current law. Under \ncurrent law, 99.8 percent of estates will not pay a penny of tax--99.8 \npercent. Our colleagues say: That is not good enough. Let's cut it some \nmore. Even though we cannot pay our bills now, let's give another big \ntax cut to the wealthiest among us and go borrow the money from Japan \nand China and Great Britain and the oil exporting countries--because \nthe money is gone. The money is gone. There are no surpluses here. We \ncannot pay our bills. We are borrowing 65 percent of the money that is \nbeing borrowed in the world today by countries. We are borrowing 65 \npercent of it.\n  This is insanity. This is irresponsible. This is reckless. And not \njust a little bit reckless, this is totally reckless. Now our friends \ncome with a proposal to virtually eliminate the estate tax. Full repeal \nfrom 2012 to 2021 would cost just over $1 trillion. This proposal costs \n$753 billion from 2012 to 2021.\n  Now, our friends on the other side say: Hey, Social Security is short \n$4 trillion. They say: Medicare is short $29 trillion. And they are not \ndoing anything about that. What they are doing is digging the hole \ndeeper. Let's get rid of another $750 billion we do not have--that we \nhave to borrow from Japan and China and all the other countries in the \nworld, even Mexico, because we now owe Mexico $43 billion--let's do \nthat so we can cut the taxes on the very wealthiest among us.\n  What earthly sense does this make? I will tell you for whom it makes \nsense. It makes sense for--as this article in the New York Times on \nJune 7 says, it is ``A boon for the richest in estate tax repeal.'' \nOver the last decades, 18 of the wealthiest families in the country \nhave spent more than $200 million lobbying to repeal the estate tax. \nEighteen families have put up $200 million to repeal the estate tax. \nHow happy they must be on this day. How happy they must be. The wealthy \nfamilies include the Mars candy family; the Gallo wine family; the \nWegman supermarket family; the Dorrance family, which controls \nCampbell's Soup; and the Waltons, who control Wal-Mart.\n  I applaud people who have been successful, but people who have been \nsuccessful have succeeded not only because of their own hard work and \ncreative approach to solving problems; no, in part they have succeeded \nbecause they are part of this country. How incredibly fortunate we all \nare to be born in America.\n  Many very wealthy people I know believe they have an obligation to \ngive back. We just saw an extraordinary example of that with Warren \nBuffett. Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest man in America, worth \nsome $40 billion, just decided to give virtually all of his wealth to \nBill Gates's foundation, who is the wealthiest person in the country, \nin order to do good works, in order to give back, in order to make a \ndifference for others.\n  What is being said here on the floor of the Senate? No, that should \nnot be the test--giving back, helping others, making a difference to \nimprove this world, understanding that part of each of our success is \nbecause we had the good fortune to be born in America. This proposal is \nall about me, all about me. I have it. I am keeping it. I am not giving \nit away. What is the result? Well, our country will have to go borrow \nmore tens of billions and hundreds of billions of dollars from Japan \nand China and Great Britain and the oil exporting countries, and even \nMexico. That is what is going to happen. Or our friends on the other \nside will, at some point, just shred Social Security and Medicare. That \nis where this is all headed. Make no mistake. That is where this is all \nheaded because America cannot pay its bills now.\n  Hurricane Katrina put the estate tax repeal in some perspective.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee said this:\n\n       It's a little unseemly to be talking about eliminating the \n     estate tax at a time when people are suffering.\n\n  He said that last year. People are suffering this year as well, \nsuffering the aftermath of Katrina--I have been with families suffering \nfrom losses in Iraq and Afghanistan--but also suffering because our \ncountry is in deep trouble. Our country is living on the credit card. \nOur country is borrowing money at a rate unprecedented in our history. \nWe are borrowing 65 percent of all the money that was borrowed by \ncountries of the world last year, our country. And who did we borrow it \nfrom? It used to be when we ran deficits we borrowed the money from \nourselves. We issued bonds and Americans bought them. It has all \nchanged because now more than half of the bonds that we sell are going \nto foreigners. Every time we have another month where we spend more \nthan we take in, we have to borrow more money. Over half of it now we \nare borrowing from Japan, China, Great Britain, the oil exporting \ncountries, and the Caribbean banking centers. What sense does this \nmake?\n  Now we are told: Do you know what we should do? Here is a good idea. \nJust before we take a break for the month, let's go out and dig the \nhole deeper. Let's go out and have a plan that will reduce taxes on the \nwealthiest among us by $753 billion for a 10-year period--not million, \n$753 billion--and put that on the charge card. Boy, we will have a real \nparty in August.\n  The cost of the proposal before us absolutely explodes, because they \nhave a clever device called a phase-in that hides the long-term cost. \nIt is not in full effect until 2015, and then the cost goes up like a \nscalded cat, as this chart depicts. The cost between 2012 and 2021 is \nabout $600 billion plus an additional $154 billion of interest cost, \nbecause, after all, where is the money coming from? Is it coming out of \nthe Treasury of the United States? No, it is all going to have to be \nborrowed. And who are we borrowing from? Increasingly, we are borrowing \nfrom abroad.\n  And what is going to happen? Some in this town say deficits don't \nmatter. Go ask the Germans about that. Ask the Germans what happened \nafter World War I when they were on a course like this, borrowing, \nborrowing, borrowing, increasingly borrowing from abroad. How did they \ntry to get out of it? They inflated their currency until the German \nmark was virtually worthless. If you wanted to buy a pair of shoes, you \nhad to fill up a wheelbarrow with German marks and go to the store \nbecause the currency had so little value. That is one way out. It is a \ndisastrous way out, but many countries have tried it.\n  The other way out is, you have to cut spending and raise taxes. That \nis tough. That is hardly popular politically, go out and tell people: \nGee, none of this adds up. We have been spending money we don't have in \nyour name. It is your debt. The President likes to say it is the \npeople's money. He is exactly right, it is the people's money. It is \nalso the people's debt. This debt is being run up in the people's name. \nThis debt is owed and is going to have to be paid.\n  The cost of the House proposal, if you compare it with the cost of \nextending the middle-class tax cuts, is very interesting. Over the \nfirst 10 years of this proposal, it costs $268 billion; from 2012 to \n2021, it costs $753 billion. But in just the first years, it dwarfs the \ncost to extend the child tax credit. That would cost $183 billion. It \ndwarfs the money to extend the marriage penalty; that would cost $46 \nbillion. It totally overwhelms the cost to extend the college tuition \ndeduction; over that period that would cost $19 billion. Those are tax \nreductions and tax relief that do benefit the middle class. This is one \nof the most irresponsible proposals to come before the body in the 20 \nyears I have been here. It is completely and totally irresponsible.\n\n  I was a conferee on the conference committee to deal with the issue \nof pensions. Last Thursday the conferees were to meet at 6 o'clock. We \nwere there. House Republicans did not appear. They asked us to come \nback 2 hours later. They needed some more time. We came back at 8. They \nstill did not appear. At that time they apparently made the decision to \nforget about\n\n[[Page S8492]]\n\nthe conference committee. The conference committee worked since March \nof this year in good faith to deal with the pension crisis, and they \nadded to that package the so-called extenders, those tax provisions \nthat are about to expire that are critically important to the country. \nWe were prepared to pass that package. The leaders from the conference \non the other side decided, no, they didn't want to have that discussion \nin the public. Instead they didn't appear, and they hatched this other \nplan to have a pension bill come out of the House freestanding and this \nother package that includes elimination of the estate tax and an \nincrease in the minimum wage for some States.\n  I was with the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, who informed \nme in her State the so-called minimum wage increase will actually \nreduce the minimum wage for millions of workers because of its \nprovisions. They put together the Abandoned Mine Lands Act in this \npackage in order to try to get the support of Members here, and they \nhave wrapped it all in a big package to try to get this body to do \nsomething that makes absolutely no sense for the fiscal future of this \ncountry. That is, without question, the most irresponsible package I \nhave seen offered here in my 20 years in the Senate. It is not just a \nlittle bit irresponsible; it is wildly irresponsible. This is reckless, \nthe course this country is being taken on, utterly reckless.\n  Why do I say that? Because sometimes you wonder if anybody is paying \nattention. Here is what is happening to the debt of our Nation: $5.8 \ntrillion in 2001; $8.5 trillion at the end of this year. If the budget \nthe President proposed is followed, the debt will rise to $11.5 \ntrillion in 2011. If this proposal is adopted, it will be even worse. \nFrom 2012 to 2021, this proposal that is before the body will take \nanother $750 billion and add that to the amount this country will have \nto borrow. It is unbelievable.\n  This President has taken us on a reckless course. Forty-two \nPresidents took 224 years to run up a trillion dollars of our debt held \nabroad. This President has more than doubled that amount in only 5 \nyears.\n  So what is before the body now? A plan to go out and put another $750 \nbillion on the charge card, because this money has to be made up from \nsomewhere. We can't pay our bills now. If you reduce the revenue that \nis scheduled to come in, the debt goes up. You have to have more \nborrowing, more going to the Chinese, more going to the Japanese, and \nasking them for more money. How are we going to pay it back?\n  Our friends say this is a tax cut. I don't think so. I think what \nthis is an enormous tax shift. Because at some point we are going to \nhave to start paying our bills. And when we do, I have a feeling I know \nwhat they are going to do. They are going to come out here and they are \ngoing to say: All of us have to contribute. All of us have to \nparticipate. We are going to have to cut spending. We are going to have \nto raise revenue.\n  I can see their proposal now. They will be coming right at the \nmiddle-class people who are the bulwark of this economy. They will \neither cut programs that are important to them, such as Social Security \nand Medicare, or they will raise taxes on them, all so that we could \ngive a big reduction to the very wealthiest among us, the people who \nhave benefitted most from the genius of the American economy.\n  Many of the wealthiest people I know say: Don't do it in my name. \nDon't do that in my name. I don't need another tax cut. I do need a \ncountry that pays its bills. I do need a country that isn't borrowing \nmore and more money from China and Japan and Great Britain and Mexico.\n  I can't think of a more consequential fiscal decision that will be \nmade than this one. Are we going to keep digging the hole deeper and \ndeeper? Or are we going to head in a new direction and get serious \nabout getting America back on track?\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in response to my friend from North Dakota, I \nwould note that the difference between the position he articulates--and \nit is a position a lot of people in Washington hold--and the position \nthat a lot of the rest of us hold is between those who worry a lot \nabout how much money the Government has versus those of us who think it \nis a better idea to let people keep more of what they earn, that they \nare probably in a better position to make good judgments about how that \nmoney should be spent, and especially when it comes to their death and \ntheir loved ones who have to face the difficult choice of deciding how \nto pay the death tax that, unless something is done, is going to go up \nto effectively 60 percent. Can anybody imagine a 60-percent tax rate? \nIt is actually on the books at 55 percent, but because of the way the \nCode works, it can be as much as 60 percent. Can you imagine a 55-\npercent or 60-percent tax rate? You cannot pay it unless you sell the \nfarm or sell the business. I know people to whom that has applied. So \nit is a difference between those who worry how much money Washington \nhas and those of us who are concerned about people keeping more of what \nthey earn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8492-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I note that the next Democratic speaker \nafter me will be Senator Harkin, and the next Democratic speaker after \nSenator Harkin will be Senator Schumer.\n  We are now in the final days and hours of this session of Congress. \nOne of the bills that is circling, waiting for a place to land is the \npension bill. We now know the pension bill has been passed by the \nHouse, and it is waiting to be taken up in the Senate, but we don't \nknow when it is going to be taken up. It all depends on what we do \nabout the estate tax.\n  The pension bill--the bipartisan pension bill--must not become a pawn \nin the debate over other unrelated issues. This bill needs to pass, and \nit needs to pass this week. There is only one reason it is being held \nup: politics, politics, politics.\n  The pension bill is being used as a pawn for reckless tax breaks for \na few when the pension bill will help the many. We need to move this \npension bill. I urge the Republican leadership to bring up the bill \nthis week and to bring it up before any tax bill. The American people \nneed it. We need to protect the pensions of millions of Americans, we \nneed to provide relief and certainty to good-guy businesses, and we \nneed to protect the taxpayers from having billions of dollars dumped on \nthe Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation. Promises made should be \npromises kept.\n  America's pension system is in crisis. There are companies that are \ndeclaring bankruptcy and then dumping their pension plans on the \ntaxpayers. We have the legislative framework to deal with this.\n  We have had terrible problems. Bethlehem Steel didn't honor their \nbooks and declared bankruptcy. They dumped the pensions of 100,000 \nworkers and retirees on the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation. \nUnited Airlines declared bankruptcy in 2002 and dumped the pensions of \n122,000 workers on the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation.\n  One might say: What will this bill do? It will help to make sure that \nhistory does not repeat itself. I have been fighting alongside my \ncolleagues for a long time to enact comprehensive, bipartisan reform. \nSenator DeWine and I held hearings over a year ago. The Senate passed \nits bill 7\\1/2\\ months ago. There was a HELP Committee bill and a \nFinance Committee bill.\n  When we were waiting to pass the bill, Senator DeWine and I had a \nhold on it because we were concerned that it would place at risk \ncertain come-back companies that were working their way out of \nbankruptcy and would force their pensions into junk bond status.\n\n[[Page S8493]]\n\nWe had the assurances of our colleagues, Senators Grassley and Baucus \nfrom the Finance Committee, saying: Lift your hold. We need to pass the \npension bill. We will work with you.\n  So Senator DeWine and I trusted Senators Baucus and Grassley, and we \ndid work it out. We were able to agree within the Senate on a \nbipartisan framework. Then we took it to the House conferees. It was a \nrocking-and-rolling conference but, again, we were able to get it done.\n  Now, why can't we get the bill done in the Senate? We worked it out \nin conference, and it passed the House. Why can't it pass the Senate? \nIt needs to pass the Senate by Thursday or Friday. Now is the time to \npass the bill.\n  The Republican leadership has decided that protecting a few \nzillionaires' estates after they die is more important than protecting \npensions for retirees while they are still alive. Let's get our \npriorities straight. We are not only talking about the retirees who \ndepend on us, we have workers right now in airlines who are wondering \nwhat is going to happen to them. What do you say to somebody who is \nworking for an airline who might lose his pension? Think about that \nmechanic. Think about what he is concerned about.\n  What about the stewardesses, the brave people we saluted on flight \n93? The last thing we can do is honor their memory and have a pension \nbill for those who fly every single day.\n  What about the people who are working right now who are concerned \nthat the rules of the game will be shifted on them? Our pension bill--\nour bipartisan pension bill--will protect them.\n  We really have to pass this bill. I urge the Republican leader to \nbring up the pension bill after we dispose of this coastal drilling \nissue. As I said, the time for delay is over, the time for politics is \nover, and it is time for us to take up and pass the pension bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support S. 3711, the \nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, and I also rise to put its \nprovisions in perspective and to dispel some of the myths and simple \ninaccuracies that, unfortunately, have been propagated in many places, \nincluding on the Senate floor.\n  It is important to understand what this important Energy bill does \nbecause it does do significant and important things, and it is also \nimportant to understand what this bill does not do because it does not \ndo several things that opponents have claimed. So let's go down these \ntwo simple lists.\n  This Energy Security Act does many important things. It brings new \nsources of domestic energy to the market over the next few years. All \nof us should agree that is a very important and necessary component of \nsecuring our energy future--not the only component, not the only thing \nwe must do but a very important component of what we must do.\n  This bill generates new revenue for the U.S. Treasury. There has been \nenormous misinformation about that. There have been claims that the \nproducing States are somehow raiding the Federal Treasury. What the \nStates are doing is producing more Federal revenue for the Federal \nTreasury. If that is a raid, let the raids begin, and we will soon \nerase the deficit.\n  This bill promotes parity with nearly 90 years of onshore energy \nproduction policy by recognizing the importance of reinvesting in our \noffshore energy-producing areas to ensure the sustainability and \nliability of domestic energy production and independence.\n\n  For decades and decades, producing States onshore, on Federal land, \nhave shared 50 percent of the royalty produced on those Federal lands. \nThis begins to achieve some parity with that by allowing coastal \nproducing States 37.5 percent.\n  This provides dedicated revenue streams for the State side of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. That fund makes grants available to \nall of our States for 50 percent of the costs of parks, soccer fields, \nand other recreational opportunities.\n  This fully complies with the budget resolution we passed last year \nand the reserve fund amendment I included in the Senate's budget \nresolution this year, and it all reduces America's dependence on \nvolatile foreign energy sources.\n  Those are all very important goals. Those are all goals achieved by \nthis bill.\n  Just as importantly, there are many things this bill does not do \nwhich opponents have confused in the debate.\n  This bill does not in any way affect offshore California, the west \ncoast, the Northeast, or anywhere on the east coast. This bill is \nfocused on the Gulf of Mexico and has the support of the Senators from \nall of those Gulf Coast States.\n  This bill does not change offshore policy in any area other than the \nGulf of Mexico, which today provides up to 30 percent of our energy.\n  This bill does not raid the Federal Treasury of funds from current \nrevenue streams. It does not increase the deficit. As I said, what this \nbill does is the opposite. It allows production activity which would \nnot occur otherwise. What does that mean? That means increased Federal \nrevenue--$1 billion toward deficit reduction--not decreased Federal \nrevenue.\n  This bill does not provide funds for the expansion of Federal land \nacquisition programs through the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  I find, quite frankly, the opposition to this bill enormously \nfrustrating. So many of these same Members of the Senate--others in the \nbroader debate--are some of the loudest voices about high, increasing \nenergy prices, oil prices at the pump, natural gas prices and what that \ndoes to our competitiveness. I agree with those concerns. Those are \nvery legitimate concerns. Yet we bring a bill to the floor of the \nSenate that can absolutely have a short-term impact, a positive impact, \nbringing prices down, and, no, they have to oppose it. That is not \ngood. That cannot be part of the solution.\n  The cost of natural gas has increased 400 percent over the last \nseveral years. Natural gas is a mostly continental commodity. Its \nimportation through LNG is possible, but that alone cannot have enough \nof an impact to bring down prices the way we want to see them come \ndown. So we need to produce more domestically. This bill will do that \nand help bring down natural gas prices.\n  Gasoline prices have increased from $1.28 in 1996 to over $3.60 in \nsome areas of the country today. Of course, these surges were \nexacerbated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  These huge spikes don't impact us just at the gas pump or when we pay \nour heating and cooling bill. They affect us everywhere--at the grocery \nstore, when we buy clothes, at the hardware store, the airlines when we \ngo on trips, restaurants when they pay higher energy bills, and also in \nthe job picture. When we decry jobs moving overseas, high natural gas \nprices in this country are a huge factor, particularly in select \nindustries such as our chemical industry.\n  Yet, again, the folks who run to the floor of the Senate to beat on \nthese issues and try to take advantage of them politically the most are \namong those who are opposing this bill. It makes no sense to me, and it \nis enormously frustrating to me.\n  They also seem to be opposed to this bill because they are just \nopposed on virtual religious grounds on more oil and gas production.\n  We need to do a lot of things to secure our energy future, and \ncertainly that involves research and new technology and new forms of \nenergy. But as we do that--and we are doing that, and we will do more, \nand we must do more--as we do that, the fact is, for the next several \nyears and several decades we will have an economy in some ways \ndominated by oil and gas.\n  So if we want to give consumers relief, if we want to secure our \nenergy independence in the short term, we also at the same time need to \nattack that side of the question, and this bill does that, domestically \nincreasing our independence.\n  It is just completely irresponsible for people to say we can't \naddress that side of the equation. We must, as we must address the \nlonger-term side of the equation, with new technology, new sources of \nenergy, new science and engineering. Those both have to be necessary \ncomponents of a solution.\n  I would have a little more sympathy with some of these arguments if \nSenators from many of these other States,\n\n[[Page S8494]]\n\nnot in the directly affected region in the gulf, were producing at \nleast other forms of energy. They don't like oil? They don't like \nnatural gas? There are other things folks in different parts of the \ncountry can do. There is nuclear. There is solar. There is windpower. \nThe fact is, so many of the critics from these other places do not \ncontribute to the Nation's energy needs in any of these categories.\n  The Department of Energy has some interesting statistics. State by \nState, what does a State consume in energy and what does it produce? \nCalifornia consumes eight times more energy than it produces. \nMassachusetts is the winner. It consumes 65 times more energy than it \nproduces. Florida consumes 11 times more energy than it produces.\n  This is not being part of the solution. This is not sustainable. It \nis particularly ironic when some voices from these very same places \ndecry a bill as we have on the floor which can be part of the solution, \nwhich can lower energy prices even in the short term and can get us to \nthe longer term as we transition to new energy sources.\n  Finally, as I mentioned, there is a whole myth that many of these \nsame opponents bring up that somehow we are raiding the Federal \nTreasury. If bringing in more Federal revenue is raiding the Federal \nTreasury, then let the raid begin. That is what this bill does. It \nincreases Federal revenue--$1 billion more for the Federal Treasury, $1 \nbillion more of deficit reduction. That is the plain and simple fact. \nWhy is that? Because this bill expands production which expands revenue \nwhich, even in the new rules of revenue sharing under this bill, \nincreases Federal revenue and decreases the deficit.\n  For any opponents to claim that this somehow increases the deficit \nand raids the Federal Treasury is simply untrue. It is factually \nincorrect. There is more Federal revenue, bringing down the deficit.\n  S. 3711 is positive. It is concrete, it is taking action now. It is a \nstep forward. It can have an impact that can make life better for \naverage Americans, even in the short term, and help bring down energy \nprices, help increase our energy independence, help produce new \nrevenue, not just to the producing States; but also to the Federal \nTreasury--help reduce the Federal deficit.\n  This is a win-win-win-win, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant energy legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak in \nopposition to the so-called Energy bill that we have before us, on \nwhich we will be voting cloture later this afternoon. I want to make my \nposition very clear. I am certainly not against drilling for oil and \ngas here in the United States or in the Gulf of Mexico. Fossil fuels \nare an essential component of our Nation's energy infrastructure, and I \nsupport appropriate steps to build our supply and use. For example, I \nhave repeatedly, for several years, called for the construction of the \nAlaskan natural gas pipeline. I voted for last year's Energy bill which \ncontained numerous incentives and provisions for the development of \nfossil fuels. In fact, I voted for previous Energy bills over the past \nseveral years.\n  However, unlike those previous Energy bills, the bill before us today \nis not comprehensive. Far from it; it is a narrow bill, focused \nstrictly on drilling for oil and gas in certain portions of the Gulf of \nMexico. There simply is not that much gas being made available under \nthis bill.\n  I mentioned a moment ago the Alaska natural gas pipeline. Every day, \nthey are reinjecting into the ground gas already discovered in Alaska \nthat could be shipped to the lower 48 if we had a pipeline in place. In \nfact, if we had started on this several years ago we would just about \nbe completed with that pipeline right now. The pipeline is projected to \nprovide some 2.2 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable gas \neach year for the next 100 years. But the bill before us today would \nprovide perhaps 5 or so trillion cubic feet lasting less than 3 years.\n  What does that all mean? It means there is about 40 times the amount \nof natural gas in Alaska than we would ever get from this bill before \nus in the Gulf of Mexico. That may not even be including the Mackenzie \ngas bill in Canada.\n  The Minerals Management Service indicates the gas made available \nunder the bill before us, if you project 50 years into the future, \ncould be about 2\\1/2\\ months of supply. In other words, of all the \nnatural gas we are going to need for the next 50 years, the bill before \nus will provide about 2\\1/2\\ months of supply. Over the next 15 years--\nanother way of looking at it--we get about 9 days' worth. And we won't \nget any at all until 2012. This is not going to have any significant \nimpact on our supply.\n  As Senator Bingaman noted, in order to get access to this very modest \namount of gas--as I said, perhaps 5 trillion cubic feet--we are locking \naway 21 trillion cubic feet in the eastern gulf until 2022 by placing \nthese areas under a 16-year moratorium. What a deal for the American \nconsumer. What a deal. We can get 5 trillion cubic feet, but in \nexchange for that we are going to lock away, for 16 years, up to 21 \ntrillion cubic feet that could be made available in the eastern gulf. \nThat is not a very good deal for the American consumer.\n  I think the better bet is for Congress to find a way to get the \nAlaska natural gas pipeline built. Yet we have done nothing on that. \nUnfortunately, key parties in the State of Alaska are not getting the \njob done, and we have not done anything to really move them in that \ndirection. My understanding is that the legislature there is not \nsatisfied with the concurrent contract proposal negotiated by the \nGovernor, and he is not satisfied with them. It goes back and forth and \nback and forth.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Snowe and I wrote a letter to the Energy \nCommittee asking them to investigate this and hopefully to come up with \nsome suggestions so that in some way we here in Congress might break \nthat logjam.\n  Anyway, there is little hope for them getting it settled by the end \nof the year, but we are focusing on this--5 trillion cubic feet, when \nwe have 40 times that amount in Alaska that could be piped down. That \nis just one facet of how bad this bill is.\n  Second, this drilling legislation would drain the Federal Treasury of \nbillions of dollars in lost revenue that would otherwise be available \nfor urgent national priorities--priorities, I might add, such as \nagricultural and rural development assistance, health care and \neducation, in addition, of course, to real energy security.\n  I know a number of farm groups--my farmers--need more natural gas. We \nuse it to make fertilizer. We use a lot of it to make ethanol, also. \nThe point here being that the amount of money we are going to lose \nunder this bill means that we are going to be draining money away from \nthe Federal Treasury that we will need in the next farm bill, which is \ncoming up, which we are going to need for a safety net for farmers, \nwhich we are going to need for conservation payments, which we are \ngoing to need to provide more incentives for ethanol and biodiesel and \nbiomass production.\n  Again, the offset is not good. Agriculture really comes up a loser.\n  The reason I say that--one other bad facet of this bill is that it \nprovides 37.5 percent of the revenue from the new leases in areas \nbeyond their areas to four Gulf Coast States. In other words, four \nStates are going to get 37.5 percent of all the revenues from gas and \noil that is way, way beyond their territorial waters.\n\n  I can't blame my friends from those States for fighting hard for this \nbill. I can't blame the Senators from Texas and Louisiana and \nMississippi and Alabama--they are making out. This is a heck of a deal \nfor them. Like I said, I can't blame them, but what about the rest of \nthe Senators here? We represent other States.\n  This is not unique. This came up once before back in 1952, when the \nPresident of the United States was Harry S Truman, from Missouri. The \nissue again was, to whom do these minerals, oil and gas, in the Gulf of \nMexico belong? I want to read this for the Record. Here is what a \ncourageous, gutsy President had to say:\n\n       The minerals that lie under the sea off the coast of this \n     country belong to the Federal Government--that is, to all the \n     people of this country. The ownership has been affirmed and \n     reaffirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States . . .\n\n  I am quoting Harry Truman. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S8495]]\n\n\n       If we back down on our determination to hold these rights \n     for all the people, we will act to rob them of this great \n     national asset. That is just what the oil lobby wants. They \n     want us to turn the vast treasure over to a handful of \n     States, where the powerful oil interests hope to exploit it \n     to suit themselves.\n       Talk about corruption. Talk about stealing from the people. \n     That would be robbery in broad daylight--on a colossal scale. \n     It would make Teapot Dome look like small change.\n       I got a letter from a fellow in Texas today, who is a \n     friend of mine, and he was weeping over what the \n     schoolchildren of Texas were going to lose if Texas didn't \n     get its oil lands 9 miles out from the shore.\n\n  Nine miles. Here we are talking about 100 miles, and more. This was 9 \nmiles. Listen to what Truman was saying about the oil and the gas 9 \nmiles off the shore:\n\n       And I composed a letter to him, and then didn't send it. I \n     said what about the schoolchildren in Missouri and Colorado, \n     and North Dakota and Minnesota and Tennessee and Kentucky and \n     Illinois, do they have any interest in this at all? Evidently \n     not, it should all go to Texas. Well, it isn't going there, \n     if I can help it.\n\n  Boy, why don't we have a President like that today? Talk about \ntelling it like it is. And Truman did veto it.\n  Here is his closing.\n\n       I can see how the Members of Congress from Texas and \n     California and Louisiana might like to have all the offshore \n     oil for their States. But I certainly can't understand how \n     Members of Congress from the other 45 States can vote to give \n     away the interest the people of their own States have in this \n     tremendous asset. It's just over my head and beyond me how \n     any interior Senator or Congressman could vote to give that \n     asset away. I am still puzzled about it. As far as I am \n     concerned, I intend to stand up and fight to protect the \n     people's interest in this matter.\n\n  President Harry Truman, May 17, 1952.\n  Where is Truman when we need him today? Yet we read history and look \nback and say: Boy, that Truman, he was brave, he was courageous, he \nfought for real people. He was on our side. How, he said, can Members \nof Congress from other States--Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, \nIllinois--how can they vote for something like this to give away a \nnational asset to four States? Truman said it in 1952. Here we are back \nagain, back again.\n  As I said, 37.5 percent goes to these four States. As Truman said--\nhow did he say it? He said here, ``Talk about corruption. Talk about \nstealing from the people. That would be robbery in broad daylight--on a \ncolossal scale. It would make Teapot Dome look like small change.''\n  Truman had it right then. He is right today, too.\n  Another reason to be opposed to this bill is it is such a narrow and \ncontroversial bill when we consider the components of what we really \nneed for a 21st century sustainable energy policy for our Nation. By \nthat I mean an aggressive and continuing effort to promote conservation \nand to ramp up renewable energy. It is as true today as it was 10 years \nago, 20 years ago, and 30 years ago. It is cheaper right now to \nconserve a barrel of oil or a trillion cubic feet of natural gas than \nit is to go out and drill for it. It is easier and cheaper--cheaper to \nconserve. Yet we have this bill before us, this very narrow bill, very \ncontentious bill, that gives all this--37.5 percent of these \nroyalties--to these four States.\n  You might say the average American out there listening to this debate \nwould say: Harkin, why don't you amend it? If you feel so strongly \nabout this, offer an amendment; see what happens.\n  Guess what. We can't offer any amendments. Yes, that is right. You \nmay wonder, Is this the Senate? You mean we can't offer an amendment? \nThat is right. I cannot offer an amendment to this bill because of the \ngames the leader on the other side played in terms of how he brought it \nup under cloture and filled the tree, as they say. That is just \ngobbledygook, meaning the majority leader is able to engineer the way \nthe bill is brought up so we cannot offer amendments to it. When the \nbill comes up for a vote, it is up or down. We can't even offer an \namendment. We can't offer an amendment on conservation or renewable \nenergy or to say maybe it shouldn't be 37.5 percent for four States, \nand maybe other States something else. Fifty amendments were filed on \nthis bill. None of them will be considered.\n  We have time to talk for days around here about flag desecration and \nabout gay marriage. I am not saying those aren't important issues. But \nlet's get real, folks. We are talking about something here that affects \nevery American every day. People are hurting out there with an \nunusually hot summer. People are struggling to pay these big gasoline \nprices--upwards of about close to $3 a gallon, 71 cents more than a \nyear ago. Natural gas prices are the highest of anywhere in the world \nright here in America. Yet how do we go about achieving some energy \nprice relief for my Iowans or other Americans? How do we go about it?\n  We have this bill--this very narrow bill. We should be discussing \nother parts of what we need for energy. The Senate leaders, Senator \nFrist and Senator Reid, were asking last week that we include a period \nfor energy debate while addressing the measure before us. Again, we \nspent all this time this year debating this and that. And if we have \ntime for those, we surely have time to debate America's energy security \nchallenges, offer our amendments, debate them, and let's see what comes \nout of the process.\n  I filed two amendments to this bill. One contains the Biofuels \nSecurity Act. It is a bipartisan measure to improve our ability to \ndeliver renewable fuels to motoring consumers. I am not going to \nexplain every little bit of it, but basically it would increase the \namount of renewable fuels we make.\n  Second, it would make E-85 ethanol available at gas stations across \nAmerica.\n  Third, it would require the automobile companies to make more \nflexible fuel cars such as they are doing in Brazil right now so we \ncould have E-85 pumps across America.\n  I filed a second amendment that would require the EPA to adjust the \nfuels standards to meet a 10 billion gallon target by 2010. That \nshouldn't be too much. We are going to meet that, anyway. We should do \nit higher.\n  We need to spur growth of cellulosic biofuel production--fuels made \nfrom fibrous materials such as corn stover, wheat straw, wood waste and \nswitchgrass.\n  Lastly, in terms of conservation, I cosponsored an amendment with \nSenator Obama and others to increase vehicle fuel economy standards for \nthe first time in two decades. Imagine that. We have not increased fuel \nstandards in this country in 20 years. Yet here is a bill on energy and \nwe can't amend it.\n  Conservation of energy coupled with increased availability of \nrenewable fuels is the pathway to the future while at the same time \ndoing what we can to increase our natural gas production.\n  The best thing would be the pipeline from Alaska.\n  As I said, I am not opposed to drilling for gas and oil in the gulf, \nbut I am the way this bill is set up. If you do not have a component in \nthe bill for renewable energy production, biomass, biofuels, wind \nenergy for electricity and others, photovoltaics as a component of it, \nand also conservation, all this bill says is basically we are going to \ncontinue to do what we have been doing in the past--getting more fossil \nfuels. We may need fossil fuels, but the sad truth is that this bill \nbefore us is a missed opportunity to do big things for our energy \nfuture and our energy security.\n  Again, I assume that the votes are cut and dry on this the way they \nhave it. I just want to make sure people know we can't offer \namendments. We are being precluded from doing so. But hopefully we will \nbe back and hopefully we can have a more serious discussion and debate \nabout how we provide for America's energy security in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, would my colleague yield for a brief \nquestion?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be happy to yield, without losing the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Does the Senator know how long he will speak?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as a Member of the Senate, I must say I \nnever know how long I am going to speak. I will not speak that long, \nbut I may get excited and go a little longer. My guess is not more than \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak immediately after the Senator from Mississippi \nfinishes his remarks.\n\n[[Page S8496]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this very important \nlegislation, S. 3711. But like others today, I may decide I need to \ncomment on some other issues that will be discussed later on this week.\n  First, I must say that this week I have been thinking repeatedly \nabout that great line from Rudyard Kipling's ``If.'' ``If you can keep \nyour head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on \nyou''--\n  And it goes on. It is a great poem, it says that if you keep your \nhead when everybody else around you is losing theirs, you shall inherit \nthe Earth, my son.\n  That is what I would encourage my colleagues to do today. Let's keep \ncool. Let's not lose our heads. Every one of us is going to get up to \nspeak, and there is going to be somebody on the other side of the issue \nor on the other side of the aisle who is going to say, That Senator \nlost his head. Let's keep our cool.\n  I just heard a speech saying we shouldn't pass this bill because it \nis not big enough. Yet you are going to hear a speech later this week \nsaying we shouldn't pass one of the next bills because it is too \ncomprehensive.\n  This is not a bill that is going to solve all of our energy needs. \nThis energy problem has not developed in the past year, or 10, or 20, \nor 30. It has been coming for years. We have made speeches on this \nfloor about how we are becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil. \nWe were all worried that it would go up to 40 percent, then 50 percent, \nand now it is 60 percent. If we don't do anything about it, it is going \nto continue to go up.\n  Do I think it is dangerous? Yes. I believe we should address it in \nevery way we can.\n  As I have said before in some of my speeches here, I personally \nbelieve that the way to deal with our energy needs is to produce more \nof everything--make the pie bigger; quit trying to find ways to shrink \nit; more gas production; more clean coal technology; more hydrogen \nplants; more nuclear plants; and, yes, alternative fuels--biomass, bio-\ndiesel, conservation; the whole package.\n  In my opinion, the first option has always been to produce more. That \nis the way I was raised. You do not have to do with less. You can find \nmore natural resources, you can find more alternative fuels, and we \nought to try to do that. I think we can get together on this.\n  As far as I am concerned this is not a comprehensive package, we \npassed a big energy bill last year, a very costly bill, with several \ngood provisions in it.\n  This very morning I met with people saying they were interested in \nseveral tax credits. They said they could change automobiles so they \ncould work using propane. We have the infrastructure to do this. There \nare lots of good ideas out there. We are going to have our first \nethanol plant in Mississippi. We are all trying to find a way to do a \nbetter job.\n  This bill will also help our new ethanol plant. It will produce lots \nmore oil and gas, millions of barrels of oil, and trillions of cubic \nfeet of natural gas. Why shouldn't we do that? Because it does not \ninclude all the coasts or all kinds of other resources? That is not \ngood enough.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction. It will lead us toward \nmore production which will make us less dependent on foreign oil. Why \ndon't we do that? It will have an impact pretty quickly. It will have \nan impact on the futures markets. I think we can get some of that \noil and gas out of the Gulf of Mexico in this designated area sooner \nthan a lot of people think, and in larger quantities.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to quit trying to find the perfect. This is good \nenough. This is a magnificent effort, and it is bipartisan.\n  I talked to my friend, former Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, a \nDemocrat, this morning. I said, We finally figured out how to bring \ntogether a bipartisan package without you. Twenty-two Democrats voted \nto move to this legislation yesterday. Seventy-two Members of the \nSenate said let's cut out the frivolous debate, and let's go to the \nsubstance here. This is an opportunity to get something done.\n  Why are we whining about it? Why aren't we high-fiving and \ncongratulating each other and saying to the American people that it is \nnot the end but it is a beginning? It is good. Let's do that. We need \nto address this overall energy problem.\n  I have heard some other interesting opposing ideas to this bill. One \nof them is: Well, if we do this, it will be cutting revenue coming to \nthe Federal Government. Let's see. The math on that one eludes me. If \nwe don't do this, we are not going to get any revenue from this area--\nnone, zero.\n  If we do it, we will have a substantial impact on the Federal budget \nwith revenue coming in. Yes, some of it will go to the States in the \nregion and some of it will go to States all over the country. However, \nthere will be a huge impact on revenue coming in from the royalties if \nwe pass S. 3711, to open up millions of acres in the south central part \nof the Gulf of Mexico.\n  This, once again from the standpoint of helping the Government and \nthe people, is a winner because revenue will also be coming into the \nFederal Treasury.\n  Some have argued: Why should the States in the area benefit? We \nshould benefit because we haven't benefitted in the past; because we \nhave not been treated fairly; because we are the ones who take the \nrisks. We are the ones who have a tremendous coastal impact problem \nwhich we must now address: hurricane prevention, protection and coastal \nreplenishment. We have estuaries in Louisiana that are disappearing. We \nhave a huge problem on our hands. With the revenue from off-shore \ndrilling we can pay for it. We are taking the risks, therefore we \nshould have the benefits. At least some benefit. These risks may be \nvery minimal, but we need the revenue to take care of ourselves.\n  I like the fact that not all of the revenue from this area goes to \nthe Gulf States or the Governors. It goes to the local people. Twenty \npercent will go to the local people, the supervisors. The individual \ncounties will decide what part of preservation, restoration, \nprevention, or recovery they will put this revenue into.\n  For years, the royalties from on shore exploration in the West stayed \nwithin the States where drilling was taking place. They got 50 percent \nof it. Yet, in the Gulf where oil and gas exploration has taken place \nfor years, we have been getting zero except for the tiny percentage we \ngot out of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Basically nothing.\n  Now we would like to have something similar to what they've had out \nWest. However, we are not saying that it all either has to go to the \nstates or to the Federal Treasury. Part of the revenue will go to the \nGulf States, part of it will be going to the Federal Land and Water \nConservation Fund, which will go to States all over the Nation, and \npart will go to the Federal Treasury. For the first time, the Gulf of \nMexico States would be getting a fair deal. I am proud of that. All of \nus from that region--Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--are \nsupporting this package.\n  Without us, it probably wouldn't have happened. A lot of credit goes \nto the Senators from the region, particularly the Senators from \nLouisiana, Mary Landrieu and David Vitter. \n  This is also an acceptable arrangement for Florida, which has not \nbeen easy. It has been tedious. They want to protect the area that is \nused for military training. They want to protect their beaches, which \nare crucial to their tourism. I understand that. I may not agree with \nthem in terms of how far away it has to be, but they believe this is a \nfair agreement for their state.\n  That was not easy to achieve. It has taken a lot of time and effort. \nIt is a principled one, from an economical, energy security and \nenvironmental standpoint.\n  All of this drilling will not take place unless it is at least 100 \nmiles from our coast, or 125 miles away from the Florida shore.\n  By the way, back in the real world, China is prepared to start \ndrilling off the coast of Cuba, which is within 60 miles of Florida. Is \nthat going to happen? Yes. Yet we are prohibiting the drilling for the \ngulf oil and gas even 125 miles away for the Coast of Florida. This \nlegislation is a good effort. I am proud to be part of it.\n  Let me speak a little bit about this week. Colleagues, there will be \nplenty\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\nof time and plenty of opportunity to say: It is your fault, it is this \nleadership, that leadership, it is Democrats, Republicans, it is this \nchairman, it is the House of Representatives; recriminations, blame all \nover the place. We need to put aside the blame game. We need to put \naside our own pitiful pride, where we are defending our turf, insisting \non the correctness of our position.\n  If it were my call, I wouldn't set this week up the way it is, but \nsomeone has to make that call, and it has been made and I support it. \nThis could be an incredibly good week. If anyone thinks we are going to \ndo better in the elections this year by doing nothing, you are sadly \nmistaken. Does anyone around here not see where Congress is rated? \nBetween the two parties, it is a question of who is the lowest, not who \nis the highest.\n  We need to produce. We used to be able to do that. We used to be able \nto reach across the aisle and find a way to make it happen. That is \nwhat we need to do this week. Envision this: Dream that at the end of \nthis week we will have passed an energy bill that will help reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil; we will have passed a defense appropriations \nbill that will help us in the war on terror, and support our troops \nwherever they stand vigil this very night; we will have passed pension \nreform that has been years in coming that is in the best interest of \ncorporations and employees all over this country, that is good for \naviation and automobile manufacturers, but most importantly of all, \nworking people, people out there making it all happen, people who are \nworried about their retirement, worried whether their pensions will be \nthere, will it be at the level they were promised? What will it be? How \ncan you transition from defined benefits into defined contributions, \n401(K) plans, IRAs? They would sleep better if this dream came through \nand we finished this week up passing this pension reform with the \naviation pension part of it included. And the so-called trifecta.\n  I don't know much about betting. I must admit that I don't even know \nwhat a trifecta is, but I know it is three of something. I suspect that \nin a trifecta bet the return on a dollar is huge. That is what will \nhappen if we pass this bill.\n  It has a minimum wage increase, $2.10 over the next 3 years. A lot of \nsmall business men and women are concerned about that. How will they \ncope with that? Will they take it out of the bottom line? Will they lay \noff people? Will they raise their prices? They are not sure, but the \nfact is we have not passed a minimum wage increase in 10 years. I was \nhere when that happened. There are a lot of people who feel it is time \nwe do this. We can debate that. We will debate that. But if we are \ngoing to get a trifecta, that is part one.\n  Part two is extenders. That is more Senate talk in Washington for tax \nprovisions, but they are not just insignificant tax provisions; they \nare the tax credit for research and development, which is about the \nfuture of America. If we want to be competitive, we better be doing \nresearch and development because the Chinese, the Japanese, even the \nRussians are beginning to do things in that area.\n  It has a deduction for college tuition. I thought we were for that. \nFor the first time we are on the verge of getting a fair capital gains \nrate for timber. I thought we were for that. That part of the trifecta \nhas so many things that will be beneficial for working men and women of \nAmerica, the people who own a few acres of timberland, for people who \nwant to send their kids to school. We need it. It will produce I don't \nknow how much more revenue than would be expended in tax credits or \ndeductions. You never get finished reaping the benefits of helping your \nkid go to college and getting an education. It benefits the revenue of \nour Federal Treasury for years to come. I am one of those. I had a \nschool loan to get through college. I paid it back a few times over \nthrough the years. So we ought to do the extenders.\n  We ought to do a reasonable compromise on the death tax. We will hear \nranting and raving about how horrible it is that we would reduce taxes \non the wealthy. I am not one of those. I don't have anyone in my blood \nfamily who will qualify. I do have a couple of in-laws who would \nprobably qualify for it. But I have never been able to conceive but one \nother tax worse than the death tax. Just the idea that you work all \nyour life, you produce, you save, you have a house, a farm, a small \nbusiness, whatever, and the Government shows up when you die and says, \ngive me a huge chunk of it--the principle is wrong. I have never talked \nto men, women, young or old, all kinds of different races, who say the \ndeath tax is a good idea. That is a bad idea. The only tax I know that \nis worse is the income tax, of course, and the day will come when we \nwill have to fix that, too.\n  Can I argue about parts of it? Sure. Can I argue against some of the \nthings in the death tax and the minimum wage and how it is constructed? \nSure. But is it good enough? Will it help America? Yes.\n  We can have a vision this week that leads us to do these four things \nand leave here on a high note. That would be good for America and good \nfor everyone who participated in the effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep calm this week. Let's hold down on \naccusations. Let's try not to get mad at each other. Let's try to \ncooperate as much as we can between our leadership. Let's see if we \ncan't do something right for a change in this institution.\n  I still have faith that the majority of the Senate wants to do what \nis right for our country, not what is right for our party or our region \nto the disadvantage of other regions, and certainly not what we are \ntold by our leadership.\n  Sometimes we do not agree with our leadership, but these guys and \nladies have a very tough time. They have to review a lot of things the \nrest of us don't know about. We have to be prepared to follow. This \nweek they may be pulling against each other, but maybe we can help get \nthem back together and produce a final product.\n  I would like to urge my colleagues to vote for S. 3711. In fact, I \nsuggest that we vote for everything this week. That would be novel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, by unanimous consent I understand the \nSenator from New York has reserved the time coming up. I visited with \nhim. He needed to attend a meeting, so I ask unanimous consent I be \nallowed to proceed, to be followed by Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Mississippi counseled me \nto stay calm. I am a reasonably calm guy. I don't get too excited about \nmuch of anything--at least that is what my wife would suggest. But let \nme tell you something that happened to me last night that caused me to \nbe a little less than calm.\n  I drove, like most Americans, to a gas station. I pulled up to the \npump, I swiped my credit card, and $39 later I filled an economy car \nfull of $3.25 per gallon gas.\n  I must tell you and tell the Senator from Mississippi, I wasn't calm. \nThis Scotchman's blood began to rile a bit when I realized that I and \nall other Americans are paying more for their gas today than ever in \nthe history of this country and it is Government policy that caused it.\n  It is an attitude over the last 20 years that somehow America was \ngoing to conserve its way out of this problem. We didn't have to \nproduce, we didn't have to refine, and, by the way, you can go out and \nbuy a bigger car and it will burn a little more, but don't worry about \nit, it will be there. We lulled ourselves into this sense of false \nsecurity that somehow gas is always going to stay at $1.25 or $2 a \ngallon.\n  While we were in a sense of false security, we did something else \nthat was politically stupid. Where the greatest potential for domestic \noil production exists today, we said take it out of bounds, take it \noffline. Seventy-five percent of the Outer Continental coast of America \ntoday, where our greatest reserves exist, is off limits, all in the \nname of the environment, even though we have applied technology, \nscience, and engineering in a way today that was proven during the \ntremendous storm of Katrina when we knocked thousands of wells offline \nin the gulf, and not one drop of oil was spilled.\n  Why, then, did we do this all in the name of the environment if, in \nfact, we can retrieve oil from our deep waters off the Continental \nShelf and coast\n\n[[Page S8498]]\n\ntoday and not damage the environment? It was the politics of the 1970s, \nthe 1980s, and the 1990s. During that time, not only was gas relatively \ninexpensive compared to today's prices, but our consumption levels went \nup and we began to buy more and more oil from foreign supplies, foreign \nproducers, dominantly from the Middle East but some from Central and \nLatin America.\n  Today, with all of these red areas off limits, where there are \npotentially billions of barrels of oil, we said ``no'' and we find \nourselves dependent today with speculative oil prices going through the \nroof because wars are being fought, people are killing people in one of \nthe most insecure areas of the world, an area we have grown to become \ndependent on for the supply of our primary economic resource, oil. What \nis wrong with that picture, America?\n  Pogo once said: I have found the enemy and the enemy is us. Maybe \nthat is to paraphrase it a little bit. The enemy for oil prices is us, \nif I can say it in those terms. It is not only public policy in America \ntoday that has created the ``no'' zone to production, it is the \nattitude in America that somehow energy prices are always going to stay \ninexpensive and we don't have to produce anymore, even though our rate \nof consumption continues to grow.\n  Then along come the late 1990s and the early 2000s and the Chinese \neconomy takes off, the European economy takes off, and the Indian \neconomy takes off, and they are now all large consumers of oil. We all \nbuy it from the same pool, and the price goes up.\n  Today, before the Senate, this afternoon at 5 o'clock, we have an \nopportunity to begin to slowly but surely correct a very big problem we \nbuilt up in the decades of the 1970s, the 1980s, and 1990s, a self-\ninflicted wound we can now bind up and heal while we work our way out \nfrom increasing dependence on foreign resources. That legislation is S. \n3711.\n  What does it do? It takes us right down here to this tiny little \ngreen square in the Gulf of Mexico called lease sale 181.\n  We say to the oil companies of America: You can go out there and bid \nand lease and drill. Our geological survey determines that there are \ntrillions of cubic feet of gas out there and, potentially, billions of \nbarrels of oil. We can bring it on line and send it to our gulf coast \nrefineries and begin to process it and move it into our distribution \nsystems. And for a moment in time we will become just a little less \ndependent on Saudi Arabia or Iraq or anywhere else in the world in \nwhich we are buying oil today.\n  Why did we do it? Times change. Attitudes shift. Technology changes. \nToday, there is absolutely no reason to have a no-zone around the \nUnited States because we not only can produce it, we can do it in an \nenvironmentally sound way. Here is what we believe--not me; we, the \nU.S. Geological Survey, our Federal agencies that study where our oil \nreserves and potentials are--here is what they say we can do. They say \nthere are, potentially, in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge--2,200 \nlittle acres that we can drill out of millions of acres--potentially, \ntens of billions of barrels of oil up there; and in the OCS, 115 \nbillion barrels of oil, of which this one little spot down in the gulf \nwe call lease sale 181 that is embodied in this legislation, S. 3711, \nwill be able to reduce this maybe down to 110 billion barrels because \nmaybe we can get 5 billion barrels out of there.\n  Of course, a few months ago I came to the floor and said: Why are \nAmerican companies not being allowed to drill in the northern \nproperties off Cuba--where Cuba is now leasing that area out to China \nto drill, 50 miles off the U.S. shore. Why are not Americans out there \ndoing that? That is another potentially 4.6 billion to 5 billion \nbarrels of oil.\n  Add it all up, if we were able to use our skill, our talent that we \nhave developed in the decade of the 1990s, and 2000 and beyond, for \ndeepwater drilling, we could bring this much oil on line in a \nrelatively short period of time.\n  But California says no. Florida, in large part, has said no, although \nthe Senators from Florida have worked with us, and Mel Martinez has \ndone a beautiful job striking the balance to protect the environment of \nFlorida and to drill in lease sale 181 off the coast of Florida.\n  But, then again, in these areas up through here, where there is \ntremendous potential off of the northeastern coast of our country, what \ndo Vermont and Maine and New Hampshire and Rhode Island and Connecticut \nsay? No, even though their consumers are paying $3.25 to $3.30 a gallon \nfor gas. Where is the logic? Where is the sensitivity of that? Where is \nthe sensibility of it?\n  I know America wishes we could snap our finger and this energy \nproblem or crisis would be over. And it will not be. It took us 30 \nyears marching down a path in which production was a negative, in which \nwe said we simply did not have to produce; we could go someplace else \nand buy it. It is going to take a while to turn that around.\n  Last year, this Senate made a major step to turn that around. The \nNational Energy Policy Act of 2005, known as EPAct, today, is bringing \nethanol refineries or distilleries on line all across the Midwest as a \npart of producing into the whole energy supply of our country. Twenty \npercent of America's corn crop, being raised right now in the fields of \nIllinois and Iowa and Kansas and other places, will be used for ethanol \nproduction to go into the gas tanks of the American automobile. So we \nare moving in the right direction.\n  Last year at this time, as it relates to electrical production, we \nhad about two reactors on the drawing board; that is, nuclear reactors. \nFolks, today there are 24 on the drawing board. Ten or 12 of them will \nbe built, but it will take 10 or 12 years to build them. You do not \novernight correct the problems you have created over the last 30 years.\n  The American consumer, in their sense of frustration, today is \nsaying: Fix it. We like inexpensive energy. And I do not blame them. So \ndo I. Last night, at $3.25 a gallon for that regular gas I put in my \ngas tank, I did not like it one bit. That is the bad news: high gas \nprices. The good news is: high gas prices. Today, we would not be on \nthe floor debating lease sale 181 if gas were still $1.25 a gallon or \neven $2 a gallon. It was at $3 a gallon when the folks in Florida \nscratched their head and said: Maybe we could allow a little drilling \nout there. Maybe we could bring a little more on production. Maybe we \nought to sit and listen to the reality of the environmental skills that \nour deepwater drillers have today in the production of oil, and we can \ndo that and protect our environment at the same time. And we can. This \nlegislation is going to do just that.\n  That is why what we pass this afternoon is critically important to \nthe long-term stability and security of this country, to the strength \nand security of the average American family and consumer out there. It \nisn't that they will pay less after we do it; it is that they probably \nwill not pay more.\n  In trying to level these prices and get this country back into \nproduction, I would hope that Americans quit saying no. I would hope \nthat Senators would quit saying no and look at all of the alternatives \nout there today in a diverse energy portfolio of ethanol, of gas, of \nhydrogen, of nuclear generation for electricity, of wind and solar, and \nall the things we ought to bring into production in this country that \nwe are working hard to do at this time.\n  I am not going to ask Americans to be patient. We are not a patient \npeople. We are very impatient as a country. But it is going to take \nsome time. It is going to take the concerted efforts of Senators such \nas Pete Domenici and myself and Mel Martinez and others who have worked \nthis issue as hard as we have to convince this Congress, that \noftentimes is very resistant to change or very resistant to having to \ngo out and face the very powerful environmental community and say: You \nknow, you are just flat wrong. We can produce energy, and we can \nproduce it cleanly for Americans, and provide it abundantly at a \nreasonable price--if we let the marketplace work, we put the parameters \naround it as it relates to what we expect from them in the safety and \nsecurity of our environment but we do not say no. And for too long we \nhave.\n  Finally, this afternoon, at around 5 o'clock, we are going to vote on \nS. 3711 and, hopefully, we will say: Yes, let's bring it on line. Let's \nproduce it. Let's put trillions of cubic feet of gas into the gas \npipelines and let's bring billions of barrels of crude into the \nrefineries of the gulf coast.\n  Senate: Say yes. You have been too long saying no. Americans are \nfrustrated and angry they are now having\n\n[[Page S8499]]\n\nto pay a price they are not used to, and certainly have an abundance \nand a sense of security that most Americans have come to enjoy and \nexpect of themselves living in this great country of ours, living with \na system that works, and with a government that tends to be responsive \nto their needs. That is what this legislation is all about this \nafternoon.\n  So when the Senator from Mississippi counsels patience, I am an \nimpatient guy, especially when it comes to my pocketbook. And I know \nmost consumers are. I don't like paying $3.25 a gallon. I would like to \nfind the boogeyman and blame somebody for it. We have ourselves to \nblame because the no-zone was created by public policy, not by the big \noil companies. No. They would like to be there drilling and using the \nlatest technology. No. The no-zone was created by public policy: no to \nthe billions of barrels of oil that exist, as shown on this chart, in \nAlaska, in the Outer Continental Shelf, in the northern area off from \nCuba, and in lease sale 181.\n  The reason we are not there today is public policy, is an \nenvironmental attitude that simply says ``we don't have to produce any \nmore.'' Well, we do have to produce, but we need to do it cleanly, \nresponsibly. That is what this legislation is about. That is what the \nenergy policy of last year was about. This Government, thank goodness, \nhas been listening and has finally heard the consumer and his and her \nfrustration.\n  I would hope this afternoon we turn a no vote into a yes vote. I \nencourage all of my colleagues to vote for S. 3711. It means a lot to \nthe average family who is paying the price today for bad policy at the \ngas pumps of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Schumer is \nsupposed to go next. So I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nrecognized following Senator Schumer or, if the other side would like \nme to go first, I would go first. But it is my understanding the time \nshould be charged to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator Schumer immediately follow me on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my very strong \nsupport for S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, \nsponsored by our very able chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, Senator Domenici. I was pleased to cosponsor S. \n2253 with the chairman, which was an earlier version of this bill.\n  We must all recognize that the global oil market has changed \ndramatically, and we must pursue an energy-security strategy that takes \ninto account a new set of realities.\n  We are now faced with the prospect of a long-term oil shortage \nconjoined with a serious lack of spare capacity among even the world's \nmost reliable suppliers.\n  As OPEC's ability to respond to growing global demand for crude has \nslackened, so, too, has OPEC's ability to maintain a price band and the \nresulting political and price stability on which our Nation--more than \nany other--has been dependent. It is imperative we face the fact that \neven exhaustive efforts to conserve and increase renewable fuel \nproduction will still fall far short of bridging the gap between global \nsupply and our world's swelling demand for liquid fuels.\n  Oil and natural gas have production. limits. We do not manufacture \noil. In order to produce oil and natural gas we must go through a \nlengthy process of exploration and extraction. Increasingly our search \nfor replacement light sweet crude has been coming up short.\n  Just as it is important to recognize the magnitude of our global \nenergy shortage, it is equally important to recognize that North \nAmerica has solutions that are being ignored. The passage of S. 3711 \nwould allow us to benefit from one of the best solutions available.\n  Within our reach, in the Gulf of Mexico, we have an abundance of new \nsources of oil and gas. It is time we develop these new sources in \norder to help American families as they struggle against the rising \ncost of energy.\n  Mr. President, increasing our domestic supply of oil and gas will \nhave a positive impact on every American and every American business. \nUnfortunately, Canada, one of our major natural gas suppliers, has \nstruggled to increase production and deliver it to the United States. \nAs a result, gas imports from Canada have dropped in recent years.\n  I don't see how this Congress can turn away an opportunity to gain \naccess to the 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that this \nlegislation would make available. This is enough natural gas to heat \nand cool nearly six million homes for 15 years.\n  And how can we ignore 1.26 billion barrels of oil which would become \navailable through this proposal?\n  I understand there may be members of this body who will oppose this \nmeasure but I wonder why.\n  But if the Senate is to get serious about reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil, we must pass this legislation.\n  Reducing our foreign dependence by means of conservation, alone, will \nnot work.\n  Conservation is a part of the solution, but it is only a small part.\n  The fact is, if we do not actually increase our domestic supply of \noil and natural gas in a significant way, as soon as possible, our \nNation will pay a very heavy price.\n  I have been a strong advocate of conservation and increasing \nefficiency.\n  Seven years ago, I recognized that about two-thirds of all our oil \nconsumption is taken up by the transportation sector, and I began to \ndraft the Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car \nTechnologies Act, or CLEAR ACT.\n  The CLEAR ACT was made law as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \nand it is now providing strong tax incentives for the purchase of \nalternative fuel and hybrid-electric vehicles, for the installation of \nnew alternative fueling stations, and for the use of alternative fuels \nin vehicles. We have had an explosion on the development of hybrid \nvehicles and alternative fules. The CLEAR Act had a lot to do with it.\n  It took me and my cosponsors substantial effort and political capital \nto pass the CLEAR Act, but we did it because we knew it was important \nto increase the efficiency of our transportation sector.\n  But I have never lost sight of the fact that our Nation absolutely \nmust increase our domestic oil and gas production if we hope to \ncontinue to prosper and remain competitive.\n  Also, there are several longer term solutions to our Nation's energy \nneeds, such as our vast resources of unconventional oil, that need to \nbe implemented.\n  The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that recoverable oil shale in \nthe western United States is somewhere between 800 billion and 1 \ntrillion barrels of oil, but it is not counted among world reserves \nbecause it is not yet commercially developed.\n  I should point out that the world's oil reserves stand at just about \n1.6 trillion barrels. That means, at a minimum, the U.S. can increase \nthe world's oil reserves by 50 percent by implementing an aggressive \npolicy to recover our own oil shale. We in the west understand that in \nColorado, Utah, and Wyoming, that tri-State area, is an estimated 1 \ntrillion barrels of recoverable oil from tar sands and oil shale.\n  Chairman Domenici and Senator Allard worked with me to ensure that \nthe Energy Policy Act included strong provisions to promote the \ndevelopment of these unconventional resources.\n  However, even if the development of oil shale and tar sands is a \nsuccess, as I believe it will be, it would not occur in time to save us \nfrom our current supply shortage.\n  S. 3711 is one of the few opportunities we have to improve our \nNation's energy situation in the near term. I believe it represents an \nexcellent compromise among the various interests\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\ninvolved, and I applaud the parties involved for bringing us to this \npoint.\n  I hope this body will not throw this opportunity away. This is a way \nof helping our country, helping our citizens. This is a way of \nstabilizing the price of oil and of natural gas.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 3711, the Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act of 2006.\n  Before I begin, let me say this: I want to try to put this in a \ngeneral setting. We have an energy problem in this country. We all know \nabout that. Every year, hundreds of billions of dollars flow out of the \npocketbooks of hard-working men and women and end up in the pockets of \npeople we don't like particularly, people in Iran and people in \nVenezuela, countries like them, leaders who don't really play ball with \nus in the Middle East or in the Soviet Union on so many issues. It is \nimperative that we get a grip on this. In the long run, there is only \none solution, and that is independence from fossil fuels. We are doing \nso little on that, it is almost pathetic. We should have a crash \nprogram to free us of imports within 10 or 15 years. We should be \nputting every nickel in. We don't.\n  The Energy bills in the past have too often listened to the big oil \ncompanies which are happy with the status quo. Mr. Tillerson, head of \nExxonMobil, came before our Judiciary Committee and said he didn't \nbelieve in alternative fuels. But that is down the road. Because even \nif we started today--and we should have started 5 or 10 years ago--that \nwill take a while. So what do we do in the short run? It seems to me \nthere has been a little bit too much deadlock here: one side, mainly \nour side, saying conserve--and we are right, there should be \nconservation--the other side saying produce more, not just alternative \nfuels, which I think are very important, alternative energy, which I \nthink is very important, whether it be wind or solar or biofuels but \nthose just nibble at the edges. The other side says we need to supply \nmore fossil fuels. There is a deadlock. It is about time we broke the \ndeadlock. An ideal bill would be one that breaks the deadlock on both \nsides, that increases supply of fossil fuels in a way that doesn't do \ngrave damage to the environment and yet at the same time conserves. \nSuch a bill is not yet here.\n  The majority in its wisdom does not allow such a bill to come \nforward. The majority doesn't allow amendments on conservation to be \nadded to this bill. But this bill does move to increase supply in a \ncertain portion of the gulf, 1.2 million barrels of oil, 5.8 trillion \ncubic feet of gas, in about 8 million acres. That is 1.2 billion \nbarrels of oil we won't have to purchase from a Middle East that is, \nunfortunately, looking more volatile and less friendly day by day.\n  For the sake of consumers, it is clear we have to get gas prices \nunder control. And while drilling in these 8 million acres isn't going \nto send the price plummeting--that takes a much larger endeavor and a \nlarger picture--it will affect things at the margin. Gas prices are the \nhighest they have been since the aftermath of Katrina. In my State, a \nfamily with two cars, two cars they need to get to work, drive the kids \nto the doctor and dentist, to get the groceries, can expect to pay \n$1,000 more in gas this year as compared to just 1 year ago. That is a \ntragedy for that family--not a tragedy, I guess, but an economic \ntragedy. If your income isn't that large, $1,000 is just too much. It \nis a huge burden--is a better way to put it--on working families as \nprices keep going up.\n  So I have thought a lot about this. I am going to vote for this bill. \nI have advocated in our caucus for this bill as a way of showing faith \non this side of the aisle that when dramatic damage is not done to the \nenvironment, as it would be in Alaska where we are 10 years away, we \nare willing to look at increasing the supply of fossil fuels in the \nUnited States.\n  I am going to support this bill. I hope the other side will join us \nin allowing CAFE standards to come to the floor. A bipartisan bill \nsponsored by Senators Lugar and Obama would be a great place to start. \nThen we would increase supply some and decrease demand some. It would \nmake a huge difference. The fact that our CAFE standards are lower than \nthat of China, a country with virtually no environmental conscience \nbut, rather, a country interested in economics--and they understand the \neconomics are very important.\n  Make no mistake about it, if this bill is tampered with in the House, \nif we go beyond these two areas and talk about drilling in the oceans, \nas the Congressman from California, Mr. Pombo, is, most of us on this \nside of the aisle will do everything we can to block that, and we will \nget no bill at all. Let that be a warning to the people in the House \nnot to take advantage of our good faith here. By opening significant \ntracts for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, I also believe this bill \nshould give us less reason to drill in areas that are more \nenvironmentally sensitive like ANWR.\n  I am supporting this bill. I have urged my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle to support the bill. I appreciate the hard work the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, has done in persuading us to be for this \nbill. But this bill will be an empty promise if we don't go further, if \nwe don't do more to conserve, if we don't do more to come up with a \nbipartisan approach that in the long run removes us from the \nstranglehold of fossil fuels and in the short run both increases supply \nand decreases demand for energy.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 3711, the Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act. This important energy legislation begins a \nprocess by which we start to produce more energy domestically. It moves \nour Nation and our economy one step away from foreign oil barons and \none step closer to energy independence.\n  The legislation does so by opening up a portion of the Gulf of Mexico \nto energy production. Energy production in the Outer Continental Shelf, \nOCS, is not a new energy endeavor. The entire OCS is composed of 1.76 \nbillion acres and there are 8,000 active lease areas producing oil and \nnatural gas. This production translates to approximately 20 percent of \nour domestic oil production and approximately 30 percent of our \ndomestic natural gas production. Unfortunately, as hard working \nfamilies endure record prices each time they fill up their vehicles and \nas our Nation's ranchers and farmers struggle with higher fertilizer \ncosts, more than 85 percent of the coastal waters around the lower 48 \nStates currently are off limits to energy development.\n  This legislation is a step in the right direction. S. 3711 requires \nthe Secretary of the Interior to offer mineral leases in what is known \nas lease area 181 within 1 year of enactment. Such leasing would \ntranslate to 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas. Those minerals could be used to help meet the energy needs \nof our economy and help ease the burden of high prices on our hard \nworking families. Put in perspective, lease area 181 will provide \nenough natural gas to heat 6 million homes for 15 years.\n  Although I support the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, it is not \nperfect. I would prefer to see the act do more to open up a greater \nportion of the OCS to drilling. I would prefer that Federal royalties \nnot be automatically directed to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, \nand I would prefer that the bill allowed States that wanted energy \ndevelopment off their coasts to opt in and States that opposed energy \ndevelopment off their coasts to opt out.\n  While I would like to see these improvements made eventually, it is \nimportant to remember that S. 3711 is an excellent first step to expand \nour domestic energy production. Opening lease area 181 must be part of \na broad and comprehensive strategy to expand our traditional energy \nportfolio as we develop better technologies such as clean coal and \nhydrogen. Every great endeavor starts with a first step. The Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act is a good first step, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I strongly support S. 3711, the Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act. I would like to thank Senator Domenici, \nchairman of the Energy Committee, for his hard work in making this \ncompromise possible. This legislation is a much needed step to increase \nthe domestic production of natural gas and crude oil.\n  In recent years, the cost for natural gas has risen from the \nmoderate, stable level of $3 per thousand cubic feet to $6, and even \nexceeded $10 last fall. Current prices are three times the average \nduring the 1990s.\n  In just the past few days, natural gas prices have risen by nearly 15 \npercent. Why? Because the current heat wave crossing the country is \nputting a strain on our Nation's electrical grid--an electrical grid \nthat is increasingly dependent on electricity generated from natural \ngas.\n  And, while the demand for natural gas has increased, we have done \nlittle as a nation to ensure that there is access to the domestic \nsupply to meet the growing demand. For too many years, our country has \nhad a ``natural gas and nothing else'' policy.\n  The Energy Policy Act, which we enacted a year ago, took significant \nsteps to diversify our energy production and increase energy \nefficiency. The Energy bill included provisions to expand the use of \nclean coal and advanced nuclear technologies. It also included \nprovisions to expand the use of renewable and alternative energy and \nenergy conservation. All of these provisions will help in the long term \nto balance and diversify our energy portfolio.\n  However, we need to take action today to increase the supply of \ndomestically produced energy. The fact is, consumers in the United \nStates are paying some of the highest natural gas costs in the world. \nThis puts our farmers, manufacturers, and industrial users of natural \ngas at a competitive disadvantage.\n  Few things are as important to the livelihood and well-being of \nIowa's economy than natural gas. Although the State of Iowa is \nconsidered a national leader in the agricultural industry, our \nmanufacturing industry actually contributes five to six times more to \nIowa's economy than agriculture. Manufacturers have been particularly \nhard hit by the increase in prices because they consume over one-third \nof our country's natural gas. I have heard from manufacturers across \nIowa who have urged Congress to act to increase the supply of \naffordable natural gas.\n  Farming is also an extremely energy-intensive industry. Farmers and \nranchers need large amounts of natural gas for drying crops, heating \nbuildings, producing ethanol, and most importantly, as the feedstock of \nchemicals and fertilizers.\n  The vast majority of the cost of nitrogen fertilizers is natural gas. \nNumerous domestic manufacturers of ammonia and nitrogen fertilizer have \nclosed in recent years due to higher costs. As a result, prices for \ntheir products have increased. Ammonia for fall application this year \nwill cost a farmer nearly $400 a ton. This is double what it was just a \nfew years ago.\n  This legislation will also help my constituents with their home \nheating and electricity bills. A significant portion of Iowa households \nuse natural gas for their home heating. Even while the past few winters \nhave been relatively mild, home heating bills have doubled and tripled \nfor some families. And, while I have been an ardent supporter of the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps the less fortunate \npay for home heating, we must also recognize that the high prices are a \nresult of the tight energy supply. One way to ensure that consumers \naren't forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on \nthe table is to lower the price for natural gas.\n  That is why I am eager to see this bill pass. The compromise bill \nbefore us will open up 8.3 million acres on the Outer Continental Shelf \nfor oil and gas leasing. It requires that leasing begin as soon as \npracticable but no later than 1 year after the date of enactment. This \narea is estimated to hold 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and \n1.26 billion barrels of oil. This legislation will take a significant \nstep to enhance our county's domestic energy supply.\n  This bill is a proactive response to the rising cost of energy and \nour growing dependence on foreign sources of crude oil. It is a \nbipartisan agreement that has the support of the Gulf State Senators, \nand it deserves our full support. I encourage my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of this bill which will increase our energy supplies and help \nstabilize prices for our consumers, farmers, and manufacturers.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 3711, the \nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act.\n  This energy bill will open more than 8.3 million acres on the Outer \nContinental Shelf for oil and gas leasing. This area is estimated to \nproduce 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas. I expect as new technologies are developed this estimate \nof recoverable resources will only grow.\n  As oil and natural gas prices fluctuate, many Americans, especially \nMontanans, are feeling the strain of increased prices for energy use in \ntheir homes and businesses. The natural gas supply made available by \nthis bill will heat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years.\n  Additionally, an increased supply of natural gas will greatly benefit \nMontana's agriculture producers who are particularly hard hit by \nskyrocketing costs of fuel and fertilizer. Natural gas is the primary \nfeedstock in virtually all fertilizer manufactured in the United \nStates. Increased production of domestic natural gas will help \nstabilize prices and decrease our dependence on foreign suppliers of \nnatural gas such as Venezuela and Russia.\n  In order to strengthen American energy security, it is our obligation \nto use our own domestic resources whenever we can. Offshore drilling \nhas proven to be safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible for \noil and gas production. While this bill is limited in scope, it is an \nimportant first step to increasing our energy supply to meet our \ncountry's demands. Lease area 181 is a phenomenal resource, and time \nafter time in energy committee hearings when we ask expert witnesses \nfor their opinions on how to best stabilize and lower natural gas \nprices, the answer is: Open lease area 181.\n  I applaud the leadership of Chairman Domenici and the bipartisan \ngroups of Senators that hammered out this compromise. I urge my fellow \nSenators to support this bill and pass this important piece of our \nenergy security.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to discuss today's \nvote on the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, S. 3711. I support the \nbill because it will provide a needed source of natural gas, which is a \nclear-burning fuel, and its passage is realistically calculated to have \na positive impact on natural gas prices for American consumers and \nbusinesses. While voting for the bill, my preference would be for it to \ncontain conservation, energy efficiency, and other measures beyond Gulf \nof Mexico development to address our Nation's growing energy needs.\n  The issue of energy prices is on the top of Americans' minds and \ntheir list of expectations for elected officials to address. For a \nnumber of months, there has been discussion in the Senate of a possible \nenergy bill to follow the 2005 Energy Policy Act. However, despite the \ngreat importance of this issue and intense interest from Senators who \nhave suggested various energy proposals, we are now presented with only \none option, a bill to allow oil and natural gas leasing in a portion of \nthe Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Beyond the narrow \nscope this bill, there have also been questions raised as to the 37.5 \npercent share of revenues going to the four Gulf of Mexico States--\nFlorida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas--instead of the Federal \nTreasury, and concerns about the eventual bill emanating from a House-\nSenate conference.\n  Unfortunately, this bill and the way it has been considered miss an \nimportant opportunity to build on the successes of the 2005 energy bill \nand deal with our nation's energy policy in a comprehensive manner. \nThis is likely the last energy-related bill to receive floor \nconsideration prior to the recess for the November elections and the \neventual adjournment of the 109th Congress. That means we will have to \nreturn to the beginning of the legislative process upon the \ncommencement of the 110th Congress.\n  That is why I am greatly disappointed that Senators were unable to \nhave amendments to this bill considered. Amendments were precluded by a\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\nrarely used legislative procedure known as ``filling the tree'' which \noccurs when the majority leader offers the maximum number of amendments \nallowable under the official Senate rules in order to preclude \namendments from other Senators.\n  As I stated on the floor last night, I had hoped to have the Senate \nconsider my Oil and Gas Company Antitrust Act, S. 2557, as an \namendment. The Judiciary Committee held hearings on the issue of \ncompetition in the oil and gas industry and the committee voted S. 2557 \nto the Senate floor on April 27, 2006. The Judiciary Committee's \nhearings considered the many factors brought about by consolidation in \nthe oil and gas industry. The testimony indicated that market \nconcentration is a problem in the industry. Responding to these \nconcerns, my bill would prohibit individual firms from exporting \npetroleum and natural gas products with the intent of increasing prices \nor creating shortages in the market. Further, the bill would allow the \ngovernment to prosecute cartels such as OPEC that set the price of \npetroleum and natural gas, even when the cartel members are foreign \nstates. This bill would encourage vigorous competition in the oil and \ngas industry to ensure that the forces of supply and demand are working \nand that the industry is competitive.\n  I also cosponsored an amendment offered by Senators Lugar and Obama \nto provide for a 4 percent annual increase in Corporate Average Fuel \nEconomy, CAFE, standards. This is a rate that the National Academy of \nSciences has determined is possible, but could be altered if the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, can prove that \nthe increase is technologically unachievable, cannot maintain overall \nfleet safety or is not cost effective. The bill provides flexibility to \ndomestic automakers by establishing different standards for various \ntypes of cars to enable domestic manufacturers that produce full lines \nof small and large vehicles to better compete with companies that only \nsell small cars. Credit would also be given for exceeding fuel economy \nstandards in one type of car to help meet goals with other vehicle \nmodels. Finally, the bill provides tax incentives for companies to \nretool parts and assembly plants to develop advanced-technology \nvehicles.\n\n  I note that Senator Bingaman has offered an oil conservation \namendment No. 4692, which would save 2.5 million barrels (bbl) of oil \nper day by 2016; 7 million bbl/day by 2026; and 10 million bbl/day by \n2031. I was disappointed that the 2005 energy bill did not include a \nsimilar oil savings goal which would have required the administration \nto identify and implement policies reducing domestic oil consumption by \n1 million barrels per day from projections by 2013. This provision was \nbased on the Carper-Specter amendment from 2002 and the Landrieu-\nSpecter amendment in 2003 which passed by a vote of 99 to 1. These are \nmodest goals, but ones which would help focus the Federal Government in \nreducing oil imports in support of energy independence, national \nsecurity, and lower trade deficits.\n  The energy bill conference also deleted the Senate provisions \nmandating that by the year 2020 at least 10 percent of our electricity \nbe produced from renewable resources. This goal was meant to help spur \ndevelopment of renewable resources, which currently account for just \nover 2 percent of U.S. electricity production. Pennsylvania is \ncurrently implementing a similar Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard \nwith an eighteen-percent goal by 2020 of electricity production from \nrenewable and other alternative energy sources.\n  Despite my desire to see additional energy issues debated, I say to \nmy colleagues that I am sensitive to the price and supply concerns that \nhave led to the consideration of the Gulf of Mexico legislation. The \nnatural gas supply and demand imbalance has caused U.S. prices to \nincrease from an average of $2.20 per million BTUs during the 1994-1999 \ntimeframe to $8.84 per million BTUs in 2005, which is the highest \naverage natural gas cost in the world. These high prices have increased \neconomic pressure on American consumers and industry, particularly \nthose who use natural gas to heat their homes and industrial sectors \nthat rely on natural gas as a fuel and as a raw material.\n  Finally, when it comes to oil prices the problem is well known. All \nAmericans are facing high gasoline prices at the pump and are expected \nto have high heating oil prices this winter. With gasoline hovering \njust above $3 per gallon nationally while this bill has been debated, \nthere is no better time to discuss energy issues and ensure that \nCongress is doing everything in its power to address them. While the \n2005 Energy Policy Act provided an important framework and policy \ndirection from which to proceed, it did not address every facet of \nthese complex issues and has not convinced the American people, nor me, \nthat nothing more can be done. Therefore, I encourage the Senate to \nconsider additional energy-related measures at the earliest \nopportunity.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today the Senate will be voting on S. 3711, \nthe Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. I regret that I cannot \nsupport this bill for a number of reasons.\n  First, I am deeply disappointed that the majority leader used \nparliamentary maneuvers to prohibit any Senators from offering \namendments to the bill before us today. While I did vote last week to \nallow for the consideration of this legislation, I did so with the hope \nthat Senator Frist would allow both Republicans and Democrats to offer \namendments that are important to our energy security. In fact, I am a \ncosponsor of a number of bipartisan amendments that were scheduled to \nbe offered to S. 3711. But unfortunately, the bill before us today is \nthe only energy bill that the Senate will debate this summer. That is \nnot in the best interest of the American consumer, the economy, or our \nlong-term energy security.\n  I have long advocated a more balanced approach to solving our energy \nproblems. Any serious solution to our energy crisis must involve \nincreasing efficiency, expanding our conservation efforts, and \ncommitting to renewable forms of energy. Unfortunately, however, the \nsole focus of S. 3711 is oil and natural gas exploration in the Gulf of \nMexico. Contrary to what supporters of the bill contend, this \nlegislation does nothing in the short term to rein in the soaring fuel \nand energy prices because of the lag time it will take to extract the \nallowed oil and gas. Further, this bill redirects some of the revenues \nfrom Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, drilling from the Federal Treasury \nto just four States.\n  For more than 25 years, most of the coastal areas of the country have \nbeen under either a Presidential moratorium on OCS drilling due to \nexpire in 2012 or a congressional moratorium enacted annually through \nthe appropriations process. Under this bill, for the first time, one \nState--Florida--is given statutory protection from offshore drilling \nthrough 2022. No similar statutory protection exists for the Atlantic \nor Pacific coasts.\n  In fact, there are some Members of Congress who would like their \nStates to be able to opt out of any future moratorium. While this \nprovision is not included in S. 3711, it is included in the House-\npassed bill that likely will be conferenced with S. 3711. If we adopt a \nfractured system and allow drilling in adjacent States, I am concerned \nthat our fragile coastal ecosystems and economies could be threatened \nby pollution associated with drilling and unforseen incidents due to \nthe drilling activity, weather, and possible terrorist attacks. Let us \nremember that our coastal waters flow freely and what happens in the \nwaters off one state may have serious repercussions up and down the \ncoast.\n  I deeply regret that in considering the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act we were not able to debate meaningful bipartisan \namendments to address many of the serious energy concerns facing our \nNation. It is my fear that in the dwindling days of this session we \nwill not again have the opportunity to revisit these critically \nimportant issues and consumers and businesses will continue to struggle \nto meet their energy needs. Mr. President, the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act truly represents a missed opportunity.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, every one of us in Congress has heard from \nour constituents about the high cost of gas. A gallon is now $3 or more \nin most parts of the country, and there is every\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\nreason to believe that figure will continue to climb throughout the \nrest of the summer.\n  Americans are asking their Members of Congress to help lower some of \nthese costs. And we should do that. But let us not kid ourselves. This \nis a problem that was decades in the making, and short-term political \nsolutions--whether it is a tax rebate or more legislation to stop price \ngouging--aren't going to be the complete answer.\n  To be sure, most of these proposals would do no harm, and many would \nprovide Americans some temporary relief at the pump. But in the long \nterm, we can't rely solely on quick fixes designed to placate an \nanxious public.\n  We need solutions designed to permanently lessen our dependence on \nforeign oil. Unfortunately, both Congress and the White House have been \nunwilling to take the politically difficult steps necessary to confront \none of the most pressing economic and national security challenges of \nthe 21st century.\n  A perfect example is the bill before us. It does do some good things: \nit marginally increases the supply of oil, and it provides a financial \nboost to Gulf Coast States that could use the help.\n  But fundamentally, the bill only focuses on part of the problem--our \ninadequate supply of oil. Unfortunately, increasing supply can't be our \nonly answer. Even if we opened up every square inch of this country for \ndrilling, America only has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. With \nour own Energy Department telling us that our demand for oil will jump \n40 percent over the next 20 years and countries such as China and India \nadding millions of cars to their roads, this means that if we truly \nhope to solve this problem, we must focus on reducing demand.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle have suggested some innovative \nways to do this. Senator Lugar and I introduced the America Fuels Act \nto increase the production of homegrown biofuels. And Senator Bunning \nand I have worked on a bill to produce liquid fuels from coal.\n  Unfortunately, we are not going to have a debate this week on how to \nreduce the demand for oil, because we weren't allowed to add any \namendments to this bill that would focus on that problem. Because \ncontrary to the judgment of every credible person who has examined our \nNation's energy woes, the Republican leadership in the Senate believes \nwe can solve our energy problems by just drilling more. That is not \nonly dishonest; it is a disservice to our constituents who want us to \nwork together to solve this crisis.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes today discussing two of the \nproposals that should have been part of this energy debate--two \nproposals that could have made this bill worthwhile.\n  First, we need to start producing cars that use less oil. Thirty-\nthree years ago, this Nation faced an energy crisis that affected every \nAmerican. In the shadow of a war against Israel, the Arab nations of \nOPEC chose to embargo shipments of crude oil to the West. The shocks \nwere felt in national economies worldwide. Washington lawmakers \nresponded by creating daylight savings time and a national speed limit. \nA new Department of Energy and a Strategic Petroleum Reserve was \nestablished. And Congress enacted Corporate Average Fuel Economy--or \nCAFE--standards, the first-ever requirements to reduce petroleum \nconsumption in the vehicles we drive.\n  As a result, the gas mileage of cars doubled from 14 miles per gallon \nin 1976 to 27.5 mpg for cars in 1985. Today, CAFE saves us about 3 \nmillion barrels of oil per day, making it among the most successful \nenergy-saving measures ever adopted. But that decade's worth of fuel \nconsumption improvements ended more than 20 years ago, because CAFE \nstandards are the same today as they were in 1985 27.5 mpg for cars.\n  To address this problem, I have joined with Senator Lugar and a \nbipartisan coalition of senators to propose the Fuel Economy Reform \nAct, which we have also filed as an amendment to the OCS bill.\n  This amendment would establish regular, continual, and incremental \nprogress in fuel economy, but still preserve the expertise and \nflexibility of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration--or \nNHTSA--to determine how to meet those targets.\n  Under this proposal, CAFE standards would increase by 4 percent every \nyear unless NHTSA can justify a deviation in that rate by proving that \nthe increase is either technologically unachievable, would materially \nreduce the safety of automobiles, or is not cost effective. For too \nlong, the presumption has been that the public would have to prove to \nthe auto industry why it should raise fuel economy standards. This \nproposal would flip that presumption by asking the auto industry to \nprove why it can't raise those standards.\n  Under this system, if the 4 percent annualized improvement occurs for \n10 years, we would save 1.3 million barrels of oil per day--an \nastounding 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year. If gasoline is just \n$2.50 per gallon, consumers would save $50 billion at the pump in 2018. \nBy 2018, we would be cutting global warming pollution by 220 million \nmetric tons of carbon-dioxide-equivalent gases.\n  And yet, auto executives are right when they say that transitioning \nto more fuel-efficient automobiles would be costly at a time of sagging \nprofits and stiff competition, and that's precisely why the Federal \nGovernment shouldn't let the industry face these challenges on their \nown.\n  The Fuel Economy Act provides tax incentives to retool parts and \nassembly plants. But we should do more than that. We need to help the \nBig Three automakers with one of their largest expenses, namely, \nretiree health care costs, which ran almost $6.7 billion just last \nyear. For GM, these health care costs represent $1,500 of the price of \nevery GM car that is made, which is more than what they pay for the \nsteel.\n  To that end, I also have filed an amendment to this bill based on the \nHealth Care for Hybrids Act that I introduced last year. That proposal \nwould set up a voluntary program in which automakers could choose to \nreceive Federal financial assistance towards their retiree health care \ncosts. In return, the automakers would be required to reinvest these \nsavings into developing fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  With the American consumer demanding more hybrid vehicles--and that \ndemand currently being filled by foreign automakers--this proposal \ncould jumpstart the Big Three to commercialize new technology. More \nAmerican hybrid cars also ensure that there is competition in this \ngrowing market, and would help keep car prices affordable.\n  If we had adopted these two proposals decades ago, when the call for \nenergy independence was first issued in this country, today we wouldn't \nbe nearly as beholden to the whims of oil-rich dictators and surging \ngas prices. And if we don't take these steps now, we will someday look \nback on today's $3 per gallon gasoline as the good old days. At that \npoint, no amount of drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf will solve \nour problems.\n  We could have taken these commonsense steps now to reduce the demand \nfor oil. We have the need, we have the technology, we have the \nresources--but with this bill, we refused to find the political will to \nget it done. We still owe it to the American public to find that will.\n  Unfortunately, this bill sends the wrong message. Instead of making \ntough political decisions about how to reduce our insatiable demand for \noil, this bill continues to lull the American people into thinking that \nwe can drill our way out of our energy problems. We can't, and for that \nreason, I plan to vote against this bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, yesterday, while the Senate was voting for \ncloture on S. 3711, a bill that could ultimately lead to exploration on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf of the Georges Bank in the North Atlantic \nOcean, the Maine lobster industry gathered on a picturesque fishing \npier in Maine to launch the ``Certified Maine Lobster'' initiative that \ncould bring an added value to the State's $300 million lobster \nindustry. My State accounts for 80 percent of lobster landings and is \nknown for its lobster boats, lobster shacks, lobster buoys and lobster \ndinners along its scenic coastline. As a matter of fact, the Maine \nLobstermen Association was formed to fight OCS drilling off the coast \nof Maine.\n  It is because of its very pristine value that fisheries and tourism \nare important economic engines for the State\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\nand I cannot stand by and let these natural resources be compromised \nthrough exploration and drilling. Last year, Maine lobstermen hauled in \nmore than 60 million pounds for a boat price of $296 million.\n  While supporters of, S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act \nof 2006, say that this bill is only about the Gulf of Mexico, while at \nthe same time stating that the bill is the first step toward opening up \nmore areas to production. One supporter was even quoted as saying, \n``The goal is to maximize over time the coastal production of America \nfrom a venue of stagnation.'' This does not sound like the bill \npertains only to the Gulf of Mexico, as its supporters have stated and \nthis has rightfully alarmed the people of my State, many who make their \nliving directly or indirectly from the sea. Scientists, economists, and \nfishermen have worked for 20 to 30 years to restore the magnificent \nfish runs off the New England coast. To them, lifting the moratorium \nand allowing oil and gas drilling on the 185-mile-long broad, shallow \nand productive fishing ground of Georges Bank that stretches from Nova \nScotia to Cape Cod is unconscionable.\n  As chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and the \nCoast Guard, the prospect of drilling in the Gulf of Maine and Georges \nBank and risking New England's fisheries is unacceptable to me as well. \nI, along with Senator Menendez, wanted to offer a simple amendment to \nensure that drilling within 200 miles of the coast of Maine and other \ncoastal States would continue to be prohibited until 2022--the same \nprotection as is given the State of Florida in this bill.\n  However, without following the usual amendment process, there can be \nno assurances that Maine's coast will be protected when this \nlegislation is approved by a conference or that the Joint Ocean \nCommission's recommendation to convert current OCS revenues for ocean \nfisheries research will occur, and without those assurances, I have not \nsupported moving forward.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the decision was made to prevent \namendments during debate that ignores the need to address conservation. \nWe were told it would take a week to get through amendments that would \nhave been offered. Well, this bill was brought up 1 week ago, and, \ninstead of having true and fair debates on conservation amendments this \npast week and up or down votes, we have spent it on moving to cloture \nand getting to final passage.\n  I believe that considering the leasing of additional OCS waters for \noil and gas drilling should only be done with utmost caution and \ndeliberation, and at the same time, I believe that our national energy \npolicy should seriously focus resources on the development of renewable \nenergy and an expansion of energy efficiencies as part of a national \nenergy policy.\n  I have filed an amendment to this bill that is also my stand alone \nbill, S. 3628, the EXTEND Energy Efficiency Incentives Act of 2006, \nthat would extend the EPAct 2005 energy efficiency tax incentives until \n2010--they currently expire at the end of next year having been \nshortened by the House in conference. Experts have calculated that, if \nfully implemented, the EXTEND Act will, by 2010, save 7 trillion cubic \nfeet, Tcf, of natural gas while the Gulf of Mexico drilling bill before \nus would extract 5.8 Tcf by 2010. We simply cannot continue to drill \nourselves out of this problem, and threaten our natural resources--we \ncan do it with bold ideas that save much more than we can get from \ndrilling.\n  A reliance on only fossil fuels retards progress in developing a \nsustainable and comprehensive 21st century energy policy. Furthermore, \nthe recent fluctuation of the world oil and natural gas markets \nindicates that this commodity is not a reliable long-term energy \nsource. There are uncertainties involved with fossil fuels that \nthreatens the energy security of the United States and it is important \nthat our nation recognize the situation and develop a diverse, \nsustainable and progressive energy plan through a market basket of \nfossil fuels, renewable energy and energy efficiencies.\n  Senator Feinstein and I were not allowed to offer our 10 in 10 bill \nas an amendment to this bill to require U.S. automakers to increase \ntheir average CAFE standards by 10 miles per gallon in 10 years. The \nbill would save 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2025, the same \namount of oil we currently import from the Persian Gulf; and 420 \nmillion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2025, the equivalent \nof taking 90 million cars--or 75 million cars and light trucks--off the \nroad in one year. Again, we can save rather than drill.\n  Exxon Mobil, the world's largest traded oil company, just reported a \n36 percent gain in 2nd earnings. Exxon has prospered because of the \nhigh gasoline prices bolstered by the demand for supply. Increasing \nCAFE standards will decrease demand, lower prices and begin to put some \nof this money in the pockets of consumers rather than the large oil \ncompanies, who have increased output and taken advantage of the \nincrease in oil prices, which remain over $70 a barrel.\n  The small increase from the latest NHTSA rule for CAFE standards for \nSUVs does little to save gasoline and only gives lipservice to an issue \nthat deserves more serious consideration. Even a modest increase of \nonly five miles per gallon in the fuel efficiency of our domestic \nautomotive fleet would save approximately 23 billion gallons of \ngasoline each year and reduce oil imports by 14 percent.\n  This percentage is more than the 11 percent Venezuela provides for \nU.S. oil imports. The GAO reports that the U.S. is inadequately \nprepared to face the possibility of President Hugo Chavez' threat to \ncut off its oil imports to the U.S. The GAO reports that this \ndisruption would cause an increase of $11 per barrel. So we are \nallowing Chavez to put us over a diplomatic oil barrel, so to speak. \nWhy are we taking this risk with the trust of the American people and \nthe economy when there are options that can be put in place to make us \nindependent of Venezuela's oil--and political maneuvering?\n  Currently, the combined fleet average for all automobiles, SUVs, \nlight trucks and passenger cars, is approximately 25 miles per gallon--\nthat is down from the peak of 26.2 miles per gallon in 1987. The \nFeinstein-Snowe-Inouye-Chafee 10 in 10 bill would increase that \ncombined fleet average to 35 miles per gallon by Model Year 2017--or \nten mpgs 10 years from today.\n  Also, according to the 2002 National Academy of Sciences Report on \nCAFE, adequate lead time can bring about substantive increases in fuel \neconomy standards. The NAS concluded that automakers can meet higher \nCAFE standards with existing technologies. We have the technologies \ntoday to increase our fuel economy standards. We have hybrids, more \nefficient engine technology, improved transmission technology, and \ncomposite materials that reduce the weight of the vehicle will all \nincrease fuel economy standards without sacrificing safety.\n  I fear that the Senate conferees will come back from a conference \nwith many of the provisions in the House bill, the Deep Ocean Resources \nAct, H.R 4761, a bill that replaces the moratorium that currently \nprotects most of the nation's coastline from oil and natural gas \ndrilling and develops a leasing system that would provide the option \nfor states to allow drilling within 50 miles of their coastlines and \nallow drilling throughout the OCS beyond 100 miles. Currently, the \nmoratorium protects the coastal area up to 200 miles out.\n  In passing this OCS drilling only bill today, the Senate has created \nlost opportunities that could have addressed how much we could save--\nalong with how much we can drill. This is what the consumers want to \nhear--that we are addressing every avenue possible to keep money in \ntheir pockets the next time they go to the gas pump or pay their \nelectricity bill or purchase heating oil for the coming winter. The \nSenate has let the consumers down once again. And, the bill does \nnothing to protect Maine's tourist and fishing economies and its 3,500 \nmiles of coastline.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, once again, this body has missed a \nchance to pass responsible, effective legislation responding to the \nvery real and very pressing energy needs of this country. While there \nmay be pieces of S. 3711 that have merit, I did not support cloture and \nI will not vote in favor of the final bill.\n  I voted to allow the Senate to consider S. 3711 in the hope that we \nmight\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\nhave a serious discussion of the bill, including debating and voting on \namendments to improve it. While the bill only addresses one part of our \nenergy needs, it could have provided an opportunity for the Senate to \nfinally address a broad range of energy issues. Unfortunately, Senators \nwere prevented from offering amendments, so there was no opportunity to \naddress, for example, efficiency, conservation, renewable fuels, or \neven global warming. The result is another missed opportunity to pass \nthe comprehensive energy legislation that our constituents are looking \nfor.\n  In addition to opposing the flawed process for consideration of S. \n3711, I have grave concerns about the fiscal implications of the \nlegislation. This bill will redirect billions of dollars in Federal \nrevenues to just four States. While I agree that we have a \nresponsibility to ensure that Federal dollars are going to important \nactivities like protecting and restoring coastal wetlands, I do not \nbelieve that doing so requires creation of a new entitlement for a \nhandful of States. If enacted, S. 3711 will have massive long-term and \nnegative consequences. For example, in 2017, the loss to the taxpayers \nof the country is estimated to be over $590 million a year, jumping to \nover $1.2 billion per year in 2022. Adding it all up, you get a total \nlikely loss of over $170 billion over 60 years. I am not prepared to \nsupport such a massive drain on the Federal Treasury for the benefit of \na few States and I urge my colleagues to oppose S. 3711.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I believe that as part of a balanced \nenergy policy, we need to expand domestic oil and gas production where \nit has local support and can do so in an environmentally sound way. I \nthink the bill before the Senate meets that test, and that is why I am \nvoting for it. However, I want to make it clear that New Yorkers do not \nsupport drilling off Long Island, or in the Finger Lakes, or in the \nGreat Lakes, and I will vehemently oppose any bill that would open any \nof these areas up for drilling. With that in mind, I am concemed about \nconferencing the Senate bill with the House bill, but I have been \nassured by Senator Reid that he will oppose efforts to expand drilling \nbeyond the areas included in the Senate bill. In addition, I am \ndisappointed that Senator Frist chose to block all amendments to this \nbill. Expanding domestic supplies is only a partial solution to our \nenergy problems. It is even more important that we take steps to \nincrease energy efficiency and to expand production of renewable \nenergy. I filed amendments to this bill to accomplish those goals, but \nwas not afforded the opportunity to offer them. I will continue to urge \nSenator Frist to schedule time to consider these and other bills that \noffer a more comprehensive long-term solution to our Nation's energy \nproblems.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am in opposition to the bill before us \nthat opens up new areas in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling. \nI don't dispute that the oil and natural gas that may be harvested as a \nresult of this legislation could be useful, and I would support \ndrilling from some new sources--if the value of doing so is not \noutweighed by the risks to our environment and economies. But it is not \na solution to our energy problems.\n  Here we are, yet again, with a so-called ``energy'' plan that only \noffers one plan for our energy security crisis: drilling. That is not \nmuch of a plan. That is not going to free our foreign policy. That is \nnot going to lower prices at the pump.\n  We consume a quarter of the oil in the world, but we have less than 2 \npercent of the world's reserves--that 2 percent includes the areas \nunder debate today. If we tapped all the reserves in Alaska, the Gulf \nof Mexico and off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, we would increase \noutput by 2 million barrels a day by 2020. Yet our consumption is \nexpected to rise to 25 million and world consumption to 110 million, so \nthe impact on price and energy security would be minimal. Drops in the \nbucket.\n  We need a real energy policy, a real path toward energy security. For \ninstance, we can make the biggest difference and have the most \nimmediate impact by reducing oil consumption where we use it most: the \ntransportation sector. That's why I have proposed four steps to begin \nthe transition to alternative fuels and make us more energy secure: (1) \n100 percent of cars running on alternative fuels; (2) 50 percent of \nmajor gas stations selling it; (3) 25 percent farm-grown fuel; (4) 1 \nmile per gallon more fuel efficient each year.\n  And if we are going to drill in new areas, we need to make sure we do \nit right, and not bypass the appropriately careful process and \nenvironmental reviews that are required by the Outer Continental Shelf \nLands Act. The leadership put this bill before the Senate and said: \n``take it or leave it.'' This bill could have been much better, and I \nfear that the bill that will come back from the House will be much \nworse.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote on final passage \nof S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. I will be voting \nagainst passage because I believe this bill is poor energy policy, \nirresponsible fiscal policy, and faulty environmental policy.\n  The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act is a misnomer. The bill will \nnot offer energy security to the United States. The United States \nconsumes 25 percent of the world's energy and yet we have less than 3 \npercent of the world's oil supplies. While I agree that we must \nincrease the domestic supply of oil and natural gas, this cannot be our \nNation's only approach. Yet it is the only approach offered in S. 3711, \nand it is the only approach that the administration and Republican \nleadership continue to propose as our Nation's energy solution. Our \nNation's energy security depends on reducing our dependency on fossil \nfuels through increased energy efficiency, greater investment in \nrenewable energy, and development of alternative fuels to replace oil. \nBut this bill does nothing to increase fuel efficiency standards for \nautomobiles, create a national renewable energy standard for \nelectricity, or promote energy efficiency or renewable energy. In fact, \nFederal investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy continues \nto decline. It is imperative for our Nation's energy and economic \nsecurity that an energy policy that increases supply must be married to \nmeaningful investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. This \nis the energy policy that our Nation deserves, but it is not the one \nbefore us today.\n  S. 3711 is also not sound fiscal policy. This legislation would \nmandate that almost 38 percent of revenue from Federal resources \ngenerated by new leases in the Gulf of Mexico be given to four States--\nAlabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. These are revenues that \ncurrently would be provided to the U.S. Treasury for the benefit of the \nNation as a whole. Reducing revenue to the Treasury means that we, as a \nnation, will have fewer resources available in the future to respond to \na call for help should there be another devastating natural disaster or \nterrorism attack. Our Nation faces a deficit of $8.4 trillion due to \nthis administration's poor fiscal management and irresponsible tax \npolicies. Large Federal budget deficits going forward are bad for the \neconomy. They reduce national saving, which depresses future standards \nof living. Reducing Federal receipts and increasing the budget deficit \nat the same time as the baby boom generation retires will put increased \nstrains on the Federal budget and makes no sense. This bill, if passed, \nwill cost the Federal Treasury billions of dollars. I am not alone in \nmy opposition to this legislation; taxpayer advocates share my concerns \nover its fiscal impact.\n  In the early 1950s, Congress considered the allocation of revenues \nbetween the Federal Government and States resulting from drilling in \nour Nation's waters. During the debate last week on S. 3711, I quoted \nfrom a speech that Senator Truman gave at the National Convention \nBanquet of the Americans for Democratic Action on May 17, 1952. \nPresident Truman stated in this speech, ``The minerals that lie under \nthe sea off the coasts of this country belong to the Federal \nGovernment''----that is, to all the people of this country. The \nownership has been affirmed and reaffirmed in the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. Those rights may be worth as much as somewhere between \n$40 billion and $100 billion.\n  If we back down on our determination to hold these rights for all the \npeople, we will act to rob them of this great national asset. That is \njust what the oil lobby wants. They want us to\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\nturn the vast treasure over to a handful of States, where the powerful \nprivate oil interests hope to exploit it to suit themselves.\n  Twice President Truman vetoed quitclaim legislation passed by \nCongress to turn these resources over to the coastal States. In his May \n29, 1952, veto statement, President Truman said ``[T]he Congress should \nprovide for the disposition of the revenues obtained from oil and gas \nleases on the undersea lands. S.J. Res. 20, as introduced by Senators \nO'Mahoney and Anderson, would have granted the adjacent coastal States \n37\\1/2\\ percent of the revenues from submerged lands of the marginal \nsea. I would have not object to such a provision, which is similar to \nexisting provisions under which the State receive 37\\1/2\\ percent of \nthe revenues from the Federal Government's oil-producing public lands \nwithin their borders.'' In his veto statement, it is clear that \nPresident Truman did not support giving coastal States revenue from the \nOuter Continental Shelf.\n\n  In the end, the coastal States received much more generous \ncompensation than the provision offered by Senators O'Mahoney and \nAnderson and President Truman. When President Eisenhower signed the \nSubmerged Lands Act, the coastal States were given title to and \nownership of the lands beneath the territorial seas and the right to \nmanage the natural resources within the States' boundaries. This law \ngave the States 100 percent of the revenue from coastal drilling in \nState waters. Importantly, the law affirmed the Federal Government's \nownership in lands seaward of the State boundaries. Revenues from Outer \nContinental Shelf drilling belong to the American people in all 50 \nStates. The legislation that the Senate is considering today violates \nthis pact with the American people, and denies the Federal Treasury and \nAmerican people of essential revenue to address the needs of our Nation \nit violates. It also is contrary to our national motto, E pluribus \nunum, from many one. Revenues from Federal resources should, and must, \nbenefit all Americans.\n  Lastly, I believe this bill is not responsible environmental policy. \nThe bill threatens our coastal ecosystems with the risk of pollution \nand oilspills which will harm the economies and families that rely on \nthese resources. Unfortunately, the Senate is likely to pass this bill. \nThis will pave the way for the Senate bill to be conferenced with H.R. \n4761, the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act. This legislation would lift \nthe moratorium on offshore drilling for all of our coastlines the \nAtlantic, Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska--and, it would allow \ndrilling for oil and gas in coastal national parks and marine \nsanctuaries. This would put our coastal communities at risk to \noilspills, onshore damage of sensitive coastal habitat, and air and \nwater pollution.\n  Oil is extremely toxic and our current cleanup methods are incapable \nof removing more than a small fraction of the oil spilled into our \nmarine waters. Offshore drilling platforms and pipelines spilled 1.8 \nmillion gallons of oil in U.S. waters from 1990 to 1999, for an average \nof 500 gallons a day, which causes irreversible harm.\n  Narragansett Bay and our coast support vital commercial fisheries, \ntourism important to our economy, and an abundance of wildlife. Our \neconomy and environment are vulnerable to oilspills. My State remembers \nthe devastating effects that the North Cape oil-spill had in southern \nRhode Island. Oil spread throughout a large area of Block Island Sound, \nincluding Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge, resulting in the \nclosure of a 250-square mile area of the sound for fishing. There were \nhundreds of oiled birds in the weeks following the spill and large \nnumbers of dead lobsters, surf clams, and sea stars were found on area \nbeaches. There was also the World Prodigy oilspill off Newport, RI, \nwhich spread over 123 square miles, killing marine life and closing \nbeaches and fishing grounds throughout Narragansett Bay. The spill hit \nduring a peak spawning period. Eggs and larvae of fish and shellfish \nlobsters, quahogs, tautog, and others--were exposed to the oil as they \nfloated at the surface.\n  Before opening new lands to development and denying the American \npeople of a great asset and Federal revenues, we need to take \nmeaningful action to reduce our consumption and increase renewable \nenergy supplies. The only way to achieve greater energy independence is \nto reduce our consumption of fossil fuels overall. This is the energy \npolicy that our Nation deserves, and this is the policy I will continue \nto fight for. I urge the Senate to reject S. 3711, and instead, pursue \nthe vehicles and rule choices and the clean EDGE legislation that will \nset America on a true road to energy independence.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today \nin support of legislation that expands access to domestically produced \noil and natural gas by opening new areas for exploration in the Gulf of \nMexico.\n  Earlier this spring, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee took action on a similar bill introduced by Senators Bingaman \nand Domenici. That bill provided the framework for today's action by \ngarnering an important, early consensus on the need to bring on-line \nadditional gas and oil reserves. As a member of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, I supported moving that earlier version \nthrough the Energy Committee with the goal of lowering energy input \ncosts for agriculture producers, and manufacturers.\n  This bill strikes an appropriate balance by focusing on Outer \nContinental Shelf lands located in relative close proximity to the \nexisting infrastructure of natural gas gathering and distribution lines \nnecessary to deliver oil and gas to consumers. When compared to a \ncompeting version passed by the House of Representatives that throws \nlong-standing environmental provisions and drilling moratoriums out the \nwindow, the Senate bill is a reasoned and responsible bill. I do, \nhowever, share the concerns of many other Senators that the final \nlegislation cannot include many of the damaging provisions included in \nthe House of Representatives-passed bill. I will do my best to convince \nmy colleagues in the coming weeks that the best, quickest path toward \nbringing more than 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to market is \nthrough a conference report that maintains the key aspects of the \nSenate bill.\n  I also want to let my colleagues know that I am determined to ensure \nthat a final bill include additional funds for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, as well as wildlife habitat funding through the \nPittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Account. I introduced an \namendment cosponsored by Senator Lincoln that seeks to use a portion of \nthe royalties, rents, and bonus bids from Lease Sale 181 South after \n2017 for this important purpose. Should Congress make the determination \nto direct a portion of the royalties from these Outer Continental Shelf \nlands for the restoration of lands from the Gulf of Mexico producing \nStates, then those revenues should be sufficient to increase the amount \ndedicated from these leases to the 46 other States of this Nation.\n  Again, I rise in support of S. 3711 and will vote in favor of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, during this hot, sultry, high-gas-price \nsummer, I urge the American people to take a minute to observe the U.S. \nSenate. Take just a few minutes from the daily challenges of coping \nwith the kids, driving them from camp to soccer grounds, going to \nchurch, worrying about how to cobble together enough money to manage \neven a brief family outing, and watching nightly news coverage of the \nMiddle East imploding to focus, just briefly, on what is happening, or \nrather not happening, on this Senate floor.\n  Instead of working to pass necessary legislation like the 11 \nremaining appropriations bills, which are now jammed up and waiting for \nmovement like the cars in a typical rush hour on the Washington \nbeltway, we are engaged in yet another leadership-driven message dance. \nThese fandangoes feature bills which are meant to drive home political \npoints to the unsuspecting American voter.\n  The latest entry in this catalog of message bills is S. 3711, the \nGulf of Mexico Energy bill, a bill cobbled together by the majority and \nthen presented to the full Senate to vote on without opportunity for \namendments.\n  To anyone in these United States who is tempted to swallow the line \nthat this sham bill now on the Senate floor is a solution to high \npetroleum and natural gas prices, I say think\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\nagain. Desperate politicians eager to invent a vote which can serve as \nthe 30-second add solution to the hot-button issue of high energy \nprices are out to hoodwink the public again, this time with this very \nbad idea.\n  Well, this Senator is very weary of message bills that lie to the \npublic. Here is the plain truth about the U.S. supply of oil and the \nworld supply of oil. We are running out, and we will reach that peak in \noil in the not-too-distant future. U.S. production peaked 30 years ago. \nThat is why the U.S. imports two thirds of the oil it consumes, and \nthat consumption is about 20 million barrels per day. As far as U.S. \nsupplies go, if the United States were, for some reason, suddenly \ndependent on only our own supply, we would hit empty very soon. That is \nthe cold, hard truth. There isn't much oil left to pump in these United \nStates, and pumping it will not make one iota of difference in the \nprice of gasoline, because oil is a global commodity and is bought and \nsold on the international market.\n  After the oil is gone, the fuel of choice is another finite source \nnatural gas. Who leads the race in that new energy game? None other \nthan nations such as Russia and Iran, because they are the top two \nglobal natural gas reserve holders. If that makes you sleep well at \nnight or suggests to you the emergence of lower energy prices, I would \nhave to say I beg to disagree.\n  The only course of action which will lead to lower, more reliable, \nmore secure energy and energy prices is a strong national commitment to \ninvesting in greater energy efficiency and developing alternate energy \nsources--and the sooner we get started the better.\n  The President likes to say that the solution to high gas prices is to \nbuild more refineries. I do not disagree that it would be useful to \nbuild more refineries because we have not built any since the 1970s. \nHowever that is not a short-term solution, nor is it a simplistic, \nlong-term solution to high gas prices. It takes too long to build \nrefineries for refineries to be a short-term solution. And we are \nrunning out of oil, so refineries cannot be a long-term solution.\n  The solution, of course, is the development of a variety of \nalternative energy sources. Crude oil currently costs something like \n$74 per barrel, and that price will certainly go up. Nuclear power \nplants can be hazardous, especially in this age of terrorism. Clean \ncoal liquefaction technologies are promising because the good ole U.S. \nof A. is by far the global leader in proven coal supplies. Remember \nthat half of all U.S. electric power comes from coal. But, there has \nbeen no real robust commitment to clean coal technologies, industrial \ngasification, and coal liquefaction by this administration.\n  Yet this bill--this message bill--this bumper sticker solution to \nAmerican distress over high gas prices is a pathetic attempt to foist a \nfake promise upon the people, which the American people ought not \nswallow. It will do little or nothing to bring down gas prices or \nnatural gas costs. It is also just very bad legislation. Let me tell \nyou why.\n  This proposed offshore drilling in Florida waters is not worth the \nenvironmental risk. The total amount of oil which could be extracted \nfrom this new drilling will equal around 55 days of American \nconsumption at current usage rates. Consider also the time it will take \nto develop this region--to deploy the rigs, pump, refine, and transport \nthese products, and anyone who cogitates for just 30 seconds will \nclearly see that this drilling will do nothing to bring down gas prices \nin the near term.\n  Furthermore, the generous revenue sharing plan aimed at buying the \nvotes of coastal State Senators could well have an impact on our future \nFederal funding needs. The robust payments to just four Gulf-producing \nStates which will not be offset by the oil and gas generated by this \nnew offshore drilling could cause holes in the Federal treasury which \nwould impact programs that would benefit States like West Virginia.\n  This bill is a bad deal for State and 45 other States, which can \noffer alternative fuels to blunt our dependence on oil. We are not \nallowed to consider amendments to this bill. A yes vote for this bill \ndoes nothing to help coal, ethanol, solar, and wind technologies \nbecause it propagates the myth of continued dependence on oil and gas. \nA yes vote lies to the American public, because it says Joe Citizen can \ncontinue economically drive a gas powered automobile if only we drill a \nfew more holes in the fragile gulf coast shoreline.\n  A yes vote on this bill says to the American public, don't bother to \nincrease energy efficiency or produce alternative fuels. It says don't \npush the powers that be to stop gauging and start producing \ntransportation that does not depend on a dwindling supply of scarce and \never increasingly expensive oil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 5 p.m. is equally divided. The \nminority side currently has 53 minutes, and the majority side has 25 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if somebody comes, I will be willing to \nenter into a different consent agreement, if somebody comes seeking the \nfloor on the other side, but I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business but with the time to be running as it \nnormally would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an amendment I \nwould have offered to the energy legislation that is before us. It \nshould be my right as a Senator to offer such an amendment. It should \nbe the right of any Senator to offer an amendment to legislation \npending before the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, because of parliamentary maneuvering by the majority \nleader, Senators, including myself, will not be able to offer our \namendments to this offshore drilling legislation. In the Senate \nvernacular, ``the tree has been filled'' with such gimmicks as changing \nthe bill's effective date and then changing it back again. Those \ngimmicks restrict this legislation to being nothing more than a special \ninterest boondoggle for the oil and natural gas industries, and for \nfour Gulf States that would, for the first time, get a direct cut of \nthat bonanza.\n  It is one thing to limit debate on a measure, as the Senate has \nchosen to do in this instance, and even though I voted against cloture, \nI can understand the desire of over 60 colleagues to proceed; but to \nprevent additional amendments related to our country's domestic energy \nproduction and consumption is uncalled for and unwise.\n  It makes a mockery of the Republican leader's promise on May 1 of \nthis year, 3 months ago, that the Senate would vote this year on \ncomprehensive energy legislation. His exact words were:\n\n       We [the Republican leadership] have presented a strong \n     package that will give consumers relief at the pump and help \n     bring down the high cost of gas. I'm hopeful that we will \n     vote on this package in the coming days.\n\n  As we all know, the remaining days in this Congress are coming and \ngoing. In fact, they are almost gone. If the Senate were going to take \nup the Republican energy package or a Democratic energy package or, \nbest of all, an American energy package, this would seem to be our \nchance to do so. Instead, we get a special interest boondoggle, and we \nare not even allowed to offer amendments that could make it the \ncomprehensive energy bill the Republican leader promised us.\n  This bill's authors have entitled it the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act of 2006, but that title says our future energy security is \nmore of the same--more of the same energy sources at ever higher \nprices, with ever greater profits to the major oil and gas companies, \nand, for the first time, with 37.5 percent of the public revenues going \nto\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\nonly four Gulf States. Under this legislation, 50 percent of the public \nrevenues would go into the Federal Treasury, 12.5 percent would go to \nall of the States under the LAWCON program. As I said before, 37.5 \npercent would go directly to the four States--Louisiana, Texas, \nAlabama, and Mississippi.\n  This virtually unprecedented arrangement is a great deal for those \nfour States. No wonder their eight Senators strongly support it. I have \nto begrudgingly congratulate the Senators from Louisiana, Texas, \nAlabama, and Mississippi. They have done an excellent job in writing \nthis legislation to benefit their States. So I certainly understand \ntheir support for this brand of revenuesharing.\n\n  What I don't understand is why the other 92 of us would agree to it. \nThe offshore waters of the Gulf Coast belong to all Americans, as do \nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Great Lakes, and other national \nresources. This is a terrible precedent--to allow a few States to \nbenefit at the expense of the rest simply because of their proximity to \na national resource--not their ownership of it, just the proximity to \nit. If Congress opens this door, watch for the stampede of parochial \nclaims for a cut of every other Federal natural resource.\n  Also sadly lacking from this bill is any kind of windfall profits tax \non the major oil companies that are its principal beneficiaries. It is \nappalling that, at a time when Americans are paying $3 or more a gallon \nfor gasoline and the oil giants such as ExxonMobil are enjoying record \nhigh profits, there is no attempt in this bill to recapture any of \nthose profits for the American people or for the public purposes that \nwould benefit them.\n  This legislation opens a public resource, gift wraps most of its \nvalue, and hand delivers billions and billions of those dollars to \nspecial corporate interests at the expense of the American citizens in \n46 States. How the elected representatives of those 46 States could \nallow this to happen is astonishing. I hope the residents of those \nStates will demand some answers. Those citizens should also ask why \nnothing in this so-called Energy Security Act provides any energy \nsecurity at all. At best, it will provide a relatively small additional \nsupply of oil and natural gas for a relatively few years starting, at \nbest, several years from now, supplies for which consumers will likely \npay even higher prices than they are today.\n  Someone once said the definition of insanity is to keep doing the \nsame thing and hope for a different result. If so, this continuation of \na national energy strategy is insane. We cannot produce our way to \nenergy self-sufficiency when consumers have no alternatives to those \ntraditional energy sources. This bill does nothing to provide Americans \nwith any of those energy alternatives--not today, tomorrow, or 10 years \nfrom now. None of us in the Senate are being given the opportunity to \noffer any of those alternatives to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have introduced legislation that would encourage the \nadditional production and use of biofuels, specifically ethanol and \nbiodiesel. My amendment to this bill would help give more Americans a \nchoice every time they fill up their fuel tanks between gasoline or \ndiesel and lower cost alternatives, such as E-85, comprised of 85 \npercent ethanol, biodiesel made out of soybeans, and other agricultural \ncommodities, and even out of animal renderings.\n  These energy sources are not buried under miles of water or ocean \nfloor located miles and miles away. They are right in our agricultural \nStates. They are renewable every year. They are cleaner burning than \ntraditional fossil-based fuels and they provide additional boosts to \nfarmers in rural communities around the Nation, where local economies \ndepend upon a healthy agricultural economy. They boost the market \nprices in the marketplace for those commodities, meaning they lower \ntaxpayer subsidies. It is a win-win-win for all Americans; yet we are \nnot allowed to offer these additional kinds of incentives and expansion \nof these and other energy fuels, conservation, and other ways that we \ncan truly enhance our energy security.\n  For those reasons, I oppose this legislation and, most of all, I \noppose the tactics used in this bill to prevent it from becoming what \nit should be, what the American people need and certainly deserve, \nwhich is comprehensive energy legislation that will provide real energy \nsecurity for our country, lower cost energy supplies now and for years \nto come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to congratulate \nthe Senate in advance of a vote at 5 o'clock which is going to \ndemonstrate the Senate at its best--a bipartisan accomplishment of \nextraordinary importance, particularly to the area of the country that \nthe occupant of the chair represents. I know Senator Vitter has for \nmany years wanted to achieve something related to the gulf coast \ndeepwater exploration issue that would benefit his State. We are on the \nverge of having that remarkable success.\n  Particular kudos to Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, who was absolutely indispensable in pulling together the \nvarious elements that did come together for this bipartisan \naccomplishment; Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, who protected the \ncoastline of his State while still helping to lead the way in a \ndirection that allowed this compromise to go forward; Senator Landrieu \nfor delivering a significant number of Democrats who were, of course, \nneeded in order to make this a bipartisan proposal; and to all of the \nGulf Coast States as well as all the other Senators whose States will \nindeed benefit from the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  As I said, this is the Senate at its finest. I congratulate all those \nwho have been integral parts of bringing about this important \nbipartisan achievement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this truly is going to be quite a vote \nin just a few minutes as the Senate has decided to have a vote at 5 \no'clock on the Gulf of Mexico Energy Independence Act.\n  Mr. President, you have been particularly helpful in putting this \nbill together, along with other gulf coast Senators.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to thank so many people who have helped \nto make this bill possible. It was many months in the working, many, \nmany negotiations and meetings that went on to produce a bill that is \nnot only going to be of extraordinary help to the great State of \nLouisiana and to all the Gulf Coast States as we try to restore our \ncoastline, restore our marshlands, stop the erosion, and build the \nlevees and the floodgates that are so imperative and critical to the \nprotection of our people, our communities, large and small, but it is \nalso a bill that is so important for this Nation as we seek to increase \nthe supply of oil and gas produced in this country so we don't have to \nrely on oil and gas coming in from unfriendly and unstable places.\n  It took a tremendous amount of work for this bill to be put together. \nI begin by thanking particularly Senator Domenici who, as the chairman \nof the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for many years, has \nserved as ranking member for some of those years, has led on the issue \nof energy in almost every aspect, trying to help us increase supply, \ndiversify supply, and come together on conservation measures that are \nimportant for the Nation.\n  I also thank Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader. Without his \nsupport, we would not have been able to get the Democratic votes \nnecessary to join in a bipartisan spirit to provide revenuesharing for \nthe Gulf Coast States, to establish for the first time a real \nconservation royalty for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and in a \ngreat way contribute to the reduction\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\nof the deficit by encouraging production where we can get new \nproduction, therefore generating more revenues for the Nation. Senator \nHarry Reid is from Nevada, a State that has produced great natural \nresources for the country. He understands the balance in this policy.\n  I thank Senator Bill Frist and Senator Mitch McConnell. Senator \nDomenici is in the Senate now. He is scheduled to speak, so I will wrap \nup. I thank Senator Bill Frist and Senator Mitch McConnell for helping \nto pull the Senate together to keep us working on this good, balanced \ncompromise.\n  I thank the Senators from the gulf coast, of course, including the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Louisiana, as well as Senator Lott, \nSenator Shelby, Senator Sessions, Senator Cochran, Senator Hutchison, \nand Senator Cornyn. None of this would have been possible without the \ngulf coast Senators coming together and agreeing how to share the \nmoney, how to proceed. I thank the Senators from Florida, Senator \nMartinez and Senator Nelson, as well.\n  There is a list of staffers I will have printed in the Record, \nstarting with my own staff, Janet Woodka, legislative director; Jason \nMatthews; Tom Michels; Elizabeth Craddock; and Ron Faucheaux; a list of \nstaffers representing all the Senators who were instrumental in the \npassing of this bill. I thank them very much, particularly Frank \nMacciorola with Senator Domenici and the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee who led this effort with Bruce Evans. It would not \nhave been possible without the help of Libby Jarvis from Senator \nFrist's office.\n  The staff have put in the long hours and I thank them for all of \ntheir hard work. That staff includes: Chris Miller, Senator Reid; Frank \nMacciorola, Senator Domenici, Senate Energy Committee; Bruce Evans, \nSenator Domenici, Senate Energy Committee; Libby Jarvis, Senator Frist; \nKyle Simmons and Malloy McDaniel, Senator McConnell; Jim Sartucii and \nAnnie Estrada, Senator Lott; Garrett Graves, Senator Vitter; Ryan \nWelch, Senator Shelby; Marie Thomas, Senator Cochran; Jamie Moore, \nSenator Hutchison; Spencer Chambers, Senator Cornyn; Dan Shapiro and \nBridget Walsh, Senator Bill Nelson; Brydon Ross, Senator Martinez; \nStephen Boyd, Senator Sessions.\n  I also thank all of my staff--they have all worked hard over the \nyears-- and in particular, my energy team: Tom Michels, Elizabeth \nCraddock, Janet Woodka, Jason Matthews, and Ron Faucheaux.\n  Any my former staff-who have laid the groundwork and built this issue \nup over the past 10 years to get us to where we are today--most notably \nJason Schendle, who has been a tremendous resource and advocate, \nKathleen Strottman, Dionne Thomas, and Neil Naraine.\n  Finally, I thank Senator J. Bennett Johnston, whose seat I now occupy \nand my great friend, Senator John Breaux.\n  I see Senator Domenici in the Senate. I thank him for his \nextraordinary leadership in helping the Nation break through on new \ndrilling for the first time in many decades.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana for her kind remarks and for her great support in this \neffort.\n  The junior Senator from Louisiana, who is the Presiding Officer, I \nthank now for the support and dedicated commitment to what we are \ndoing. It is not only for the State of Louisiana, but for all the \ncoastal States surrounding Louisiana. It is very important for the \nUnited States. I commend the Senator for his participation.\n  I would like to thank a Senator who was vital. He was courageous. He \nstepped forward, as Senators from Florida have not been used to doing. \nThat was Senator Mel Martinez, who came forward and said: I would like \nto work with you. And he ended up striking a balance for his people of \nFlorida and for America. And he, along with the others we have \nmentioned, got us going.\n  It has been a pleasure taking this job on and to end up tonight, 10 \nminutes before the vote, with the full appreciation on the part of \nscores of Senators that we are about to do something very positive, \nvery important. For a change, very few Senators will still have to say \nno. Most of the time it is hard to get 60 votes for cloture. Many times \nit is hard to get that 51 needed for a simple majority.\n  Over the weeks, and finally over the days, the point has come across \nto the bipartisan Senators in this Senate, this bill is welcome news \nfor the consumers of the United States, for homeowners, families, \npeople who work in all kinds of manufacturing businesses, chemical \nbusinesses, plastic businesses, all kinds of activities related to \nnatural gas. Of course, there is oil involved, too, but that is \nsecondary to the natural gas which is also involved.\n  It has finally dawned on everyone here, we own a piece of property. \nIt has USA stamped all over it. It is off the coast of Florida, off the \ncoast of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, out there in the gulf. There \nare roughly 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas owned by us, much of \nwhich is ready to be drilled, much of which can be drilled during the \nnext decade. There is enough gas for 6 million houses for 15 years, to \nquantify it. That does not mean that is where it is going. It will be \nadded to the availability of the supply and 1.250 billion barrels of \noil. It has finally dawned on everyone. Now we will get their vote. \nThat is all on our property. We have been sitting idly by, year after \nyear, saying no, no, no, because we want a moratorium to protect \nsomething that needed no protection, the shoreline of Florida. I don't \nmean that literally. I mean we can drill on this property as provided \nin this bill with no damage yet, after we have sat here year after year \nsaying no.\n  It does not happen very often, I say to my distinguished assistant \nRepublican leader, but at the very time and day that we are voting, the \nbest evidence you can get is right on the streets, in the homes, and on \nthe television news for the American people to hear, see, and, \nincidentally, feel: We have had these enormous heat waves and the use \nof natural gas has jumped so much. That creates a scarcity; that \ncreates an increase in price. Yesterday, the day before this vote, the \nprice increased 11 percent in 1 day. Right now, it is $8.05 per million \nBtus. That price is four times higher than it was 6 years ago. That is \nincredible, but it is true.\n  Fellow Senators, when you vote tonight to add 1.2 million barrels, if \nthis went to the President and got signed, we instantly add it to the \nready reserves of America for crude oil waiting to be drilled and put \ninto the system. Members would be voting to instantly add to our ready \nreserves of natural gas which we could start getting on the market in \nthe not too distant future, almost 6 trillion cubic feet.\n  We have a crisis right in front of our nose and we have a partial \ncure right in front of our nose, but this time we decided we would go \nahead and do it, not continue to say no and to worry ourselves to death \nover what could happen. This could happen, that could happen, do we \nneed it, should we do it. That is what has happened in the United \nStates recently when we are trying to make energy decisions. We do not \nwant to recognize that there is a bit of a risk, but you have to take a \nbit of a risk for a big benefit. In this case, it is a very minimum \nrisk and a very big benefit.\n\n  I am particularly pleased in this bill we are reinvesting in our \nenvironment. For decades, our coastal States have produced much of the \noil and gas which the Nation consumes. They no longer sit back and go \nalong with leasing without compensation needed for their \ninfrastructure, the coastal environment. It is so critical to our \ndomestic energy survival. We have changed direction and said ``share it \nwith them.'' That is a good idea, a new precedent which we need not be \nembarrassed about.\n  We also have said we want to share some of this wealth with the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund, a very good national program. We have not \ndone that before. That, too, is good precedent, good ground to break, \nand sets us on a good path.\n  For those who worry, again, about that and about sharing with the \nStates, I regret if that concerns them so much they will not vote for \nthis bill. I am very sorry about that. In this case, the benefits so \noutweigh the risks of changing policy or changing direction\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\nthat we should have a stampede, not a vote, when it comes time to \ncount.\n  I am not going to do justice to all those who helped me by mentioning \nthem all because I will not get to it. That is probably my mistake. I \nthank my friend and colleague from the State of Louisiana who is here \nin the Senate. She started working with me early as a member of the \ncommittee. Obviously, Senator Vitter, also, from Louisiana, an early \nparticipant. I thank him greatly for his efforts, as well as all the \ncoastal State Senators. I also thank the distinguished leaders on our \nside who encouraged and urged passing. In fact, I would say about my \ngood friend from Kentucky, I think he thought more about my proceeding \nto get this done than I did a few weeks ago. He kept saying it was a \ngreat day, get along with it, Pete, let's do it. So we are doing it.\n  This is a good bill. It took a little effort. It took a little time. \nNonetheless, compared with other bills around here these days, it is \nnot going to go to the graveyard. It is not going to die because \nSenators were able to talk the Senate into voting again to delay or \nkill a bill. They have not been able to do that on this bill. We are \ngrateful.\n  The American people ought to know that even with the hurdle of 60 \nvotes which was required because of filibuster threats on this bill, we \nprevailed. We have learned also that when we vote tonight, I think we \nonly need 51 votes for a change. That is a very good sign. Finally, we \nare at a point where a 51-vote majority would win. We thought it was \nthat way all the time, but it wasn't. Finally, after all the hurdles, \nwe will have many more than that, but this is going to pass.\n  For those who are watching, we are at a point where that old-\nfashioned majority would be enough. We learned about the majority in \nschool. It has been thrown out the window because there is so much \npoliticking going on. Every vote is 60 votes around here. In the next \nfew years we will have a few more of those, Mr. Leader, with the tax \nbill, and it will be 60 votes because someone is screaming filibuster.\n  I used to think filibusters were great when I first came to the \nSenate. Then I almost changed and said: Throw them away. I don't know \nwhere I am now. I do know I am for using part of the Budget Act to get \naround filibusters.\n  Mr. FRIST. Are you filibustering me right now?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am through. It will be a nice evening. I am going to \ngo back and sit down. Thank you, Senator Frist, for helping me. I want \nyou to thank me for letting you have a happy day for a change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do thank my distinguished colleague, who \nabout 2 months ago said, we can do this, we can do it for the American \npeople. It was at a time where it looked as though this Senate could \nnot come together to address one of the more fundamental issues that \nthe taxpayer, the American consumer, sees every day; that is, the price \nof gas, the price of consumer products that go up because of the \nnatural gas required to make that product.\n  We have addressed it in a bipartisan way: Senator Domenici, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Martinez, Senator Vitter--the Gulf State Senators--my \ndistinguished colleague, the assistant majority leader, who was there \nevery second of the way, through meeting after meeting, as we worked \nthrough the many, many details in what was really pioneering work in \nmany ways, opening up the deep sea energy exploration, with the sharing \nof revenues coming in and what the appropriate amount should be. So I \ndo thank all of them.\n  I have to come back to Senator Domenici and him just looking them in \nthe eye and saying: It can get done. I know elections are coming, and I \nknow there is partisanship, people want to slow the place down, but we \nare going to do it. To have it done means a lot.\n  ``The increase in energy prices is clearly making the economy worse \noff. . . .'' If oil prices continue to rise, there will be \n``significant consequences'' for the economy. That was the testimony \ndelivered by Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke earlier this \nmonth before the House Committee on Financial Services.\n  When I look at the evidence, I cannot help but agree. Right now, \nAmericans are paying, on average, $3 per gallon for regular unleaded \ngasoline. Right now, 60 percent of the oil we consume comes from \noverseas, from foreign countries. Right now, we are on track to a \nfuture where the demand for petroleum more than doubles our supply here \nat home--more than doubles our domestic supply. And right now, the \nprice of natural gas for American consumers and industries, as of this \nmorning, is $8.05 per million Btu, and that is six times as much as the \nprice in countries competing for American jobs.\n  What do all these numbers mean? We hear the numbers a lot on the \nfloor. What it translates into for that average consumer, that typical \nconsumer, is higher cooling bills for their homes, higher heating bills \nin other seasons, higher prices for products made with natural gas, and \nhigher prices for farm produce.\n  They mean manufacturing jobs lost in America. When U.S. companies \nhave to pay more for the energy they need, it makes it harder for them \nto compete in the global marketplace, and it results in jobs being lost \nto overseas, facilities being shipped overseas. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers estimates that more than 3.1 million high-\nwage manufacturing jobs have been lost just in the last 6 years, \nlargely as a result of high energy prices. Of more than 120 world-scale \nchemical plants under construction across the globe, only one is being \nbuilt here at home.\n  The high cost of natural gas is hurting farmers. Over the last 3 \ndays, over the weekend, I spent a lot of time with farmers, actually, \nin North Carolina, in Tennessee, and in Iowa, and the No. 1 issue from \nthe farmers was the high price of fertilizer because of the natural gas \nto make that fertilizer.\n  It is hurting the forest and paper products industry. Mr. President, \n267 mills have closed and 189,000 jobs have been lost since this runup \nin natural gas prices over the last 6 years.\n  You put all those numbers together, and they point to a clear \nconclusion. It is the exact same conclusion of Ben Bernanke, Chairman \nBernanke: America is dangerously dependent on foreign sources of \nenergy, and it is hurting our economy. It hurts our consumers.\n  Last year, Congress began to address this problem, under the \nleadership of Pete Domenici, once again, by passing a comprehensive \nenergy bill. I do not think anybody realized at the time how \ncomprehensive that bill was, how important, how timely that bill was. \nAgain and again it had been obstructed from the other side of the \naisle, but under his leadership we passed it.\n  What has happened just in the last 12 months? Because of that Energy \nbill, 27 new ethanol plants have broken ground, and 150 more are in the \nworks. Because of that Energy bill, the amount of ethanol and biodiesel \nwe use in our gasoline will more than double over the next 6 years, and \nthat will save 80,000 barrels a day. Because of the Energy bill we \npassed, 401 new E-85 pumps have been installed. Because of that Energy \nbill we passed a year ago, the nuclear industry is planning to build 25 \nnew reactors in the United States, and that is enough to boost 15 \nmillion households with power with that clean, emission-free energy. \nBecause of that Energy bill, 120 clean-coal facilities are in the \nplanning stages--enough to replace 2 million barrels of oil a day by \nthe year 2025. And because of the Energy bill--as I was flying across \nthe country, I looked out and saw those windmills out there--wind \npower, solar power, and hydrogen fuel cells all got a shot in the arm.\n  The Energy bill we passed a year ago was only part of the solution. \nThe bill we will pass here shortly is that next critical step. And \nthere will be other steps, as so many of my colleagues who have said \n``I have a great idea'' have demonstrated. But the bill we have today \nwill reduce our dependence on foreign oil and natural gas by opening 8 \nmillion acres in the gulf for domestic exploration. The area opened \nunder this bill is estimated to contain 1.26 billion barrels of oil and \nover 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. As has been said, that is \nroughly the same amount of oil as the proven reserves of Wyoming and \nOklahoma combined, and more than six times our current imports of \nliquefied natural gas each year.\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\n  This bill will substantially reduce our dependence on foreign sources \nof oil and gas. It increases our energy independence. It strengthens \nour national security. And it helps to reduce the cost of living for \nevery American consumer. It will have a direct impact on the prices \nconsumers pay at the pump and on their power bills each month.\n  Mr. President, now more than ever America needs American energy. That \nis what the bill before us does. It brings more American energy to \nAmerican consumers.\n  Let me just close once again in thanking Chairman Domenici, Senator \nMartinez, Senator Landrieu, Senator Vitter--all the Senators from the \ngulf coast--and, as I said earlier, especially the assistant majority \nleader, Senator McConnell, for his leadership.\n  I know this bill will receive broad bipartisan support. And when we \nbegin that vote here shortly, it will move us one step closer to \nlowering energy prices for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 4713 and 4714, Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendments are \nwithdrawn.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was unfortunately not present to \nvote on final passage of S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security \nAct of 2006. I would like the Record to reflect that had I been \npresent, I would have voted no on both the July 31 vote on the motion \nto invoke cloture as well as today's vote on final passage of the bill.\n  This legislation not only fails to address our energy problems, it \nraids the Federal Treasury and threatens our coastal economies and \necosystems. Opening more of our coastlines to drilling is clearly not \nthe answer to our energy problems, especially given that 80 percent of \noffshore oil and gas resources are already open to drilling, and oil \ncompanies currently hold more than 4,000 untapped leases in the Gulf of \nMexico.\n  Instead of despoiling our shores and perpetuating our dependence on \noil, I believe Congress should pursue more environmentally friendly \nsolutions, including investments in efficiency, biofuels, and increased \nuse of renewable energy such as wind and solar power.\n  Unfortunately, rather than using American ingenuity to advance a new \nenergy future that benefits both the economy and the environment, S. \n3711 continues to promote failed policies of the past. It opens 8 \nmillion acres of Florida's gulf coast waters to offshore drilling rigs, \nincluding more than 6 million acres that are currently protected by the \nbipartisan moratorium on offshore drilling that has been in place for \n25 years. S. 3711 also diverts tens of billions of dollars in offshore \ndrilling revenues from the Federal Treasury and gives the money to just \nfour States.\n  Furthermore, passing S. 3711 paves the way for a conference with H.R. \n4761, the even more harmful House-passed bill that lifts the moratorium \non all offshore drilling, including my home State, Massachusetts.\n  For our coasts, our environment, and our economy, I oppose S. 3711, \nand instead support real solutions to our energy problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8513-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8513-S8529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Res. 818 \n     (109th Congress) and are designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 402 of S. Con. Res. 83 (109th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2007, as made applicable in the Senate by section 7035 \n     of Public Law 109-09234: Provided, That the amounts provided \n     in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this title are available \n     immediately upon enactment of this Act.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 2007''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Inouye and I are pleased to \npresent this Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007 to the \nSenate. This bill reflects the bipartisan approach that my cochairman, \nSenator Inouye, and I have maintained regarding the issue of the \nDepartment of Defense as cochairmen of the Subcommittee on Defense for \nthe Appropriations Committee. It has been a pleasure for us to work \ntogether and with the other members of the committee in the process.\n  This bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee 2 \nweeks ago by a unanimous vote. We hope to finish this bill this week so \nwe can proceed to conference early in September. Our goal is to get the \nbill to the President before the end of the fiscal year. This bill can \nbe worked on by the staffs in the August recess, and with the House, \nand we will be able to proceed as early as possible in September if we \ncan finish the work this week.\n  It is our hope that we can finish the bill and have it be sent to \nconference before we leave for the August recess. The Army, Navy, Air \nForce, and Marines need these funds at the beginning of the fiscal \nyear, not 3 or 4 months after the beginning of the fiscal year. We \nshould do everything possible to ensure that Congress completes action \non this bill in a timely fashion.\n  As we debate this bill today, there are hundreds of thousands of men \nand women in uniform forward deployed and serving our country in over \n120 countries throughout the world and throughout the United States. \nTheir bravery and dedication to our country are extraordinary, and \ntheir sacrifices don't go unnoticed.\n  Each year, the Department of Defense faces the critical challenge of \nbalancing the costs of maintaining high levels of readiness, being \nready to respond to the call wherever and whenever it is necessary. \nThis also means adequately investing in transformation to be ready to \nmeet the threats of tomorrow.\n  The bill Senator Inouye and I present today offers a prudent balance \namong these challenges. It recommends $453.5 billion in new \ndiscretionary authority for the Department of Defense, which includes \n$50 billion in additional appropriations to fund operations related to \nthe global war to contain violent extremists. This bill is $9 billion \nunder the President's budget request, consistent with the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  In order to reach that figure, we had to cut key defense readiness \nand modernization programs. We closely reviewed program execution and \nfocused on unjustified growth and program delays. We have received many \nrequests from Members that we could not address this year for lack of \nfunds.\n  The bill is $13 billion under the national defense authorization bill \nrecently passed by the Senate. That means that just because a program \nor project was authorized, it doesn't mean funding was available in \nthis bill. It wasn't possible under the allocations we have received.\n  Given our restraints, the bill doesn't provide much in the way of \nmedical research outside of the budget. We primarily focus on the \nlimited medical resources in the bill toward the treatment of \nconditions directly impacting our military today rather than longer \nterm research.\n  I remain concerned about the migration of funds from defense \nrequirements to nondefense medical research, and how we sustain such \nfunding in a declining budget environment.\n  This measure is consistent with both the objectives of the \nadministration and the broad recommendations contained in the Senate's \nnational defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2007.\n  We have sought to recommend a balanced bill to the Senate. We believe \nit addresses key requirements for readiness, quality of life, and \ntransformation of the force.\n  It honors the commitment we have to our Armed Forces. It helps ensure \nthat they will continue to have first-rate training, modernized \nequipment, and quality infrastructure.\n  It provides the much needed funds to continue the global war against \nterror.\n  Finally, I thank my great friend and colleague, Senator Inouye, and \nhis staff, particularly Charlie Houy, for their support and counsel on \nthis bill.\n  I yield at this time to Senator Inouye for any statements the \ncochairman wishes to make.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I ask the distinguished ranking member \nof the subcommittee to allow me to make a brief statement?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Phillip Baucus\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I received a phone call early this morning \nfrom Senator Max Baucus. It was a call that was so troubling. Max \nBaucus and I are friends. I have such great admiration and respect and \naffection for him. On this issue that is before the Senate now, he has \nbeen such a good person, trying to work through the matter we are going \nto vote on this Friday. He called to indicate that he would not be here \nthis week. He asked me not to say anything until he made some public \nstatement. I have certainly followed his desire.\n  Senator Baucus comes from a very close-knit family. He has one son. \nSenator Baucus' nephew, Phillip, is also like a son to Senator Baucus. \nHe was killed in Iraq on Saturday. He was 28 years old. He died while \nconducting combat operations in Al Anbar Province.\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\n  On behalf of the entire Senate family, I express through the Chair to \nour dear friend, Max Baucus, our sympathy and condolences.\n  Senator Baucus put out a brief statement saying that Phillip was\n\n       an incredible person, a dedicated Marine, a loving son and \n     husband, and a proud Montanan and American. He heroically \n     served the country he loved and he gave it his all. We loved \n     him dearly, and we'll miss him more than words can ever \n     express.\n\n  Mr. President, during these difficult times for Senator Baucus and \nthe entire Baucus family while dealing with this loss, we send to them \nour thoughts and our prayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to join my leader in expressing my \ncondolences and my sadness. It is ironic that at this moment we are \nconsidering a measure which is something that is very important to him.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the measure \npending before us. The measure includes some $453.5 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense. As the chairman stated, it includes $50 billion \nto help offset the cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for the first \nseveral months of fiscal year 2007.\n  This is a very good bill, and all of my colleagues should thank \nChairman Stevens for his efforts. And believe me, it wasn't easy. \nEveryone in the Senate knows how difficult it is to write a Defense \nbill, but this year's challenge was particularly great because the \ncommittee's 302 allocation required the Defense Subcommittee to cut $9 \nbillion from the requested amounts. As a result, this bill is $13 \nbillion below the amount the Senate has already approved for Defense \nauthorization this year.\n  However, it is also true that if supplemental funds are excluded from \ncomparison, the recommended funding is still $15 billion more than was \nprovided in fiscal year 2006.\n  This is a tough bill but an exceedingly fair one. It provides for the \nessential requirements of the Department of Defense while holding down \nthe growth in the budget. The committee did a tough review of the real \nneeds of the Defense budget. Funding for programs that were delayed or \nin which substantial increases were requested was curtailed.\n  The chairman also made a courageous decision to cut back on the \nnondefense medical research funding in this bill. In recent years, \nSenators have been seeking funding for more and more medical programs \nthat have very little direct relations to defense matters. Because of \nthe need of sharply reducing funding, the chairman had to decide to \ndeny funds for many of these programs.\n  To my colleagues on the Democratic side, Mr. President, I say this is \na good bill. It was fashioned in a bipartisan manner and it funds our \ncritical defense needs. I fully support the bill that was unanimously \nreported out by the committee and recommended to the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Before I close, I commend the chairman for his courage, for his \nforesight, and I commend the staff: Ms. Sid Ashworth and Charlie Houy. \nWithout these two people, I don't think we would be where we are at \nthis moment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4751\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have an amendment I wish to send to the \ndesk. I want to explain it. We have had a series of requests from \nMembers and from portions of the military establishment to add money to \nthis bill due to emergency requirements that were not presented to us \nat the time we considered the bill in our committee.\n  This is money for what we call equipment reset. It is the money that \nmeets the requirements for continuing combat operations, primarily in \nIraq, but it is for the Department overall. It is additional money, as \nI said, for the Army and Marine Corps for equipment reset.\n  We have consulted with the Department and with the OMB about this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The unanimous \nconsent agreement was for debate only. If you have an amendment, you \nneed unanimous consent. Without objection, the Senator can proceed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we had an understanding that we could do \namendments cleared on both sides, but no amendments controversial that \nwould require a vote by the Senate. We are proceeding under that \nunderstanding. Mr. President, is that the understanding of the Senator \nfrom Hawaii?\n  Mr. INOUYE. If the Senator will yield, that is my understanding, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \npresent this amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Therefore, Mr. President, I send to the desk this \namendment to provide additional appropriations, $7.8 billion for the \nArmy and $5.3 billion for the Marine Corps for the reset of equipment \ndue to combat operations and to designate such amounts as emergency \nrequirements.\n  I ask the amendment be presented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] for himself and Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 4751.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To appropriate as additional appropriations $7,800,000,000 \n for the Army and $5,300,000,000 for the Marine Corps for the reset of \n  equipment due to continuing combat operations and to designate such \n                   amounts as emergency requirements)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Additional Amount for Army and Marine Corps \n     for Equipment Reset.--In addition to amounts provided by \n     other provisions of this title, $7,800,000,000 is provided to \n     the Army, and $5,300,000,000 is provided to the Marine Corps, \n     to fund equipment reset requirements resulting from \n     continuing combat operations.\n       (b) Designation as Emergency Requirements.--The amounts \n     provided under subsection (a) are designated as \n     appropriations for contingency operations directly related to \n     the Global War on Terrorism, and other unanticipated defense-\n     related operations, pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. \n     376 (109th Congress), as made applicable to the House of \n     Representatives by H. Con. Res. 818 (109th Congress), and are \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     402 of S. Con. Res. 83 (109th Congress), the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2007, as made \n     applicable in the Senate by section 7035 of Public Law 109-\n     234.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this measure has been cleared by both \nsides. I have studied the measure, and I approve it. I support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4751.\n  The amendment (No. 4751) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this means the committee has addressed \nthe total needs that have been presented to us by the Department and by \nthe administration and by many Members to the extent we could afford \nit. We urge that Members study this bill. We will be prepared, I hope, \nto come in early tomorrow, and it is my understanding tomorrow we will \nbe able to consider amendments that are filed by Members.\n  At this time, we have no further amendments to offer on behalf of the \ncommittee. We may, as the bill proceeds, in the next 2 days. Again, it \nis my--and I believe our--fervent hope that we can bring this bill to a \nclose and vote on it before we leave this Friday for the August recess \nso that it may be worked on during the period of the August recess and \npresented to the Senate and the House early in September so that the \nbill can get to the President in ample time for it to be signed and \nbecome law prior to the end of this fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, does the Senator from Hawaii have any further \ncomments?\n  Mr. INOUYE. No, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of both of us, I say the bill \nis open to amendment. We would be pleased to discuss amendments with \nany Member. It is my hope the leadership will convene the Senate as \nearly as possible tomorrow morning.\n  May I inquire of the Chair, it is my understanding the Senator from \nSouth\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\nDakota has a statement to make that is not related to our bill. I think \nit is in order, if he wishes to do so, while we wait to see if Senators \nwish to bring amendments to discuss tonight.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Budget Committee, I \nregularly comment on Appropriations bills that are brought to this \nSenate for consideration and present the financial comparisons and \nbudgetary data. Today I am reporting on compliance with the Budget Act \nin the case of the pending measure, H.R. 5631, the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2007.\n  As reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, H.R. 5631 \nprovides $456.805 billion in budget authority and $496.082 billion in \noutlays in fiscal year 2007 for the Department of Defense and related \nagencies. Of these totals, $251 million in budget authority and $251 \nmillion in outlays are for mandatory programs in fiscal year 2007. I \nwill note here that this bill is in compliance with the 2007 302(b) \nallocations, but there are other budgetary matters worthy of Senators' \nattention.\n  The bill provides discretionary budget authority in fiscal year 2007 \nof $414.500 billion for DOD's regular appropriation. But it also \nincludes $50.0 billion for projected contingency operations overseas. \nOf that, $42.054 billion is designated as an emergency. The rest--\n$7.946 billion--is funds remaining in Defense's fiscal year 2006 \nallocation. We should be very clear on this point: putting those funds \nin the Defense Appropriations bill has the effect of reversing the \nacross-the-board cut Congress passed at the end of last year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee estimate of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  H.R. 5631, 2007 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal Year 2007, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        General\n                                        purpose    Mandatory     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority..................     414,500         251     414,751\n  Outlays...........................     434,955         251     435,206\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..................     414,500         251     414,751\n  Outlays...........................           *           *           *\n2006 Enacted:\n  Budget authority..................     393,759         245     394,004\n  Outlays...........................     406,276         245     406,521\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority..................     423,554         251     423,805\n  Outlays...........................     424,302         251     424,553\nHouse-passed bill: \\1\\\n  Budget authority..................     377,357         251     377,608\n  Outlays...........................     393,550         251     393,801\n  Senate reported bill compared to:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..................           0           0           0\n  Outlays...........................          na          na          na\n2006 Enacted:\n  Budget authority..................      20,741           6      20,747\n  Outlays...........................      28,679           6      28,685\n    President's request:............\n  Budget authority..................      -9,054           0      -9,054\n  Outlays...........................      10,653           0      10,653\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority..................      37,143           0      37,143\n  Outlays...........................      41,405           0     41,405\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ House and Senate bills having different jurisdictions.\n* There is no outlay allocation in the Senate for 2007 appropriations\n  bills.\n Note: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise today to address some issues that \nare pending before the Senate, and I also want to acknowledge what I \nhope will be action we will take somewhere down the road regarding a \nsituation in South Dakota that we are experiencing this year.\n  We are experiencing what is, I would say, probably a 100-year \ndrought. We are having extraordinarily high temperatures. We haven't \nhad rain. In fact, the rain accumulations this year in South Dakota are \nless than the rain in many years throughout the Great Depression back \nin the 1930s, and it is having a devastating impact on our economy and \nthe farmers and ranchers in South Dakota on which our economy relies.\n  In fact, if one looks at the small grain crop, the wheat crop in \nSouth Dakota was a complete bust, a 100-percent loss in many areas of \nSouth Dakota.\n  The row crops, corn and soybeans, are extremely stressed. Much of \nthat crop will be lost this year as well. Cattle producers are selling \ntheir herds, liquidating their herds, creating all kinds of economic \nissues for my State of South Dakota.\n  What I hope is that as time goes on, we will have an opportunity to \naddress in some fashion that crisis in South Dakota in the form of an \nemergency disaster relief package.\n  There is some money attached, currently, to the agriculture \nappropriations bill that passed at the committee level of the Senate--\nit hasn't seen floor action--about $3.9 billion that would apply to \n2005. Obviously, 2006 is much worse in many parts of the country and \nfor sure in my State of South Dakota. So I am hopeful we will be able \nto amend that or perhaps move on to some other legislation. I am \nlooking at introducing a piece of freestanding legislation, too, that \nwould address this situation for 2006.\n  My point is this is something which is a dire emergency in my State \nof South Dakota. It literally is burning up out there. We have had \ntemperatures that have shattered State records, in the high hundreds--\n115, 118--temperatures like that for days and days at a time without \nany rain. In fact, in many cases, there was very little rain going back \nall the way to the very first of this year. It is a historic event. As \nI said, it is probably up to a 100-year type event in terms of the \nactual weather conditions we are experiencing in South Dakota. I hope \nwe can draw attention to that issue and get the support of our \ncolleagues here in the Senate to address it.\n  I also wish to speak to an issue which has some bearing on that in a \nlot of ways--trying to keep people on the family farm, on the ranch, \nkeeping these small businesses active, and allowing the next generation \nto move in and assume those operations and continue to create jobs and \nkeep the economy going in South Dakota. It is really important.\n  Many pieces of legislation with which we will be dealing this week \nbear on this. One, the Energy bill has huge economic consequences to \nfarmers and ranchers and small businesses that have to get their \nproducts to the marketplace and rely heavily on transportation, that \nneed the inputs to get the crop planted, and the fertilizer and \neverything with it--all those costs are going through the ceiling as a \nresult of high energy costs. Increasing energy supplies is critical.\n  The bill we just moved is important. I have another piece of \nrenewable fuel legislation which I hope we will be able to get \nagreement on and be able to move across the Senate floor, too, this \nweek and get some relief and move the country in the direction that is \nexpanding the use of renewable fuels and expanding the sources of \nenergy and lessening our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  We will also be voting on a pension bill this week, which is \nimportant, but the piece of legislation I want to speak to now is the \ntax bill which will come before the Senate later this week.\n  There are several provisions in the bill. One on which I have been \nworking for some time is to provide permanent death tax relief. If we \nwant to keep farmers and ranchers on the farm, continuing to grow and \ncontributing to our economy in this country, we need to do something to \naddress what is a very real issue. If we do not take action, in a few \nyears here the death tax will rise back up to 55 percent, the top rate, \nand the exemption will drop back to $1 million. Anybody who knows \nagriculture knows that today, with land values being what they are and \nthe capital costs associated with agriculture, we need to provide some \nadditional relief.\n  The death tax reform bill which is going to be considered and voted \non in the Senate would raise that exemption\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nover a course of time to $5 million, indexed for inflation, and then \nfor anything over that amount, over $5 million, it would tax it at the \ncapital gains rate, which is 15 percent, and then on amounts above $25 \nmillion it would go up to 30 percent. It would also unify the estate \nand gift tax to simplify planning for people who are having to address, \nfor planning purposes, what happens when it comes time to deal with the \nissue of the next generation.\n\n  I have always maintained that when someone dies, they should not have \nto see the undertaker and the IRS on the same visit. We need to do \nsomething that addresses this issue, that will bring some relief for \nhard-working farmers and ranchers across this country who are trying to \nprovide a nest egg, something for the next generation to assume those \noperations and continue to be a part of the business that is an \nintegral part of our economy in this country, not just in South Dakota \nbut across the entire country. You have small businesses, farmers, and \nranchers who are adversely impacted tremendously by the death tax. It \nis high time we did something about that.\n  There are a lot of people who would argue, and I have heard this \nargued before by Democrats in the Senate, that this is something which \njust benefits the rich. The reality is, regarding the death tax today, \nthe people who are actually opposing repealing or reforming the death \ntax are the superrich. The reason is the superrich are not the ones who \nare paying the taxes. They use accountants and lawyers to figure out \nways around paying the tax. It is those small farm and ranch \noperations, small businesses, that get stuck with the bill.\n  There are a lot of reasons we need to permanently deal with this \ndeath tax issue, but one of the reasons is the death tax revenues that \ncome into the Federal Government are not all that consequential in \nterms of the overall budget relative to what it costs to collect and \ncomply. Death tax revenues were $24.8 billion in 2005. They have \naveraged about 1.3 percent of Federal revenues annually over the past \n10 years. The other side will argue that requiring this tax isn't too \nmuch to ask from the superwealthy. What they don't consider is all the \ncosts imposed on family farms or small businesses to avoid or reduce \ntheir tax burden. Basic estate planning documents can cost up to \n$50,000. Plans involving limited partnerships can cost up to $250,000. \nOne study concluded that in New York, family-owned businesses can spend \nan average of $125,000 on estate planning.\n  At the time of death, tax preparation fees can range from $5,000 to \n$50,000, according to some estimates. Often, family-owned farms and \nbusinesses right on the cusp of the death tax exemption will be \nrequired to fill out the IRS paperwork to ensure they do not owe \nanything. In 2004, there were 62,718 estate tax returns filed, but only \n30,276 owed any taxes to the Federal Government. What that means is \nthat 52 percent of the estates filing a return were required to hire a \nteam of accountants, lawyers, and other professionals, only to file a \nfew dozen papers with the IRS but pay no tax. What is the point? \nAccording to what one estimate indicates, the amount spent on avoiding \nthe death tax could be approximately equal to the amount of revenue \ngenerated.\n  This is not good policy. The cost of repealing the death tax raised \nthe ire of the Wall Street Journal editorial page, and here is what \nthey said:\n\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation refuses to take any account \n     of the potential economy-wide benefits of repeal: more \n     investment in family businesses, more money spent on creating \n     jobs than on buying life insurance to pay death taxes, and a \n     higher savings rate. Many studies have found these positive \n     effects could be large and would mean much smaller revenue \n     losses from getting rid of the tax.\n\n  If you listen again to the rhetoric of those who are opposed to \nreforming the death tax, I think we have to be careful when we hear \nthat rhetoric as they begin to describe the cost of this tax relief \nbecause their record really has not been very good of late.\n  In 2003, we reduced the capital gains and dividend tax rate as part \nof the economic stimulus package. At that time, Democrats in the Senate \nargued it would add to the deficit and burden our budget. In fact, \nearlier today the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, was in the \nChamber talking about how this would adversely impact the long-term \nbudget outlook and how it would impact the deficit. But he said the \nsame things back in 2003 when talking about capital gains and dividend \ntax relief. He said these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget \noutlook, adding to the Nation's projected chronic deficits.\n  Three years later, we now see the other side of the aisle could not \nhave been more wrong on this issue. The capital gains and dividend rate \nreductions have paid for themselves many times over in the form of \nincreased Government revenue. May's budget report from the Treasury \nDepartment has tax receipts up by about $206 billion, which is a 13-\npercent increase for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2006. The year \nbefore--between 2004 and 2005--there was a $274 billion increase, or \n14.6 percent more in Federal revenues for fiscal year 2005 than 2004.\n\n  Again, let me emphasize, reducing capital gains and dividends tax \nrates generated more Government revenue to the Federal Treasury, not \nless. That sometimes seems counterintuitive to the Democrats, people on \nthe other side.\n  I would argue as well that some of the people who are doing these \nestimates have, certainly in this case, been proven wrong. I think the \nsame would be true with respect to reforming the death tax in the way \nthat has been proposed here and that we will have a chance to vote on \nlater this week. But reducing capital gains and dividends taxes spurred \neconomic growth, and it increased Government revenue--not decreased--\nincreased Government revenue by $275 billion between 2004 and 2005, and \nalready in the first 9 months of this year, $206 billion, which is a \n13-percent increase over the previous year.\n  Again, I would say that as it relates to the estimates that have been \nmade in the past and the rhetoric and many of the prognostications that \nhave come from the other side, it clearly has been a very different \noutcome, a very different result, a very different record when it comes \nto revenues coming into the Federal Government from reducing capital \ngains and dividends rates.\n  Some on the other side are also arguing that only the superrich pay \nthe death tax and that Warren Buffett and the Gates family are the ones \nwho are really going to benefit from this. Warren Buffett and the Gates \nfamily have both been vocal in their support of keeping the death tax. \nAs I said earlier, the reason is they are not the ones paying it. They \nhave armies of accountants and lawyers to figure out ways to get around \nit. Don't let yourself think their estates will be subject to the tax. \nThere are lots of folks who will make sure they never have to see the \n55 percent of the value of their estates being taxed. In fact, Warren \nBuffett and Bill Gates have both figured out ways to shelter their net \nworth in charitable foundations. That is obviously their right, and we \nappreciate and are grateful for their generosity. But if the superrich \nsupport keeping the death tax but have figured out ways to avoid it, \nwho actually is paying the tax? The smaller, family-owned farms and \nbusinesses are the ones that pay it because they didn't spend the money \npreparing to avoid it. That is why agriculture and big industry support \nrepealing this very onerous tax.\n  If you look at the folks who are in favor of getting rid of this tax, \nit is not the superrich that the other side argues would benefit from \nrepealing the tax or at least reforming it in the fashion that has been \nproposed. It is the organizations that represent the small, family-\nowned businesses and farmers and ranchers in this country. The list of \nthose who support repealing the Federal death tax includes the Farm \nBureau Federation, the National Cattleman's Beef Association, National \nPork Producers Council, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, National Association of Home Builders, Large Equipment \nDistributors Association, Beer Wholesalers Association, National Tax \nLimitation Committee, National Wholesalers and Distributors \nAssociation, National Taxpayers Union, Forest Landowners Association, \nAmerican Family Business Institute, National Grocers Association, U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, American \nTool Manufacturers Association. In my State, South Dakota, Petroleum \nand Propane Marketers Association, South Dakota\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\nAssociation of Convenience Stores, the National Restaurant Association, \nAmerican International Automobile Dealers Association, Family Research \nCouncil, the Black Chamber of Commerce--the list goes on and on.\n  My point simply is that as we engage in this debate this week, the \narguments are going to be made, as they have been already, and the \nissue framed in a way by the Democrats that, again, this is somehow \nsomething which will benefit the superrich. As I noted, the superrich \nare the ones coming out to say we don't need to repeal this. The reason \nthey say that is because they are not going to be paying it because \nthey have at their disposal the lawyers and accountants and \nprofessionals who can figure out a way to keep them from having to pay \nit. The people who get stuck paying the death tax in this country are \nthe small farms, the ranch operations, the small businesses, the people \nwho are just trying to put together a little bit of equity, a little \nbit of assets that they can then pass on to the next generation and \nkeep that family business growing and prospering.\n  It just seems to me that as a matter of principle, death should not \nbe a taxable event. We should not be taxing people throughout their \nentire lifetime on everything they earn, on everything they acquire, on \neverything they buy, and then when death rolls around say: We are going \nto take 50 percent of everything you have acquired during the course of \nyour lifetime and give it to the Federal Government. And as I said, \nmuch of the cost associated with either collecting or complying with \nthe death tax actually negates, I believe, the positive revenue benefit \nthat comes into the Federal Treasury to start with.\n  As I said earlier, I think you will find when this happens--and I \nhope it does happen because I hope we get the votes to pass it later \nthis week--that you will see what happens with the death tax repeal is \nthe same thing that happened when we reduced capital gains and dividend \ntax rates, and that is you will see more expansion, more investment, \nand actually more Federal revenues coming into the Treasury, which has \nbeen the record with the capital gains and dividend tax reductions.\n\n  I might again repeat, because I think it is worth noting and because \nit is an important part of the debate and the other side maybe will \ncome over here and talk about how this will add to the deficit, how \nmuch this is going to cost the Government in terms of lost revenue, how \nit is going to only benefit the superwealthy. Let's remember again who \nis paying the tax, and let's also remember again when we reduced \ncapital gains and dividend tax rates, we got more Government revenue \nand not less.\n  Let's move forward. Let's do something that has been on the agenda \nhere for a very long time. Failure to act on the part of this Congress \nmeans that in the year 2010 going into 2011, these rates start kicking \nback in. We provided some temporary relief in previous tax bills. But \nif we don't take action to permanently address this issue, then people \nwho pass on in the year 2010 and beyond that rate are going to be \npaying on everything they pass on to their next generation; 55 percent \nis going to be taken by the Federal Government.\n  It is an issue that needs to be addressed. It has been acted on in \nthe House--not once but on multiple occasions. In fact, the House voted \nlast week on this total package which includes the death tax repeal. It \nalso includes extension of some other tax relief measures and an \nincrease in the minimum wage. The vote coming out of the House was a \nfairly big bipartisan vote, with 34 Democrats in the House of \nRepresentatives voting with the majority of Republicans in the House to \nsend it over to the Senate. We are faced right now with this vote on \nFriday on whether we are going to do something that will address once \nand for all this situation that the death tax creates for estates, for \nbusinesses, family farms and ranch operations going forward, whether we \nare going to address these other tax issues which also expire.\n  I might add that in my State of South Dakota, there is one on this \nlist that is extremely important to the people I represent, and that is \nthe State and local sales tax reduction. We are not an income tax \nState. We don't have a personal or corporate income tax. We do have a \nsales tax. For a long time, people who paid State income tax got to \ndeduct that on their Federal tax return. People who had sales tax and \nused the sales tax as basis for taxation were not able to take the same \nbenefit. We changed that in 2003. That is set to expire. If we don't do \nsomething to extend that tax relief, then people in my State of South \nDakota and other States across this country who use the sales tax as \ntheir primary source of raising revenue to fund State governments are \ngoing to lose this deduction. That again creates an inequity between \nStates that use the sales tax and those States that use the income tax \nto fund their governments.\n  There are other things on this list as well--college tuition \ndeduction, work opportunity tax credit, welfare to work tax credit, \ntimber capital gains that are also on the list of taxes, tax revenue \nthat would be extended, teachers' classroom expenses deduction, \nsomething a lot of teachers across this country have benefited from.\n  My point very simply is these are all things included in this \npackage. This is our one opportunity to get this vote. I think there \nare those on the other side who are hopeful they can take this down and \nthen they will figure out a way to split these things off. But I think \nit is fair to say we have this one opportunity. We get one shot. We get \none shot at providing some permanent death tax relief by extending \nthese death tax relief measures that are set to expire, and we get one \nshot at an increase in the minimum wage.\n\n  I think if you look at this body and the way it works, there is a \nsort of sense of finding a consensus. It has been a long-time priority \nfor our colleagues on the Democratic side to get an increase in the \nminimum wage. There is a phased increase in the minimum wage in this \nbill.\n  There has been a long-term priority for those of us on this side to \nbe able to provide some death tax relief for farmers and ranchers and \nsmall businesses in this country. This bill accomplishes that.\n  It is not a total repeal. As I said, I think it is a very modest \napproach. It goes to $5 million for an individual and $10 million for a \ncouple, basically if you have a spouse, and it also uses after that \namount the capital gains tax rate as a level of taxation up to $25 \nmillion at which point it would be a 30-percent rate.\n  So it is not a complete repeal. You are still going to capture the \nsuperrich who are going to pay the 30-percent rate because most of \ntheir estate assets are going to be well over the $25 million threshold \nor limit.\n  So this is a moderate, modest approach. It represents what this \ninstitution is about; that is, trying to bring both sides together, \ntrying to figure out where that middle ground is and form a consensus \naround these issues. The minimum wage, as I said, is phased in. The \nestate tax death tax relief is phased in. It doesn't happen overnight. \nIt is phased in to get up to the $5 million unified credit, or the \nexemption. And then these other tax extenders are something I think \nmost Members here in the Senate on both sides at one time or another \nhave supported and voted for. I would argue it is very important to \nmany of their constituencies.\n  Again, if you are a State such as my State of South Dakota that \nrelies on State sales tax as your primary source of revenue to fund \nState government, extending the deductibility of that is a matter of \nfairness for those States that have income tax and, therefore, are able \nto deduct the State income taxes they pay.\n  Again, it has been voted on in the House by a big bipartisan vote \ncoming out of the House.\n  This is an opportunity, I think, for this Senate to come together on \na set of priorities which reflect, I think, the agendas of both sides.\n  As he said, the minimum wage increase is something that the Democrats \nhave been advocating for some time. I voted for a minimum wage increase \nin the past coupled with small business tax relief.\n  The estate tax--or death tax--relief is something our side has been \nactively working on for years. As a Member of the House, we voted \nnumerous times on this and now as a Member of the Senate I will have \nthat same opportunity.\n  Of course, the extension of the other forms of tax relief are in this \nbill. We\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\nget one shot. I hope Members on both sides will recognize what an \nincredible opportunity we have right now to address this whole range of \nissues that have been languishing here for a long time, and do \nsomething that will be meaningful in terms of continuing to give our \nentrepreneurs in this country, small businesses, farm and ranch \noperations the opportunity to grow, to continue to build wealth, to \ncreate jobs, and to keep the economy strong. That is what this \nparticular bill and what it contains is all about.\n  Again, my hope is that at the end of the day we will see a good, \nstrong, bipartisan vote in the Senate as we saw in the House of \nRepresentatives, and be able to send this on to the President where he \ncan sign it into law and we can demonstrate to the people of this \ncountry that we are addressing the issues they care deeply about and, \nmost importantly, I say to them the issue of the economy, and dealing \nwith energy costs today with an energy bill, dealing with the death \ntax, dealing with the minimum wage, dealing with these other forms of \ntax relief are all things that have been on the agenda for some time.\n  I believe we have an opportunity to get this done. I hope we can.\n  I appreciate the work of my colleagues who have labored so diligently \nto get this far in the process, to get it on the floor for a vote. I \nhope when Friday rolls around and we have this vote that we will have \nthe 60 votes necessary to move forward and to get this done once and \nfor all.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8532-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Army Corporal Nathaniel S. Baughman\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nIdaville. Nathaniel S. Baughman, 23 years old, was killed on July 17th \nby rocket-propelled grenades while on duty in Bayji, Iraq. Nate risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Baughman enlisted in the Army National Guard last spring and shortly \nafter was deployed to Iraq. He was on his last mission when he was \nkilled and was due to return home to Indiana in a few weeks. Baughman \nwas remembered by his mother, Jill Baughman, who told a local news \noutlet, ``He was a good dad, a great father. He was a hard worker who \nbelieved in what he was doing. We're proud of what he did for us, very \nproud of him.'' Nate was a 2001 graduate of Twin Lakes High School. He \nwas married 2 years ago and had a son, Hunter, 4.\n  Nate was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was assigned to 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade \nCombat Team, 101st Airborne Division out of Fort Campbell, KY. This \nbrave soldier leaves behind his parents, Robert and Jill Baughman and \nAndy Skorup; twin brother Nick Skorup and brothers Ben, Joseph and \nChristopher Baughman; his wife Erin; son Hunter and Hunter's mother \nAmanda Conrad.\n  Today, I join Nate's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Nate, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Nate was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Nate will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Nate's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Nate's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Nathaniel S. Baughman in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Nate's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Nate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8532-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, since July 12th we have watched with \ngrowing horror as hundreds of Hezbollah rockets have landed deeper and \ndeeper inside Israel, indiscriminately killing and injuring civilians, \nand Israeli bombs, missiles and artillery shells have destroyed much of \nthe civilian infrastructure in areas of Beirut and southern Lebanon.\n  Some 550 Lebanese have died, the vast majority of them civilians, and \nan estimated 866,000 one in five Lebanese citizens have fled their \nhomes and are either displaced in Lebanon, living in schools and public \nbuildings, or as refugees in Syria. Fifty Israelis have died, and in \nHaifa and other towns in the north many families are living in terror \nin basements or shelters.\n  Meanwhile, three Israeli soldiers remain as hostages and their \nfamilies remain in anguish hostages held in violation of the Geneva \nConventions and every other international norm. In another sense, \nHezbollah and its supporters Syria and Iran are holding the entire \npopulation of Lebanon hostage.\n  Of the 26,000 American citizens who were living in or visiting \nLebanon when this crisis began, more than 12,000 have been evacuated, \nand the exodus continues. The cost to the U.S. Government of this air \nand sea lift is expected to be at least $46 million.\n  The evacuation took too long to get started, and the delay and \nconfusion caused a lot of frustration and anxiety among Americans in \nLebanon as well as their families back home.\n  As after Hurricane Katrina, I hope the administration has learned \nsomething from this experience. At the same time, I want to commend the \nState Department employees and U.S. military personnel who worked \naround the clock to help Americans who were trapped in Lebanon find a \nway out.\n  The unprovoked, indiscriminate and utterly inexcusable kidnapping of \nIsraeli soldiers and rocket attacks by Hezbollah should be universally \ncondemned. Those who ordered it should be brought to justice. It has \nignited a conflict that Hezbollah cannot win but which could engulf the \nregion if a way\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\nis not found to stop the spiral of violence from widening.\n  It is clear that a buffer zone patrolled by an international force is \nurgently needed along the Israeli-Lebanese border to prevent these \nkinds of violent incursions against Israel and its people, and that \nHezbollah must be disarmed in order for Lebanon to finally finally--\nbreak free of Syria's harsh grip.\n  While hundreds of Hezbollah's missiles continue to rain down on \nIsrael, Israel's military response has also caused the deaths of \nhundreds of civilians in Lebanon, including four United Nations \nobservers. One of the latest tragedies is the destruction by an Israeli \nmissile of an apartment building in Qana that resulted in 57 Lebanese \ndeaths including 34 children, children who were not terrorists.\n  Secretary Rice's whirlwind visits to the region have been welcome but \nthey have produced few tangible results. This type of crisis diplomacy \nrarely achieves lasting solutions. She is also occupied with a widening \ncivil war in Iraq, resurgent Taliban violence in Afghanistan, an \nincreasingly recalcitrant and aggressive regime in North Korea, a \nworsening humanitarian crisis in Darfur with no end in sight, the \nspecter of a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran in the world's future, and \nother pressing problems. She is simply unable to focus the sustained, \nhigh-level attention on the Middle East crisis that is needed.\n  I and others like my friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, have urged \nPresident Bush to appoint a special envoy with the stature and the \nauthority to work on a continual basis to help broker an immediate \ncease-fire and long term solutions to Israel's conflicts with Hamas and \nHezbollah someone who wakes up every single day with the challenge, the \nportfolio and especially the authority to help resolve this conflict. I \nrenew this call for such an envoy again today.\n  Some U.S. officials have questioned the possibility of a cease-fire \nwith a terrorist organization like Hezbollah. That is a valid question, \nbut cease-fires have been achieved with other terrorist groups, and \nwhile imperfect the results have been sharp reductions in violence.\n  A cease-fire is needed immediately in Lebanon, to be followed with \nsimilar urgency by the deployment of an international peacekeeping \nforce on the border. Too many innocent people are dying innocent \npeople--in both countries. A peacekeeping force is necessary to prevent \nfurther loss of Lebanese and Israeli lives.\n  The United States is committed to protecting Israel's security and we \nsupport Israel's right of self defense, including going after Hezbollah \nfighters who often launch their attacks from civilian areas.\n  But for Israel's sake, for ours and especially especially--for the \nsake of innocent lives on both sides of these battle lines, it is \nvitally important to ask whether destroying Lebanon--not Hezbollah, but \ndestroying Lebanon--will make Israel more secure or instead rally \nMuslims behind Hezbollah and give rise to further hatred and \ninsecurity. I believe that continued bombing of civilian areas in \nLebanon will not destroy Hezbollah, but in a perverse way, it may \nstrengthen it.\n  The fact that these attacks are being carried out with such intensity \nand are yielding so much death and destruction, with weapons supplied \nby the United States, and at a time when we are trying to repair our \nalready frayed relations with Muslims around the world, is all the more \nreason for the United States and the people of Israel to consider and \nanswer this question frankly and honestly. I am concerned, as others \nhave also warned, that a short-term tactical victory--even if \npossible--could prove to be a hollow victory at great human cost.\n  We should also reflect on the circumstances that preceded this \ncrisis. For the past 5 years, the Bush administration's approach to the \nMiddle East has been either to ignore it or to parachute in for just \nenough time for a few handshakes and photographs. There has never been \nan effective strategy. They have never been willing to expend any \npolitical capital. Their policy toward Syria and Iran has been erratic \nand ineffective. Their relations with the Palestinians have stagnated.\n  It was clear since the earliest days of this administration that this \nlaxity would define their approach to these tinderbox issues, and the \nterrible harm of that approach--to our ally Israel, to the \nPalestinians, and to the prospects for resuming a meaningful peace \nprocess in that region is all the more clear today.\n  I am not among those who believe that the United States pulls all the \nstrings in the Middle East. There are forces there over which we have \nonly limited influence.\n  But neither do I believe there can be a lasting solution to the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict without the active, creative and sustained engagement \nof the United States, including direct talks with those with whom we \nstrongly disagree, like Syria and Iran. That has been sorely lacking \nunder this administration, and we are witnessing the price of that \nneglect in Lebanon and Israel today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8533-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             A CALL TO DUTY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two acts of \nselfless courage that exemplify the willingness of Iowans to accept and \nfulfill their Nation's call to duty. The actions of US Marine Corps \nSgt. R.J. Mitchell and Sergeant Major Bradley Kasal have earned each of \nthem the Navy Cross. Awarded for their actions during a November 2004 \nassault on Fallujah, the Navy Cross is among the highest awards for \ngallantry our Nation can bestow on those who serve. More than this, \nthey have earned the respect of a nation and the thanks of its people \nby ensuring that the cause of freedom and its protection not only \nsurvives but thrives in the face of every challenge.\n  Sergeant Mitchell, who grew up near Carson, IA, was awarded the Navy \nCross on July 28. Sergeant Major Kasal, originally from Afton, IA \nreceived his award May 1 as well as a promotion to sergeant major. \nDuring an assault on a house in Fallujah, both Iowans charged to the \naid of fellow wounded marines, remaining in the line of fire and \ncontinuing to provide leadership to fellow marines until the last \ninjured marine was safely evacuated. Over the course of the engagement, \nboth sustained wounds from enemy fire and shrapnel but continued on in \nharm's way, saving the lives of several marines as a result of their \nselfless actions.\n  I extend my personal gratitude, that of all Iowans, and all \nAmericans, to these brave marines. It is in their selfless acts of \ncourage that the very meaning of honor can be found. The Navy Cross is \nmore than an adornment, it symbolizes the respect and appreciation of \nthe American people. Through these heroic acts in service to their \ncountry, Brad Kasal and R.J. Mitchell truly embodied the motto of Iowa, \n``Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8533-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8533-S8534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THANKING SUMMER INTERNS\n\n\n                              Bill Blewett\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I express my interest in \ncontinuing to work on reform of the Committee on Foreign Investment in \nthe United States.\n  National security is our priority, but it is vital that we not let \noverreaction from the Dubai Ports World controversy result in hasty \nlegislation that will choke off foreign direct investment, or ``in-\nsourcing,'' which is a key contributor to the U.S. economy. In my own \nState, 87,000 people, or 6 percent of the entire State workforce, are \nemployed by in-sourcing companies. These are good jobs, most frequently \nin manufacturing, paying 34 percent higher wages on average.\n  It is understandable that everyone involved with the CFIUS process \ntoday is very cautious. Consequently, there are more CFIUS filings. \nCFIUS is taking extra measures to ensure that every transaction is \nstrenuously scrutinized. Moreover, CFIUS is frequently requiring \nsecurity commitments from parties with regard to transactions that they \nwould not have given a second thought before.\n  Without a doubt, some of this is good--the CFIUS process needs to be \nthorough. But extreme caution, when mixed with amendments to the Exon-\nFlorio statute proposed by S. 3549, may result in substantial \nbureaucratic friction and delay for the foreign investments that pose \nno national security risk.\n  I am concerned that, in the post-Dubai Ports World environment, \noverburdened CFIUS agencies could be tempted to regularly seek to \nextend the initial 30-day review to a 60-day period for reasons \nunrelated to any issues presented by the transaction under review. This \ntemptation could be even greater given the case-by-case, detailed \nnotifications to Congress that the bill would require CFIUS personnel \nto provide at every stage of regulatory proceedings. Ultimately, these \ndelays could clog up the CFIUS process, penalize foreign investors, and \nchill foreign investment, without actually contributing to improved \nnational security.\n  I also raised this issue during Banking Committee hearings on S. \n3549, which passed the Senate last week. Chairman Shelby pledged to \nwork to address these concerns during markup of the legislation. I look \nforward to working with him to do so as the bill proceeds to \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8534-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8534-S8535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL JAMES J. D'AGOSTINO\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I recognize the accomplishments \nof BG James J. D'Agostino, U.S. Air Force, assistant adjutant general \nfor air and deputy commanding general, of the Rhode Island National \nGuard. General D'Agostino is retiring on August 5, 2006, with over 38 \nyears of active military service in war and peace. I have been pleased \nto know General D'Agostino for many years.\n  Brigadier General D'Agostino has served in a variety of field and \nstaff assignments. His military career began in 1967 when he enlisted \nin the U.S. Army. After completing infantry training, he served with \ndistinction during the Vietnam war in four separate military campaigns. \nAfter serving in Vietnam, he was transferred to the Army Reserve and \nwas honorably discharged as a sergeant in 1973.\n  In 1974, Brigadier General D'Agostino joined the 143rd Civil \nEngineering Flight of the Rhode Island Air National Guard. Three years \nlater, he graduated from the Air National Guard Academy of Military \nScience and was commissioned a first lieutenant. Shortly thereafter, he \nassumed the duties of base civil engineer for the 281st Combat \nCommunications Group in Coventry, RI. Twenty-one years later, in 1999, \nhe was transferred to the U.S. Property and Fiscal Office for Rhode \nIsland as the supervisory logistics management specialist. Within 2 \nyears, Brigadier General D'Agostino was selected to be the fiscal \nofficer for Rhode Island, where he served through September 2005. In \nOctober 2005, he transitioned to his current position as the assistant \nadjutant general for air and deputy commanding general of the Rhode \nIsland National Guard.\n  You have to cast a very large net to truly capture everything \nBrigadier General D'Agostino has done to improve the Rhode Island \nNational Guard. I would like to highlight some of his greatest \naccomplishments. During his 21-year tenure as the only ``one person'' \nbase civil engineering officer in the Air National Guard, he completely \nrebuilt both the Coventry and North Smithfield Air National Guard \nstations. He planned and effected a comprehensive program of military \nconstruction which has since cut operating and maintenance costs by \nnearly 50 percent. Additionally, he more than tripled the size of the \nNorth Smithfield Air National Guard, station, which provided, for the \nfirst time, a realistic environment for unit-wide, in-garrison field \ntraining. For his outstanding performance he was recognized as Rhode \nIsland's Federal Professional Employee of the Year in 1997.\n  In 1998, Brigadier General D'Agostino prepared the critical project \nbook for what was at that time the single largest military construction \nproject in the Rhode Island National Guard, the $16 million C-130J \naircraft hanger. Rhode Island's 143rd Airlift Wing was subsequently the \nfirst Air Force unit to receive the C-130J and appropriately, they \nperformed superbly as they deployed the first C-130Js during the global \nwar on terrorism in Iraq. Today, that hanger supports the Rhode Island \nAir National Guard's five C-130J aircraft.\n  And finally, Brigadier General D'Agostino's has been a critical \nsupporter of energy conservation. While rebuilding Rhode Island's \nbases, he strictly adhered to using energy efficient air conditioning \nunits, lighting fixtures, and appliances. Additionally, he has \nimplemented various energy conservation programs that further enhance \nenergy efficiency. Between these and other cost saving measures, an \nestimated reduction of over 50 percent has been achieved in operating \nand maintenance costs.\n  While carrying the full load of his professional career, Brigadier \nGeneral D'Agostino has been affiliated with at least 30 professional \nand military organizations. He has and continues to serve in many \nprominent positions, where his work has paralleled his military \nsuccesses.\n  Brigadier General D'Agostino, currently serves as the chairman of the \nboard at the Society for Human Advancement through Rehabilitation \nEngineering Foundation, with which he has been actively involved for \nover 20 years. The society has enabled hundreds of individuals with \ndisabilities to communicate via custom-made computer systems utilizing \nvoice synthesizers and other specialized equipment.\n  As a past president of the National Guard Association of Rhode \nIsland, Brigadier General D'Agostino created and still chairs its \nscholarship awards program, which has awarded almost $40,000 in \nscholarships. Additionally, he also served for several years as a \ntrustee for the Rhode Island Air National Guard's McGown-Roberts \nScholarship Fund, the primary educational fundraising vehicle for Air \nNational Guard personnel. In 2002, the National Guard Association of \nthe United States\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\nawarded him its coveted Meritorious Service Award for his contributions \nto his State and Nation.\n  Brigadier General D'Agostino is surrounded by a wonderful family. \nTogether with his wife of almost 30 years, Frances, he has raised two \nchildren, Christopher and Alisa, of which they are very proud. He and \nFrances have been a remarkable example of husband and wife in service \nto the Air Force, to the Rhode Island National Guard, and to the \nNation. Anyone who has enjoyed their friendship, treasures their \ncompany and their kindness.\n  Through Brigadier General D'Agostino's considerable efforts, the men \nand women of the Rhode Island National Guard have truly world-class \nfacilities in which to accomplish their critical work. His consistent \nexceptional performance and exemplary character have secured his \nreputation as one of Rhode Island's most respected military officers.\n  The Rhode Island National Guard has never been stronger and more \nconnected to the Army and Air Force. Brigadier General D'Agostino has \nset the groundwork for current and future Rhode Island National Guard \nfacilities. His dedication to excellence and his unsurpassed devotion \nto duty, honor, and country have marked his distinguished service over \n38 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8535-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF MARRIAGE\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to delay the full implementation of the occupational \nmix adjustment to the wage index under the Medicare inpatient hospital \nprospective payment system; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join once again my good \nfriend and colleague Senator Baucus to introduce the Wage Index \nAccuracy Improvement Act.\n  The Wage Index Accuracy Improvement Act enables the Centers for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, to improve the accuracy of Medicare \npayments for acute care hospital services.\n  Under Medicare, acute care hospitals are paid for inpatient services \nthrough the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, IPPS. Around \n3,500 hospitals received payment through the\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\nIPPS totaling approximately $100 billion in fiscal year 2004.\n  As you know, hospitals in the United States vary greatly in terms of \nsize, geographic location, types of patients served and staffing. Since \na ``one size fits all'' approach to paying hospitals would not fairly \ncompensate hospitals for the inpatient services they provide to \nMedicare patients, payments under the IPPS are adjusted to take into \naccount these differences.\n  CMS has been refining one such adjustment, as required by law, and \nhas limited its application until it has been adequately developed. \nThis significant adjustment, the area wage index, is intended to \naccount for differences in prices for labor in different markets.\n  In order to ensure that the wage index accurately reflects the \ndifference in labor costs among different areas and not a hospital's \nemployment choices, an occupational mix adjustment is also applied to \nthe wage index.\n  For example, a hospital choosing to employ predominantly registered \nnurses would have higher labor costs than a hospital employing--less-\nexpensive--licensed practical nurses. Because a hospital's staffing \npractices are unrelated to area wages, its staff composition should not \ninfluence the area wage index.\n  CMS collected data in 2004 from hospitals for purposes of calculating \nthe occupational mix adjustment; however, because of reasons including \nthe agency's lack of confidence in the data, only 10 percent of the \nwage index was adjusted for occupational mix in fiscal years 2005 and \n2006.\n  Questions concerning the reliability of these data can be seen in my \nhome State of Iowa. Since the State is largely rural, Iowa hospitals \ngenerally employ a less expensive mix of personnel. One would expect \nthe occupational mix adjustment to the wage index to benefit these \nhospitals; however, the opposite effect has occurred. In fact, it is \nestimated that the occupational mix adjustment has adversely affected 8 \nof the 10 geographic locations in Iowa.\n  CMS originally proposed to continue this limited adjustment for \noccupational mix in fiscal year 2007, but a Federal appellate court \nordered the agency to apply the occupational mix adjustment, based on \ndata collected in 2006, to 100 percent of the wage index effective for \nfiscal year 2007.\n  CMS collected these data hurriedly, using only 3 months of data, and \nwill not be able to post the final wage index information until after \nthe fiscal year 2007 inpatient hospital rates are announced. Moreover, \nsince the data collection instrument has changed from the last time CMS \ncollected data, CMS will not have sufficient time to analyze fully the \ndata and determine their accuracy.\n  Given the lack of opportunity to ensure data accuracy, the \nuncertainty of how the occupational mix adjustment will affect hospital \npayments, and the disruption that can occur in moving immediately from \na 10-percent adjustment for occupational mix to a 100-percent \nadjustment, the Medicare Wage Index Improvement Act would limit \napplication of the occupational mix to the current rate for a 2-year \nperiod.\n  This legislation would give CMS the opportunity to look at the data \nand act accordingly both to apply the occupational mix adjustment to \nthe wage index appropriately and to avoid disruptions.\n  In the meantime, the Medicare Wage Index Improvement Act would \nrequire CMS to evaluate the way in which they collect data for and \ncalculate the occupational mix adjustment and present us with \nrecommendations by January 1, 2008.\n  I would also like to point out that the changes required under this \nlegislation would be budget neutral because the Social Security Act \nrequires that aggregate payments under this adjustment not be greater \nor less than payments made without the adjustment.\n  Mr. President, adjusting inpatient hospital payments under Medicare \ncan have significant effects on a hospital's financial health. These \nadjustments should therefore be adequately developed to ensure that \npayments are accurate and not fully implemented until they are ready.\n  In the case of the wage index adjustment, let's provide CMS the \nopportunity to get the job done right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, along with Finance Committee \nChairman Chuck Grassley, I am introducing the Wage Index Accuracy \nImprovement Act. This bill would help ensure access to quality, \naffordable health care in rural America. And this bill would improve \naccuracy, reduce volatility, and ease uncertainty in the way that \nMedicare pays hospitals.\n  Medicare pays most hospitals through the inpatient prospective \npayment system, or IPPS. Under the IPPS, Medicare pays hospitals a \nstandardized amount for each patient discharged. The Government's \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, adjusts this amount \nfor local wages, with a mechanism known as the area wage index. CMS \nintends that the area wage index help adjust for the wide variation of \nprices for labor and supplies across the Nation. After adjusting for \nwages, CMS then multiplies the standardized amount by the relative \nweight of the diagnosis--the diagnosis related group or DRG--to \ndetermine the total payment to the hospital. CMS further increases \npayments if the hospital is a teaching hospital, cares for a \ndisproportionate share of low-income patients, or treats an \nexceptionally costly case.\n  Rural providers have had concerns about the accuracy of the wage \nindex. Largely in response to these concerns, Congress enacted an \nimportant provision as part of the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, \nin 2003. For hospitals with wage indexes below 1.0--that is, hospitals \nwhere CMS thinks that local wages are below average--section 403 of the \nMMA reduced the portion of the standardized amount subject to wages to \n62 percent, down from about 70 percent. This provision increased \npayments to hospitals in low-wage areas by an estimated $5.2 billion \nover 10 years. And this change was an important step toward ensuring \naccess to quality, affordable health care in rural areas.\n  Nonetheless, significant problems with the wage index still exist. \nSome of those problems relate to section 304 of the Benefits \nImprovement and Protection Act of 2001. In that law, Congress required \nCMS to collect data on hospitals' occupational mix, in order to remove \nincentives to employ a relatively more expensive workforce.\n  For instance, a hospital that employs predominantly higher paid \nregistered nurses would typically have higher labor costs than a \nfacility employing mostly lower paid licensed practical nurses. In an \neffort to remove the influence of these staffing choices on Medicare \nhospital payments, section 304 required CMS to adjust the wage index \nfor occupational mix. Congress intended through section 304 to bring \ngreater accuracy to the payment system, leading to fairer reimbursement \nfor hospitals. I am concerned that this provision may well have the \nopposite effect.\n  CMS collected data for occupational mix adjustment in 2004. But given \nconcerns over the accuracy of the data, in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, \nCMS applied only a 10-percent adjustment for occupational mix. CMS \nproposed the same adjustment--10 percent--for fiscal year 2007.\n  On April 3, 2006, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ordered CMS to \napply 100-percent of the occupational mix adjustment for fiscal year \n2007. The court directed CMS to complete data collection and \nmeasurement by September 30, 2006, and then apply the adjustment in \nfull.\n  Mr. President, if CMS proceeds with a 100 percent occupational mix \nadjustment, hospital payments will be subject to inaccuracy, \nuncertainty, and volatility. Congress can prevent these outcomes, by \npassing the Wage Index Accuracy Improvement Act that we introduce \ntoday.\n  This bill would maintain the current 10 percent occupational mix \nadjustment for the next 2 fiscal years, giving CMS time to collect \naccurate data. The bill would require CMS to report on its data \ncollection for the occupational mix adjustment by January 1, 2008. Both \nof these actions will give hospitals more time--and more information--\nto better understand the effect of the occupational mix adjustment.\n  Mr. President, Medicare pays for more than $100 billion of hospital \ninpatient services every year. This system should be as accurate as \npossible. This system should not be subject to swings resulting from \nquickly-collected data, applied at the last minute. I urge my\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\ncolleagues to join Chairman Grassley and me in passing this important \nlegislation as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. \n        Harkin):\n  S. 3768. A bill to prohibit the procurement of victim-activated \nlandmines and other weapons that are designed to be victim-activated; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I join Senator Leahy in introducing \nthe Victim-Activated Landmine Abolition Act of 2006, which will \nprohibit the procurement of victim-activated landmines. Antipersonnel, \nvictim-activated landmines are small, inexpensive weapons that kill or \nmaim people upon contact. Indiscriminate use has produced many civilian \ncasualties and has resulted in an international effort to control or \nban these weapons.\n  As a member of both the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense and \nForeign Operations, I have supported efforts to create alternatives to \nvictim-activated munitions, to mitigate the associated risks for \ninnocent civilians, and to help those who have been inadvertently \nharmed. The United States sets an example for the world by remaining a \nglobal leader in providing funds for mine clearance, mine risk \neducation, and mine survivor assistance activities. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, the United States has dedicated an \nestimated $500 million for demining efforts over the last 10 years. \nFurthermore, the U.S. Department of Defense, in conjunction with \nindustry partners, has developed technology which permits the \ndeployment of mines that cannot be activated by the victim. This ``man-\nin-the-loop'' technology will ensure that innocent civilians are not \nharmed by mines.\n  On September 18, 1997, diplomats from almost 90 countries met in \nOslo, Norway, and adopted the text of the Convention on the Prohibition \nof the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel \nMines and on their Destruction, commonly referred to as the Ottawa \nConvention or the Mine Ban Treaty. The Mine Ban Treaty went into effect \non March 1, 1999, and mandates that countries discontinue the \nproduction, stockpile, use or exportation of antipersonnel landmines. \nIt further mandates that countries clear their territory of mines and \ndestroy stockpiles. The Mine Ban Treaty is credited with the reduction \nin victims and procurement of mines.\n  Although the U.S. has declined to participate in the treaty, the U.S. \ncontinues to lead the world in dollars spent on aid and efforts to help \nforeign nations demine fields and dispose of thousands of antipersonnel \nlandmines, which is a costly and dangerous undertaking. The U.S. has \nnot used antipersonnel mines since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Since \n1992, the U.S. has prohibited exportation of antipersonnel mines and \nU.S. production was halted in 1997.\n  A review of the facts surrounding landmines and the tragic \nconsequences that have resulted from their use has convinced me that \nthe indiscriminate use of these weapons must be stopped. The \nInternational Campaign to Ban Landmines estimates that there are more \nthan 80 million landmines in the ground in more than 80 countries and \nthat 15,000-20,000 people are maimed or killed by landmines each year. \nUNICEF estimates that 30 to 40 percent of mine victims are children \nunder 15 years old. Millions more suffer from the economic and \npsychological impact of these weapons.\n  Innocent civilians in foreign countries are not the only victims that \nsuffer the debilitating effects of these weapons. Landmines have \ninjured and killed thousands of U.S. and allied troops in every U.S.-\nfought conflict since World War II, including those in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Although landmines cost as little as $3 to produce, they \ncan cost as much as $1,000 per mine to clear.\n  The legislation introduced today calls on the United States to \ncontinue to set an example for other countries by implementing a ban on \nthe procurement of victim-activated weapons systems. Further, it \nrecognizes that the U.S. has acquired reliable technology that enables \nall weapons systems to be equipped with man-in-the-loop targeting and \ntriggering capabilities, meaning that the device can be deployed and \ntriggered only in response to an intentional action by a person.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am today introducing, with my friend from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, and Senators Dorgan and Harkin, The \nVictim-Activated Landmine Abolition Act of 2006.\n  This legislation would prohibit the procurement of victim-activated \nlandmines and other weapons that are designed to be victim-activated. \nIt builds on a long history of leadership by the Congress on the issue \nof landmines, which indiscriminately kill and maim innocent people, as \nwell as U.S. troops, around the world.\n  I will have another statement on this subject when we return from the \nAugust recess, but I want to make a couple of points today.\n  First, Senators should know that since 1997 when an international \ntreaty banning the manufacture, use, export and stockpiling of \nantipersonnel landmines was initialed at Ottawa, 154 nations have \nsigned and 151 have ratified the treaty.\n  This is an extraordinary achievement, for which Lloyd Axworthy, \nCanada's Foreign Minister at the time, and the International Campaign \nto Ban Landmines deserve enormous credit. Unfortunately, the United \nStates is not a signatory to the treaty and at one time even worked \nagainst it.\n  Thanks to the treaty, the manufacture and export of antipersonnel \nlandmines has decreased significantly, and the number of victims has \nalso declined. But mines continue to be a weapon of choice, especially \nfor rebel groups such as the FARC in Colombia and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n  Second, the United States has not exported antipersonnel mines since \n1992, produced antipersonnel mines since 1997, or used anti personnel \nmines since 1991. This is not a weapon we need.\n  Moreover, for the past decade the Department of Defense has been \ndeveloping alternatives to landmines. The goal has been to replace \nmines that cannot distinguish between an enemy combatant and a U.S. \nsoldier, an innocent child, a farmer or a refugee.\n  That program has produced man-in-the-loop technology that is ready to \nbe deployed in a new generation of mines that are not victim-activated.\n  I have long supported this program and I commend the Department of \nDefense for its support for the development of this technology. I \nbelieve it will provide the U.S. military with the force multiplier and \nprotection afforded by conventional landmines without impeding the \nmobility of our troops or endangering innocent civilians. It will \nenable the military to finally stop using or stockpiling victim-\nactivated landmines that have no place in the arsenal of a civilized \nnation, much less the world's only superpower.\n\n  As we see daily in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Lebanon, civilians bear the \nbrunt of wars today. They do not have body armor or armored vehicles. \nThey are routinely caught in the crossfire. At any moment they are at \nrisk of being killed or maimed by a landmine or other improvised \nexplosive that lies in wait until triggered by whoever steps on it or \ndrives over it.\n  I want to emphasize that the need for this legislation is not because \nthe United States is causing the mine problem. It is not. As I \nmentioned, we have not used or exported antipersonnel mines for 15 \nyears, despite fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are also the \nlargest contributor to humanitarian demining in countries that have \nbeen severely affected by mines, and we support programs to assist mine \nsurvivors.\n  But just as a solution to the Middle East conflict depends on the \nactive, sustained engagement and leadership of the United States, so \ndoes the problem of landmines.\n  As was the case with poison gas more than half a century ago, the \nsolution to the mine problem is the stigmatization of these \nindiscriminate weapons so the political price of using them serves as a \ndeterrent. Will some rebel groups or rogue nations continue to defy the \ninternational norm? Undoubtedly. But by setting an example and using \nour influence we can reduce their numbers significantly to the benefit \nof our troops and the innocent.\n  I again want to thank my friend Senator Specter, who has supported \nlegislation to ban landmines for more than a decade.\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The `Victim-activated Landmine Abolition Act of 2006', \nwhich I am joining my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, in \nintroducing today would end the procurement of these indiscriminate \nweapons by the United States. We neither need these weapons not is it \nin our interest to continue to insist on the right to use them. They \ncannot distinguish between civilians and combatants, and as long as we \nstockpile them we cannot credibly urge others to stop using them \nagainst our troops. Does my friend from Vermont agree with me that our \ngoal in sponsoring this legislation is to reaffirm United States \nleadership on this crucial humanitarian issue and to encourage other \nnations to follow our example?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct and I thank the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania. I have been pleased to have him as a partner over the \nyears on legislation to eliminate these inhumane weapons, and I welcome \nthe opportunity to do so again today. We want to send a message to the \nworld that victim-activated landmines and other weapons designed to be \nvictim-activated are beyond the pale. We have seen what they can do to \nour troops. We have seen what they do to a child who picks up one of \nthese seemingly harmless objects, only to have it blow off an arm or \nworse. These weapons do not belong in the arsenals of civilized \nnations.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my friend, who has led this campaign for so many \nyears. Landmines and other munitions that are designed to be victim-\nactivated are inherently indiscriminate. In that sense, they are no \ndifferent from poison gas. They should be abolished and replaced with \nweapons that have a man-in-the-loop who can distinguish between an \nenemy combatant and a civilian. The Department of Defense has this \ntechnology. It is time for the United States to adopt a policy that is \nconsistent with the force protection needs of our troops and with the \nmoral values of the American people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Coleman, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 3769. A bill to encourage multilateral cooperation and authorize a \nprogram of assistance to facilitate a peaceful transition in Cuba, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, at long last, Fidel Castro's reign of \nterror over the Cuban people may be coming to an end. Fidel Castro is \nincapacitated. He has handed over control of the government to his \nbrother, Raul. The Cuban Government wants us to believe that it is a \ntemporary measure--that Castro just needs to recuperate from surgery. \nBut we don't know the truth--we can't know the truth, because lies are \nthe byproduct of tyranny. And tyrannies are notoriously opaque. For all \nwe know, it may be that Fidel already has already spent his last day as \nCuba's leader.\n  I believe that now is the time for the U.S. Government to push for a \npeaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. It is a travesty that more \nthan a decade after the cold war ended, a brutal communist dictatorship \nis still oppressing people 90 miles from our border. It would be an \neven greater travesty if the United States did not do everything in our \npower to ensure that after Fidel leaves power--one way or another--Cuba \nbecomes free.\n  Let's join together in support of the Cuban people and in support of \nfreedom, and let's adopt this bill.\n  We need to send a signal to all the dissidents and political \nprisoners in Cuba that we have no illusions about the nature of Fidel \nCastro's regime--that we know of their plight and stand ready to help \nthem. When Ronald Reagan called Russia the ``evil empire,'' it brought \nhope to the dissidents and political prisoners in the Soviet gulags. \nThey knew that the people and leaders of the United States were united \nwith them. They were not alone.\n  That is why I am introducing a bill today that authorizes assistance \nto the OAS for Cuba human rights activities and election reform. It \nalso authorizes a fund to support independent civil society-building \nefforts. That includes assistance to political prisoners and their \nfamilies, other dissidents, independent libraries, youth organizations, \nworkers' rights activists, agricultural cooperatives, associations of \nthe self-employed, journalists, economists, and medical doctors. And it \ncreates the ``Fund for a Free Cuba'' to provide assistance to a \ntransition government in Cuba.\n  This bill is consistent with the recommendations in the July 2006 \nCommission for Assistance for a Free Cuba report. We need to move this \nlegislation now, when it can have the biggest impact. The people of \nCuba are watching and listening. We need to show them that the leaders \nof the United States are willing to join them in their quest to be \nfree. They need to know that they are not alone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 3770. A bill to require a pilot program on the facilitation of the \ntransition of members of the Armed Forces to receipt of veterans health \ncare benefits upon completion of military service, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, since the March 2003 start of the Iraq \nwar, more than 19,157 members of our Nation's Armed Forces have been \ninjured, more than 18,777 of them wounded in action.\n  Imagine that you are one of those wounded. You are an enlisted marine \nserving your country in Iraq. Your convoy is attacked by Iraqi gunmen \nand your transport explodes, killing several of your fellow soldiers \nand wounding many more. You are seriously wounded, so you're medevaced \nto Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and then transported to an \nappropriate medical facility in the U.S. for further stabilization and \ntreatment.\n  As you begin the long road to recovery in the hospital, you may be \napproached by a Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, counselor who \nprovides you with information about VA medical benefits and vocational \nrehabilitation and employment services. You may or may not meet with \nsomeone from the VA. But you're not ready to think about those things \nyet. You just want to get better and rejoin your fellow marines in \nIraq.\n  Several months later, as you convalesce, Department of Defense, DOD, \ndetermines that you should be discharged due to the seriousness of your \ninjuries. But, the discharge process won't become official for at least \nnine months, and you can't access VA services until it does. This \nleaves you in limbo, caught somewhere between the DOD and VA systems.\n  You finally return home, still convalescing from your injuries and \nwhile there, you finally receive your discharge papers. This \ndevelopment means no more access to the support you received during \nactive duty, including health care. In order to receive medical care, \nyou need to begin enrollment in the VA system to access medical \nservices. Enrollment is a slow and difficult process, and, in your \nseriously wounded state, you come up against a blizzard of paperwork, \nByzantine procedures, and a number of overworked VA caseworkers.\n  Your family has no idea how to get you into the system quickly and \nwithout having to pay more money for interim care until the VA benefits \nkick in.\n  As the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan grind on, these stories are \nall too frequent. Many wounded soldiers, service men and women are \nfaced with the prospect of a premature end to their military service \nand are struggling to reenter civilian life, often with permanent \ndisabilities. And they now have to find their way to the VA. They need \nhelp finding their way so they can get the care they deserve. They have \nserved their country and now their country, their military, owes them \nour best in return.\n  That is why I am proud to introduce the Veterans Navigator Act, a \nbill that would expand and enhance the important work done by VSOs and \nother non-governmental organizations to guide our Nation's service men \nand women to and through the VA healthcare system. It would, in fact, \nacknowledge the work of these organizations by providing $25 million in \ngrants over 5 years to augment their capabilities.\n  The ``navigator'' concept is not new. It is similar to the Patient \nNavigator demonstration program I introduced and which was subsequently \nenacted\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\ninto law. There, we also took a successful small-scale program being \nused at select medical facilities around the country and expanded it by \nproviding grants for a scaled-up demonstration program to serve those \nwith cancer and other chronic diseases, and in particular, to provide \nsupport to medically underserved populations.\n  With the veterans navigator bill, I propose to do something similar, \ncapitalizing on the successes of the Patient navigator concept, to help \nour troops. The $25 million over 5 years in the bill would allow VSOs \nand other organizations to apply for grants so that they could hire and \ntrain navigators to provide assistance, on an individualized basis, to \nmembers of the Armed Forces as they transition from military service to \nthe VA health care system. They would do so in coordination with DOD \nand the VA. Right now, many VSOs rely principally on donations to \nperform these services.\n  At the end of the 5 years, the VA Secretary would submit a report to \nCongress on the effectiveness of the veterans navigator demonstration \nprogram and to recommend whether it should be made permanent.\n  Often called national service officers or counselors, a navigator is \na ``sherpa,'' a guide through the maze of paper and people and \nspecialists and benefits. A navigator is an advocate for those no \nlonger able to go it alone. A navigator is a facilitator, someone who \nwill be with you through the process, to provide the expertise you will \nneed to transition between active duty and veterans status and to get \nthe urgent care you need.\n  Let me be clear: a navigator does not supplant the role of the DOD or \nthe VA. A navigator is meant to complement the work done by these \norganizations, particularly at a time when those systems are struggling \nto meet the needs of the soldiers returning from war and will continue \nto do so long after the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have ended.\n  The bill focuses particular attention on four underserved groups in \nthe military community: the seriously injured or wounded soldiers, \nfemale soldiers, those suffering from psychological problems like post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and members of the activated National \nGuard and Reserves.\n  These underserved groups have not been sufficiently served in \nexisting VA and DOD transition programs and activities. It is these \nunderserved groups who especially need continuity of care as they enter \nand wind their way through the VA medical system. Part of the reason \nthey have not been adequately cared for is that the nature of the \ncurrent wars we are fighting, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, are different \nfrom previous conflicts we have undertaken.\n  During the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns, we have the largest \nactivation of National Guard and reservists since World War II. As of \nJune 1, according to DOD, the United States had 128,789 military \npersonnel deployed in Iraq. Of these, 102,709 were active component \npersonnel and 26,080 were National Guard and Reserves. The recent \nannouncement by President Bush to send additional troops to Baghdad in \nthe face of increasing sectarian violence will likely only mean that \nthose numbers will increase.\n  The GAO released a report last February citing deficiencies in \nbenefits for these soldiers. The report concluded that National Guard \nand Reserve soldiers ``are given little help navigating a thicket of \nregulations and procedures necessary to gain access to military \ndoctors.''\n\n  To complicate matters, members of our National Guard who seek medical \ncare must file for an extension of their active duty status in order to \ncontinue to access military bases and hospitals.\n  In its report, GAG also concluded that, and I quote, ``the Army has \nnot consistently provided the infrastructure needed to accommodate the \nneeds of soldiers trying to navigate their way through the' active duty \nmedical extension' ADME--process . . . this has resulted in injured and \nill soldiers carrying a disproportionate share of the burden for \nensuring that they do not fall off their active duty orders.''\n  The Veterans Navigator Act would help minimize such occurrences by \nproviding National Guardsmen and Reservists someone to help bring them \nthrough the ADME process and to help correct any discrepancies before \nthey cause a delay in accessing VA medical care.\n  Veterans with psychological problems also need help. In the last \nseveral years, we have been hearing a lot more about post-traumatic \nstress disorder, or PTSD, in veterans and those returning from \nconflict. A recent GAO report has concluded that almost four out of \nfive service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who were found \nto be at risk for PTSD, were not provided appropriate medical \nassistance. All of these factors mean that now, more than ever, our \nNation's soldiers need help moving between the DOD and VA realms.\n  According to the chief of psychology at Walter Reed Army Institute of \nResearch, roughly 20 percent of those service men and women returning \nfrom Iraq suffer from PTSD. In its recently released report, GAO \nconcluded that roughly 78 percent of those servicemembers at risk for \nPTSD do not get further evaluation. That means they return to active \nduty or are discharged without receiving the appropriate care.\n  It is the nature of this disorder to appear not right after the \ntraumatic event is experienced, but often not until an individual \nreexperiences an event, has a flashback or is somehow reminded of a \nbattlefield event. That may not happen until after a servicemember has \nbeen discharged from service. Once PTSD does emerge, the veteran may \nnot know how to access VA medical assistance, or he or she may not have \nyet enrolled into the VA medical system.\n  Again, as in the case of the severely wounded, time is of the \nessence. PTSD can manifest itself so severely as to incapacitate a \nsoldier, making medical care more urgent. In the case of returning \nNational Guardsmen and Reservists, the problem is made more complex \nbecause of the 2 year time limit on filing for VA benefits.\n  Since 1991, opportunities for women in our Nation's Armed Forces have \ngrown. For the first time, the military is placing women in support \nunits at the front line. This has come partly as the result of more \nthan 10 years of policy changes making 91 percent of the career fields \ngender neutral.\n  The Navy and the Air Force have begun to allow female soldiers to fly \nfighters and bombers. The Army has expanded the role of women in \nground-combat operations. Right now, ``women command combat military \npolice companies, fly Apache helicopters, work as tactical intelligence \nanalysts, and serve in artillery units.\n  This would have been unheard of a decade ago, but it is happening \nright now. Right now, record numbers of female soldiers are fighting on \nthe front lines and, as a result, more are being seriously wounded or \nkilled. A Baltimore reporter profiling women soldiers' participation in \nIraq observed that ``the war in Iraq has been an equal opportunity \nemployer, by killing and injuring a historic number of female soldiers \nin combat situations.''\n  Therefore, a VA medical system designed to treat wounded male \nsoldiers must now ensure that female soldiers get the right kind of \nmedical care. They will need help finding that care and getting access \nto that care. A veteran navigator can help them do that.\n  Because of the length and size of the deployment, many more soldiers \nare being seriously wounded. According to the GAO, roughly 30 percent \nof U.S. soldiers wounded in combat during World War II later died. \nToday, that number has dropped to 3 percent for those serving in Iraq \nand Afghanistan due to advances in technology and protective gear.\n  While this is clearly a positive development, it also means that many \nof these injured soldiers are returning home with severe disabilities, \nincluding traumatic brain injuries and missing limbs that require \ncomprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services.\n  But, severe injuries often mean a lengthy transition from active duty \nto veteran status. As my story earlier indicates the physical \nevaluation of a seriously wounded service member to determine whether \nhe or she can return to active duty can take months to complete. In the \ninterim, the VA has to be able to identify these soldiers so that they \ncan perform early outreach, provided that they have the information to \ndo so.\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\n  Despite this, the GAO observed in a March 2005 report that the VA \nfaces ``significant challenges in providing services to seriously \ninjured service members.''\n  In many cases, VA staff have reported that seriously injured service \nmembers are simply not ready to begin thinking about VA benefits or \ndealing with the VA system during the recovery process. The problem \nhere, as GAO has pointed out, is that the VA has no policy for \nmaintaining contact with these soldiers down the line, once they are \ndischarged. Contact is often conducted on an ad hoc basis. Navigators \ncan also help these seriously wounded soldiers.\n  VSOs such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American \nVeterans, Jewish War Veterans and so many others have emphasized the \nimportance of maintaining contact with seriously injured veterans who \ndo not initially apply for VA health care benefits because it may be \nmany months or even years before they are prepared to apply for them.\n  The veterans navigator can help perform this function. Because this \nindividual or individuals have reached out to the injured service \nmember before his or her discharge, they can, in coordination with the \nVA caseworkers, remain in contact with them as they recover and prepare \nto reenter civilian life. The navigator can also help obtain \ninformation from DOD on seriously injured soldiers earlier on so that \nthey can help ensure that all service members and veterans benefit from \nVA health care services at the right time.\n  At a time when many active duty service people and veterans have \nfought and often made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, we \ncannot risk having any soldier fall through the cracks. We cannot take \nthe risk that our female soldiers, who are fighting alongside their \nmale colleagues, may not receive the medical care they need. We cannot \nrisk the lives and health of soldiers with PTSD. We cannot risk the \nlives and the health of any service member who put their lives at risk \nfor our country.\n  Not so long ago we celebrated Memorial Day, a day when each and every \nAmerican honors the service of our Nation's Armed Forces, both past and \npresent and takes a moment to thank them for helping to keep America \nsafe and secure. The very least that we can do is to ensure that all of \nthese brave men and women are able to access the medical benefits to \nwhich they are entitled, particularly in their time of greatest need. \nAt some point in each of our lives, we might need a guiding hand to \nhelp us find our way. Today, Mr. President, I am proposing to provide \nthat helping hand to our troops in a time of their greatest need. It is \nthe very least that we can do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Burr, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bond, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Talent, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Chafee, Mr. Reed, Mr. Smith, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 3771. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nadditional authorizations of appropriations for the health centers \nprogram under section 330 of such Act; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health Centers \nRenewal Act with my colleagues, Senators Kennedy, DeWine, Dodd, Burr, \nHarkin, Bond, Mikulski, Snowe, Jeffords, Talent, Bingaman, Collins, \nMurray, Chafee, Reed, Smith, and Clinton.\n  The health centers program was established more than 40 years ago and \nit has been successful in providing access to quality, comprehensive \nprimary health care services throughout the country to a large number \nof uninsured or underinsured people, including children, parents and \nthe elderly. Health centers are located at sites within medically \nunderserved areas and provide care to those who have limited or no \naccess to health insurance. Health centers are a critical component of \nour Nation's health care safety net, providing quality health care to \nover 15 million underserved individuals in the United States.\n  These health centers include community health centers which are \nlocal, not-for profit 501(c) (3) corporations that provide community-\noriented primary and preventive health care and are governed by boards \nof directors that are composed of at least 51 percent health centers \nusers, to ensure that the patients and the community are represented.\n  In my home State of Utah, community health centers serve 84,578 \npatients and provided almost 305,000 patient visits in 2005.\n  As I travel throughout Utah, I hear nothing but positive remarks \nabout the vital work of community health centers. I would like to share \nsome of the comments that I have received from Utahns with my \ncolleagues.\n  Midtown Community Health Center in Ogden, UT just opened a very \nimpressive new center which will enable patients in that community to \nreceive the latest care for a range of illnesses such as diabetes, \nhypertension and asthma. These illnesses are costly and often require \nmonthly visits, laboratory tests and expensive medication. One of the \npatients at Midtown who has diabetes and hypertension, stated that she \nwould not have anywhere to go to monitor her diabetes if Midtown didn't \nexist. She describes Midtown as a ``Godsend'' and said that without her \nhealth care provided by Dr. Gregoire, she would be in serious financial \ndebt and would have to choose between housing and food or health care. \n'\n  Another Utah health center has a family that comes into the clinic \nwith a son who is bipolar. The boy's mother called very distraught \nbecause they were having problems affording his medicines and his \nillness had created other concerns within their family. The woman's new \nhusband thought discipline was the solution to the child's mood swings. \nThe community health center referred the boy to its mental health \nworker, who in addition to providing counseling, was able to get his \nmedication for him at a reduced price. The mother thanked the mental \nhealth worker and she said just having someone to talk to who \nunderstood the boy's condition was helpful to her and her family.\n  Bottom line, community centers have made a tremendous difference for \nUtah's residents with limited or no health insurance. And these \nexamples are not unique to Utah--patients across the country have had \nsimilar experiences with community health centers.\n  Due to the difference that health centers have made in so many lives, \nCongress has consistently increased funding for them since 2001 in \norder to meet President Bush's goal to have 1,200 new or expanded \ncenters and an additional 6.1 million patients served by 2006. \nCurrently, the additional funding has provided service to 4 million \nadditional patients and has added new or expanded facilities in well \nover 750 communities nationwide. By reauthorizing this program, we will \nallow health centers to provide lowcost health care to many more \nuninsured and underinsured individuals.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will reauthorize the \nhealth center program for 5 more years at the fiscal year 2007 funding \nlevel of $1.963 billion, which is the administration's fiscal year 2007 \nbudget request for the health centers program.\n  Utah health centers have made a tremendous difference in the lives of \nmany--66 percent of patients come from Utah's urban areas and 27 \npercent are from the rural regions in Utah. Ninety-six percent of \nUtah's health center patients lived below 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level and health centers have made a tremendous difference in \ntheir lives. In fact, for most, these health centers serve as a vital \ncomponent of the health care safety net for the medically underserved \nand uninsured. In rural areas, health centers are often the only health \ncare provider for many miles.\n  Midtown Community Health Center coordinates a free comprehensive \nscreening clinic for women on an annual basis. In 2006, over 250 women \nreceived pap smears, breast examinations, diabetes screening, \ncholesterol screening and depression screening. Many of the low-income, \nuninsured women served had not received preventive care in many years. \nOne woman who attended the event had experienced irregular vaginal \nbleeding for several months. She had tried to find a medical provider \nbut was unsuccessful\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\ndue to a lack of health insurance and financial concerns. She came to \nMidtown Community Health Center with an enlarged uterus, a uterine mass \nand anemia. A Midtown medical provider arranged for an emergency \nultrasound and removal of the tumor within 3 weeks. The patient is \nimproving and being treated by Midtown for anemia and irregular \nmenstrual periods.\n  A 40-year-old man was working as a contractor when his boss noticed \nhe was losing weight and took him to the hospital. He was diagnosed \nwith tuberculosis and hepatitis C. He did not have health insurance and \nbecame homeless. The hospital referred him to Wasatch Homeless Health \nCare, Inc. where he entered the tuberculosis housing and treatment \nprogram.\n  The Johnsons manage their own business in a small rural Utah town, \nbut somehow health insurance coverage has always been difficult for \nthem to purchase. Without the Wayne Community Health Center in \nBicknell, the family could only seek medical care for emergencies.\n  These stories are just some of real life experiences which illustrate \nhow community health centers make a difference. They save lives. They \nprovide preventive health care. They keep people out of hospitals. \nCommunity health centers are worth every cent that the Federal \nGovernment invests in them. I am pleased and proud to support them by \nintroducing this legislation today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation which not \nonly provides individuals with important health care services but also \nensures that the health centers providing these services will have the \nnecessary support to continue providing health services.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join Senator Hatch \ntoday in introducing this bill to reauthorize the health centers \nprogram. The Health Centers Renewal Act reauthorizes the community \nhealth center program through 2011. Its goal is to make sure that \npeople across the Nation can obtain the care they need in their \ncommunity, regardless of their ability to pay.\n  What began in the 1960s as a neighborhood health center demonstration \nproject at two sites--Columbia Point in Massachusetts and Mound Bayou \nin Mississippi--has flourished beyond expectation in the years since \nthen. It has now grown to more than 1,000 community, migrant, and \nhomeless health centers providing care in every State across the \nNation. Health centers are the ``medical home'' today for over 15 \nmillion patients--patients who are overwhelmingly low-income, uninsured \nand minorities. Without health centers in their community, most of \nthese patients would have nowhere to turn for the health care they \nneed.\n  Health centers are truly democratic, and are operated in large part \nby the patients and communities they serve. We hear a great deal these \ndays about moving toward ``consumer-directed'' health care but in most \ncases that's a code name for cost-shifting to patients. That's not true \nof health centers, which are truly consumer-directed. The requirement \nof a patient-majority for health centers' governing boards makes sure \nthe community has a real voice in the services offered and that the \nneeds of the community are met. This community focus has been essential \nto the program's success in reducing barriers to good health care and \novercoming unfair health disparities.\n  As the number of uninsured and underinsured persons grows each year, \nthe need for health center services increases. More than 40 percent of \nhealth center patients have no health insurance and their ranks are \nincreasing. Another 36 percent have coverage through Medicaid or CHIP, \nand cuts in these programs affect health centers as well. With the \ngrowing number of patients who rely on health centers, we must provide \nthe funds needed to open new centers in areas that are underserved and \nto provide better funding to existing centers to meet the growing \ndemand.\n  Health centers fill a large void by providing quality, cost-effective \ncare in medically underserved areas. Most health centers are located in \nrural areas or economically depressed inner cities, where poverty is \nhigh and the need is great. They truly are part of the community, \nproviding not just health care, but good jobs and other programs that \nbenefit the entire community.\n  Community health centers have proven their value over the past four \ndecades, and this bill will enable them to expand and grow in the years \nahead, so that they can continue to provide the quality care that their \npatients and communities rely on.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am pleased to join with my colleagues in the \nintroduction of the Health Centers Renewal Act. Today health centers \nare a critical part of our health care safety net, serving over 15 \nmillion Americans.\n  Community Health Centers, also known as federally qualified health \ncenters, are the only source of primary and preventive services for \nmany medically underserved. This is especially true for people living \nin rural areas, where provider shortages couple with high health care \ndelivery costs to make access difficult for many individuals.\n  The increasing role of health centers truly represents a bipartisan \nsuccess story. Since 2001, the Congress has provided increased funding \nfor health centers to improve and upgrade existing facilities, as well \nas to further expand the safety net these centers provide. That has \nsupported the President's goal to provide 1,200 new or expanded \ncenters, and is why today an additional four million Americans are now \nserved by health centers.\n  In my State of Maine, over 80,000 individuals are served by federally \nfunded health centers. In fact, one in five uninsured, low-income \nMainers relies on a health center for their primary care. In rural \nareas, 1 in 10 of our residents rely on a community health center for \ncare.\n  Today's health centers look very different from those of the past. \nThey are providing comprehensive primary care, and have been moving \nforward to adopt new technology and practice models which will ensure \ncare of the highest quality at modest cost. In fact, the Office of \nManagement and Budget has recognized the health centers as one of the \ntop 10 performing programs in the Federal Government.\n  Community involvement has been key to this success. The requirement \nthat patients and community play a major role in governance has been \nkey to the success of these providers in addressing critical local \nhealth needs.\n  There is much yet that must be done to improve our health care safety \nnet, including reducing the disparities in care and outcomes which \nplague minority and poor populations. Health centers will play a vital \nrole in meeting those challenges, and that is why I am pleased to \nsupport this vital legislation to enable their continued growth and \nsupport.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 3772. A bill to establish wilderness areas, promote conservation, \nimprove public land, and provide for high quality development in White \nPine County, Nevada, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to introduce the White Pine County Conservation, Recreation and \nDevelopment Act of 2006. This bill creates economic opportunity for the \npeople of White Pine County, improves public land management, and \nprotects some of Nevada's most incredible wild lands. It also makes \nneeded changes to the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act.\n  The White Pine County Conservation, Recreation and Development Act is \nthe product of many years of work. Ranchers, land managers, \nconservationists, off-highway vehicle advocates, tribal members, city \nand county officials, wilderness advocates and many others have \ncontributed to this effort. Meetings and tours focused on a White Pine \nCounty land bill have been taking place for more than 5 years.\n  The result of these many years of dialogue can be found in the sturdy \ncompromise contained in this legislation. Our bill resolves wilderness \nstudy areas, provides a reasonable expansion of local tribal lands, \nauthorizes a study and possible designation of an off-highway vehicle \ntrail, provides for competitive Federal land sales, makes common sense \ntransfers of land between Federal agencies, expands State parks, \nconveys two small tracts of land to the county for economic \ndevelopment, funds an\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\nimportant landscape scale restoration project in eastern Nevada, and \nestablishes a national heritage route in eastern Nevada and western \nUtah.\n  Like similar legislation that we have worked on and passed for Clark \nCounty and Lincoln County, we do not expect anyone to endorse every \ntitle in this bill. When it comes to the topics of growth, conservation \nand stewardship in rural Nevada there are many strong and often \nopposing views. We believe that this legislation offers a solid middle \nground and a path forward for the people of White Pine County.\n  In order to understand why this legislation is necessary, it is \nimportant to first put Nevada and White Pine County in context. Unlike \nmost states in our Union, nearly nine out of every ten acres in Nevada \nare managed by Federal agencies. In White Pine County the number is \neven higher. Of the 5.7 million acres that make up White Pine County, \n94 percent are managed by the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, the \nForest Service, the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife \nService Federal agencies.\n  This means that local decisions are not always local. Even the \nsimplest land and stewardship decisions can involve multiple Federal \nland agencies, and the associated rules that come along with each \nagency. All too frequently, congressional action is needed to bridge \nthe divide. This is a reality in many parts of the West, but in no \nplace is it more true than in Nevada.\n  Moving beyond the borders of White Pine County, our legislation also \nmakes essential changes to the Southern Nevada Public Land Management \nAct that was first passed in 1998. This law has served Nevada well over \nthe last 8 years, yet changes are needed to ensure that the legislation \nis able to meet the many and complex needs of our fast growing State. I \nwill briefly describe each of these amendments, in addition to the \nother major titles of this legislation.\n  But before moving on to the specifics of each section of this bill, \nlet me thank my colleagues for their willingness to work with us on \nthis legislation. Senator Ensign and I have crafted this bill through a \nhands-on, ground level process that we think you will appreciate and \nsupport. Throughout this effort we have aspired to make well-reasoned, \nbeneficial and necessary changes to land management in Nevada.\n  The first title in this bill creates a mechanism to increase the \namount of privately held land in White Pine County. Currently, 94 \npercent of the land in the county is managed by Federal agencies. By \nincreasing the total amount of private land in White Pine Country, we \ncreate essential opportunities for growth and economic development that \nwill also allow the county to provide greater support to its residents \nthrough an expanded tax base.\n  Our bill calls for up to 45,000 acres of land currently managed by \nthe BLM to be made available for sale in reasonable increments. Each \nyear a portion of the total acreage will be made available for public \nauction after a joint selection is made by the county and the BLM. This \nsystem has worked well in Clark County and Lincoln County, and we \nbelieve that it will greatly enhance the ability of White Pine County \nto help plan and shape the long-term growth of its many communities. As \npart of the land sale authority, the county may elect to halt the \nannual disposal of land when and if appropriate.\n  Like the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act and the Lincoln \nCounty Conservation, Recreation and Development Act, this bill directs \nthe Secretary of Interior to reinvest the proceeds from these land \nsales into essential Federal, State, and local environmental \nprotection, infrastructure development, and recreational enhancements \nin the areas and communities where the lands are sold.\n  These funds also provide an additional revenue source for fulfilling \nthe various mandates of this bill, including an off-highway vehicle \ntrail study, designation of new wilderness areas, and the conveyance of \nlands into trust for tribal use.\n  In 1985 when I visited White Pine County to discuss possible \nwilderness designations in the Schell Creek and Currant Ranges and the \nnorth and south ends of the Snake Range, I heard from many local \nresidents who opposed any effort to designate wilderness. Now in 2006, \nwhen I hear from the citizens of White Pine County they are most often \nstrongly supportive of wilderness designation, particularly in the \nareas that they and their families have visited and cherished for \ngenerations.\n\n  I believe that much of this change can be attributed to the \nsuccessful management of the Mt. Moriah and Currant Mountain wilderness \nareas, designated in 1989, where we were able to protect truly wild \nlands while still allowing hunting, grazing and other historical uses \nto continue. Equally important, many White Pine County residents have \nnoted that as new waves of people discover the incredible backcountry \nof the Great Basin, the identification and protection of lands that are \nuntouched by permanent development has become a priority.\n  Accordingly, in this bill we have identified roughly 545,000 acres \nfor wilderness designation and the release of 67,000 acres of BLM \nwilderness study areas. We have benefited greatly from the careful \nsuggestions of the White Pine County Commission, the Nevada Department \nof Wildlife, the Nevada Wilderness Project, hunters, ranchers, miners, \nFriends of Nevada Wilderness, and other White Pine County residents \nduring this process.\n  We have worked to make careful decisions on the wilderness boundaries \nin this bill. Based on feedback from grazers and other users of the \nMount Moriah wilderness area, a number of boundary adjustments have \nbeen included to remove small pipelines and other encumbrances from the \noriginal wilderness area designated in 1989. We have also made careful \nchoices like along the north end of Red Mountain where the wilderness \nboundary follows the banks of the White River so that a number of \nprimitive campsites between the stream and a nearby road are excluded \nfrom the wilderness area.\n  While this proposal will surely be criticized as too conservative, \nothers will see it as too expansive. Senator Ensign and I have both \nmade important compromises to reach the proposal that we are presenting \ntoday and we stand by the middle ground that we have reached. We are \ncommitted to continue listening to all parties and taking into account \ntheir many and divergent needs.\n  The third title of this bill makes two important transfers of land \nbetween Federal agencies that will improve public land management in \nWhite Pine County. The first of these changes is a transfer of \napproximately 645 acres from the BLM to the Fish and Wildlife Service, \nFWS, to be managed as part of the Ruby Lake National Wildlife Refuge. \nThis land became an inholding within the boundaries of the refuge after \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service purchased the lands surrounding the BLM \nparcel in 2002. Management of this area by the Ruby Lake National \nWildlife Refuge will improve oversight on the land and strengthen the \nholdings of this popular refuge.\n  Our legislation also transfers administrative jurisdiction of roughly \n117,000 acres from the Forest Service to the BLM. These lands can be \neasily identified on a map as the donut shaped configuration of Forest \nService land currently surrounding Great Basin National Park. Under the \npresent arrangement, the Park Service, the Forest Service and the BLM \nmanage an awkward patchwork of lands. In some areas, land managed by \neach of the three agencies can be found within a single linear mile. \nThis division of management and labor makes proper stewardship of this \narea complicated and often times unworkable.\n\n  In addition to moving the identified lands to the BLM to improve \nmanagement efficiency, we also withdraw roughly 50,000 acres of this \nland from mineral and land laws and require a management plan for the \nroads and trails through the area. These added protections will not \nonly compliment Great Basin National Park and its mission, but will \nalso ensure that popular hunting areas remain open and accessible. The \nadditional 70,000 acres transferred to the BLM will be designated as \nthe Highland Ridge Wilderness Area.\n  This title conveys land to expand two existing state parks and one \nstate wildlife management area. The Charcoal Ovens State Park will \nreceive approximately 650 acres of BLM land to expand its current \nholdings. The land to be conveyed is already managed by the\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\nstate through a Recreation and Public Purposes lease for the operation \nof a camping area and trail system. Cave Lake State Park will also \nreceive a conveyance of land to help improve management of that site, \nalthough the exact boundaries of this designation have not yet been \nfinalized. This park is exceptionally popular, receiving nearly 100,000 \nvisitors each year, most of which are from southern Nevada.\n  In addition to expanding these two State parks, this bill conveys \nroughly 6,200 acres to the State of Nevada for an expansion of the \nSteptoe Valley Wildlife Management Area. The State acquired the 3C \nRanch in 1999 and now manages it as the Steptoe Valley Wildlife \nManagement Area. The conveyance of BLM land to this popular hunting and \nbird watching area will maximize management options while also creating \na safety buffer between hunters and future residential and commercial \ndevelopment.\n  Further, our legislation makes two small but important conveyances to \nprovide for the future economic growth of White Pine County. These \ninclude up to 200 acres for the expansion of the White Pine County \nIndustrial Park and up to 1,500 acres for the planned expansion of the \nWhite Pine County Airport. The county has been working with the Federal \nAviation Administration on this airport expansion for a number of \nyears. When completed, it will allow larger jets to land at the \nairport, further expanding the economic reach of White Pine County. The \nconveyance also allows for the airport to expand and accommodate \nadditional business tenants. Any funds collected from the lease, sale \nor conveyance of either the industrial park or airport lands will be \ndirected for public uses.\n  Building on the designation of the Silver State Off-Highway Vehicle \nTrail in Lincoln County, this bill authorizes a 3-year study for a \npossible extension of the trail into and through White Pine County. If \nthe Secretary of Interior, working with local citizens and other \nstakeholders, is able to identify a route for the trail that would not \nsignificantly impact wildlife, natural or cultural resources, an \nextension of the Silver State Trail will be designated at the \nconclusion of the study.\n\n  Off-highway vehicle use in Nevada has grown exponentially in recent \nyears, and this rise in use has led to the pioneering of hundreds of \nmiles of additional trails and roads across Nevada's frontier. The \nlonger this uncontrolled use continues, the fewer areas we will have in \nNevada that are truly wild and untouched. And when these places are \ngone, we will have lost something that cannot be replaced.\n  With this in mind, the study authorized by this bill is an effort to \nrecognize that the use of off-highway vehicles is a popular form of \nrecreation that is here to stay. Many people use their off-highway \nvehicles responsibly and we are creating a process with this \nlegislation that will put advocates for off-highway vehicles, wildlife, \ngrazing and other land users around the same table.\n  Perhaps no issue addressed by this legislation has been more \ndiscussed and debated than the conveyance of BLM land to be held in \ntrust by the United States for the Ely Shoshone Tribe. Currently, the \ntribe holds 100 acres in two separate parcels within the city limits of \nEly. For 3 years meetings have been taking place in White Pine County \nto discuss possible configurations and areas for a tribal expansion. \nLocal residents and interested parties have expressed strong feelings \non all sides of this issue, and our proposal is better as a result of \nthis dialog.\n  This bill transfers roughly 3,500 acres in four separate parcels into \ntrust for the benefit of the Ely Shoshone Tribe. Over half of this \nacreage is contained in one parcel to the west of Ward Mountain. This \nlarge area is designated exclusively for traditional tribal uses, such \nas ceremonial celebrations and gatherings and pine nut picking.\n  The conveyance also includes two parcels to the south of Ely and one \napproximately 10 miles north of McGill on highway 93. These lands are \navailable to be used by the tribe for residential and commercial \npurposes.\n  The placement of these conveyances will allow the tribe to be a \npartner in the growth and economic development of White Pine County \nwhile also ensuring that the city of Ely has sufficient room to grow \nsouth along highway 93. We have taken special care to ensure that \nexisting developments, like the KOA, have room to expand.\n  This conveyance represents a tough compromise between many important \ninterests. Some have proposed that the tribe should receive in excess \nof 20,000 acres of land in and around Ely. Others have fought to block \nthe tribe from receiving a single acre. We do not expect that the \nconveyance in this bill will please anyone completely, but we do \nbelieve it is a fair compromise that addresses the main concerns of all \nthe concerned parties.\n  The invasion of non-native species like cheat grass and red brome and \nthe overgrowth of pinon and juniper woodlands has begun to \nfundamentally alter the ecosystems in eastern Nevada. This landscape \nlevel change threatens to bring catastrophic fire to this area while \nalso destroying essential habitat for many of Nevada's native species.\n  In order to address the challenges, this legislation makes funds from \nthe Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act special account \navailable for the implementation of the Eastern Nevada Landscape \nRestoration Project in White Pine and Lincoln Counties. In addition to \nfunding this vital program, we have authorized the Secretaries of the \nInterior and Agriculture to work with Eastern Nevada Landscape \nCoalition and the Great Basin Institute in carrying out the landscape-\nscale restoration efforts necessary to restore the health of eastern \nNevada's rangelands. In the interest of understanding and fully \naddressing the ecosystem changes that are taking place all across the \nGreat Basin, this bill also authorizes a feasibility study for an \ninteragency research facility and experimental rangeland in eastern \nNevada.\n  In addition to preventing major and repeated fires, this restoration \ninitiative will benefit ranchers, sportsmen, private land owners, \ncommunities of all sizes, and of course the wildlife and rangelands on \nwhich we depend. It is my sincere hope that this program will make a \nlong lasting and beneficial change in the health of the ecosystems in \neastern Nevada.\n  Since the passage of the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, \nSNPLMA, in 1998, thousands of acres of BLM land have been auctioned in \nsouthern Nevada. These sales have produced significant funding for \nconservation efforts, enhancements to our most prized public lands, and \nthe acquisition of sensitive lands throughout our State.\n  Now, 8 years after its passage, we are seeking to update the \nlegislation so that it continues to serve the full interests of the \npeople of Nevada, our public lands, and the federal agencies that \nadminister the programs funded by the original legislation.\n  In this bill we provide funding for two separate 10-year hazardous \nfuels reduction programs, one for the Spring Mountains and one for the \nLake Tahoe Basin including the adjacent lands in the Carson Range in \nWashoe and Douglas Counties and Carson City. We also provide funding \nfor the implementation of the Clark County Multispecies Habitat \nConservation Plan, allow SNPLMA to be used for improvements to state \nparks in Clark County, authorize reimbursement for water saving \nlandscaping undertaken by public institutions, and make the Clean Water \nCoalition eligible for funding to implement an essential wastewater \nproject that will improve the water quality in Lake Mead and provide a \nsustainable future for the Las Vegas Wash.\n  In order to make SNPLMA more manageable for the agencies and \nmunicipalities that administer the special account and its many \nprograms, we have included authority that allows all federal agencies \nthat carry out SNPLMA projects to get reimbursed for their direct \ncosts. We have also provided an important authority for the BLM to use \nSNPLMA funds to properly clear and protect vacant parcels in the Las \nVegas Valley from dumping. The current practice of providing funding \nfor approved projects only through reimbursement is also brought to an \nend. Under this legislation the Department of Interior is required to \ndistribute funds for approved SNPLMA projects no later than 60 days \nafter a transfer of funds is requested.\n  Of special note, these amendments also include a 5-year authorization \nfor Washoe County to acquire up to 250\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\nacres of land for a county park. The residents of Washoe County have \nbeen and remain strong advocates for open space and we hope that they \nwill take advantage of this opportunity.\n  Perhaps the most important change that we make to SNPLMA is a \ncomplete rewrite of the legislation's affordable housing title. While \nlanguage was included in the original legislation that allows for land \nto be acquired at less than fair market value for the development of \naffordable housing, it took the BLM over 4 years to promulgate the \nguidelines for implementing this provision. Since that time no eligible \nparty has successfully used these guidelines to secure land and build \naffordable housing anywhere in Nevada.\n  With an estimated 170,000 housing units needed in southern Nevada for \naffordable and workforce housing in the next 10 years, immediate action \nis needed. As a result, we have struck the largely unworkable language \nfrom the original legislation. We have replaced it with an authority \nallowing all legitimate interested parties to work with the BLM to \npursue land for the development of affordable and workforce housing. We \nalso take a further step and require that any parcel of Federal land \nover 200 acres in size that is auctioned in the Las Vegas Valley must \ninclude at least 5 percent affordable and workforce housing.\n  These new affordable and workforce housing provisions are by no means \na complete answer to the housing crisis facing southern Nevada, but \nthey are a step in the right direction. I applaud the work that has \nbeen done at the local and State levels to address this issue and I am \ncommitted to continuing to work on broad based solutions to ensure that \nwe can meet the affordable housing needs in all of Nevada's \ncommunities.\n  The last title of this bill establishes the Great Basin National \nHeritage Route. Encompassing Millard County, Utah; the Duckwater Indian \nReservation in Nevada; and White Pine County, Nevada, this historic \narea includes historic mining camps and ghost towns, Mormon and other \npioneer settlements, as well as Native American communities. The Route \npasses through classic Great Basin country along the trails of the Pony \nExpress and the Overland Stage. Cultural resources within the route \ninclude highly valued and culturally important Native American \narchaeological sites dating back to the Fremont Culture.\n\n  Designation of the corridor as a heritage route will ensure long-term \nprotection of key educational and recreational opportunities while also \nbringing attention to the Great Basin's rich natural wonders like the \nbristlecone pine, the old living things on Earth, and the rare \nBonneville cutthroat trout. In short, the Great Basin National Heritage \nRoute will provide a framework for celebrating eastern Nevada's and \nwestern Utah's rich historic, archaeological, cultural, and natural \nresources for both visitors and residents.\n  I have been proud to support the designation of the Great Basin \nHeritage Route for many years and have helped pass legislation through \nboth the Senate and the House calling for establishment of the route. \nUnfortunately, in each instance the legislation was included in a \nlarger package of bills that failed to reach the President for \nsignature. Having received the approval of both bodies of Congress for \nthis measure, it is my hope that we can finally make this route a \nreality as part of this comprehensive legislative package for White \nPine County.\n  The White Pine County Conservation, Recreation and Development Act of \n2006 is an ambitious, timely and complex piece of legislation. By \nmaking long-term and forward looking improvements to public land \nmanagement and the stewardship of our shared natural resources, we \nbelieve we have crafted a bill that will serve the best interests of \nthe people of White Pine County, eastern Nevada and our entire State.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to ensure timely review \nand passage of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8547-1", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4749.

   for any calculation of political efficacy or utility;\n       Whereas the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     Movement is a worldwide institution in which all national Red \n     Cross and Red Crescent societies have equal status, whose \n     mission is to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever \n     it may be found, without discrimination;\n       Whereas the Magen David Adom (Red Shield of David) Society \n     is the national humanitarian society in Israel and has \n     performed heroically, aiding all in need of assistance, on a \n     purely humanitarian basis,\n\n[[Page S8550]]\n\n     without bias, even those responsible for acts of horrific \n     violence against Israeli civilians;\n       Whereas, since 1949, the Magen David Adom Society has been \n     refused admission into the International Red Cross and Red \n     Crescent Movement and has been relegated to observer status \n     without a vote because it has used the Red Shield of David, \n     the only such national organization denied membership in the \n     Movement;\n       Whereas the red cross symbol was intended as the visible \n     expression of the neutral status enjoyed by the medical \n     services of the armed forces and the protection thus \n     conferred, and there is not, and has never been, any implicit \n     religious connection in the cross;\n       Whereas, since its establishment in 1930, the Magen David \n     Adom Society has worked under its own symbol, the Red Star of \n     David, as an expression of the humanitarian values the Magen \n     David Adom Society shares with the Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     societies;\n       Whereas Israel acceded to the Geneva Conventions in 1951 \n     with a reservation specifying their intent to continue to use \n     the Magen David Adom;\n       Whereas international consultations among nations and \n     national Red Cross Societies ensued until 1999, when the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross formally called for \n     adoption of a protocol to the Geneva Conventions creating a \n     third neutral symbol, allowing the use of either the Red \n     Cross, the Red Crescent, or the third neutral symbol, and \n     allowing for the third neutral symbol to be used in \n     combination with other national Red Cross Society symbols, \n     including the Magen David Adom;\n       Whereas a diplomatic conference to adopt this proposal into \n     the Geneva Conventions was scheduled for October 2000, but \n     was prevented by the outbreak of the second Palestinian \n     intifada;\n       Whereas the United States, the American Red Cross, and the \n     American Friends of Magen David Adom have worked ceaselessly \n     to resolve the issue of the third neutral symbol and achieve \n     full membership in the International Red Cross and Red \n     Crescent Movement for the Magen David Adom Society;\n       Whereas Congress has insisted that funds made available to \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross be contingent on \n     a certification by the Secretary of State confirming that the \n     Magen David Adom Society is a full participant in the \n     activities of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     Movement;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross has stood alone among all \n     the national humanitarian aid societies, and has withheld \n     over $45,000,000 in dues to the International Federation of \n     the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to protest the \n     exclusion of the Magen David Adom;\n       Whereas the Government of Switzerland, the depositary state \n     for the Geneva Conventions, convened a Diplomatic Conference \n     of the states party to the Geneva Conventions in December \n     2005 for the purpose of adopting a Third Additional Protocol \n     and rightly resisted efforts to block the broad international \n     consensus in favor of resolving the third neutral symbol \n     question;\n       Whereas the efforts by the United States and the American \n     Red Cross at the Diplomatic Conference in December 2005 were \n     critical to achieving both an overwhelming positive vote in \n     favor of adopting the Third Additional Protocol, as well as \n     an extremely important memorandum of understanding between \n     the Magen David Adom and the Palestinian Red Crescent \n     Society;\n       Whereas sustaining international support for the adoption \n     of the third neutral symbol against efforts to divert the \n     conference into unrelated political matters required \n     extraordinary diplomatic efforts by the United States and the \n     American Red Cross;\n       Whereas the Third Additional Protocol adopted in Geneva in \n     December 2005 established the new third neutral symbol, the \n     ``red crystal'' that can be used in conjunction with the Red \n     Shield of David and cleared the way for Israeli membership in \n     the international movement;\n       Whereas, in June 2006, the states party to the Geneva \n     Conventions, the national humanitarian aid societies, the \n     International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     Societies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross \n     met in Geneva to adopt rules implementing the Third \n     Additional Protocol; and\n       Whereas, at the June 2006 meeting in Geneva, the \n     International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement accepted \n     the Magen David Adom Society as a full member: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the Magen David Adom Society for its long and \n     distinguished record of providing humanitarian assistance to \n     all those in need of aid, even those responsible for heinous \n     atrocities against Israeli civilians;\n       (2) congratulates the Magen David Adom Society, and the \n     Government and people of Israel, for securing full membership \n     in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, 57 \n     years past due;\n       (3) thanks the President, the Secretary of State, and \n     United States diplomatic representatives for their tireless \n     pursuit and maintenance of the international consensus that \n     culminated in the recent acceptance of the Magen David Adom \n     Society as a full member in the International Red Cross and \n     Red Crescent Movement;\n       (4) thanks the American Red Cross for its unwavering and \n     unyielding insistence within the International Red Cross and \n     Red Crescent Movement that the principles of international \n     humanitarian law could not be reconciled with continued \n     exclusion of the Magen David Adom Society;\n       (5) thanks the Government of Switzerland and officials of \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross for helping to \n     prepare the necessary consensus and carrying to completion \n     the adoption of the Third Additional Protocol by the states \n     party to the Geneva Conventions and the rules for its \n     implementation; and\n       (6) commends the President for--\n       (A) submitting the Third Additional Protocol to the Senate \n     for its advice and consent; and\n       (B) pending approval by the Senate, preparing for \n     congressional consideration and enactment of legislation \n     necessary to carry into effect the Third Additional Protocol.\n\n

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5683, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Soledad Veterans \n     Memorial in San Diego, California, by providing for the \n     immediate acquisition of the memorial by the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5683) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to pause for a moment and comment on \nthe bill we just passed. I am proud that the Senate, in this bill, is \nchoosing to protect an important memorial that honors our Nation's \nfallen veterans.\n  With the passage of this legislation, the Mt. Soledad Veterans \nMemorial Protection Act--this memorial being in San Diego, CA--I \nbelieve we pay a real tribute to our fallen veterans. This memorial \nwill be controlled, with this legislation, by the Federal Government, \nwhich will ensure that the men and women it memorializes will continue \nto be so honored.\n  The memorial is very important to our veterans. It is a key symbol of \nour religious freedom.\n  Just a very brief comment on the history. Since 1954, a 29-foot cross \nhas stood atop Mt. Soledad in San Diego memorializing the American war \ndead of World War I, World War II, and the Korean War conflict.\n  Over the years, the memorial has grown and now includes six large, \nconcentric walls covered with granite plaques commemorating individual \nservice men and women, bollards, pavers, and a flagpole proudly flying \nthe American flag. The Mt. Soledad Memorial, in its entirety is a world \nclass war memorial.\n  In 1989, a plaintiff who claimed to be offended by the memorial sued \nthe city for its removal. The city of San Diego went to great lengths \nto divest themselves of the property by selling it to a private party \nwho could choose to keep the memorial cross. That sale was blocked, \nhowever, by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Last year, the voters \nof San Diego passed a ballot measure providing for the donation of the \nmemorial to the Federal Government, but again that transfer was blocked \nby the courts.\n  This bill, H.R. 5683, which we just passed, directs the Federal \nGovernment to acquire the property and enables the Mt. Soledad Memorial \nto be federally owned and continue to memorialize Americans who have \nfallen in service to their country. I do commend my colleagues for \ntaking this significant step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8550-2", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8550-S8552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PREMATURITY RESEARCH EXPANSION AND EDUCATION FOR MOTHERS WHO DELIVER \n                           INFANTS EARLY ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today, we overwhelmingly passed a very \nimportant bill that will affect the lives of all consumers, which is \neverybody in this country in the future. The gulf coast energy security \nbill was passed overwhelmingly today with a vote of 71 to 25.\n  We just passed this bill an hour and a half ago or so. At that point, \nwe thanked our various colleagues. But in conversations after that \namong my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, we all remarked that \nthis is the way legislation should be passed: bipartisan, working \ntogether, a lot of hard work on the floor, a lot of preparatory work, \ninvolvement of staff soliciting a lot of input as we go through careful \ndeliberation and passage of a bill that will be to the benefit of every \nAmerican.\n  It is a great victory for the American people. Our colleagues were \nrecognized earlier. Most people pointed, first and foremost, and \nappropriately, to Senator Domenici who stayed focused on the bill, who \nled the bill that was passed last year, now 54, 53 weeks ago, a bill \nthat has transformed the framework through which we review advances in \nenergy and energy policy, and this bill being the next major step in \naddressing supply and production of American homegrown energy. We thank \nSenator Domenici for his leadership on both those bills.\n  This evening, the Senate turned to the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. I appreciate Chairman Stevens and the ranking \nmember, Senator Inouye, for very rapidly turning to that bill and \nbeginning debate with their opening statements and beginning on the \namendment process which should start tomorrow morning.\n  Tomorrow we will resume consideration of this appropriations bill. It \nis my hope that we can complete this legislation before we leave for \nthe August recess. I say that after having talked with a number of our \nmilitary leaders over the last several weeks and the Secretary of \nDefense today who stressed how important it is to get these \nappropriated funds flowing for the support of our troops overseas and \nat home and the infrastructure that supports them, especially in this \ntime of war.\n  We have a lot to do over the course of the week. So late nights are \npossible each night. I laid out the schedule early this morning. I \nmentioned the importance of this bill which links three bills \ntogether--the death tax, the tax extenders, and the minimum wage--on \nFriday morning. Late nights are possible--in fact, likely--as we \ncontinue on the Department of Defense bill tomorrow and on Thursday \nnight as well, and then the pension bill we absolutely must address \nbefore we leave before the recess.\n  I thank the Democratic leader, in particular, for understanding and \nworking with our leadership in scheduling and being able to proceed \nwith the Nation's business in a very short period of time because the \nAmerican people deserve it. He understands that; their leadership \nunderstands it. Even though we don't agree on all the legislation that \nis coming before us, the ability to move and to move effectively and \nefficiently is something I really appreciate as we come into these last \n5 or 6 days in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/08/01/senate-section/article/S8552-6", "month": "08", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8552-S8553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
