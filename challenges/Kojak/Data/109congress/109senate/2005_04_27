Mr. President, this morning, following our leader time, we \nwill have up to 2 hours of morning business.

Following that time we will resume \nconsideration of the highway bill. Yesterday, we began the amendment \nprocess on the highway legislation, and we will continue working \nthrough amendments today and over the course of this week. I do expect \nrollcall votes today on amendments, and we should have a full day of \ndebate on the highway bill.\n  I do want to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues that we in \nall likelihood will be considering conference reports this week, as \nthey are made available. One of those will be the budget conference \nreport, which will be debated for up to a 10-hour statutory limit. I \nhope when we do come to the budget we not find it necessary to use all \nthat time, but Senators should stay on notice that we will complete \nthat very important conference report before we leave for our recess.\n  Finally, I should also mention there are a number of nominations--\nactually two specific nominations--that will be completed before \nadjourning. We are working back and forth across the aisle to see how \nwe can best complete those two nominations. We have three district \njudges as well that should be voted unanimously. The two nominations \nthat I referred to--one is the Portman nomination, which came out of \ncommittee, to be U.S. Trade Representative, and the other is Stephen \nJohnson, to be Administrator of EPA. Again, we are working on bringing \nthat to conclusion, but we need to complete both of those before we \nleave. Both of these are Cabinet rank officials, and we should not--\nwill not--adjourn until we have considered these important nominations \nas well.\n  Mr. President, I have a brief statement on the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4351-7", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4351-S4352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted overwhelmingly \nto invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the highway bill, the \nhighway bill we are now on. The amendment process has begun. It enjoys \nstrong bipartisan support, and I am encouraged by the bipartisan \ncommitment to both go to the bill and move this important bill forward. \nTime is of essence. The current highway extension from last year \nexpires at the end of next month, on May 31. We are going to have to \nwork together to pass this legislation, then take the bill that we pass \nto conference to join it with the House bill--I have a feeling there \nwill have to be fairly extensive negotiations at that point--and then \nsend that bill to the President for his signature.\n  This highway bill that is currently on the floor is a product of a \nlong bipartisan process. It is based on more than 3 years of hard work, \nover a dozen hearings, testimony from more than 100 witnesses, \ncountless hours of negotiation, all of it supported by a deep\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\nand broad coalition, from State and local highway authorities to \nnational safety advocates. It was last month that a very similar bill \noverwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 417 to \n9. It is time to get this bill done.\n  This is what America sees, I know: While we engage in this endless \nnegotiation inside the beltway, outside the beltway people are \nlistening to that as they are sitting in traffic jams which are getting \nworse and worse by the day. At the same time we are debating, roads and \nbridges continue to deteriorate, and preventable traffic accidents take \nthe lives of tens of thousands of Americans each year. I will come back \nto that, because these lives do not have to be lost. The action we take \non the floor of the Senate will cause those lives not to be lost.\n  Car crashes, in fact, are the No. 1 cause of death for every age from \n3 years of age to 33 years of age; crashes are their No. 1 cause of \ndeath. According to national statistics reported just last week, 43,000 \npeople died in car accidents just last year alone. More than 2.7 \nmillion people were injured.\n  I believe the key point is that one-third of all these traffic-\nrelated deaths can be attributed to unsafe roads. One out of every \nthree deaths can be attributed to unsafe roads. In my home State of \nTennessee, over 1,000 Tennesseans lost their lives in traffic accidents \nin 2003. Treasury Secretary Norm Mineta rightly says:\n\n       If this many people were to die from any one disease in a \n     single year, Americans would demand a vaccine.\n\n  We do have a medicine of sorts. In fact, we have a cure of sorts. \nPassing the highway bill will save 4,000 lives each year simply by \nmaking those roads safe, by improving those roads, as well as educating \nthe public about road safety. In Tennessee, where seatbelt usage is \namong the lowest in the country, our State highway department is taking \naction, but, like transportation departments all across the country, it \nneeds our help. The highway bill will provide Tennessee with more than \n$3.8 billion over the next 5 years to invest in our State's highway \ninfrastructure.\n  Safety is a top priority of this legislation. Another serious goal is \nto get America's highways back on track economically. America is \ninterlaced by nearly 4 million miles of roads and highways. Our \ntransportation infrastructure is worth about $1.75 trillion. Every $1 \nbillion we invest in transportation infrastructure generates twice that \nmuch--$2 billion--in economic activity and creates over 47,500 jobs. \nThe interstate highway system has often been called the greatest public \nworks project in history, and for good reason.\n  Our roads, ports, and railroads are vital to America's economic \nsuccess. We know that well in Tennessee, where we are home to companies \nsuch as Federal Express, U.S. Express, Averitt Express. Unfortunately, \nAmerica's transportation infrastructure is deteriorating badly and \nbecoming painfully overcrowded. Our roads and highways are not keeping \nup with demand. Just ask any American commuter--bumper to bumper \ntraffic all day long. Indeed, in our Nation's urban areas, traffic \ndelays have more than tripled over the last 20 years, and not just in \nthe big cities but all over the country. In Raleigh Durham, for \ninstance, commuting time has gone up 25 percent in 10 years. In \nCharlotte, traffic congestion has added 39 additional commuting hours \nper year. That is nearly an entire work week that has been added, \nsitting in traffic. In Tennessee, traffic congestion has increased in \nall of our major metropolitan areas. In Nashville, my hometown, \ncommuters drive an average of 32 miles per person per day. Metropolitan \nplanning organizations are struggling to meet demand.\n  Americans suffer the loss of more than 3.6 billion hours in those \ntraffic delays, and that translates down to 5.7 billion gallons per \nyear of fuel being wasted. These transportation delays ripple through \nour Nation's economic sector and ultimately result in lost wages and \nlost jobs and lost productivity.\n\n  Traffic congestion also generates more pollution. Cars that are \ncaught up in stop-and-go traffic emit far more pollution than they do \non a road that is smoothly flowing. The American Highway Users Alliance \nestimates that if we could free up America's worst bottlenecks, in 20 \nyears carbon dioxide emissions would drop by over three-fourths, and \nAmericans would save 40 billion gallons of fuel.\n  Time, money, and quality of life are being burned up in traffic jams. \nThe highway bill goes a long way to alleviating many if not most of \nthese problems. The key to that effort is the improvements it will make \nin our mass transit system. The highway bill provides generous \nprovisions to improve our bus and rail systems that make our urban \ncenters thrive. In Tennessee, it will provide more than $240 million \nover the next 5 years to improve our transit for our rural and urban \ncommuters. Taking the train or the bus will be more convenient and less \ntime consuming and more comfortable.\n  As we consider this legislation, keep in mind that oil prices are \nclimbing to historic highs, and the summer driving season is just \naround the corner. For the sake of every family right now planning \ntheir vacation for this summer, every commuter who parks and rides, \nevery minute we spend in a traffic jam, I do urge my colleagues to work \nquickly to pass this bill.\n  One final note, and it is a note of caution: We need to stay within \nour budget limits. We have a rising deficit. We have a President who \nhas clearly laid out his spending parameters, several of which will be \nspelled out in the budget we will bring to the floor tomorrow. But I am \nconfident by working together we can get this done, and we can \ndemonstrate reasonable fiscal restraint.\n  Our vast and interconnecting highways are emblematic of our American \nspirit. They represent what being American is all about. They represent \nthat spirit and love of adventure, our drive for the unknown. Our \nhighways, bridges, roads, trains, and ports are the physical, tangible \nexpression of the United States. I do urge my colleagues in the great \nAmerican tradition, in every sense of the phrase, to keep America \nmoving forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4352-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be a period for the transaction of morning business up to 120 \nminutes, the first 30 minutes under the control of the majority leader \nor his designee, the next 60 minutes under the control of Mr. Biden or \nhis designee, and the final 30 minutes under the control of the \nmajority leader or his designee.\n  The Senator from the great State of Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. My understanding is we are going first in morning \nbusiness on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                          judicial nominations\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I will claim 20 minutes of the time. I \nwill appreciate it if the Presiding Officer notifies me when 15 minutes \nare up because Senator Hutchison wants to use 10 minutes. I want to \nmake certain everyone knows I do not intend to filibuster this morning. \nThere will be a limit to my remarks.\n  I appreciated what the leader said about the highway bill. We do need \nto pass it. We need to pass a robust highway bill for all the reasons \nhe stated. We are all very strongly for reducing the deficit, but \nspending on infrastructure is dynamic in nature, as I happen to believe \ntax cuts are dynamic in nature in the sense they produce economic \ngrowth. When we reduce the deficit, make this country competitive, help \npeople get to work, Americans will get rid of the deficit if they can \nget to work in the morning. We need to have that debate in the Senate. \nEveryone needs to vote their conscience and vote out a robust highway \nand transportation bill.\n  That is not what I am here to talk about this morning. I am here to \ntalk about judicial nominations. We have spent altogether too much time \non judicial nominations the last 2 years, 150 hours on judicial \nnominations--not even Supreme Court nominations but court of appeals \nnominations. We have\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\nbeen told over and over again how important they are. And they are \nimportant. They are the second highest court in the country. There are \nonly three levels of courts in the country so the second highest court \nis also the second lowest court. They do the day-to-day appellate \nbusiness of the Federal courts. It certainly is very important, but it \nis not worth filibustering the Senate and obstructing it to death and \npreventing the vote on these nominees. That is basically my message \ntoday.\n  For the first 214 years of this Senate, no nominee for the Federal \ncourt of appeals was ever successfully filibustered in the Senate. \nThere were runt groups of Senators who in recent years tried \nfilibusters, embryonic filibusters, that were cut off and defeated \nbecause the leadership of both parties, majority and minority \nleadership, opposed those filibusters on the grounds it was a mistake \nfor this Senate to get in the business of filibustering judicial \nnominees. That was, until a couple years ago, the uniform point of \nview.\n  Senator Boxer said--and I am not picking out Senators in any \nparticular area; I guess they are alphabetic:\n\n       According to the U.S. Constitution, the Senate nominates, \n     and the Senate shall provide advice and consent. It is not \n     the role of the Senate to obstruct the process and prevent \n     numbers of highly qualified nominees from even being given \n     the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  Senator Daschle, former Democratic leader:\n\n       I find it simply baffling that a Senator would vote against \n     even voting on a judicial nomination . . . We have a \n     constitutional outlet for antipathy against a judicial \n     nominee--vote against the nominee.\n\n  And, I add, let them have a vote.\n  Senator Feinstein:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them \n     down . . .\n\n  But vote on them.\n  Senator Feinstein again:\n\n       Our institutional integrity requires an up-or-down vote.\n\n  I couldn't agree with that more. I will get to that a little bit \nlater if I do not have so many digressions that I use up my 20 minutes.\n  Senator Kennedy:\n\n       We owe it to Americans across the country to give these \n     nominees a vote. If our Republican colleagues do not like \n     them, vote against them. But give them a vote.\n\n  Senator Leahy, now the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, \nformer chairman of that committee:\n\n       I cannot recall a judicial nomination being successfully \n     filibustered. I do recall earlier this year when the \n     Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I noted \n     how improper it would be to filibuster a judicial nomination.\n\n  Yes, he is right.\n  Senator Leahy again:\n\n       I . . . do not want to see the Senate go down a path where \n     a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate on \n     votes of 41 . . .\n\n  With 41 Senators out of 100, if we allow the filibuster in these \ncases, you can stop a nominee from ever coming to a vote. So nominees \nwith bipartisan majority support in the Senate do not even get a vote \nif we allow filibusters in these cases. That has been the case with all \nthese nominees.\n\n  I could go on and on with quotes. I will not do it.\n  For 214 years we never had one successful filibuster of a court of \nappeals nominee, not one supported by the leaders of either party. In \nthe last 2 years we have had 10 successful filibusters and 6 other \nthreatened ones.\n  What has happened? Is there something extraordinarily wrong with \nthese nominees? No. I will go to two nominees before the Senate.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen from Texas. I do not know Justice Owen. I did \nnot insist she come in and speak to me before I voted on her \nnomination. Here is her history.\n  Before joining the Texas Supreme Court, Justice Owen was a partner \nwith the well-respected Texas law firm of Andrews and Kurth. She made \npartner. I never did. She practiced commercial litigation for 17 years. \nShe earned a B.A. cum laude from Baylor University and graduated cum \nlaude from Baylor Law School in 1977. After graduating from law school, \nJustice Owen earned the highest score in the State on the December 1977 \nTexas bar exam. Lawyers within the sound of my voice know the \ndifficulty of earning the highest score on the bar exam. I am not \ncertain how I ever staggered through the Missouri bar, but I am certain \nI did not get the highest score.\n  Justice Owen served on the Supreme Court in Texas since 1995. This \nperson who could not even get a vote for 10 years has been a supreme \ncourt judge in Texas. She was reelected to her second term by 84 \npercent of the vote. Every major newspaper in Texas endorsed her. She \ncannot get a vote. She has significant bipartisan support, including \nfrom three former Democratic judges on the Texas Supreme Court. I will \nread some of that in a minute.\n  Justice Janice Rogers Brown from California is the daughter of \nsharecroppers, born in Greenville, AL, in 1949. She attended segregated \nschools in the era of Jim Crow. She moved to Sacramento, CA. Her family \ndid. She got a B.A. in economics from California State in 1974 and her \nlaw degree from the UCLA Law School. She has received honorary law \ndegrees from Pepperdine University, Catholic University of America Law \nSchool, and Southwestern University School of Law--three more honorary \ndegrees than I have. She currently serves and is an associate justice--\nanother justice on the State Supreme Court who cannot get a vote. She \nhas held that position since 1996. Before that, she was on the \nintermediate State appellate court. She got on the State court of \nappeals. She cannot get a vote to get on the Federal court of appeals. \nShe is the first African-American woman to serve on California's \nhighest court and was retained with 76 percent of the vote in the last \nelection.\n  I can go on and on with honorary degrees. She spent 24 years in \npublic life in various legal capacities. She is experienced in judicial \nmatters, in other governmental matters as a lawyer. She cannot get a \nvote. She is being filibustered.\n  Some of my colleagues say these and the other eight are too extreme; \nthey are not in the mainstream. I wish every Federal judge on the bench \ntoday had the qualifications of these people and the bipartisan support \nof these people. The people who know them best from their own States do \nnot think they are too extreme.\n  Raul Gonzalez, former Democratic Justice on the Supreme Court of \nTexas said of Justice Owen:\n\n       I found her to be apolitical, extremely bright, diligent in \n     her work and of the highest integrity. I recommend her for \n     confirmation without reservation.\n\n  I guess he would support a vote since he says we ought to confirm \nher.\n  Here is another former Democratic Chief Justice:\n\n       After years of closely observing Justice Owen's work, I can \n     assert with confidence that her approach to judicial \n     decision-making is restrained, her opinions are fair and well \n     reasoned, her integrity is beyond reproach . . . I know \n     personally how impeccable her credentials are.\n\n  This is from a Democrat in Texas, one of her colleagues.\n  Jack Hightower, a former Democratic Justice on the Supreme Court of \nTexas:\n\n       I am a Democrat and my political philosophy is Democratic, \n     but I have tried very hard not to let preconceived philosophy \n     influence my decision on matters before the court. I believe \n     that Justice Owen has done the same.\n\n  A bipartisan group of 15 former presidents of the State Bar of Texas:\n\n       Although we profess different party affiliations and span \n     the spectrum of views of legal and policy issues, we stand \n     united in affirming that Justice Owen is a truly unique and \n     outstanding candidate for appointment to the Fifth Circuit . \n     . . The status of our profession in Texas has been \n     significantly enhanced by Justice Owen's advocacy of pro bono \n     service and leadership for the membership of the State bar of \n     Texas.\n  They go on and on. These are 15 bipartisan former presidents of the \nState bar of Texas about Justice Priscilla Owen. She cannot get a vote. \nThe 215-year tradition of not filibustering court of appeals nominees \nis broken to keep people such as her from not getting a vote.\n  The same things can be said of Justice Janice Rogers Brown who \nappears to be an extraordinary person. A bipartisan group of 12 of her \ncurrent and former judicial colleagues says:\n\n       Much has been written about Justice Brown's humble \n     beginnings, and the story of her rise to the California \n     Supreme Court is truly compelling. But that alone would not \n     be enough to gain our endorsement for a seat on the federal \n     bench. We believe she is qualified because she is a superb \n     judge. We who have worked with her on a daily basis know\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\n     her to be extremely intelligent, keenly analytical, and very \n     hard working. We know that she is a jurist who applies the \n     law without favor, without bias and with an even hand.\n\n  And she can't get a vote. This 214-year tradition of not \nfilibustering court of appeals judges, we are breaking to keep people \nsuch as this woman from getting on the Federal bench and even getting a \nvote because she is not in the mainstream.\n  Here is the truth: There is not any one judicial mainstream, as there \nis no one mainstream of political philosophy in the Senate. Judges \ndisagree about issues as Senators disagree about issues. The point is \nto disagree without being disagreeable. Disagree while recognizing the \nother person has a valid point of view. The fact that you do not agree \nwith them does not make them automatically unfit even for a vote to \nserve on the Federal judiciary.\n  President Clinton appointed a lot of judges during his time in office \nwho were a lot more liberal than I would have liked. I probably \nwouldn't have appointed very many of them. I cannot say they are out of \nthe mainstream. They represent the views of tens of millions of people \nin the country. When you say somebody who disagrees with you is out of \nthe mainstream, you are slandering everyone who supports their views. \nIt is not the right thing to do. It is extremely divisive.\n  When we hear Members in the Senate say somebody else is not in the \nmainstream, what they mean is that other person disagrees with me. A \nconfrontational person follows this logic: You say, They do not agree \nwith me; therefore, they are not in the mainstream, and then when you \nadd the filibuster on top of that, you say, therefore, I am not only \nnot going to vote for them--which to me is the first mistake--but I am \nnot even going to let them have a vote. What you are saying is they, \nand everyone such as them in the whole country and the Senate, do not \neven deserve a vote on whether they are qualified for public office.\n  Then we wonder why this place gets divisive and why it is hard to \noperate because we are not showing respect to many who may disagree \nwith us.\n  My wife says, when she wants to bring me down to earth when I am on \nmy high horse, Jim, wouldn't the world work wonderfully if everyone \nwould only agree with you all the time about everything? We do not all \nagree with each other about everything. We have a vote and we go on. \nAnd then we try and concentrate on the areas where we do agree, such as \nthe highway bill.\n  The worst thing about this--and there are a lot of bad things about \nwhat is happening with regard to the filibustering of nominations, the \nbreaking of this 214-year tradition--the worst thing about it is the \nslandering of the credentials and the careers of these qualified \npeople.\n  There is an old idiom, an old saying: People will forgive you the \nwrong you do them, but they will never forgive you the wrong they do \nyou. Once, for whatever reason, they have done something that is wrong \nto you, then they may decide, you know what, I have to make that person \nout to be a bad person to justify the wrong I did to them in the first \nplace.\n  A filibuster of these people, breaking the tradition to do that, to \nnot even let them have a vote, these people who have bipartisan \nmajority support on the floor, to justify that, you have to say things \nabout their records. That completely disserves their histories of \npublic service and qualifications, as the people who know them best \nhave said.\n\n  The second worst thing about this whole issue is the fact that there \nare now large parts of the political community in this country, and \neven here, that, in order to support this effort and to win this battle \nthat is going on, are treating the filibuster like it is a great thing. \nMy heavens, there are groups that have made a mascot out of the \nfilibuster. Filibuster is an extraordinary, obstructive tactic that is \nnot even permitted in most legislative bodies. Even the advocates of it \nsay it should be used sparingly.\n  The case is actually being made on the floor of this Senate that the \nfilibuster is part of our deliberative process, that it promotes \ncalmness and coolness, compromise, moderation. Is this calmness? \nHolding these votes up for years, is this coolness? Is this compromise? \nWe have used the filibuster for the first time in 214 years, taking yet \nanother step with the device, making it more common, a device that even \nthe advocates of it say should be used very sparingly.\n  Do you want to know why? I will explain why. It has to do with the \ndynamics of a legislative body. If you care passionately about an issue \nbefore the Senate--and we should care passionately about these issues--\nand you know that issue is going to come up for a vote, what are you \ngoing to do? If you know it is going to come up for a vote, and a \nmajority is going to win, what are you going to do? You are going to \nappeal to the middle, aren't you? You are going to seek arguments and \namendments and methods that get the middle with you. That encourages \ncompromise. If you do not have the middle with you, and you know it is \ngoing to be voted on, and you know a majority is going to win, what is \ngoing to happen to your position? Even Senators can figure out that \nmath. You are going to lose.\n  The majoritarian process promotes compromise and discussion because \nit empowers the middle. Filibusters empower the extreme, and not just \nthe extreme philosophically; they empower the confrontational people. I \nhave nothing against people who take that point of view. And you need \nsome of them in a legislative body, but you have to be careful how much \nyou empower them. The people who say: Look, if it isn't the way I want \nit, it is not going to happen at all. It has to be my way or the \nhighway--that is what filibusters empower. I am not saying we should \nnot have it on the legislative calendar. But we have to remember there \nis a cost to it.\n  Do you want to know why we don't have an energy bill? Because of the \nfilibuster. There are a lot of other examples of legislation the \ncountry has wanted and needed that have been held up with the \nfilibuster. It is a tactic with a cost. It should be used sparingly. It \nshould not be extended in areas where it has not been used in the past \nwith a bipartisan consensus. That is the reason all these distinguished \nDemocratic Senators said, for years on the floor of this body: We are \nnot going to filibuster judicial nominations. It is because they knew \nwhat would happen.\n  We can be certain of one thing: The same standard is going to be \napplied in this body from President to President. I do not want the \nfilibuster standard applied. I do not want a situation where because I \ndisagree with a judicial nominee of a Democratic President, I am \nexpected, as a matter of course--because that is the protocol and the \nprecedent in this Senate--not to permit a vote. I believe--and it was \nthe tradition here for years--that even if you disagree with a nominee, \nif they are competent and have integrity, you vote to confirm them out \nof respect for the process that elected that President and respect for \nthe people and the party that person represents, even if you disagree. \nIf they are a good person, you vote to confirm them. That is what I \nwant to do in this Senate year by year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 20 minutes.\n  Mr. TALENT. One more minute, and I will really be done, if the \nSenator does not mind.\n  At the very least, we have to allow a vote. Let's keep the tradition \nof 214 years in the Senate. Let us allow a vote on these people, all of \nwhom have bipartisan, majority support on the floor of the Senate. \nLet's not continue doing an injustice to the reputation of these fine \nAmericans. Let's preserve the traditions of the Senate, have this vote, \nand then move on to other issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Priscilla \nOwen to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I want to comment \non the constitutional right of Senators to advise and consent to \njudicial nominations by the President, a right that is now being denied \nby tactics employed by the minority in the Senate.\n  Priscilla Owen was nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals 4 \nyears ago--4 years ago! She has been serving on the Supreme Court of \nTexas for 4 years, while awaiting her confirmation by the Senate. Yet \nshe has actually had the votes to confirm her in the\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\nSenate four times. Four times the Senate has voted on her nomination, \nand four times she has received a majority. On May 1, 2003, a cloture \nvote: 52 to 45 in her favor; May 8, 2003, 52 to 45; July 29, 2003, 53 \nto 43; November 14, 2003, 53 to 42.\n  In all these cases, she had a majority of votes in the Senate for \nconfirmation, but she is not on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals \ntoday. Why? Because her nomination is being filibustered by Democrats, \nand she has been held to a standard of 60 votes instead of 51. That is \nchanging the Constitution of the United States.\n  I know Priscilla Owen. I have watched her through this process. If \nanything confirmed my admiration for her, it is the incredible calm and \nmeasured response she has displayed in response to unfair attacks which \nhave sometimes been personal, unfair, and have had political overtones. \nYet she has remained totally professional. She has gone through two \nhearings with the committee. She has answered every question members \nasked. Some people have said she is the best witness that has ever come \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. It is because she knows what she is \ndoing. She knows the law. And she is very bright.\n  She earned both her undergraduate and law degrees from Baylor \nUniversity. She earned the highest score--the No. 1 score--on the Texas \nbar exam, when she took it. She has had a distinguished career in the \nprivate sector for 17 years. And since 1995, she has served on the \nSupreme Court of Texas.\n  The American Bar Association unanimously voted for her to have the \n``well qualified'' recognition and rating. That is the highest rating \nthey award, as they review judicial candidates--``well qualified.''\n  I would ask those who are holding up her nomination by putting a 60-\nvote threshold on it, in a completely partisan vote, what is it that \ncaused her to have the entire Democratic conference come out against \nher? She has received bipartisan support nationwide.\n  When she was reelected to the Texas Supreme Court in 2000, she \nreceived 84 percent of the vote. Every major newspaper in Texas \nendorsed her.\n  Some of her detractors, I have to say, opposed her before they had \never heard one word about her. There were outside groups that decided \nshe should not be a circuit court judge.\n  Three former Democratic judges, who sat on the Texas Supreme Court, \nhave announced their public support for her. A bipartisan group of 15 \npast presidents of the Texas Bar Association have come out in open \nsupport of Priscilla Owen. I have to come away with the view that this \nis really not a debate about Priscilla Owen. This is not a debate about \nthis woman who has an impeccable record and an impeccable academic \nbackground. No, I do not think it is about Priscilla Owen. I think it \nis about the Constitution and the requirement of advice and consent.\n  The minority has changed the Constitution by filibustering judicial \nnominees, for the first time in the history of the Senate. For the \nfirst time in the history of the Senate--over 200 years--we saw, in the \nlast session of Congress, a filibuster of almost one-third of President \nBush's circuit court nominees. No President has ever received fewer of \nhis circuit court nominees than President George W. Bush. Almost a \nthird were filibustered to death.\n  Before the 108th Congress, there were only 17 cloture votes on \njudicial nominations. But there was never a judge who had the support \nof the majority who failed to get confirmed. That is the key. For 70 \npercent of the last century, the same party controlled the Senate and \nthe White House, but there was no use of a partisan filibuster on \nnominees to prevent an up-or-down vote.\n  It is not the rule that is being changed in this debate. It is the \nprecedent of the Senate, for 200 years, that was changed in the 108th \nCongress, by requiring 60 votes for the confirmation of judges. And we \nare now looking to reaffirm the will of the Senate to do exactly what \nthe Constitution envisions; and that is, a 51-vote majority for judges.\n  Two hundred years of Senate precedent is being torn apart. Through \nDemocrat majority control and Republican majority control over the \nyears--the filibuster was not used as it was in the last session of \nCongress.\n  As recently as March of 2000, more than 80 Senators were on record \nopposing the filibuster of judicial nominations because the filibuster \nwas never intended to be used this way.\n  The Senate's original cloture rule, in 1917, did not even apply to \nnominations because no Senator had ever used a filibuster for \nnominations. When the cloture rule was rewritten in 1949 to cover all \nmatters, it was used most often for scheduling purposes. History \ndemonstrates that there was no real precedent for the use of the \nfilibuster to permanently block the confirmation of judicial \nnominations. And there has never been a cloture vote where the person \nreceived majority support and still was not confirmed. However, we are \nnot trying to do away with the filibuster on legislative matters. This \nis a part of our tradition in the Constitution that everyone, I \nbelieve, wants to uphold; that is, the right of a minority to \nfilibuster and require three-fifths of the people present and voting in \nthe Senate to overturn it. It is a vital legislative tool. But when it \ncomes to judges, the Constitution never envisioned a super-majority. In \nfact, where the Constitution has required a super-majority, it has \nspecifically said so. A majority vote ensures the balance of power \nbetween the President's right to nominate and the Senate's role to give \nadvice and consent.\n  We are not only changing the tradition of the Senate with the \nfilibuster of judicial nominations, we are changing the balance of \npower that was clearly set out in the Constitution and which has been \none of the strengths of our democracy. The separation of powers and the \nbalance of powers given to the legislative, executive, and judicial \nbranches of our Government was the genius of the Founding Fathers.\n  We value three independent branches in our Government and work to \nprohibit one branch from overruling another, beyond repair. These are \nthe stakes in this debate. That balance of power is going to be \ndisrupted if we allow a super-majority requirement for Presidential \nnominees or judgeships to be confirmed. It says a minority of 41 \nSenators, who are not in the majority in the Senate, will have the \nability to dictate to the President who is acceptable as a nominee.\n  That was not envisioned in the Constitution, and it was part of the \ncareful balance between the right of the President to appoint the \njudiciary and the Senate's right to overturn that appointment by 51 \nvotes, if necessary. But if the nominee gets the majority of 51, that \nperson is confirmed.\n  We are trying to uphold that constitutional balance. The rules of the \nSenate can be changed by the Senate. The Supreme Court has been clear. \nIn the United States v. Ballin, the Supreme Court held that only a \nmajority of the lawful quorum is all that is necessary to change the \nHouse or Senate rules, practices, and procedures. Moreover, the Supreme \nCourt held that the right to change rules, practices, and procedures is \na ``continuous power'' that may be exercised at any time.\n  Clearly, the Senate has the right to change its rules and practices \nby the majority. I want the tradition of the Senate, for 200 years, to \nbe upheld without any need for a rule change. For 200 years, Democrats \nand Republicans had agreed on this principle. It was not until the last \nsession of Congress, when President George W. Bush lost almost one-\nthird of his judicial nominees for the circuit court benches that we \nsaw sudden changes to the traditions of the Senate, with the effort to \nimpose a 60-vote super-majority for nominations by the Democrats.\n  I am here to talk about someone I know well, someone I have come to \nadmire totally, even more than I did before she took this awesome \nresponsibility to become a nominee of the President. She has withstood \nthe slings and arrows. Her strength and sound judicial temperament has \nbeen consistent. Priscilla Owen has had the necessary 51 votes to be \nconfirmed by the Senate four times. But still, we wait and have been \nwaiting for four years. She deserves an up-or-down vote that will allow \nher to sit on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals bench.\n  I hope we will not let 200 years of tradition go. But if it is the \nwill of the minority to continue to thwart 200 years of tradition and \nthe Constitution of the United States, it is my hope we reinstate the \nlong-standing practice on\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\nnominations in the Senate and adhere to the Constitution. Our Founding \nFathers knew what they were doing. We should not change the \nConstitution without going through the appropriate amending process, \nwhich has not been done.\n  We have unanimous consent for two more speakers, which we intend to \ncontinue to hold.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4356-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4356-S4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the \nSenate's deliberations on some of the administration's judicial \nnominees. It is clear this is a debate about basic American values. In \ndrafting the Constitution, the Framers wanted the Senate to provide \nadvice and consent on nominees who came before it to ensure that these \nvery rights and values were protected. I believe, as a Senator, I have \na responsibility to stand up for those values on behalf of my \nconstituents in Washington State.\n  Many activists today are complaining that certain Senators are \nattacking religious or conservative values. I must argue that it is \nothers--not Democratic Senators exercising their rights--who are \npursuing a nomination strategy that attacks basic values outlined in \nthe Constitution.\n  Our democracy values debate and dissension. Our democracy values the \nimportance of checks and balances. Our democracy values an independent \njudiciary. But with the nuclear option and the rhetorical assault being \nlaunched at Democratic Senators by activists around the country, among \nothers, we see those values under attack.\n  The nuclear option is an assault on the American people and many of \nthe things we hold dear. It is an attempt to impose on the country, \nthrough lifetime appointments, the extreme values held by a few at the \ncost of the many. It is the tyranny of the majority personified. \nConfirming these nominees by becoming a rubber stamp for the \nadministration would be an affront to the 200-year-old system of checks \nand balances, and at the same time it would be an affront to the values \nI promised to defend when I came to the Senate.\n  Building and maintaining a democracy is not easy, but our system and \nthe rights and values it holds dear are the envy of the world. In fact, \nthe entire world looks at us as the model for government. It is our \nvalues they want to look to. We must protect them not only for us but \nfor those fledgling democracies.\n  I just returned from a bipartisan trip to Israel, Iraq, Georgia, and \nthe Ukraine, where we saw leaders who were trying to write \nconstitutions, trying to write laws, trying to write policies. They \nwere all working very hard to assure even those who did not vote in the \nmajority that they would have a voice. The challenges were varied in \neach country. They faced everything from protecting against terrorists \nto charging people for the first time for electricity, to reforming \nwholly corrupt institutions. Making sure that democracy survives means \nhaving debates, bringing people to the table, and making tough \ndecisions.\n  In each case, the importance of not disenfranchising any group of \npeople also rings true. So how we in this country accomplish the goal \nof sustaining a strong democracy and ensuring the participation of all \npeople is very important.\n  Elections are the foundation of our democracy. They determine the \ndirection of our country. But an election loss does not mean you lose \nyour voice or you lose your place at the table. That is what we must do \nto keep our democracy strong. That is why we are fighting so hard to \nkeep our voice.\n  Recently, we have heard a lot from the other side about attacks on \nfaith and on values. In fact, some are trying to say our motive in this \ndebate is somehow antifaith. I argue the opposite is true. We have \nfaith in our values, in American values. We have faith that these \nvalues can and must be upheld. It is not an ideological battle between \nRepublicans and Democrats. It is about keeping faith with the values \nand the ideals our country stands for. Having values and having faith \nin those values requires that we make sure those without a voice are \nrepresented. Speaking up for those in poverty to make sure they are fed \nis a faith-based value. Making sure there is equal opportunity and \njustice for the least among us is a faith-based value. Fighting for \nhuman rights and taking care of the environment are faith-based values. \nTo now say those of us who stick up for minority rights are antifaith \nis frightening and it is wrong.\n\n  I hope those who have decided to make this into a faith-antifaith \ndebate will reconsider. This should be about democracy. It should be \nabout the protection of an independent judiciary, and it should be \nabout the rights of minorities.\n  Mr. President, our system of government, of checks and balances, and \nour values are under attack by this transparent grab for power. They \nare, with their words and potential actions, attempting to dismantle \nthis system despite the clear intent of the Framers and the weight of \nhistory and precedent. They think they know better. I think not.\n  Mr. President, there is even news this morning that our friends on \nthe other side are unwilling to come to the table to compromise to \navoid this crisis. I want to take a second to praise our leader, \nSenator Reid, for his effort to find a reasonable conclusion before the \nnuclear bomb is dropped.\n  Unfortunately for him, for all of us on this side of the aisle, and \nfor this institution, that plea has been rejected.\n  First, yesterday we saw that Karl Rove, one of the President's top \nadvisers, said there would be no deal. Now, in this morning's papers, \nwe read the leadership on the other side of the aisle is falling into \nline and saying, ``No deal.''\n  By rejecting the deal, Republicans are now saying that three \nnominees--three total nominees--are so important that they must break \nwith the more than 200 years of tradition and 200 years of precedent. \nWe have heard day after day on the floor--even a few moments ago--that \nthis is the most important issue facing this body today.\n  Well, we have record-high gas prices and deficits, we have 45 million \nuninsured Americans, and we have far too many veterans without the \nhealth care they need and deserve. All the other side is talking about \nis doing away with the checks and balances so they can get radicals on \nthe bench.\n  If the other side wants to continue on this destructive course and \nignore those real needs of the American people, they can. But this \nSenator and my colleagues will continue to fight this abuse of power \nand do the work the people sent us here to do.\n  It is a sad day when one side refuses to come to the table to \nnegotiate a way out of this impasse. It is even sadder that they refuse \nto accept our excellent confirmation record in blind pursuit of \nconfirming the most radical of their choices.\n  Although we have been able to confirm 205 nominees that President \nBush sent forward, there are a few that are far outside some basic \nvalues.\n  Let's start close to home with President Bush's nominee to the Ninth \nCircuit Court. To that court, which overseas appeals from my home State \nof Washington and five other States, President Bush has nominated \nWilliam Myers. Mr. Myers is a lifelong lobbyist and anti-environmental \nactivist. He is opposed by over 175 environmental, labor, civil, and \nwomen's disability rights organizations. He even drew opposition from \nNative American organizations and from the National Wildlife \nFederation. This is a man who has never tried a jury case, who has an \nanti-environmental record stretching back to his days as a Bush \nInterior Department official and industry lobbyist. He even received \nthe lowest possible rating from the ABA.\n  Mr. President, in the Pacific Northwest and in regions around this \ngreat country, we hold our environmental values dear. I am not willing \nto hand a lifetime appointment to such a vehement advocate against the \npeople's interests. This is the perfect example of the check our \nFramers had in mind when they drafted our Constitution. We can, and we \nmust, use it.\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\n  That is just one example of a nominee looking to attack basic values. \nBill Pryor, a nominee to the Eleventh Circuit, opposes basic individual \nliberties and freedoms. He called Roe v. Wade the ``worst abomination \nof constitutional law in history.''\n  Janice Rogers Brown, nominated to the DC Circuit Court, called 1937--\nthat was the year this Government enacted many of the New Deal's \nprograms to help lift our country out of the deep depression--``the \ntriumph of our own socialist revolution.'' Mr. President, her disdain \nfor worker and consumer protection values and principles is clear in \ndecision after decision.\n  Nominee Priscilla Owen's narrow constitutional view was so far \noutside the mainstream that then-Texas Supreme Court Judge and now \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales said that to accept it would be ``an \nunconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n  Mr. President, time and time again, these nominees have sided against \nthe American people and the values we hold dear. They have taken \nextreme positions that run counter to mainstream values. Not one of \nthese nominees has the experience or the temperament to administer \njustice in an impartial way to the citizens that they would serve.\n  Today it is fashionable for some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to disparage what they call activist judges. But this \npower grab reveals their true motivation. They want activists on the \nbench to interpret the law in a way that undermines important American \nvalues. We will not let them.\n  We have a responsibility to stand up and say no to these extreme \nnominees. But to know that, you don't need to listen to me; just look \nback at the great Founders of our democracy.\n  The Framers, in those amazing years when our country was founded, \ntook great care in creating our new democracy. They wrote into the \nConstitution the Senate's role in the nomination process. They wrote \nand they spoke about protecting the minority against the tyranny of the \nmajority. Their words ring true today.\n  James Madison, in his famous Federalist No. 10, warned against the \nsuperior force of an overbearing majority or, as he called it, a \n``dangerous vice.'' He said:\n\n       The friend of popular governments never finds himself so \n     much alarmed for their character and fate as when he \n     contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice.\n\n  Years prior, John Adams wrote, in 1776, on the specific need for an \nindependent judiciary and checks and balances. He said:\n\n       The dignity and stability of government in all its \n     branches, the morals of the people and every blessing of \n     society, depends so much upon an upright and skillful \n     administration of justice, that the judicial power ought to \n     be distinct from both the legislative and executive, and \n     independent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both, \n     as both should be checked upon that. The judges, therefore, \n     should always be men of learning and experience in the laws, \n     of exemplary morals, great patience, calmness, coolness and \n     attention. Their minds should not be distracted with jarring \n     interests; they should not be dependent upon any man or body \n     of men.\n\n  Mr. President, I shudder at the thought of what these great thinkers \nand Founders of our democracy would say to this attempted abuse of \npower in the Senate. I think one of the best interpretations of those \nthoughts was offered to this body by Robert Caro, the great Senate \nhistorian, in a letter in 2003. He talked about the need for the Senate \nto maintain its history and traditions, despite popular pressures of \nthe day, and of the important role debate and dissension plays in any \ndiscussion of judicial nominees. In particular, he wrote of his concern \nfor the preservation of Senate tradition in the face of attempted \nchanges by a majority run wild.\n  In part, he said:\n\n       In short, two centuries of history rebut any suggestion \n     that either the language or intent of the Constitution \n     prohibits or counsels against the use of extended debate to \n     resist Presidential authority. To the contrary, the Nation's \n     Founders depended on the Senate's members to stand up to a \n     popular and powerful President. In the case of judicial \n     appointments, the Founders specifically mandated the Senate \n     to play an active role providing both advice and consent to \n     the President. That shared authority was basic to the balance \n     of powers among the branches.\n       I am . . . attempting to say as strongly as I can that in \n     considering any modification, Senators should realize that \n     they are not dealing with the particular dispute of the \n     moment, but with the fundamental character of the Senate of \n     the United States, and with the deeper issue of the balance \n     of power between majority and minority rights.\n\n  Mr. President, protection of minority rights has been a fundamental \nprinciple since the infancy of this democracy. It should not--in fact, \nit cannot--be laid to rest here in this Chamber.\n  I know many people are out there wondering why we are spending so \nmuch time talking about Senate rules and judicial nominations. They are \nwondering why I am talking about nominees and being on the floor \nquoting Madison and Adams. They are wondering what this means to them.\n  Let me make it clear. This debate is about whether we want a clean, \nhealthy environment and the ability to enforce laws to protect it \nfairly. This debate is about whether we want to protect essential \nrights and liberties. This debate is about whether we want free and \nopen Government. This debate is about preserving equal protection under \nthe law. This debate is about whether we want to preserve the \nindependent judiciary, whether we want to defend our Constitution, and \nwhether we want to stand up for the values of the American public.\n  Mr. President, these values are too precious to be abdicated. \nTrusting in them, we will not let the Republicans trample our rights \nand those of millions of Americans we are here to represent. We will \nstand and say, yes, to democracy; yes, to an independent judiciary; \nyes, to minority rights; and, no, to this unbelievable abuse of power.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak at some length, if \ntime will permit me, about the same subject my friend from Washington \nState so eloquently addressed. My colleagues know that although when I \nspeak, I sometimes get very passionate, I have not very often, in past \nyears, risen to the floor for any extended period of time. I do that \ntoday because so much is at stake.\n  For over 200 years, the Senate has embodied the brilliance of our \nFounding Fathers in creating an intricate system of checks and balances \namong the three branches of Government. This system has served two \ncritical purposes, both allowing the Senate to act as an independent, \nrestraining force on the excesses of the executive branch, and \nprotecting minority rights within the Senate itself. The Framers used \nthis dual system of checks and balances to underscore the independent \nnature of the Senate and its members.\n  The Framers sought not to ensure simple majority rule, but to allow \nminority views--whether they are conservative, liberal, or moderate--to \nhave an enduring role in the Senate in order to check the excesses of \nthe majority. This system is now being tested in the extreme.\n  I believe the proposed course of action we are hearing about these \ndays is one that has the potential to do more damage to this system \nthan anything that has occurred since I have become a Senator.\n  History will judge us harshly, in my view, if we eliminate over 200 \nyears of precedent and procedure in this body and, I might add, doing \nit by breaking a second rule of the Senate, and that is changing the \nrules of the Senate by a mere majority vote.\n  When examining the Senate's proper role in our system of Government \ngenerally and in the process of judicial nominations specifically, we \nshould begin, in my view, but not end with our Founding Fathers. As any \ngrade school student knows, our Government is one that was infused by \nthe Framers with checks and balances.\n  I should have said at the outset that I owe special thanks--and I \nwill list them--to a group of constitutional scholars and law \nprofessors in some of our great universities and law schools for \nediting this speech for me and for helping me write this speech because \nI think it may be one of the most important speeches for historical \npurposes that I will have given in the 32 years since I have been in \nthe Senate.\n  When examining the Senate's proper role in our system of Government \nand in the process of judicial nominations, as I said, we have to look \nat what our\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\nFounders thought about when they talked about checks and balances.\n  The theoretical underpinning of this system can be found in \nFederalist 51 where the architect of our Constitution, James Madison, \nadvanced his famous theory that the Constitution set up a system in \nwhich ``ambition must be made to counteract ambition.''\n  ``Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'' As Madison notes, \nthis is because ``[The] great security against a gradual concentration \nof the several powers in the same department consists in giving those \nwho administer each department the necessary constitutional means and \npersonal motives to resist encroachments by the other.''\n  Our Founders made the conscious decision to set up a system of \ngovernment that was different from the English parliamentary system--\nthe system, by the way, with which they were the most familiar. The \nFounders reacted viscerally to the aggrandizement of power in any one \nbranch or any person, even in a person or body elected by the majority \nof the citizens of this country.\n  Under the system the Founders created, they made sure that no longer \nwould any one person or one body be able to run roughshod over everyone \nelse. They wanted to allow the sovereign people--not the sovereign \nGovernment, the sovereign people--to pursue a strategy of divide and \nconquer and, in the process, to protect the few against the excesses of \nthe many which they would witness in the French Revolution.\n  The independence of the judiciary was vital to the success of that \nventure. As Federalist 78 notes:\n\n       The complete independence of the courts of justice is \n     peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution.\n\n  Our Founders felt strongly that judges should exercise independent \njudgment and not be beholden to any one person or one body. John Adams, \nin 1776, stated:\n\n       The dignity and stability of government in all its \n     branches, the morals of the people, and every blessing of \n     society, depend so much upon an upright and skillful \n     administration of justice, that the judicial power ought to \n     be distinct from both the legislative and executive, and \n     independent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both, \n     as both should be checks upon that.\n\n  Adams continues:\n\n       The judges, therefore, should always be men of learning and \n     experience in the laws, of exemplary morals, great patience, \n     calmness and attention; their minds should not be distracted \n     with jarring interests; they should not be dependent upon any \n     one man or any body of men.\n\n  In order to ensure that judicial independence, the very independence \nof which Adams spoke, the Founders did not give the appointment power \nto any one person or body, although it is instructive for us, as we \ndebate this issue in determining the respective authority of the Senate \nand the Executive, it is important to note that for much of the \nConstitutional Convention, the power of judicial appointment was \nsolely--solely--vested in the hands of the legislature. For the \nnumerous votes taken about how to resolve this issue, never did the \nFounders conclude that it should start with the Executive and be within \nthe power of the Executive. James Madison, for instance, was ``not \nsatisfied with referring the appointment to the Executive;'' instead, \nhe was ``rather inclined to give it to the Senatorial branch'' which he \nenvisioned as a group ``sufficiently stable and independent'' to \nprovide ``deliberative judgments.''\n  It was widely agreed that the Senate ``would be composed of men \nnearly equal to the Executive and would, of course, have on the whole \nmore wisdom'' than the Executive. It is very important to point out \nthat they felt ``it would be less easy for candidates''--referring to \ncandidates to the bench--``to intrigue with [the Senators], more than \nwith the Executive.''\n  In fact, during the drafting of the Constitution, four separate \nattempts were made to include Presidential involvement in judicial \nappointments, but because of the widespread fear of Presidential power, \nthey all failed. There continued to be proponents of Presidential \ninvolvement, however, and finally, at the eleventh hour, the \nappointment power was divided and shared, as a consequence of the \nConnecticut Compromise I will speak to in a minute, between the two \ninstitutions, the President and the Senate.\n  In the end, the Founders set up a system in which the President \nnominates and the Senate has the power to give or withhold--or \nwithhold--its ``advice and consent.'' The role of ``advice and \nconsent'' was not understood to be purely formal. The Framers clearly \ncontemplated a substantive role on the part of the Senate in checking \nthe President.\n  This bifurcation of roles makes a lot of sense, for how best can we \nensure that an independent judiciary is beholden to no one man or no \none group than by requiring two separate and wholly independent \nentities to sign off before a judge takes the bench?\n\n  There is a Latin proverb which translates to ``Who will guard the \nguardians?'' Our judges guard our rights, and our Founders were smart \nenough to put both the President and the Senate, acting independently, \nin charge of guarding our judicial guardians. Who will guard the \nguardians?\n  As a Senator, I regard this not as just a right but as a solemn duty \nand responsibility, one that transcends the partisan disputes of any \nday or any decade. The importance of multiple checks in determining who \nour judges would be was not lost on our Founders, even on those who \nwere very much in favor of a strong Executive.\n  For example, Alexander Hamilton, probably the strongest advocate for \na stronger Executive, wrote:\n\n       The possibility of rejection [by the Senate] would be a \n     strong motive to [take] care in proposing [nominations. The \n     President] . . . would be both ashamed and afraid to bring \n     forward . . . candidates who had no other merit, than that . \n     . . of being in some way or other personally allied to him, \n     or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to \n     render them the obsequious instrument of his pleasure.\n\n  Hamilton also rebutted the argument that the Senate's rejection of \nnominees would give it an improper influence over the President, as \nsome here have suggested, by stating:\n\n       If by influencing the President be meant restraining him, \n     this is precisely what must have been intended. And it has \n     been shown that the restraint would be salutary.\n\n  The end result of our Founders was a system in which both the \nPresident and the Senate had significant roles, a system in which the \nSenate was constitutionally required to exercise independent judgment, \nnot simply to rubberstamp the President's desires.\n  As Senator William Maclay said:\n\n       [W]hoever attends strictly to the Constitution of the \n     United States will readily observe that the part assigned to \n     the Senate was an important one--no less that of being the \n     great check, the regulator and corrector, or, if I may so \n     speak, the balance of this government. . . .The approbation \n     of the Senate was certainly meant to guard against the \n     mistakes of the President in his appointments to office . . . \n     The depriving power should be the same as the appointing \n     power.\n\n  The Founders gave us a system in which the Senate was to play a \nsignificant and substantive role in judicial nominations. They also \nprovided us guidance on what type of legislative body they envisioned. \nIn this new type of governance system they set up in 1789 where power \nwould be separated and would check other power, the Founders envisioned \na special unique role for the Senate that does not exist anywhere else \nin governance or in any parliamentary system.\n  There is the oft-repeated discussion between two of our most \ndistinguished Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. \nReportedly, at a breakfast that Jefferson was having with Washington \nupon returning from Paris, because he was not here when the \nConstitution was written, Jefferson was somewhat upset that there was a \nbicameral legislative body, that a Senate was set up. He asked \nWashington: Why did you do this, set up a Senate? And Washington looked \nat Jefferson as they were having tea and said: Why did you pour that \ntea into your saucer? And Jefferson responded: To cool it.\n  I might note parenthetically that was the purpose of a saucer \noriginally. It was not to keep the tablecloth clean.\n  Jefferson responded: To cool it, and Washington then sagely stated: \nEven so, we pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it.\n  The Senate was designed to play this independent and, I might \nemphasize, moderating--a word not heard here very often--moderating and \nreflective role in our Government. But what aspects of the Senate led \nit to become this saucer, cooling the passions of the\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\nday for the betterment of America's long-term future? First, the \nFounders certainly did not envision the Senate as a body of \nunadulterated majoritarianism. In fact, James Madison and other \nFounders were amply concerned about the majority's ability, as they put \nit, ``to oppress the minority.'' It was in this vein the Senate was set \nup ``first to protect the people against their rulers; secondly, to \nprotect the people against the transient impressions into which they \nthemselves might be led. . . .The use of the Senate is to consist in \nits proceeding with more coolness, with more system, and with more \nwisdom, than the popular branch.''\n  Structurally, the Founders set up a ``different type of legislature'' \nby ensuring that each citizen--now here is an important point, and if \nanybody in this Chamber understands this, the Presiding Officer does--\nthe Founders set up this different type of legislative body by ensuring \nthat each citizen did not have an equal say in the functioning of the \nSenate--that sounds outrageous, to ensure they did not have an equal \nsay--but that each State did have an equal say. In fact, for over a \ncentury, Senators were not originally chosen by the people, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, and it was not until 1913 that they were \nelected by the people as opposed to selected by their State legislative \nbodies.\n  Today, Mr. President, you and I do stand directly before the people \nof our State for election, but the Senate remains to this day a \nlegislative body that does not reflect the simple popular majority \nbecause representation is by States.\n  That means someone from Maine has over 25 times as much effective \nvoting power in this body as the Senator from California. An \ninteresting little fact, and I do not say this to say anything other \nthan how the system works, there are more desks on that side of the \naisle. That side has 55. Does that side of the aisle realize this side \nof the aisle, with 45 desks, represents more Americans than they do? If \nwe add up all the people represented by the Republican Party in the \nSenate, they add up to fewer people than the Democratic Party \nrepresents in the Senate. We represent the majority of the American \npeople, but in this Chamber it is irrelevant and it should be because \nthis was never intended in any sense to be a majoritarian institution.\n  This distinctive quality of the Senate was part of that Great \nCompromise without which we would not have a Constitution referred to \nas the Connecticut Compromise. Edmund Randolph, who served as the first \nAttorney General of the United States and would later be Secretary of \nState, represented Virginia at the Constitutional Convention, and in \nthat context he argued for fully proportionate representation in the \ndebates over the proper form of the legislative branch, but ultimately \nhe agreed to the Connecticut Compromise. After reflection, that so \nseldom happens among our colleagues, myself included, he realized his \nfirst position was incorrect and he stated:\n\n       The general object was to provide a cure for the evils \n     under which the United States labored; that in tracing these \n     evils to their origin every man--\n\n  Referring to every man who agreed to the compromise--\n\n     had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy; that \n     some check therefore was to be sought against this tendency \n     of our Governments; and that a good Senate seemed most likely \n     to answer this purpose.\n\n  So the Founders quite intentionally designed the Senate with these \ndistinctive features.\n  Specifically, article 1, section 5 of the Constitution states that \neach House may determine its own rules for its own proceedings. \nPrecisely: ``Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.'' \nThe text contains no limitations or conditions. This clause plainly \nvests the Senate with plenary power to devise its internal rules as it \nsees fit, and the filibuster was just one of those procedural rules of \nthe many rules that vest a minority within the Senate with the \npotential to have a final say over the Senate's business.\n  It was clear from the start that the Senate would be a different type \nof legislative body; it would be a consensus body that respects the \nrights of minorities, even the extreme minority power of a single \nSenator because that single Senator can represent a single and whole \nState. The way it is played out in practice was through the right of \nunlimited debate.\n  I find it fascinating, we are talking about the limitation of a right \nthat has already limited the original right of the Founding Fathers. \nThe fact was there was no way to cut off debate for the first decades \nof this Republic.\n  Joseph Story, famous justice and probably one of the best known \narbiters of the Constitution in American history, his remark about the \nimportance of the right of debate was ``the next great and vital \nprivilege is the freedom of speech and debate, without which all other \nprivileges would be comparatively unimportant, or ineffectual.'' And \nthat goes to the very heart of what made the Senate different.\n  In the Senate, each individual Senator was more than a number to be \ncounted on the way to a majority vote, something I think some of us \nhave forgotten. Daniel Webster put it this way:\n\n       This is a Senate of equals, of men of individual honor and \n     personal character, and of absolute independence. We know no \n     masters, we acknowledge no dictators. This is a hall for \n     mutual consultation and discussion; not an arena for the \n     exhibition of champions.\n\n  Extended debate, the filibuster, was a means to reach a more modest \nand moderate result to achieve compromise and common ground to allow \nSenators, as Webster had put it, to be men--and now men and women--of \nabsolute independence.\n  Until 1917, there was no method to cut off debate in the Senate, to \nbring any measure to a vote, legislative or nomination--none, except \nunanimous consent. Unanimous consent was required up until 1917 to get \na vote on a judge, on a bill, on anything on the Executive Calendar. \nThe Senate was a place where minority rights flourished completely, \ntotally unchecked, a place for unlimited rights of debate for each and \nevery Senator.\n  In part this can be understood as a recognition of our federal system \nof government in which we were not just a community of individuals but \nwe were also a community of sovereign States. Through the Senate, each \nState, through their two Senators, had a right to extensive debate and \nfull consideration of its views.\n  For much of the Senate's history, until less than 100 years ago, to \nclose off debate required not just two-thirds of the votes, but it \nrequired all of the votes. The Senate's history is replete with \nexamples of situations in which a committed minority flexed its ``right \nto debate'' muscles. In fact, there was a filibuster over the location \nof the Capitol of the United States in the First Congress. But what \nabout how this tradition of allowing unlimited debate and respect for \nminority rights played out in the nomination context, as opposed to the \nlegislative process?\n  First, the text of the Constitution makes no distinction whatsoever \nbetween nominations and legislation. Nonetheless, those who are pushing \nthe nuclear option seem to suggest that while respect for minority \nrights has a long and respected tradition on the legislative side of \nour business, things were somehow completely different when it came to \nconsidering nominations. In fact, it is the exact opposite.\n  The history of the Senate shows, and I will point to it now, that \nprevious Senates certainly did not view that to be the case. While it \nis my personal belief that the Senate should be more judicious in the \nuse of the filibuster, that is not how it has always been. For example, \na number of President Monroe's nominations never reached the floor by \nthe end of his administration and were defeated by delay, in spite of \nhis popularity and his party's control of the Senate.\n\n  Furthermore, President Adams had a number of judicial nominations \nblocked from getting to the floor. More than 1,300 appointments by \nPresident Taft were filibustered. President Wilson also suffered from \nthe filibusters of his nominees.\n  Not only does past practice show no distinction between legislation \nand judicial nominations in regards to the recognition of minority \nrights, the formal rules of the Senate have never recognized such a \ndistinction, except for a 30-year stretch in the Senate history, 1917 \nto 1949, when legislation was made subject to cloture but nominations \nwere not. Do my colleagues hear this? All of those who think a judge is \nmore entitled to a vote than legislation, in 1917 it was decided that \nabsolute unlimited debate should be curtailed, and\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\nthere needs to be a two-thirds vote to cut off debate in order to bring \nlegislation to the floor.\n  But there was no change with regard to judicial nominees. There was a \nrequirement of unanimous consent to get a nominee voted on. So much for \nthe argument that the Constitution leans toward demanding a vote on \nnominations more than on legislation. It flies in the face of the \nfacts, the history of America and the intent of our Framers. This fact \nin itself certainly undercuts the claim that there has been, by \ntradition, the insulating of judicial nominees from filibusters.\n  In both its rules and its practices, the Senate has long recognized \nthe exercise of minority rights with respect to nominations. And it \nshould come as no surprise that in periods where the electorate is \nsplit very evenly, as it is now, the filibustering of nominations was \nused extensively. For example, my good friend Senator Hatch who is on \nthe Senate floor--as my mother would say, God love him, because she \nlikes him so much, and I like him, too--he may remember when I was \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee back in the bad old days when the \nDemocrats controlled the Senate during President Clinton's first 2 \nyears in office, a time when the Democrats controlled both the \nPresidency and the Senate but nonetheless the country remained very \ndivided, numerous filibusters resulted, even in cases not involving the \njudiciary.\n  I remind my friends, for example, that the nomination of Dr. Henry \nFoster for Surgeon General, Sam Brown to be ambassador to the \nConference on Cooperation and Security in Europe, Janet Napolitano to \nbe U.S. attorney in the District of Arizona, and Ricki Tigert for the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation head, were all filibustered. We \ncontrolled the Senate, the House, the Presidency, but the Nation was \nnonetheless divided.\n  Some may counter that there should be a difference between how \njudicial nominees should be treated versus the treatment accorded \nexecutive branch nominees, the Cabinet, and the rest. Constitutional \ntext, historical practice and principle all run contrary to that \nproposition.\n  On the textual point, we only have one appointments clause. It is \nalso instructive to look at a few historical examples. In 1881, \nRepublican President Rutherford B. Hayes nominated Stanley Matthews to \nthe Supreme Court. A filibuster was mounted, but the Republican \nmajority in the Senate was unable to break the filibuster, and Stanley \nMatthews' Supreme Court nomination failed without getting a vote.\n  In 1968, the filibuster to block both Justice Abe Fortas from \nbecoming Chief Justice and Fifth Circuit Court Judge Homer Thornberry \nto occupy the seat that Justice Fortas was vacating was one where the \nDemocrats controlled the Senate, and the Republicans filibustered. The \nleader of that successful filibuster effort against Justice Fortas was \nRepublican Senator Robert Griffin from Michigan. In commenting on the \nSenate's rejection of President George Washington's nomination of John \nRutledge to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Republican \nSenator who mounted a successful filibuster against Fortas on the \nfloor--translated, Fortas never got a vote, even though he was a \nsitting Supreme Court Justice about to be elevated to Chief Justice--\nwhat did the Senator from Michigan who led that fight say about the \nfirst fight in the Senate?\n\n       That action in 1795 said to the President then in office \n     and to future Presidents: ``Don't expect the Senate to be a \n     rubberstamp. We have an independent coequal responsibility in \n     the appointing process; and we intend to exercise that \n     responsibility, as those who drafted the Constitution so \n     clearly intended.''\n\n  There is also a very important difference between judicial and \nexecutive nominees that argued for greater Senate scrutiny of judicial \nnominees. It should be noted that legislation is not forever. Judicial \nappointments are for the life of the candidate.\n  Of course, no President has unlimited authority, even related to his \nown Cabinet. But when you look at judges, they serve for life.\n  An interesting fact that differentiates us from the 1800s, when these \nfilibusters took place, and 1968, when they took place: The average \ntime a Federal judge spends on the bench, if appointed in the last 10 \nyears from today, has increased from 15 years to 24 years. That means \nthat on average, every judge we vote for will be on that bench for a \nquarter century. Since the impeachment clause is fortunately not often \nused, the only opportunity the Senate has to have its say is in this \nprocess.\n  The nuclear option was so named because it would cause widespread \nbedlam and dysfunction throughout the Senate, as the minority party, my \nparty, has pledged to render its vigorous protest. But I do not want to \ndwell on those immediate consequences which, I agree with my Senate \nJudiciary Committee chairman, would be dramatic. He said:\n\n       If we come to the nuclear option the Senate will be in \n     turmoil and the Judiciary Committee will be in hell.\n\n  However serious the immediate consequences may be, and however much \nsuch dysfunction would make both parties look juvenile and incompetent, \nthe more important consequence is the long-term deterioration of the \nSenate. Put simply, the nuclear option threatens the fundamental \nbulwark of the constitutional design. Specifically, the nuclear option \nis a double-barreled assault on this institution. First, requiring only \na bare majority of Senators to confirm a judicial nominee is completely \ncontrary to the history and intent of the Senate. The nuclear option \nalso upsets a tradition and history that says we are not going to \nchange the rules of the Senate by a majority vote. It breaks the rule \nto change the rule. If we go down this path of the nuclear option, we \nwill be left with a much different system from what our Founders \nintended and from how the Senate has functioned throughout its history.\n  The Senate has always been a place where the structure and rules \npermit fast-moving partisan agendas to be slowed down; where hotheads \ncould cool and where consensus was given a second chance, if not a \nthird and a fourth.\n  While 90 percent of the business is conducted by unanimous consent in \nthis body, those items that do involve a difference of opinion, \nincluding judicial nominations, must at least gain the consent of 60 \npercent of its Members in order to have that item become law. This is \nnot a procedural quirk. It is not an accident of history. It is what \ndifferentiates the Senate from the House of Representatives and the \nEnglish Parliament.\n  President Lyndon Johnson, the ``Master of the Senate,'' put it this \nway:\n\n     In this country, a majority may govern but it does not rule. \n     The genius of our constitutional and representative \n     government is the multitude of safeguards provided to protect \n     minority interests.\n\n  And it is not just leaders from the Democratic Party who understand \nthe importance of protecting minority rights. Former Senate Majority \nLeader Howard Baker wrote in 1993 that compromising the filibuster:\n\n     would topple one of the pillars of American Democracy: the \n     protection of minority rights from majority rule. The Senate \n     is the only body in the federal government where these \n     minority rights are fully and specifically protected.\n\n  Put simply, the ``nuclear option'' would eviscerate the Senate and \nturn it into the House of Representatives. It is not only a bad idea, \nit upsets the Constitutional design and it disserves the country. No \nlonger would the Senate be that ``different kind of legislative body'' \nthat the Founders intended. No longer would the Senate be the \n``saucer'' to cool the passions of the immediate majority.\n  Without the filibuster, more than 40 Senators would lack the means by \nwhich to encourage compromise in the process of appointing judges. \nWithout the filibuster, the majority would transform this body into \nnothing more than a rubber stamp for every judicial nomination.\n  The Senate needs the threat of filibuster to force a President to \nappoint judges who will occupy the sensible center rather than those \nwho cater to the whim of a temporary majority. And here is why--it is a \nyes or no vote; you can't amend a nomination.\n  With legislation, you can tinker around the edges and modify a bill \nto make it more palatable. You can't do that with a judge. You either \nvote for all of him or her, or none. So only by the threat of \nfilibuster can we obtain compromise when it comes to judges.\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\n  We, as Senators, collectively need to remember that it is our \ninstitutional duty to check any Presidential attempt to take over the \nJudiciary. As the Congressional Research Service, the independent and \nnon-partisan research arm of Congress, stated, the ``nuclear option'' \nwould:\n\n       . . . strengthen the executive branch's hand in the \n     selection of federal judges.\n\n  This shouldn't be a partisan issue, but an institutional one. Will \nthe Senate aid and abet in the erosion of its Article I power by \nconceding to another branch greater influence over our courts? As \nSenator Stennis once said to me in the face of an audacious claim by \nPresident Nixon:\n\n       Are we the President's men or the Senate's?\n\n  He resolved that in a caucus by speaking to us as only John Stennis \ncould, saying:\n\n       I am a Senate man, not the President's man.\n\n  Too many people here forget that.\n  Earlier, I explained that for much of the Senate's history, a single \nSenator could stop legislation or a nomination dead in its tracks. More \nrecent changes to the Senate Rules now require only \\3/5\\ of the \nSenate, rather than all of its Members, to end debate. Proponents of \nthe ``nuclear option'' argue that their proposal is simply the latest \niteration of a growing trend towards majoritarianism in the Senate. God \nsave us from that fate, if it is true.\n  I strongly disagree. Even a cursory review of these previous changes \nto the Senate Rules on unlimited debate show that these previous \nmechanisms to invoke cloture always respected minority rights.\n  The ``nuclear option'' completely eviscerates minority rights. It is \nnot simply a change in degree but a change in kind. It is a \ndiscontinuous action that is a sea change, fundamentally restructuring \nwhat the Senate is all about.\n  It would change the Senate from a body that protects minority rights \nto one that is purely majoritarian. Thus, rather than simply being the \nnext logical step in accommodating the Senate Rules to the demands of \nlegislative and policy modernity, the ``nuclear option'' is a leap off \nthe institutional precipice.\n  And so here we collectively stand--on the edge of the most important \nprocedural change during my 32-year Senate career, and one of the most \nimportant ever considered in the Senate; a change that would \neffectively destroy the Senate's independence in providing advice and \nconsent.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be able to continue for another 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDNG OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The ``nuclear option'' would gut the very essence and core \nof what the Senate is about as an institution--flying directly in the \nface of our Founders who deliberately rejected a parliamentary system. \nA current debate, over a particular set of issues, should not be \npermitted to destroy what history has bestowed on us.\n  And the stakes are much, much higher than the contemporary \ncontroversy over the judiciary. Robert Caro, the noted author on Senate \nhistory, wrote the following in a letter to the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n       [I]n considering any modification [to the right of extended \n     debate in the Senate Senators should realize they are dealing \n     not with the particular dispute of the moment, but with the \n     fundamental character of the Senate of the United States, and \n     with the deeper issue of the balance between majority and \n     minority rights . . ., you need only look at what happened \n     when the Senate gradually surrendered more and more of its \n     power over international affairs to learn the lesson that \n     once you surrender power, you never get it back.\n\n  The fight over the nuclear option is not just about the procedure for \nconfirming judges. It is also, fundamentally, about the integrity of \nthe Senate. Put simply, the ``nuclear option'' changes the rules \nmidstream. Once the Senate starts changing the rules outside of its own \nrules, which is what the nuclear option does, there is nothing to stop \na temporary majority from doing so whenever a particular rule would \npose an obstacle.\n  It is a little akin to us agreeing to work together on a field. I \ndon't have to sit down and agree with you that we are going to divide \nup this field, but I say, OK, I will share my rights in this field with \nyou. But here is the deal we agree to at the start. Any change in the \nagreements we make about how to run this field have to be by a \nsupermajority. OK? Because that way I am giving up rights--which all \nthe Founders did in this body, this Constitution--rights of my people, \nfor a whole government. But if you are going to change those rules with \na pure majority vote, then I would have never gotten into the deal in \nthe first place.\n  I suffer from teaching constitutional law for the last 13 years, an \nadvanced class on constitutional law at Widener University, a seminar \non Saturday morning, and I teach this clause. I point out the essence \nof our limited constitutional government, which is so different than \nevery other, is that it is based on the consent of the governed. The \ngoverned would never have given consent in 1789 if they knew the outfit \nthey were giving the consent to would be able, by a simple majority, to \nalter their say in their governance.\n  The Senate is a continuing body, meaning the rules of the Senate \ncontinue from one session to the next. Specifically, rule V provides:\n\n       The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to \n     the next Congress unless they are changed as provided in \n     these rules.\n\n  I say to my colleague from North Carolina, on the floor, I say to my \ncolleague from South Carolina, I say to my colleague from Utah: If you \nvote for this ``nuclear option'' you are about to break faith with the \nAmerican people and the sacred commitment that was made on how to \nchange the rules.\n  Senate rule XXII allows only a rule change with two-thirds votes. The \n``continuing body'' system is unlike many other legislative bodies and \nis part of what makes the Senate different and allows it to avoid being \ncaptured by the temporary passions of the moment. It makes it different \nfrom the House of Representatives, which comes up with new rules each \nand every Congress from scratch.\n  The ``nuclear option'' doesn't propose to change the judicial \nfilibuster rule by securing a two-thirds vote, as required under the \nexisting rules. It would change the rule with only a bare majority. In \nfact, as pointed out recently by a group of legal scholars:\n\n       On at least 3 separate occasions, the Senate has expressly \n     rejected the argument that a simple majority has the \n     authority claimed by the proponents of the [nuclear option].\n\n  One historical incident is particularly enlightening. In 1925, the \nSenate overwhelmingly refused to agree to then-Vice President Dawes' \nsuggestion that the Senate adopt a proposal for amending its rules \nidentical to the nuclear option.\n  On this occasion, an informal poll was taken of the Senate. It \nindicated over 80 percent of the Senators were opposed to such a \nradical step.\n  Let me be very clear. Never before have Senate rules been changed \nexcept by following the procedures laid out in the Senate rules. Never \nonce in the history of the Senate.\n  The Congressional Research Service directly points out that there is \nno previous precedent for changing the Senate rules in this way.\n  The ``nuclear option'' uses an ultra-vires mechanism that has never \nbefore been used in the Senate--``Employment of the [nuclear option] \nwould require the chair to overturn previous precedent.\n  The Senate Parliamentarian, the nonpartisan expert on the Senate's \nprocedural rules--who is hired by the majority--has reportedly said \nthat Republicans will have to overrule him to employ the ``nuclear \noption''.\n  Adopting the ``nuclear option'' would send a terrible message about \nthe malleability of Senate rules. No longer would they be the framework \nthat each party works within.\n  I've been in the Senate for a long time, and there are plenty of \ntimes I would have loved to change this rule or that rule to pass a \nbill or to confirm a nominee I felt strongly about.\n  But I didn't, and it was understood that the option of doing so just \nwasn't on the table.\n  You fought political battles; you fought hard; but you fought them \nwithin the strictures and requirements of the Senate rules. Despite the \nshort-term pain, that understanding has served both parties well, and \nprovided long-term gain.\n  Adopting the ``nuclear option'' would change this fundamental \nunderstanding and unbroken practice of\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\nwhat the Senate is all about. Senators would start thinking about \nchanging other rules when they became ``inconvienent.'' Instead of two-\nthirds of the vote to change a rule, you'd now have precedent that it \nonly takes a bare majority. Altering Senate rules to help in one \npolitical fight or another could become standard operating procedure, \nwhich, in my view, would be disastrous.\n  The Congressional Research Service has stated that adopting the \n``nuclear option'' would set a precedent that could apply to virtually \nall Senate business. It would ultimately threaten both parties, not \njust one. The Service report states:\n\n       The presence of such a precedent might, in principle, \n     enable a voting majority of the Senate to alter any procedure \n     at-will by raising a point of order . . . by such means, a \n     voting majority might subsequently impose limitations on the \n     consideration of any item of business, prohibiting debate or \n     amendment to any desired degree. Such a majority might even \n     alter applicable procedures from one item of business to the \n     next, from one form of proceeding to a contrary one, \n     depending on immediate objects.\n\n  Just as the struggle over the ``nuclear option'' is about \nconstitutional law and Senate history, it is also about something much \nmore simple and fundamental--playing by the rules.\n  I reiterate that I think Senator Frist and his allies think they are \nacting on the basis of principle and commitment, but I regret to say \nthey are also threatening to unilaterally change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game. Imagine a baseball team with a five-run lead after \neight innings unilaterally declaring that the ninth inning will consist \nof one out per team.\n  Would the fans--for either side--stand for that? If there is one \nthing this country stands for it's fair play--not tilting the playing \nfield in favor of one side or the other, not changing the rules \nunilaterally. We play by the rules, and we win or lose by the rules.\n  That quintessentially American trait is abandoned in the ``nuclear \noption.'' Republican Senators as well as Democratic ones have benefited \nfrom minority protections. Much more importantly, American citizens \nhave benefited from the Senate's check on the excesses of the majority.\n  But this is not just about games, and playing them the right way. \nThis is about a more ethereal concept--justice. In his groundbreaking \nphilosophical treatise, A Theory of Justice, the philosopher John Rawls \npoints to the importance of what he calls procedural justice.\n  Relying on this predecessors such as Immanuel Kant, Thomas Hobbes, \nJean Jacques Rousseau, and John Locke, Rawls argues that, in activities \nas diverse as cutting a birthday cake and conducting a criminal trial, \nit is the procedure that makes the outcome just. An outcome is just if \nit has been arrived at through a fair procedure.\n  This principle undergirds our legal system, including criminal and \ncivil trials. Moreover it is at the very core of our Constitution. The \nterm ``due process of law'' appears not once but twice in our \nConstitution, because our predecessors recognized the vital importance \nof setting proper procedures--proper rules--and abiding by them.\n  It is also the bedrock principle we Senators rely on in accepting \noutcomes with which we may disagree. We know the debate was conducted \nfairly--the game was played by the rules. A decision to change the \nSenate's rules in violation of those very same rules abandons the \nprocedural justice that legitimates everything we do.\n  It is interesting to ask ourselves what's different about now, why \nare we at this precipice where the ``nuclear option'' is actually being \nseriously debated and very well might be utilized? Why have we reached \nthis point when such a seemingly radical rule change is being seriously \nconsidered by a majority of Senators? It's a good question, and I don't \nhave an easy answer.\n  We have avoided such fights in the past largely because cooler heads \nhave prevailed and accommodation was the watchword.\n  As Senator Sam Ervin used to say--the separation of powers should \nnot, as President Woodrow Wilson warned, become an invitation for \nwarfare between the two branches.\n  Throughout this country's history--whether during times of war or \npolitical division, for example--Presidents have sometimes extended an \nolive branch across the aisle. Past Presidents have in these \ncircumstances made bipartisan appointments, selecting nominees who were \nconsensus candidates and often members of the other party.\n  President Clinton had two Supreme Court nominees, and the left was \npushing us as hard as the right is pushing you. What did he do? I spent \nseveral hours with him consulting on it. He picked two people on his \nwatch who got 90 or so votes. Moderate, mainstream appointments. He did \nnot appoint Scalias. He did not appoint Thomases. He appointed people \nacceptable to the Republicans because he was wise enough to know, even \nthough he was President, we were still a divided Nation.\n  History provides ample examples. During the midst of the Civil War, \nPresident Lincoln selected members of the opposition Democratic party \nfor key positions, naming Stephen Field to the Supreme Court in 1863 \nand Andrew Johnson as his Vice Presidential candidate in 1864.\n  On the brink of American entrance into WWII, President Roosevelt \nlikewise selected members of the opposition Republican party, elevating \nHarlan Fiske Stone to be Chief Justice and naming Henry Stimson as \nSecretary of War.\n  Other 20th Century Presidents followed suit. In 1945, President \nTruman named Republican Senator Harold Burton to the Supreme Court. In \n1956, President Eisenhower named Democrat William Brennan to the \nSupreme Court. What has happened to us? What have we become?\n  Does anyone not understand this Nation is divided red and blue and \nwhat it needs is a purple heart and not a red heart or a blue heart.\n  Lest any of my colleagues think these examples are merely culled from \nthe dusty pages of history, let me remind them that the Senate has \nwitnessed recent examples of consensus appointments during times of \nclose political division. As I already mentioned, President Clinton \nfollowed this historic practice during vacancies to the Supreme Court a \ndecade ago.\n  As explained by my friend, the Senior Senator from Utah, who was then \nthe ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, President Clinton \nconsulted with him and the Republican Caucus during the High Court \nvacancies in 1993 and 1994. The result was President Clinton's \nselection of two outstanding and consensus nominees--Ruth Bader \nGinsburg and Stephen Breyer--both of whom were confirmed overwhelmingly \nby the Senate, by votes of 97-3 and 87-9, respectively.\n  Indeed, the last two vacancies to the Supreme Court are text book \nexamples of the executive branch working in cooperative and collegial \nfashion with its Senate counterpart to secure consensus appointments, \nthus averting an ideological showdown. The two constitutional partners \ngiven roles in the nomination process engaged in a consultative process \nthat respected the rights and obligations of both branches as an \ninstitutional matter, while also producing outstanding nominees who \nwere highly respected by both parties.\n  To be sure, a careful review of our Nation's history does not always \nprovide the examples of consultation, comity, or consensus in the \nnomination process. Presidents of both parties have at times attempted \nto appoint nominees--or remove them once confirmed--over the objections \nof the Senate, including in some instances where the Senate was \ncomposed of a majority of the President's own party. And sometimes the \nSenate has had to stand strong and toe the line against imperialist \nPresidential leanings.\n  Our first President, George Washington, saw one of his nominees to \nthe Supreme Court rejected by this Senate in 1795. The Senate voted 14 \nto 10 to reject the nomination of John Rutledge of South Carolina to be \nChief Justice. What is historically instructive, I believe, is that \nwhile the Senate was dominated by the Federalists, President \nWashington's party, 13 of the 14 Senators who rejected the Rutledge \nnomination were Federalists.\n  The Senate also stood firm in the 1805 impeachment of Supreme Court \nJustice Samuel Chase. President Jefferson's party had majorities in \nboth the House and the Senate, and Jefferson set his sights on the \nSupreme\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\nCourt. Specifically, he wanted to remove Justice Chase, a committed \nFederalist and frequent Jefferson critic, from the Court.\n  Jefferson was able to convince the House to impeach Justice Chase on \na party-line vote, and the President had enough members of his party in \nthe Senate to convict him. But members of the President's own party \nstood up to their President; the Senate as an institution stood up \nagainst executive overreaching. Justice Chase was not convicted, and \nthe independence of the judiciary was preserved.\n  The Senate again stood firm in the 1937 court-packing plan by \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt.\n  This particular example of Senate resolve is instructive for today's \ndebates, so let me describe it in some detail. It was the summer of \n1937 and President Roosevelt had just come off a landslide victory over \nAlf Landon, and he had a Congress made up of solid New Dealers. But the \n``nine old men'' of the Supreme Court were thwarting his economic \nagenda, overturning law after law overwhelmingly passed by the Congress \nand from statehouses across the country.\n  In this environment, President Roosevelt unveiled his court-packing \nplan--he wanted to increase the number of Justices on the court to 15, \nallowing himself to nominate these additional judges. In an act of \ngreat courage, Roosevelt's own party stood up against this \ninstitutional power grab. They did not agree with the judicial activism \nof the Supreme Court, but they believed that Roosevelt was wrong to \nseek to defy established traditions as a way of stopping that activism.\n  In May 1937, the Senate Judiciary Committee--a committee controlled \nby the Democrats and supportive of his political ends--issued a \nstinging rebuke. They put out a report condemning Roosevelt's plan, \narguing it was an effort ``to punish the justices'' and that executive \nbranch attempts to dominate the judiciary lead inevitably to autocratic \ndominance, ``the very thing against which the American Colonies \nrevolted, and to prevent which the Constitution was in every particular \nframed.''\n  Our predecessors in the Senate showed courage that day and stood up \nto their President as a coequal institution. And they did so not to \nthwart the agenda of the President, which in fact many agreed with; \nthey did it to preserve our system's checks and balances; they did it \nto ensure the integrity of the system. When the Founders created a \n``different kind of legislative body'' in the Senate, they envisioned a \nbulwark against unilateral power--it worked back then and I hope that \nit works now.\n  The noted historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., has argued that in a \nparliamentary system President Roosevelt's effort to pack the court \nwould have succeeded. Schlesinger writes: ``The court bill couldn't \nhave failed if we had had a parliamentary system in 1937.'' A \nparliamentary legislature would have gone ahead with their President, \nthat's what they do, but the Founders envisioned a different kind of \nlegislature, an independent institution that would think for itself. In \nthe end, Roosevelt's plan failed because Democrats in Congress thought \ncourt-packing was dangerous, even if they would have supported the \nnewly-constituted court's rulings. The institution acted as an \ninstitution.\n  In summary, then, what do the Senate's action of 1795, 1805, and 1937 \nshare in common? I believe they are examples of this body acting at its \nfinest, demonstrating its constitutional role as an independent check \non the President, even popularly elected Presidents of the same \npolitical party.\n  One final note from our Senate history. Even when the Senate's rules \nhave been changed in the past to limit extended debate, it has been \ndone with great care, remarkable hesitancy, and by virtual consensus. \nTake what occurred during the Senate's two most important previous \nchanges to the filibuster rule: the 1917 creation of cloture and the \n1975 lowering of the cloture threshold.\n  First, let's examine 1917. On the eve of the United States' entry \ninto WWI, with American personnel and vessels in great danger on the \nhigh seas, President Wilson asked that Congress authorize the arming of \nAmerican merchant vessels. Over three-fourths of the Senate agreed with \nthis proposal on the merits, but a tiny minority opposed it. With \nAmerican lives and property at grave risk, the Senate still took over 2 \nmonths to come to the point of determining to change its rules to \npermit cloture.\n  When they did so, they did it by virtual consensus, and in a \nsupremely bipartisan manner. A conference committee composed equally of \nDemocrats and Republicans, each named to the committee by their party \nleadership, drafted and proposed the new rule. It was then adopted by \nan overwhelming vote of 76-3.\n  In 1975, I was part of a bipartisan effort to lower the threshold for \ncloture from two-thirds to three-fifths. Many of us were reacting \nagainst the filibustering for so many years of vital civil rights \nlegislation. Civil rights is an issue I feel passionately about and was \na strong impetus for me seeking public office in the first place. Don't \nget me wrong--I was not calling the shots back in 1975; I was a junior \nSenator having been in the chamber for only 2 years.\n  But I will make no bones about it--for about two weeks in 1975--I was \npart of a slim bipartisan majority that supported jettisoning \nestablished Senate rules and ending debate on a rules change by a \nsimple majority.\n  The rule change on the table in 1975 was not to eliminate the \nfilibuster in its entirety, which is what the current ``nuclear \noption'' would do for judicial nominations; rather it was to change \nfrom the then-existing two-thirds cloture requirement to three-fifths. \nIt was a change in degree, not a fundamental restructuring of the \nSenate to completely do away with minority rights.\n  The rule change was also attempted at the beginning of the Senate \nsession and applied across the board, as opposed to the change \ncurrently on the table, brought up mid-session concerning only a very \nsmall subset of the Senate's business. Nonetheless, my decision to \nsupport cutting off debate on a rules change by a simple majority vote \nwas misguided.\n  I carefully listened to the debate in 1975 and learned much from my \nsenior colleagues. In particular, I remember Senator Mansfield being a \nprincipled voice against the effort to break the rules to amend the \nrules.\n  Senator Mansfield stood on this floor and said the following:\n\n       [T]he fact that I can and do support [changing the cloture \n     threshold from \\2/3\\ to \\3/5\\] does not mean that I condone \n     or support the route taken or the methods being used to reach \n     the objective of Senate rule 22. The present motion to invoke \n     cloture by a simple majority, if it succeeds would alter the \n     concept of the Senate so drastically that I cannot under any \n     circumstances find any justification for it. The proponents \n     of this motion would disregard the rules which have governed \n     the Senate over the years, over the decades, simply by \n     stating that the rules do not exist. They insist that their \n     position is right and any means used are, therefore, proper. \n     I cannot agree.\n\n  Senator Mansfield's eloquent defense of the Senate's institutional \ncharacter and respect for its rules rings as true today as it did 30 \nyears ago. Senator Mansfield's courage and conviction in that \nemotionally charged time is further evidence, I believe, of why he is \none of the giants of the Senate.\n  In the end, cooler heads prevailed and the Senate came together in a \nway only the Senate can. I changed my mind; I along with my Senate \ncolleagues. We reversed ourselves and changed the cloture rule but only \nby following the rules. Ultimately, over \\3/4\\ of the voting Senators--\na bipartisan group--voted to end debate. In fact, the deal that was \nstruck called for reducing the required cloture threshold from \\2/3\\ to \n\\3/5\\; but it retained the higher \\2/3\\ threshold for any future rules \nchanges.\n  Now I understand that passions today are running high on both sides \nof the ``nuclear option'' issue, and I can relate to my current \nRepublican colleagues. I agree with my distinguished Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman that neither side has clean hands in the escalating \njudicial wars.\n  I also understand the frustration of my Republican colleagues--\nespecially those who are relatively new to this Chamber--that a \nminority of Senators can have such power in this body.\n  For me, the lesson from my 1975 experience, which I believe strongly \napplies to the dispute today, is that the Senate ought not act rashly \nby changing its rules to satisfy a strong-willed majority acting in the \nheat of the moment.\n\n[[Page S4364]]\n\n  Today, as in 1975, the solution to what some have called a potential \nconstitutional crisis lies in the deliberate and thoughtful effort by a \nbipartisan majority of Senators to heed the wisdom of those who \nestablished the carefully crafted system of checks and balances \nprotecting the rights of the minority. It's one thing to change Senate \nrules at the margins and in degrees, it's quite another to overturn \nthem.\n  Federalist No. 1 emphasizes that Americans have a unique \nopportunity--to choose a form of government by ``reflection and \nchoice'':\n\n       It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been \n     reserved to the people of this country . . . to decide the \n     important question, whether societies of men are really \n     capable or not of establishing good government from \n     reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined \n     to depend for their political constitutions on accident and \n     force.\n\n  We need to understand that this is a question posed at the time of \nthe founding and also a question posed to us today. At the time of the \nfounding, it was a question about whether America would be able to \nchoose well in determining our form of government.\n  We know from the experience of the last 225 years that the founding \ngeneration chose well. As a question posed to citizens and to Senators \nof today, it is a question about whether we will be able to preserve \nthe form of government they chose.\n  The Framers created the Senate as a unique legislative body designed \nto protect against the excesses of any temporary majority, including \nwith respect to judicial nominations; and they left all of us the \nresponsibility of guaranteeing an independent Federal judiciary, one \nprice of which is that it sometimes reaches results Senators do not \nlike.\n  It is up to us to preserve these precious guarantees. Our history, \nour American sense of fair play, and our Constitution demand it.\n  I would ask my colleagues who are considering supporting the \n``nuclear option''--those who propose to ``jump off the precipice''--\nwhether they believe that history will judge them favorably.\n  In so many instances throughout this esteemed body's past, our \nforefathers came together and stepped back from the cliff. In each \ncase, the actions of those statesmen preserved and strengthened the \nSenate, to the betterment of the health of our constitutional republic \nand to all of our advantage.\n  Our careers in the Senate will one day end--as we are only the \nSenate's temporary officeholders--but the Senate itself will go on.\n  Will historians studying the actions taken in the spring of 2005 look \nupon the current Members of this Senate as statesmen who placed the \ninstitution of the United States Senate above party and politics?\n  Or will historians see us as politicians bending to the will of the \nExecutive and to political exigency?\n  I, for one, am comfortable with the role I will play in this upcoming \nhistoric moment.\n  I hope all my colleagues feel the same.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a speech against the nuclear option \ndelivered earlier this week by Senator Byrd to the Center for American \nProgress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Upholding the Tradition of Freedom of Speech--April 25, 2005\n\n       ``That 150 lawyers should do business together (in the U.S. \n     Congress) ought not to be expected.'' Those are the words of \n     Thomas Jefferson.\n       Now comes the so-called Nuclear Option, or Constitutional \n     Option to prove him right. You know, I liked Jefferson, but I \n     always thought he borrowed some of my best stuff for that \n     declaration he wrote. This poisoned pill, euphemistically \n     designated ``the nuclear option'', has been around a long \n     time--since 1917, in fact, the year the cloture rule was \n     adopted by the U.S. Senate. It required no genius of \n     Brobdingnagian proportions to conjure up this witch's brew. \n     All that it takes is (1) to have the chair wired; (2) to have \n     a majority of 51 votes to back the chair's ruling; and (3) a \n     determined ruthlessness to execute the power grab.\n       Over the 88 years since 1917, however, no White House and \n     no party in control of the Senate has ever resorted to the \n     use of this draconian weapon in order to achieve its goal. \n     Until now. Why now? It is because a determined minority in \n     the Senate has refused to confirm only 10 of over 200 \n     nominees to federal judgeships submitted by President George \n     Bush during this first term as President. Since his \n     reelection, President Bush has resubmitted 7 of the 10 \n     nominees who failed to be confirmed in his first term. Hence, \n     a heavy-handed move is about to be made to change the rules \n     by disregarding the standing rules of the Senate that have \n     governed freedom of speech and debate in the Senate for over \n     200 years. The filibuster must go, they say.\n       Obstructive tactics in a legislative forum, although not \n     always known as filibusters, are of ancient origin. Plutarch \n     reported that, while Caesar was on sojourn in Spain, the \n     election of Consuls was approaching. ``He applied to the \n     Senate for permission to stand candidate,'' but Cato strongly \n     opposed his request and ``attempted to prevent his success by \n     gaining time; with which view he spun at the debate till it \n     was too late to conclude upon anything that day.'' Hey, the \n     filibuster has only been around 2,064 years, since circa 59 \n     B.C.!\n       Filibusters were also a problem in the British Parliament. \n     In 19th century England, even the members of the Cabinet \n     accepted the tactics of obstruction as an appropriate weapon \n     to defeat House of Commons' initiatives that were not \n     acceptable to the government. In this country, experience \n     with protracted debate began early. In the first session of \n     the First Congress, for example, there was a lengthy \n     discussion regarding the permanent site for the location of \n     the Capitol. Fisher Ames, a member of the House from \n     Massachusetts, complained that ``the minority . . . makes \n     every exertion to . . . delay the business.''\n       Senator William Maclay of Pennsylvania complained that \n     ``every endeavor was used to waste time, . . . '' Long \n     speeches and other obstructionist tactics were more \n     characteristic of the House than of the Senate in the early \n     years.\n       There have been successful filibusters that have benefited \n     the country. For example, in March 1911, Senator Owen of \n     Oklahoma filibustered a measure granting statehood to New \n     Mexico, arguing that Arizona should also be a state. \n     President Taft opposed the inclusion of Arizona's statehood \n     because a provision of Arizona's state constitution permitted \n     the recall of judges. Arizona later attained statehood, at \n     least in part because Senators took time to make the case the \n     year before. Another example occurred in July 1937, when a \n     Senate filibuster blocked FDR's Supreme Court-packing plan \n     until public opinion turned against the plan.\n       Freedom of speech and debate is enshrined in Article I, \n     Section 6, of the U.S. Constitution. The roots run deep. \n     Before the British Parliament would proclaim William III and \n     Mary as king and queen of England, they were required to \n     swear allegiance to the British Declaration of Rights, which \n     they did on February 13, 1689. They were then declared joint \n     sovereigns by the House of Commons. The declaration was \n     converted into the English Bill of Rights by statute on \n     December 16, 1689, the 9th Article of which guarantees \n     freedom of speech and debate in Parliament in words similar \n     to those in our own Constitution, Article I, Section 6.\n       So now, for the first time in the 217 years since 1789, the \n     tradition of freedom of speech and debate in the Senate is \n     under a serious threat of extinction by the majority party \n     through resort to the nuclear option.\n       Marty Gold, deservedly respected for his knowledge of the \n     Senate rules and precedents, and opponents of free speech and \n     debate claim that, during my tenure as Majority Leader in the \n     United States Senate, I established precedents that now \n     justify a proposal for a misguided attempt to end debate on a \n     judicial nomination by a simple majority vote, rather than by \n     a 3/5s vote of all Senators duly chosen and sworn as required \n     by Paragraph 2 of Senate Rule XXII. Their claims are false. \n     Utterly false!\n       Proponents of the so-called ``nuclear option'' cite several \n     instances in which they inaccurately allege that I ``blazed a \n     procedural path'' toward an inappropriate change in Senate \n     rules. They are dead wrong. Dead wrong! They draw analogies \n     where none exist and create cockeyed comparisons that fail to \n     withstand even the slightest intellectual scrutiny. My \n     detailed response to these false claims and allegations \n     appears in the March 20, 2005, edition of the Congressional \n     Record. But, simply put, no action of mine ever denied a \n     minority of the Senate a right to full debate on the final \n     disposition of a measure or matter pending before the Senate. \n     Not in 1977, not in 1979, not in 1980, not in 1987--the dates \n     cited by critics as grounds for the nuclear option. In none \n     of the instances cited by those who threaten to invoke the \n     nuclear option did my participation in any action deny the \n     minority in the Senate, regardless of party, its right to \n     debate the real matter at hand.\n       Now why can't reasonable Senators on both sides of the \n     aisle act in the best interests of the Senate, the \n     Constitution, and the country by working together to find a \n     way to avoid this procedural Armageddon? President Gerald \n     Ford always said that he believed in friendly compromise and \n     called compromise ``the oil that makes governments go.''\n       When I was a mere lad in southern West Virginia, I once \n     accidentally threw a wooden airplane I had crafted through \n     the glass of a window in a neighbor's house. The neighbor's \n     name was Mr. Arch Smith. He was angry, and I was scared. Into \n     the house I went to plead with Mr. Smith not to tell my Dad. \n     I\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\n     knew that a belt thrashing awaited me if he did. I promised \n     to pay Mr. Smith .35 cents for the windowpane if he would \n     stay mum about the accident. I would raise the .35 cents by \n     running errands for a friendly lady next door. We struck a \n     deal. We compromised. And my dad never learned of the \n     incident until after I had paid my debt. That compromise \n     saved me a licking, and paid for Mr. Smith's broken window. \n     The sweet art of compromise solved our dispute.\n       Of course, the Senate itself is the result of a compromise \n     which solved a dispute. The Senate answered the plea of the \n     smaller states for equality and a forum where they could have \n     equal representation and minority views could be heard. \n     Because of that famous action, the Great Compromise of July \n     16, 1787, the Senate and the House balance each other, \n     reflecting majority rule and minority rights like halves of \n     the same apple in our Republic, and achieving a delicate \n     balance--a finely tuned, exquisitely honed accommodation of \n     tensions which has endured for over 200 years. To paraphrase \n     the words of James Madison, the Republic has been structured \n     to, ``guard against the cabals of a few . . .,'' as well as \n     against the ``confusion of a multitude . . .''\n       The Constitution, under Article II, Section 2, requires a \n     President to submit his selection of Federal judges, members \n     of his own cabinet, and certain other high-ranking officials \n     to the Senate for its ``advice and consent.'' The Framers \n     allowed the Executive only to propose. It was left to the \n     Senate to dispose. There is no stipulation in the \n     Constitution as to how the Senate is to express its advice or \n     give its consent. President Bush incorrectly maintains that \n     each nominee for a federal judgeship is entitled to an up or \n     down vote. The Constitution doesn't say that. It doesn't even \n     say that there has to be a vote with respect to the giving of \n     ``its consent.'' The Senate can refuse to confirm a nominee \n     simply by saying nothing and doing nothing. In Section 2, \n     Article II, it says, `` . . . and by and with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate, [He] shall appoint ambassadors . . . \n     Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the \n     United States. . . .''\n       Just as in Article I concerning the setting of Senate \n     rules, Article II allows the Senate the freedom to determine \n     how it will use its advice and consent powers. The choice \n     of the Senate as the single entity to work with the \n     President on the selection of life-tenured federal judges \n     seems strongly to indicate the Framer's desire for \n     scrutiny by the House of Congress uniquely designed for \n     the protection of minority views. The Framers could have \n     selected the majoritarian House of Representatives for \n     such a duty. They did not. In fact, they totally excluded \n     the House. They made a conscious decision to delegate the \n     ``advice and consent'' function to the United States \n     Senate.\n       But, suppose the President's party controls the Senate, and \n     therefore controls the votes of a majority in the Senate? \n     Where then, is the check on Presidential power? The \n     filibuster is the minority's strongest tool in providing the \n     Constitutional curb on raw Presidential power when it comes \n     to nominations and the federal courts. Of course, the \n     President's party could occupy 60 seats in the Senate, and \n     that would be enough to break any filibuster except when \n     amending the rules. But, 60 votes is a high threshold, and \n     does provide an effective check on the abuse of power. Why \n     would we ever want to eliminate this important check on \n     Presidential power? Haven't we always had a healthy suspicion \n     of too much power in the hands of a King or any President \n     regardless of party affiliation? The filibuster is the final \n     bulwark preventing a President from stacking the courts (as \n     FDR tried to do in 1937) if his political party holds a \n     majority in the Senate. Without the ability by a minority to \n     defeat cloture by a supermajority vote, that slim wall \n     holding back the waters of destruction of a fair and \n     independent judiciary, ruptures. Other liberties enumerated \n     in the bill of rights can then also be washed away by a \n     President who stacks the courts to reflect a political \n     agenda. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, all could be \n     gone, wiped out by a partisan court, beholden to one man: the \n     President.\n       The threat of the so-called ``nuclear option'' puts us on a \n     dangerous course. Yet, incredibly, today we stand right on \n     the brink, maybe only days away, from destroying the checks \n     and balances of our Constitution. What has happened to the \n     quality of leadership in this country that would allow us to \n     even consider provoking a Constitutional crisis of such major \n     proportions? Where is the gentle art of compromise? Edmund \n     Burke said, ``All government--indeed, every human benefit and \n     enjoyment, every virtue and every prudent act--is founded on \n     compromise and barter.'' As I have said earlier, the nuclear \n     option has been around for years. It could have been employed \n     at anytime. Yet, no leader of either party chose to go down \n     that path because the consequences are so dire. Why have we \n     arrived at such a dangerous impasse?\n       Reaction to recent decisions handed down by Federal Courts \n     has fueled the drive toward this act of self destruction. \n     Many citizens, religious people, angered by a feeling of \n     years of exclusion from our political process, are deeply \n     frustrated. I am in sympathy with such feelings. I do not \n     agree with many of the decisions which have come from the \n     courts concerning prayer in school, and prohibitions on the \n     public display of religious items. For example, relating to \n     freedom of religion, Article I states: ``Congress shall make \n     no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \n     prohibiting the free exercise thereof; . . .'' In my opinion, \n     the courts have not given equal weight to both of these \n     clauses but have stressed the first clause while not giving \n     enough weight to the second clause ``or prohibiting the free \n     exercise thereof;. . . .'' I have always believed that this \n     country was founded by men and women of strong faith, and \n     that their intent was not to suppress religion in the life of \n     our nation, but to ensure that the government favored no one \n     religion over another. I understand the extreme anger of many \n     good people who decry the nature of our popular culture, with \n     its overt emphasis on sex, violence, profanity, and \n     materialism. They have every right to seek some sort of \n     remedy. But these frustrations, as great as they are, must \n     not be allowed to destroy crucial institutional mechanisms \n     which protect minority rights, and curb the power of an \n     overreaching President. Yet, that is exactly what is about to \n     happen, with this very misdirected attack on the filibuster.\n       The outlook for compromise is dim. The debate has reached a \n     fever pitch and political polarization is at levels I have \n     never seen. Democrats have overreached. Republicans have \n     overreacted. And the White House has poured salt in the wound \n     by sending the same contentious nominations right back to the \n     Senate as if there were not a country full of qualified and \n     talented judges from which to choose. Our two great political \n     parties are not having a national debate. We are simply \n     shouting at each other. I have heard statements of late which \n     cause me to shudder--such things as, ``Democrats hate \n     America,'' or ``Democrats hate people of faith,'' or \n     ``Republicans want to eliminate separation of Church and \n     State.'' Thinking Americans would ordinarily shun such \n     extreme and ridiculous rhetoric. Yet, vituperation and \n     extremism continue to rage on all sides. There have even been \n     overt attempts to physically threaten and intimidate Federal \n     judges. When the nation becomes this divided, when the spin \n     becomes this mean, the destruction of basic principles which \n     have been our guide for more than two centuries looms \n     straight ahead. Moreover, the trashing and trampling of \n     comity leaves ugly scars sure to fester and linger. How can \n     we recover from the venom spewed by this dangerous political \n     ploy and get on with the people's business, especially if the \n     nuclear trigger is actually pulled?\n       At such times as these, the character of the leaders of \n     this country is sorely tested. Our best leaders search for \n     ways to avert such crises, not ways to accelerate the plunge \n     toward the brink. Overheated partisan rhetoric is always \n     available, although these days it seems to come especially \n     cheap, but the great majority of our people want a healthy \n     two-party system and leaders who know how to work together, \n     despite serious differences.\n       The current uproar serves only to underscore the mounting \n     number of problems not being addressed by this government. \n     Over forty five million persons in our country, some 15% of \n     our population cannot afford health care insurance. Our \n     infant mortality rate is the second highest of the major \n     industrialized countries of the world. Our deficits are \n     skyrocketing. Poverty in these United States is rising, with \n     34 million people or 12.4% of the population living below the \n     poverty line. Our veterans lack adequate medical care after \n     they have risked life and limb for all of us. Our \n     education system produces 8th graders ranked 19th out of38 \n     countries in the world in math, and 12th graders ranked \n     19th out of 21 countries in both math and science. Yet, we \n     debate and seek solutions to none of these critical \n     problems, and instead focus all energy on the frenzy over \n     the selection of judges, and seek as an antidote to our \n     frustration, the preposterous solution of permanently \n     crippling freedom of speech and debate and the right of a \n     minority to dissent in the United States Senate.\n       It is very important to remember that the Senate has \n     formalized ways of considering changes to our rules. Changes \n     require 67 votes to curtail a filibuster of rules changes. If \n     this nuclear option is employed in the way most frequently \n     discussed, i.e. a ruling from the chair that a supermajority \n     requirement for cloture on a filibuster in respect to \n     amending the rules is unconstitutional, if sustained by 51 \n     votes, cloture will require only a simple majority vote with \n     respect to federal judgeships. There is nothing, then, except \n     good sense, which seems to be in very short supply, to \n     prevent majority cloture of any filibuster on any measure or \n     matter, whether on the legislative or the executive calendar. \n     Think of that! Rules going back for over 200 years and \n     beyond, with roots in the early British Parliament, can be \n     swept away by a simple majority vote. Because of demagoguery, \n     lack of leadership, raw ambition, hysteria, and a state of \n     brutal political warfare that wants no truce and brooks no \n     peacemakers, we may destroy the U.S. Senate, leaving in our \n     wake a President able to select and intimidate the courts \n     like a King, and a system of government finally and \n     irretrievably lost in a last pathetic footnote to Ben \n     Franklin's rejoinder for the ages, ``a Republic, if you can \n     keep it.'' This is scary!\n       I suspect that at least part of what all of this dangerous \n     sound and fury is about can be explained by the advanced ages \n     of several Supreme Court Justices, and rumors of the Chief \n     Justice's coming retirement due to ill health. The White \n     House does not want a filibuster in the Senate to derail a \n     future choice for the Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\n       Let me step into the brink and propose something that might \n     calm some waters. In the 105th Congress, Senator Arlen \n     Specter and I introduced S. Res. 146, a bill which would \n     establish an advisory role for the Senate in the selection of \n     Supreme Court Justices. Except for a very limited \n     ``floating'' of names shortly before the President sends up a \n     nomination for the Supreme Court, no one gets to weigh in on \n     the choices until after they are made. As in so many \n     instances in Washington, broad consultation is nonexistent. \n     In the case of potential occupants for the Federal Bench, \n     that is a recipe for instant polarization before hearings on \n     nominees are even held. Everyone quickly takes sides, and the \n     steam mounts like in an overheated pressure cooker until the \n     lid is about to blow off.\n       Therein lies the source of some of the fighting over the \n     make-up of the Courts--no prior consultation, so, in effect, \n     no ``advice'' independent of the White House. Our bill aims \n     to release some of that steam in this way. The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee would establish a pool of possible \n     Supreme Court nominees for the President to consider, based \n     on suggestions from Federal and State judges, distinguished \n     lawyers, law professors, and others with a similar level of \n     insight into the suitability of individuals for appointment \n     to the Supreme Court.\n       Such a pool would fulfill the Senate's ``advice'' function \n     under Article II, Section 2. In other words, everyone could \n     get their ``oar'' into the prospective judicial waters. The \n     President would of course be free to ignore the pool if he \n     chose to do so. But, the ``advice'' required by the \n     Constitution would be formally available, and the President \n     would know that the individuals in the pool had received a \n     bipartisan nod from the Senate Committee required to do the \n     vetting. Such a pool might even be expanded to include all \n     nominees for our federal judiciary.\n       Perhaps letting the Senate in on the judicial ``take off'' \n     as well as the landing can help in the future to heal some of \n     the anger which dominates the discussion of the Federal \n     Courts these days.\n       But for now, like many of you, I simply hope and pray that \n     cooler heads will prevail, and compromise (that fading art) \n     will prevent us from heading over the cliff. There are, at \n     least some efforts in that direction, but time is very short. \n     In just a few days we may see the unbelievable come to pass--\n     one man, the President, able to select the third, unelected \n     branch of government, including the court of last resort, the \n     Supreme Court; the Senate of the United States relegated to a \n     second House of Representatives with six year terms; free \n     speech and unfettered debate rejected; and the Constitutional \n     checks and balances in sad and sorry tatters. Shame! What a \n     shame!\n       In closing, let us remember the words spoken by Vice \n     President Aaron Burr in 1805 when he addressed the Senate for \n     the last time:\n       This House is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, and \n     of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted \n     refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the \n     storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of \n     corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to \n     perish by the sacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the \n     usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be \n     witnessed on this floor.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, the clock is running and the hour of \n     fulfillment of Vice President Burr's prophesy is virtually at \n     hand.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent we be extended an extra 15 \nminutes, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          judicial nominations\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator from Delaware a few minutes ago claimed we \nhave never changed our procedures by majority vote. Four times the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia led this body to do exactly \nthat when he was acting as majority leader--in 1977, 1979, 1980, and \n1987. Using a ruling from the Chair and a majority of all the Senate, a \nsimple majority, we changed procedure relating to both legislation and \nnominations. The record has to be made clear.\n  All we are asking is the 214-year tradition of the Senate that \njudicial nominees not be filibustered be followed. That has been the \ntradition of the Senate up until President Bush became President. All \nwe are asking is that every one of these qualified nominees who have \nreached the floor receive an up-or-down vote. That is all we are \nasking.\n  These are highly qualified nominees. The ABA has ruled they are \nqualified in every case. They all have a majority bipartisan vote in \ntheir favor. If our colleagues on the other side do not want to vote \nfor them, they can vote against them. That will be their right. I would \nfight always to maintain that right. But give them a vote, vote up or \ndown. That is what we have always done for 214 years before this \nPresident became President.\n  The actions of our colleagues on the other side amount to changing \nthat 214-year traditional history of this Senate.\n  By the way, we never called this the nuclear option. It was called \nthe nuclear option by the Democrats. We called it the constitutional \noption because the Constitution says the President has the right to \nappoint and nominate these people for judicial positions. We have the \nright to advise and--it is sometimes left off in this body--consent, \nwhich means a vote up and down.\n  That is what I think our colleagues ignore. This is a dangerous \nthing. I call it the constitutional option, or I call it the Byrd \noption because our distinguished friend, the Senator from West \nVirginia, is the one who used this four times.\n  If politics is a medicine, an effective prescription gives an \naccurate diagnosis. I take a step back and offer a diagnosis of our \ncurrent struggle over how to conduct the judicial confirmation process. \nI hope this will bring a few pieces together, connect some dots, and \nprovide a little perspective.\n  The first principle is every judicial nomination reaching the Senate \ndeserves an up-or-down vote.\n  This principle has constitutional roots, historical precedent, and \ncitizen support. I begin with the Constitution because that is where we \nshould always begin. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. \nAlong with the Declaration of Independence, it is one of the \nfoundational organic laws of the United States. It is the charter that \neach of us, as Senators, swears an oath before God to preserve, \nprotect, and defend.\n  That Constitution separates the three branches of Government, \nassigning legislation to us in the legislative branch, and assigning \nappointments to the President in the executive branch. We have heard \nthat the Constitutional Convention considered other arrangements for \nappointing judges. That may be, but the Constitutional Convention \nrejected those arrangements. Rejected ideas do not govern us. The \nConstitution does. And the Constitution makes the President, in \nAlexander Hamilton's words, the ``principal agent'' in appointments, \nwhile the Senate is a check on that power.\n  Giving judicial nominations reaching the floor an up-or-down vote, \nthat is, exercising our role of advice and consent through voting on \nnominations, helps us resist the temptation of turning our check on the \nPresident's power into a force that can destroy the President's power \nand upset the Constitution's balance.\n  Historically, we have followed this standard of everybody who reaches \nthe floor getting an up-or-down vote. When Republicans ran the Senate \nunder President Clinton, we gave each of his judicial nominations \nreaching the floor a final confirmation decision, an up-or-down vote. \nWe took cloture votes, that is, votes to end debate, on four of the \nhundreds of nominees reaching us here. All four were confirmed. As a \nmatter of fact, we confirmed 377 judges nominated by President Clinton, \nalmost the same number as the all-time confirmation champion, and that \nwas Ronald Reagan, who got 382. But Ronald Reagan had 6 years of a \nRepublican Senate to help him. President Clinton only had 2 years of a \nDemocrat Senate to help him. Yet, with the aid of the Republicans on \nthe Judiciary Committee and in this body, he got 377 approved.\n  In fact, even on the most controversial appeals court nominations by \nPresident Clinton, the Republican leadership used cloture votes to \nprevent filibusters and ensure up-or-down votes, exactly the opposite \nof how cloture votes are being used during President Bush's Presidency.\n  This principle that every judicial nomination reaching the Senate \nfloor deserves an up-or-down vote not only has constitutional roots and \nhistorical precedent, it also has citizen support. I saw in the \nWashington Post yesterday a poll framed in partisan terms, asking \nwhether Senate rules should be changed ``to make it easier for the \nRepublicans to confirm Bush's judicial nominees.''\n  With all due respect, this question could easily have been written in \nthe Democrats' new public relations war room. I am actually surprised \nthat such a biased question did not get even more than 66-percent \nsupport.\n  A more balanced, neutral, fair poll was released yesterday, asking \nwhether\n\n[[Page S4367]]\n\nSenate procedures should make sure that the full Senate votes up or \ndown on every judicial nomination of any President. The results, not \nsurprisingly, were exactly the opposite of the biased poll, with 64 \npercent of Americans, including 59 percent of moderates and almost half \nof all liberals, embracing this commonsense, fair, and traditional \nstandard.\n  The second aspect of this diagnosis is that the judicial nominees \nbeing denied this traditional up-or-down vote are highly qualified men \nand women, with majority, bipartisan support.\n  Last week, I addressed how opponents of President Bush's nominees \nplay games with words such as ``extremist.'' Just as they want to talk \nabout a judicial appointment process the Constitution did not \nestablish, these critics want to talk about everything but what these \nnominees would do on the bench. We know, from abundant testimony by \nthose who know these nominees best, that no matter how provocative \ntheir speeches off the bench or strongly held beliefs in their hearts \nand minds, these nominees are or would be fair, impartial, and \nevenhanded on the bench.\n  Yet they are called extremists. All 10 of them--there are only 7 \nremaining--but all 10 of them had qualified ratings, and most well \nqualified, the highest rating of the American Bar Association. By the \nway, that was considered the ``gold standard'' during the Clinton years \nby our friends on the other side.\n  Now this is the real standard.\n  It is hard to believe we are actually arguing about whether we should \nvote on judicial nominations and whether highly qualified nominees, \nwith majority support--bipartisan, majority support--should be \nconfirmed. Yet the third part of this diagnosis is that Senate \nDemocrats are trying to change our tradition of giving judicial \nnominations reaching the Senate floor an up-or-down vote. Senators, of \ncourse, are free to vote against them for any reason. We must, of \ncourse, have a full and vigorous debate about these nominees and their \nqualifications.\n\n  The critics, however, do not want to have that debate. Democrats in \nthis body and the leftwing interest groups that, to a certain extent, \nseem to control them, want only to seize what they cannot win through \nthe fair, traditional system. Beginning in the 108th Congress, for the \nfirst time in American history, they are now using the filibuster not \nto debate but to defeat majority-supported judicial nominations.\n  They are trying to rig the confirmation process, to pry us away from \nour tradition that respected the separation of powers, and force us \ninto a brave, new world which turns the judicial appointment process \ninside out. They want to turn our check on the President's appointment \npower into a force that hijacks that power altogether. That would be \nserious and constitutionally suspect if a Senate majority did it. It is \neven more serious when, as we see today, a minority of Senators--all \npartisan Senators--tries to capture the process.\n  For 2 years now, we have heard claims that these filibusters are \nnothing new, that they have been part and parcel of how the Senate has \nlong done its confirmation business. While some questions in this \ndebate may be subjective and complex, this is not one of them. The \ncurrent filibusters target bipartisan, majority-supported judicial \nnominations, and they defeat them by preventing confirmation votes. \nEither that happened before the 108th Congress or it did not.\n  Let us look at what our Democratic colleagues have claimed. On March \n11, 2003, the distinguished Senator from Vermont displayed here on the \nSenate floor a chart titled: ``Republican Filibusters of Nominees.'' He \nsaid his list proved that Republicans have ``succeeded in blocking many \nnominees by cloture votes.'' Anyone can look it up for him or herself. \nThe whole chart is right there on page S3442 of the Congressional \nRecord.\n  It turns out only 6 of the 19 names on the chart were judicial \nnominations, that the Senate actually confirmed 5 of those 6, and the \nother one did not have majority support. And there was a real question \nwhether that was a filibuster raised, not in the least sense by the \nperson who conducted the debate on the Republican side, Senator Robert \nGriffin, who had an impeccably honest--and still does--an impeccably \nhonest reputation. He said there was never a desire to filibuster \nJustice Fortas. He said they wanted 2 more days of debate to make their \ncase. But, he said, they had enough votes to defeat him up and down. \nNow, he was here on the Senate floor. He knew it. He led the fight. And \nthe votes were bipartisan, almost equal. It turns out, again, that only \n6 of the 19 names on the chart were judicial nominations, that the \nSenate actually confirmed 5 of them, and the only one they did not was \nJustice Fortas, because Lyndon Johnson pulled him, not wanting to be \nembarrassed.\n  Far from justifying today's filibusters, the chart of the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont proved no precedent exists at all.\n  On November 12, 2003, the Senator from Vermont tried again, this time \nwith a list of what he claimed were Clinton appeals court nominees \nsupposedly blocked by Republicans. Once again, the list included \nnominations the Senate confirmed--every one of them. How can a \nconfirmed nomination be called a blocked nomination? It cannot. Not a \nsingle nomination on Senator Leahy's list is similar to the nominations \nbeing filibustered today.\n  That same day, November 12, 2003, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, named 5 judicial nominations which he said had \nbeen filibustered. Once again, not one of them is a precedent for \nfilibusters happening today. You would think no one with a straight \nface would claim that ending debate and confirming nominations is \nsomehow precedent for not ending debate and refusing to confirm \nnominations.\n  On April 15, 2005, the distinguished assistant minority leader, \nSenator Durbin, expanded his previous list, now offering us 12 examples \nof what he said were judicial nominations requiring at least 60 votes \nfor cloture to end a filibuster. I addressed this in more detail last \nweek. Not one--not one--of those 12 of Senator Durbin's supposed \nprecedents is any precedent at all.\n  The first nomination on his list occurred in 1881, 36 years before we \neven had a cloture rule in the Senate. In fact, if we truly did what he \napparently wants us to do, and treated his listed examples as a \nconfirmation guide, we would vigorously debate judicial nominations, \ninvoke cloture if we needed to, and then vote on the confirmations. \nThat is what happened.\n  This game continued as recently as 2 months ago. On Monday, April 25, \non CNN's ``Crossfire'' program, the leader of a prominent leftwing \ngroup claimed that more than 30 nominations--here is the list--had been \nfilibustered. I have this list right here in my right hand. It is \ntitled: ``Filibusters of Nominations.'' It lists 13 judicial \nnominations out of the 30, and not one of them is at all like the \nfilibusters being conducted today--not one. We did not even take a \ncloture vote on two of them. We invoked cloture on eight of them. We \nconfirmed 12 of the 13. And the one we did not, did not have majority \nsupport, the Fortas nomination, but had bipartisan opposition.\n  Accepting such fraudulent arguments requires believing that ending \ndebate on judicial nominations is the same as not ending debate, that \nconfirming judicial nominations is the same as not confirming them, and \nthat judicial nominations without majority support are the same as \nthose with majority support. As you can see, the liberal propaganda \nmachine has been working overtime.\n  In addition to these bizarre claims I described, they worked to turn \nwhat was once common sense and accepted fairness into something that \nsounds sinister and unseemly. They manufacture nasty phrases such as \n``court packing'' and ominous warnings about ``one-party rule.'' Now, \nwe are told, preventing up-or-down votes on even majority-supported \njudicial nominations is the only way to prevent our entire \nconstitutional order from imploding. The sky is falling, and we are all \nabout to slide into the abyss.\n  The purveyors of this fantasy would have us look to President \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt who, they tell us, wanted to pack the Supreme \nCourt. The Senate rejected his legislative proposal to expand the Court \nso he could appoint more Justices. By taking this stand, the \nstorytellers say, the Senate kept one-party rule from packing the \nCourt.\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\n  Well, as Paul Harvey might say: Here is the rest of the story.\n  The Senate, even though dominated by President Roosevelt's own party, \ndid not support this legislative plan. And it turns out President \nRoosevelt did not need any legislative innovations to pack the Supreme \nCourt. He packed it all right, doing it the old-fashioned way, by \nappointing eight out of nine Justices in 6 years. Mind you, during the \n75th to the 77th Congress, Democrats outnumbered Republicans by an \naverage of 70 to 20. Now, that is one-party rule.\n  In those years, from 1937 to 1943, our cloture rule applied only to \nbills. This meant that ending debate on other things, such as \nnominations, required unanimous consent. A single Senator in that tiny, \nbeleaguered minority could conduct a filibuster of President \nRoosevelt's nominations and thwart the real court packing that was in \nfull swing.\n  Now, if the filibuster were the only thing preventing one-party rule \nfrom packing the courts, and the filibuster were so easily used, surely \nthere must be in history filibusters of President Roosevelt's Supreme \nCourt nominations. If the warnings, frantic pleas, and hysterical \nfundraising appeals we hear today make any sense at all, the filibuster \nwould certainly have been used in FDR's time.\n  I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but there were no filibusters, not \neven by a single Senator, not against a single nominee. In fact, FDR's \n8 Supreme Court nominees were confirmed in an average of 13 days, and 6 \nof the 8 were confirmed without even a rollcall vote.\n  So if this is to protect the minority, why has it not ever happened \nbefore President Bush became President? Even when we look at the very \nexamples and stories the other side uses, we see no support for using \nthe filibuster against majority-supported judicial nominations.\n  Last week, here on the Senate floor, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois repeated a selective version of this FDR story and asked what \nwould happen today in a Senate dominated by the President's party. He \nasked:\n\n       Will they rise in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt's \n     Senate?\n\n  Well, I hope we do. I hope the Senate does exactly what Franklin \nRoosevelt's Senate did, by debating and voting on the President's \njudicial nominations. Franklin Roosevelt's Senate did not use the \nfilibuster, even when the minority was much smaller and the filibuster \nmuch easier to use, and this Senate should not do so, either.\n  Finally, the fourth piece to this diagnosis of our current situation \nis that Senate Democrats have threatened to shut down the Senate if the \nmajority moves us back to the tradition--the 214-year tradition--of \ndebating and voting on judicial nominations.\n  To avoid what most Americans believe Senators come to Washington to \ndo--debate and vote--we are now threatened with a party policy of open \nobstruction, a nuclear option of shutting down the Senate, at least to \nanything but what they agree to. I said a few minutes ago that the \nConstitution's separation of powers assigns legislative business to \nCongress and executive business, including appointments, to the \nPresident. Some Senators on the other side of the aisle are saying if \nthey cannot hijack what is not theirs, they will destroy what is \ntheirs. If they cannot abandon Senate tradition and use the filibuster \nto defeat majority-supported judicial nominations, they will undercut \nand disable the legislative process. And they call us radical.\n  The Constitution gives the power of nomination and appointment to the \nPresident. The Senate provides a check on that power. I believe we must \npreserve the system of separated powers and checks and balances and \nresist those who would radically alter that system, turning the \nSenate's check on the President's power into a force that can overwhelm \nthe President's power.\n  Every judicial nomination reaching the Senate floor deserves an up-\nor-down vote. I argued that during the Clinton years, and I prevailed \nas chairman of the Judiciary Committee. That principle has \nconstitutional roots, historical precedent, and citizen support. \nPresident Bush has sent two highly qualified nominees that we know have \nbipartisan majority support. They deserve to be treated decently and, \nafter a full and vigorous debate, given an up-or-down vote.\n  Our colleagues on the other side are trying to change our tradition. \nFor the first time in more than two centuries, they want to use \nfilibusters to block confirmation votes on judicial nominations here on \nthe Senate floor. This radical innovation is not needed to prevent one-\nparty rule from packing the courts. Republicans resisted using the \nfilibuster under Roosevelt and Democrats should resist using it today.\n  Finally, all Americans should be most concerned with the threat of \nsome of our colleagues on the other side. Because they are unable to \nseize control of a judicial appointment process that does not belong to \nthe Senate, Democrats say they will shut down the legislative process \nthat does belong to the Senate. This cannot stand. With all due \nrespect, they need to get both their principles and their priorities in \norder.\n  Our former majority leader Bob Dole has a thoughtful column in \ntoday's New York Times also addressing Senate tradition and the \nprospect of returning to that tradition. No one loves this institution \nmore than Senator Dole, and I think I am in that category, too.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 27, 2005]\n\n                            Up, Down or Out\n\n                         (By Senator Bob Dole)\n\n       In the coming weeks, we may witness a vote in the United \n     States Senate that will define the 109th Congress for the \n     ages. This vote will not be about war and peace, the economy \n     or the threat from terrorism. It will focus instead on \n     procedure: whether the Senate should amend its own rules to \n     ensure that nominees to the federal bench can be confirmed by \n     a simple majority vote.\n       I have publicly urged caution in this matter. Amending the \n     Senate rules over the objection of a substantial minority \n     should be the option of last resort. I still hold out hope \n     that the two Senate leaders will find a way to ensure that \n     senators have the opportunity to fulfill their constitutional \n     duty to offer ``advice and consent'' on the president's \n     judicial nominees while protecting minority rights. Time has \n     not yet run out.\n       But let's be honest: By creating a new threshold for the \n     confirmation of judicial nominees, the Democratic minority \n     has abandoned the tradition of mutual self-restraint that has \n     long allowed the Senate to function as an institution.\n       This tradition has a bipartisan pedigree. When I was the \n     Senate Republican leader, President Bill Clinton nominated \n     two judges to the federal bench--H. Lee Sarokin and Rosemary \n     Barkett--whose records, especially in criminal law, were \n     particularly troubling to me and my Republican colleagues. \n     Despite my misgivings, both received an up-or-down vote on \n     the Senate floor and were confirmed. In fact, joined by 32 \n     other Republicans, I voted to end debate on the nomination of \n     Judge Sarokin. Then, in the very next roll call, I exercised \n     my constitutional duty to offer ``advice and consent'' by \n     voting against his nomination.\n       When I was a leader in the Senate, a judicial filibuster \n     was not part of my procedural playbook. Asking a senator to \n     filibuster a judicial nomination was considered an abrogation \n     of some 200 years of Senate tradition.\n       To be fair, the Democrats have previously refrained from \n     resorting to the filibuster even when confronted with \n     controversial judicial nominees like Robert Bork and Clarence \n     Thomas. Although these men were treated poorly, they were at \n     least given the courtesy of an up-or-down vote on the Senate \n     floor. At the time, filibustering their nominations was not \n     considered a legitimate option by my Democratic colleagues--\n     if it had been, Justice Thomas might not be on the Supreme \n     Court today, since his nomination was approved with only 52 \n     votes, eight short of the 60 votes needed to close debate.\n       That's why the current obstruction effort of the Democratic \n     leadership is so extraordinary. President Bush has the lowest \n     appellate-court confirmation rate of any modern president. \n     Each of the 10 filibuster victims has been rated \n     ``qualified'' or ``well qualified'' by the American Bar \n     Association. Each has the support of a majority in the \n     Senate. And each would now be serving on the federal bench if \n     his or her nomination were subject to the traditional \n     majority-vote standard.\n       This 60-vote standard for judicial nominees has the effect \n     of arrogating power from the president to the Senate. Future \n     presidents must now ask themselves whether their judicial \n     nominees can secure the supermajority needed to break a \n     potential filibuster. Political considerations will now \n     become even more central to the judicial selection process. \n     Is this what the framers intended?\n       If the majority leader, Bill Frist, is unable to persuade \n     the Democratic leadership to end its obstruction, he may move \n     to change the Senate rules through majority vote. By\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\n     doing so, he will be acting in accordance with Article I of \n     the Constitution (which gives Congress the power to set its \n     own rules) and consistently with the tradition of altering \n     these rules by establishing new precedents. Senator Frist was \n     right this past weekend when he observed there is nothing \n     ``radical'' about a procedural technique that gives senators \n     the opportunity to vote on a nominee.\n       Although the Democrats don't like to admit it, in the past \n     they have voted to end delaying tactics previously allowed \n     under Senate rules or precedents. In fact, one of today's \n     leading opponents of changing the Senate's rules, Senator \n     Robert Byrd, was once a proponent of doing so, and on several \n     occasions altered Senate rules through majoritarian means. I \n     have great respect for Senator Byrd, but Senate Republicans \n     are simply exploring the procedural road map that he himself \n     helped create.\n       In the coming days, I hope changing the Senate's rules \n     won't be necessary, but Senator Frist will be fully justified \n     in doing so if he believes he has exhausted every effort at \n     compromise. Of course, there is an easier solution to the \n     impasse: Democrats can stop playing their obstruction game \n     and let President Bush's judicial nominees receive what they \n     are entitled to: an up-or-down vote on the floor of the \n     world's greatest deliberative body.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. As our current majority leader Bill Frist put it a few \ndays ago: I never thought it was a radical thing to ask Senators to \nvote. That is what we have traditionally done on judicial nominations \nthat reach the floor, and that traditional standard should apply across \nthe board no matter which party controls the White House and no matter \nwhich party controls the Senate. We should bind both parties, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to do what is right.\n  That is the diagnosis, and I hope we see an effective cure soon so we \ncan get back to doing the people's business.\n  I started off by saying one of the problems here is that every one of \nthese Presidential nominees who reaches the floor should have an up-or-\ndown vote, especially since they are listed as qualified by the \nAmerican Bar Association, most of them well qualified, the highest \nrating you can have. They all have majority bipartisan support. We \nshould not change 214 years of Senate tradition because some in this \nbody don't like President Bush's nominees.\n  People such as Priscilla Owen--she broke through the glass ceiling \nfor women in this country and became a major partner in a major law \nfirm. Her last election to the Texas Supreme Court was over 75 percent. \nShe had every editorial board in the State of Texas supporting her; 15 \nformer State bar presidents supported her, most of whom were Democrats. \nYet they have called her an extremist.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, a sharecropper's daughter, came up the hard way, \nput herself through college and law school as a single mother, worked \nin California State government in a variety of positions, wound up on \nthe California Supreme Court where she wrote, at least in the last \nnumber of years, the majority of the majority opinions. She got \nreelected by 84 percent of the California voters, more votes than any \nother person running for the Supreme Court that year, including her \ncolleagues. Yet she is called an extremist because she is a \nconservative African American.\n  It is very dangerous stuff to say this will create nuclear war \nbecause we want to continue 214 years of Senate tradition. That is \ndangerous stuff. It is the wrong stuff. We ought to give these people a \nsimple, straightforward up-or-down vote.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from North Carolina is waiting. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield briefly for a \nunanimous consent request, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenator from North Carolina has completed her remarks, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, today I want to express my strong concern \nover the judicial nominations process. It is clear this process has \ncompletely broken down. Unfortunately, the rhetoric surrounding this \nimportant issue has become increasingly bitter over the past several \nweeks. Sharp words have been exchanged. The intentions of my fellow \nRepublicans have been unfairly characterized and my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have even gone so far as to threaten to shut \ndown the Government if the Senate were to exercise its constitutional \nright to set its own procedural rules. That is nuclear.\n  It is time to put aside the rhetoric for a moment and look at the \nfacts. It is a fact that my Democratic colleagues have taken the \nunprecedented step of blocking not 1, not 2, but 10 nominees of \nPresident Bush to the Federal circuit courts of appeal. As a result, \nPresident Bush has the lowest appeals court confirmation rate for any \nfirst-term President since Franklin Roosevelt. It is a fact that each \nof these filibustered nominees has the support of a majority of \nSenators and each has received a rating of qualified or well qualified \nby the American Bar Association. It is a fact that today for the first \ntime in our Nation's history, a President's nominees to the Federal \nbench are being required to receive a 60-vote supermajority rather than \nthe traditional majority, the up-or-down vote, that has been the \nstandard for 214 years. That is nuclear.\n  It is a fact that the ongoing filibuster of the President's nominees \nhas prevented the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional duty to \nprovide advice and consent to the appointment of men and women chosen \nto sit on our Nation's highest courts.\n  The former minority leader from South Dakota once lamented he found \nit simply baffling that a Senator would vote against even voting on a \njudicial nomination. I completely agree and note that every single one \nof President Clinton's judicial nominees who reached the Senate floor \nreceived an up-or-down vote. And contrary to what my friends across the \naisle are so fond of saying, this includes the Paez and Berzon \nnominations to the Ninth Circuit.\n  By imposing a supermajority requirement for judicial nominees, the \nDemocrats are disrupting the careful balance struck in the Constitution \nitself between Congress and the executive branch and allowing political \nconsiderations to play an even larger role in the confirmation process. \nThey should heed the words of prominent Democratic legal advisor \nProfessor Michael Gerhardt who, in another context, has written that a \nsupermajority requirement for confirming judges would be ``problematic \nbecause it creates a presumption against confirmation, shifts the \nbalance of power to the Senate, and enhances the power of special \ninterests.''\n  For the last several weeks, instead of engaging in the hard work of \ncompromise, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nchosen to travel down the political road. We have seen pro-filibuster \npress conferences, other political events, and even an obstruction \nrally with the extreme liberal group MoveOn.Org. Liberal special \ninterest groups are now spending millions of dollars across the country \non television ads in support of judicial filibusters. One cannot help \nbut reach the conclusion that these organizations, having failed to \ndefeat President Bush at the ballot box in November, are now trying to \nadvance their own liberal agenda through the only avenue left open to \nthem--the Federal courts.\n  The judicial filibuster is their way of establishing a liberal litmus \ntest. If you are not a liberal activist, you cannot serve on a Federal \ncircuit court of appeals, or at least that is what the new standard \nappears to be.\n  Until now every judicial nominee with support from a majority of \nSenators was confirmed. The majority vote standard was used \nconsistently throughout the 18th, 19th, and the 20th century for every \nPresident's nominees, Democrat or Republican, even Whig, until George \nW. Bush's judicial nominations were subjected to a 60-vote standard.\n  Let me emphasize one additional point. My friends across the aisle \nare well aware that no Republican--not one--is seeking to eliminate the \nability of Senators to filibuster on legislative matters. We all \nrecognize that the legislative filibuster has served an important \nfunction in our system of checks and balances. It is ironic, though, \nthat nine of my Senate colleagues who are now working so hard to block \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees once advocated the elimination of \nthe legislative filibuster. So who is playing politics?\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\n  I commend Majority Leader Frist for his patience in trying to bring \nboth sides together to develop a reasonable compromise on this \ndifficult issue. Certainly no other majority leader has been faced with \nsuch unprecedented tactics in blocking the Senate's ability to fulfill \nits constitutional duty to provide advice and consent. I know Senator \nFrist will continue to do what he feels is right for this body and for \nour country.\n  If he decides he is confronted with no other choice but to proceed \nwith the constitutional option, I will fully support him. This approach \nis consistent with Senate precedent and has been employed in the past \nby some of the best parliamentary minds in this Chamber.\n  Our goal is to restore the practice, the tradition of 214 years, a \nsimple majority vote for a President's nominees to the Federal bench.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4370-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this is the third day we have been on a \nbill we have been working on for 2\\1/2\\ years. It is the same bill \nessentially that was passed last year by a margin of 76 to 21. We are \nanxious to get people to come down to the floor for amendments. I don't \nknow of anyone coming down at this time. But I encourage all Members on \nboth sides of the aisle to come down and utilize this time so we can \nget the amendments behind us.\n  I understand the Senator from Illinois has some comments he wishes to \nmake. I yield to him some of our time at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the committee. \nLet me say I share his sense of urgency about the underlying bill. This \nis a bipartisan bill, a bill Democrats and Republicans want to see \npassed, a bill to finance the building of roads and bridges and \nairports, to finance mass transit in what is critical infrastructure \nfor America's economy. I do not have an amendment to the bill, but if I \ndid, I would offer it because I think those who have them should bring \nthem to the floor so we can move and get it done before we take a \nrecess next week. I urge my colleagues on the Democratic side to follow \nthe admonition of the chairman.\n  What brings me to the floor was a statement made earlier by the \nSenator from Utah which made reference to me. Senator Orrin Hatch and I \nare friends. We disagree on a lot of things.\n  We vote differently on a lot of issues and we debate furiously, but \nwe get along fine. I think that is what life should be like and what \nthe legislative process should be like. He made a reference earlier to \nthis whole question of the nuclear option, to which I would like to \nreturn for a few moments.\n  First, what is the nuclear option? People who don't follow the Senate \non a regular basis have to wonder are they using nuclear weapons on the \nfloor of the Senate? What could it be? ``Nuclear Option'' was a phrase \ncreated by Republican Senator Trent Lott to describe a procedure that \nmight be used to change the rules of the Senate. The reason Senator \nLott called it the nuclear option was because it is devastating in its \nimpact to the tradition and rules of the Senate.\n  I will put it into context. The Senate was created to give the \nminority in the Senate, as well as in the United States, a voice. There \nare two Senators from every State, large and small. Two Senators from \nthe smallest State have the same vote on the floor of the Senate as \nSenators from larger States, such as California, New York, Illinois, \nand Texas. That is the nature of the Senate. The rules of the Senate \nback that up. The rules of the Senate from the beginning said if any \nSenator stood up and objected, started a filibuster, the Senate would \ncome to a stop. You think to yourself, how can you run a Senate if any \nSenator can stop the train? Well, it forces you, if you are going to \nmove something forward in the Senate, to reach across the aisle to your \ncolleagues, to compromise, to find bipartisanship, so that things move \nthrough in a regular way and in a bipartisan way. That is the nature of \nthe filibuster.\n  Over the years, it has changed. You saw the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington,'' when Jimmy Stewart stood at his desk, with his idealism \nand his youth, arguing for his cause until he collapsed on the floor. \nHe was exercising a filibuster because he believed in it so intensely. \nWe have said over the years that you can do that to any nominee, bill, \nor law on the floor of the Senate; but if a large number of Senators, \nan extraordinary number of Senators, say it is time for the filibuster \nto end, it would end. The vote today is 60 votes. So if I am perplexed \nby an amendment offered by one of my colleagues, and I stand up to \ndebate it and decide I am going to hold the floor of the Senate as long \nas my voice and body can hold out, I can do that, until such point as \n60 colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, come together and say: \nEnough, we want to move to a vote. That is what it is all about.\n  So what has happened is the Republicans now control the House, \nSenate, and the White House. What they have said is they want to change \nthe rules. They want to change the rules in the middle of the game \nbecause they don't like the fact that Democratic Senators have used the \nfilibuster to stop 10 judicial nominees President Bush has sent to \nCongress, sent to the Senate.\n  Now, for the record, the President sent 215 nominees; 205 were \napproved and only 10 were not. Over 95 percent of the President's \njudicial nominees have gone through. We have the lowest vacancy rate on \nthe Federal bench in modern memory. So we don't have outrageous \nvacancies that need to be filled quickly. We decided--those of us who \nvoted for the filibusters--that these 10 nominees went way too far; \ntheir political views were inconsistent with the mainstream of America. \nThey were not consistent with the feelings and values of families \nacross the country on issues as diverse as the role of the Federal \nGovernment in protecting health and safety, which is an issue nominee \nJanice Rogers Brown takes a position on that is hard to believe. She \nhas taken a position on a case--a famous case called the Lockner case--\nwhich would basically take away the power of the Federal Government to \nregulate areas of health and safety when it comes to consumers and the \nenvironment. It is a radical position.\n  And then another nominee, William Myers--my concern about him and the \nconcern of many Senators is the fact that he has taken a radical \nposition when it comes to our Nation's treasury and heritage, our \nnatural and public lands. He has taken a position where he backs \ncertain lobby groups, but there is one that we think is inconsistent \nwith mainstream thinking in America. So there is an objection.\n  Other nominees have taken what we consider to be far-out positions \nthat don't reflect the mainstream of America and we have objected, \nwhich is our right. Now the President says: Enough, I am tired of \nlosing any nominee to the Senate. Don't we have 55 Republicans? Should \nwe not get what we want?\n  He is not the first President who has felt that way. Thomas Jefferson \nfelt that way. Thomas Jefferson, in the beginning of his second term, \ncame to the Senate and said: I am sick and tired of the judges who have \nbeen appointed to the Supreme Court. I want to start impeaching them.\n  You know what Jefferson's party said? No, Mr. President, you are \nwrong. The Constitution is more important than your Presidential power. \nThey said no to Thomas Jefferson.\n\n  Franklin Roosevelt did the same thing at the beginning of his second \nterm. He was unhappy that his New Deal legislation was being rejected. \nHe\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\ncame to the Senate and said: Let's change this and make sure we can put \nmore Justices on the Supreme Court and get the votes we want.\n  His Democratic Party in the Senate said: No, Mr. President, we love \nyou and we are glad you were elected, and we support your New Deal, but \nyou have gone too far. Presidential power is not more important than \nthe Constitution. They said no to him.\n  So now comes President Bush and Vice President Cheney, and they have \nsaid: We don't like the fact that we only have 95 percent of our \nnominees approved; we want them all. We want to change the rules of the \nSenate--in fact, we will break those rules to change them so that \nPresident Bush can get every single nominee. Unfortunately, very few on \nthat side of the aisle from the President's party are willing to stand \nup and say to this President, as Senators have said to President \nJefferson and President Roosevelt: You are going too far. What you are \ndoing here, sadly, is going to abuse the Constitution to build the \npower of the White House.\n  The Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, came in earlier and made a \nstatement. He said every nominee should have an up-or-down vote. On its \nface, that sounds reasonable. We understand the rules of the Senate \nallow the filibuster and an extraordinary majority for nominees. What \nSenator Hatch failed to mention was that when he was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee during the Clinton administration--those 8 years--\nover 60 Presidential nominees for the bench who were sent up by \nPresident Clinton to his committee were buried in committee without so \nmuch as a hearing. They didn't even have a chance to stand up and \ndefend themselves, explain their point of view. Senator Hatch said, no. \nOver 60 Presidential nominees for President Clinton were stopped by \nSenator Hatch on the Judiciary Committee. I know; I served on the \ncommittee. I watched it happen. I heard Senator Hatch say every nominee \nshould have an up-or-down vote. He is suffering from political amnesia. \nHe has forgotten when he was in charge, 60 nominees never even had a \nhearing, let alone an up-or-down vote.\n  So we come to this point, a point where I think the issues are very \nclear. The Republicans are prepared, with the help of Vice President \nCheney--who announced over the weekend he supports them--to break the \nrules of the Senate, which are in a book that is seldom drawn out of \nour desks. The rules of the Senate say it takes 67 votes to change the \nrules of the Senate. That is a big number, 67 out of 100. The \nRepublicans know they don't have 67 votes to change the filibuster \nrule, so they have decided to do it differently. They are going to wait \nuntil Vice President Cheney is in the chair, and they are going to make \na point of order that we should just have a simple majority vote on \njudicial nominees. And Vice President Cheney is going to rule--he \nalready said he would--and that is that. That is the end of the story.\n  So they are breaking the rules of the Senate to change the rules of \nthe Senate, to eliminate a tradition and rule that has been around for \n200 years. They are changing the rules in the middle of the game. The \nnet result of that is this: The Senate will lose power when it comes to \nchecks and balances. The President will have more power. It will mean \nthat the President--this President, unlike President Jefferson and \nPresident Roosevelt--will trump the Constitution and will basically \nsay: I am going to take more power away from the Senate. And his party \nwill go along with that, even though President Jefferson and President \nRoosevelt had members of their own party stand up and say: Mr. \nPresident, you have gone too far.\n  The net result--the one that troubles me the most--is that we are \ntalking about lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. If you take \npeople who are so far out of the mainstream and stick them on a Federal \nbench for life, let me tell you, we don't have a clue what that is \ngoing to mean. But it is certainly worrisome that they could rule and \nchange laws that we value as Americans--laws that, frankly, cross both \npolitical borders and Democrats and Republicans have supported. When \nyou put somebody on the bench with that much power for a lifetime, then \nyou have to worry about them.\n  So we have tried to come to some conclusion. Senator Reid of Nevada, \nour Democratic leader, came to the floor to describe in general terms \nwhat he has been doing. For weeks, he has been negotiating with Senator \nFrist and speaking to other Republican Senators about avoiding this \nconstitutional confrontation, avoiding a constitutional crisis, \navoiding this effort to change the rules in the middle of the game. He \nhas made an offer--a good-faith offer--to bring some of these judges \nforward, to talk about rule changes that are in the best interests of \nthis institution; and, frankly, Senator Frist said yesterday: No, we \nare not talking about it anymore. It is over.\n\n  That is unfortunate.\n  It is important that we continue a dialog. The good thing about the \nfilibuster is that it brings us together in order to move a nominee or \na bill. Republicans have to reach across the aisle to Democrats and \nDemocrats have to reach across to Republicans. That is the way it \nshould be in this Chamber. It should not be a line down the middle and \na wall that cannot be breached. That is exactly what we face if the \nRepublicans go forward with the nuclear option.\n  When I return to Illinois, they say: Senator, can we come together to \npass this highway bill Senator Inhofe is bringing to the floor? We will \nand it will be a good, bipartisan bill. We have been waiting, but let's \npass this bill on a bipartisan basis. They say: Senator, can't \nDemocrats and Republicans work together to do something about health \ninsurance? You don't even talk about it on the Senate floor. I think we \ncan. I know that business interests, as well as labor interests, want \nus to bring up this issue and resolve it. We should do it on a \nbipartisan basis. They say: Senator, can't you sit down and find a \nRepublican who wants to put more money into our schools for No Child \nLeft Behind, so that we can have better schools, better teachers, \nbetter students?\n  Of course, we should move toward bipartisanship. But the nuclear \noption, sadly, is going to divide us, split us. Make no mistake, if the \nnuclear option goes forward, this will be a different Senate and not \nvery good in the process, I am afraid. A lot will happen that will be \nbad for us. Some have said on the floor, well, certainly at that point \nthe Democrats are going to shut down the Senate and the Government. \nTrust me, that is not going to happen. We saw that tactic once. \nRemember the name Newt Gingrich and the Contract with America? He was \nso emboldened by Rush Limbaugh, he said if we shut down the Federal \nGovernment, nobody will notice. We noticed in a hurry and it hurt the \nRepublican Party when they did it. We are not going to make that \nmistake. We believe that important functions of this Government must \nmove forward. The defense of America, the support of our troops, the \npassage of critical appropriations bills, the passage of a highway \nbill--those issues are moving forward. But the ordinary day-to-day \nbusiness of the Senate, otherwise, is going to be changed a lot.\n  If the Republicans are prepared to break the rules to change the \nrules, sadly the Senate Democrats will have to say we must play by the \nrest of the rules. That means more time on the floor, more debate, \nSenators spending more time at their desks, more time in session, more \ntime in Washington. You hear the complaint that 5,000-page bills come \nbefore us that nobody reads. We will read them. Important amendments \nwill be read. Debate will take place, and instead of the Chamber almost \nalways being empty, it may be almost always full. Things will change.\n  I think there is a better way. Senator Reid has suggested a better \nway--that cooler heads prevail, that those truly interested in not only \nthe institution of the Senate but the value of the Constitution come \nforward. We can protect the filibuster. We can make certain that we do \nit in a sensible way. But we can only do it if we are in a dialog.\n  Senator Frist's comments yesterday are worrisome. At this point, I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the \nChicago Tribune. It is an editorial of April 25, which supports the \nDemocrats and opposes the nuclear option.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\n                 [From Chicago Tribune, Apr. 25, 2005]\n\n                      Democracy and the Filibuster\n\n       The most surprising thing about the Senate battle over the \n     filibuster is that a dusty 200-year-old procedure could \n     generate such fresh controversy. Republicans say Democrats \n     have abused it so badly to block judicial nominees that it \n     should be removed from their arsenal. Democrats say it is an \n     indispensable tool to prevent the president from turning the \n     federal courts over to extremist judges.\n       But the debate is really just the latest argument about the \n     central issue of our system of government: how much power the \n     majority should have.\n       There is no question that Democrats have misused the \n     leverage afforded by the filibuster. This device is supposed \n     to ensure that the Senate gets a full hearing on any \n     controversy before it votes. Facing a Republican president \n     and a Republican majority of 55 senators, however, Democrats \n     have deployed the threat of a filibuster not to delay votes \n     but to prevent them.\n       Contrary to Republican claims, though, this tactic is not \n     unprecedented, and it wasn't invented by the Democrats. \n     Republicans tried to filibuster several judges named by \n     President Clinton, even though they controlled the Senate at \n     the time.\n       Democrats were right to complain then, as Sen. Patrick \n     Leahy did in 1999: ``If we don't like somebody the president \n     nominates, vote him or her down. But don't hold them in this \n     anonymous unconscionable limbo, because in doing that, the \n     minority of senators really shame all senators.'' Republicans \n     are equally justified in objecting now.\n       But changing Senate rules to bar the use of filibusters \n     against judicial nominees, as Republican leader Bill Frist of \n     Tennessee has threatened to do, would be shortsighted and \n     ultimately unhealthy. The filibuster, whatever its potential \n     for misuse, is a vital safeguard against majority excesses. \n     As such, it buttresses a constitutional framework ingeniously \n     designed to keep the many from running roughshod over the \n     few.\n       Although Americans have great faith in democracy, a Martian \n     political scientist arriving here with no knowledge of our \n     federal framework might think its purpose was not to empower \n     the majority but to frustrate it. The Constitution contains a \n     variety of mechanisms designed to make sure that public \n     sentiment doesn't automatically get translated into policy.\n       The Bill of Rights, for instance, places certain subjects \n     off-limits. The separation of powers, dividing authority \n     among three different branches of government, serves as \n     another check on the will of the people. A president can \n     overrule the 535-member Congress and sustain a veto with as \n     few as 34 senators. The Senate itself, of course, is at odds \n     with pure democracy, because it allocates equal \n     representation to each state, regardless of population.\n       The filibuster is merely a Senate rule, not a \n     constitutional provision. But the reason it has survived for \n     so long is that it fits well into the overall structure of \n     our government.\n       Devices that obstruct the will of the majority can be an \n     awful nuisance. But in the long run, the protections they \n     offer against democratic excesses are worth the price.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Chicago Tribune, I can tell, is no \nliberal newspaper. They have a newspaper that takes conservative \npositions regularly, and they have decided that the nuclear option is \nthe wrong way to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am anxious to yield the floor to the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, who has an amendment to bring up at \nthis time. But before doing that, I have sat and listened very \ncarefully while Senator Hatch was talking about the constitutional \noption and the response from the Senator from Illinois. Sometimes you \nhave to leave the individuals and hear what is being said outside this \nChamber.\n  I have a couple editorials I am going to read at this time. The first \nis from yesterday's Investors Business Daily. Granted, that is \ngenerally a fairly conservative publication, and the next editorial I \nwill read certainly is not one that would be identified as even \nmoderate or conservative.\n  Investors Business Daily says:\n\n       Rules of order: The Democrats would have us believe \n     filibustering is a time-honored constitutional and Senate \n     tradition. It's not. And it wasn't that long ago that they \n     felt quite differently.\n       A showdown now looms after Republicans on the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee used their 10-8 majority to move the \n     nominations of Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen for \n     federal appeals court seats to the full Senate.\n       Democrats threaten to filibuster these picks, Majority \n     Leader Bill Frist threatens to employ the unfortunately named \n     ``nuclear option'' restoring the quaint notion that 51 votes \n     constitutes a majority, and Vice President Dick Cheney says \n     he's willing to be the tie-breaking vote to ban filibusters \n     of judicial nominees.\n       Democrats are trying to portray GOP efforts to restore \n     majority rule to the Senate as it relates to judicial \n     nominations as an assault on the traditions of the Senate and \n     the Constitution itself. As if the filibuster were James \n     Madison's dying wish.\n       As a practical matter, the filibuster didn't even exist \n     until the 1830s, when it was used to block legislation and \n     not judicial picks. It was used by Democrats to defend \n     slavery and oppose the Civil Rights Act--hardly noble \n     purposes.\n       In 1841, the filibuster was used by Sen. John Calhoun to \n     defend slaveholding interests. In 1957, then-Democratic Sen. \n     Strom Thurmond held the floor for 24 hours straight to block \n     civil rights legislation. And in 1964, 18 Democrats and one \n     Republican blocked the Civil Rights Act for 2\\1/2\\ months.\n       In 1916, Senator Robert La Follette, a Republican, used it \n     to block legislation to let merchant ships arm themselves \n     against German U-boats. This prompted the Senate in 1917, at \n     the behest of President Wilson, a Democrat, to adopt the \n     first cloture rule, rule XXII, requiring a two-thirds to end \n     debate.\n       This was amended 60 years later by none other than Robert \n     Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate's constitutional guardian and \n     conscience, who reduced it to a three-fifths requirement.\n       In sum: For the first 200 years of our republic, Senate \n     ``tradition'' never required 60 votes to approve judges. \n     Filibusters are neither an idea of the Founding Fathers nor a \n     historical tradition of the Senate. Cloture rules are a 20th \n     century phenomenon, with the current rule less than 30 years \n     old. Systematic filibustering of a president's appellate-\n     court nominees is totally unprecedented.\n       Democrats didn't always love the filibuster. In September \n     1999, in a debate over Clinton appellate-court nominees, Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy of Vermont thundered on the Senate floor: \n     ``Vote them up or down! That is what the Constitution speaks \n     of in our advise-and-consent capacity.'' An up-or-down vote, \n     he said then, was a ``constitutional responsibility.''\n       The year before, none other than Sen. Ted Kennedy of \n     Massachusetts solemnly intoned: ``We owe it to Americans to \n     give these (judicial) nominees a vote. If our Republican \n     colleagues don't like them, vote against them, but give them \n     a vote.''\n       In 1995, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa proposed a plan to end \n     filibusters identical to one now proposed by Frist. The \n     Harkin plan was supported by 19 Democrats, including Sens. \n     Kennedy, Barbara Boxer of California, Joseph Lieberman of \n     Connecticut, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and John Kerry of \n     Massachusetts.\n       Harkin proposed to establish a declining vote requirement \n     for cloture so that by the fourth cloture vote, a simple \n     majority of the Senate would suffice to end debate and allow \n     a floor vote on the matter at hand.\n       In the Constitution, when the Framers intended more than \n     simple majorities, they explicitly said so. For example, they \n     require a two-thirds majority to convict in an impeachment \n     trial, expel a member, override a presidential veto, approve \n     a treaty or propose a constitutional amendment.\n       Senate Democrats once opposed the filibustering of judicial \n     nominees; they now support and rail against a ``nuclear \n     option'' they once proposed themselves. Republicans should \n     expose this hypocrisy, stop worrying and learn to love the \n     bomb.\n\n  I will not read the whole editorial from the L.A. Times, from \nyesterday. I will read the first two paragraphs, in deference to my \ngood friend from Indiana.\n  They said:\n\n       These are confusing days in Washington. Born-again \n     conservative Christians who strongly want to see President \n     Bush's judicial nominees voted on are leading the charge \n     against the Senate filibuster, and liberal Democrats are \n     born-again believers in that reactionary, obstructionist \n     legislative tactic. Practically every big-name liberal \n     senator you can think of derided the filibuster a decade ago \n     but now sees the error of his or her ways and will go to \n     amusing lengths to try to convince you that the change of \n     heart is explained by something deeper than the mere \n     difference between being in the majority and being in the \n     minority.\n       At the risk of seeming dull or unfashionable for not \n     getting our own intellectual makeover, we still think \n     judicial candidates nominated by a president deserve an up-\n     or-down vote in the Senate. We hardly see eye to eye with the \n     far right on social issues, and we oppose some of these \n     judicial nominees, but we urge Republican leaders to press \n     ahead with their threat to nuke the filibuster. The so-called \n     nuclear option entails a finding by a straight majority that \n     filibusters are inappropriate in judicial confirmation \n     battles.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this entire editorial be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I will say this: It is unprecedented, \nthat for 200 years there has never been a circuit court nominee by any \nPresident who had the majority support in the Senate to be \nfilibustered. It never has happened until now.\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the LA Times, April 26, 2005]\n\n                          Nuke the Filibuster\n\n       These are confusing days in Washington. Born-again \n     conservative Christians who strongly want to see President \n     Bush's judicial nominees voted on are leading the charge \n     against the Senate filibuster, and liberal Democrats are \n     born-again believers in that reactionary, obstructionist \n     legislative tactic. Practically every big-name liberal \n     senator you can think of derided the filibuster a decade ago \n     but now sees the error of his or her ways and will go to \n     amusing lengths to try to convince you that the change of \n     heart is explained by something deeper than the mere \n     difference between being in the majority and being in the \n     minority.\n       At the risk of seeming dull or unfashionable for not \n     getting our own intellectual makeover, we still think \n     judicial candidates nominated by a president deserve an up-\n     or-down vote in the Senate. We hardly see eye to eye with the \n     far right on social issues, and we oppose some of these \n     judicial nominees, but we urge Republican leaders to press \n     ahead with their threat to nuke the filibuster. The so-called \n     nuclear option entails a finding by a straight majority that \n     filibusters are inappropriate in judicial confirmation \n     battles.\n       But the Senate shouldn't stop with filibusters over judges. \n     It should strive to nuke the filibuster for all legislative \n     purposes.\n       The filibuster debate is a stark reminder of the \n     unprincipled and results-oriented nature of politics, as \n     senators readily switch sides for tactical advantage. \n     Politicians' lack of consistency on fundamental matters--the \n     debate over the proper balance of power between Washington \n     and the states would be another case in point--is far more \n     corrosive to the health of American democracy and the rule of \n     law than any number of Bush-appointed judges could ever be. \n     For one thing, it validates public wariness about politicians \n     professing deep convictions.\n       Liberal interest groups determined to keep Bush nominees \n     off the bench are in such a frenzy that they would have you \n     believe that the Senate filibuster lies at the heart of all \n     American freedoms, its lineage traceable to the Constitution, \n     if not the Magna Carta. The filibuster, a parliamentary \n     tactic allowing 41 senators to block a vote by extending \n     debate on a measure indefinitely, is indeed venerable--it can \n     be traced back two centuries. But it is merely the product of \n     the Senate's own rule-making, altered over time; the measure \n     was not part of the founding fathers' checks and balances to \n     prevent a tyranny of the majority. The Senate's structure \n     itself was part of that calculus.\n       The filibuster is a reactionary instrument that goes too \n     far in empowering a minority of senators. It's no accident \n     that most filibusters have hindered progressive crusades in \n     Washington, be it on civil rights or campaign finance reform. \n     California's Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, one of those \n     recent converts to the filibuster, embarrassed herself by \n     hailing Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) as her inspiration at a \n     pro-filibuster rally. At least Byrd is being consistent in \n     his support--he filibustered the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n       A showdown is looking increasingly likely, though it isn't \n     clear that all Republicans want this fight. Some of them \n     realize they will again be in the minority someday and that \n     the filibuster is a handy brake on the federal government's \n     activism. If their caution prevails, or if Republicans take \n     on the filibuster only in the narrow context of confirmation \n     battles, we will happily weigh in again in the future, still \n     on the anti-filibuster team.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I inquire of the Senator from Indiana, \nis he going to be offering an amendment?\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I am.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The highway bill is the pending business.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 568 to Amendment No. 567\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 568, \nand I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 568.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that \n  the provisions relating to countervailing duties apply to nonmarket \n                           economy countries)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                     TITLE ___--OVERSEAS SUBSIDIES \n\n     SECTION __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Stopping Overseas \n     Subsidies Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. __02. APPLICATION OF COUNTERVAILING DUTIES TO NONMARKET \n                   ECONOMY COUNTRIES.\n\n       Section 701(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \n     1671(a)(1)) is amended by inserting ``(including a nonmarket \n     economy country)'' after ``country'' each place it appears.\n\n     SEC. __03. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by section __02 apply to petitions \n     filed under section 702 of the Tariff Act of 1930 on or after \n     the date of the enactment of this title.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his \ncourtesy.\n  The highway bill we are currently debating is important, vitally \nimportant to building a strong economy for our Nation. It will create \njobs today and raise productivity tomorrow, strengthening the American \npeople in the global economic competition we face and, in so doing, \noffer better prosperity and security for our children.\n  This is only a small part of a bigger picture. It is only the \nbeginning of what must be done if we are to ensure American prosperity \nand national security and a future for our children of which we can be \nproud.\n  The American people need a debate--a debate that starts today--about \nhow to create that prosperity in a global economy, about what we must \ndo and to what we must commit ourselves, and also about what we have a \nright to expect from others. It is a debate that will take time--time \ntoday, time this week, time repeatedly this year and for the \nforeseeable future. It is a debate that will define our generation and \naffect the American people for generations to come. It is a struggle \nfrom which our current leaders have all too often been missing, \nincoherent, naive, and shortsighted, and that must change.\n  As my colleagues know, I feel so strongly about this subject that I \nrecently placed a hold--the first time I have done such a thing--on the \nprospective nomination of Ron Portman to be our next trade negotiator. \nI want to emphasize this action is not personal on my behalf. I met \nwith Mr. Portman. He is a fine man. I have every reason to believe he \nis eminently qualified for the position for which he has been \nnominated. But our obligation in this Senate is not merely to confirm \nhim in his new job but, in addition, to confirm that American workers \nand businesses can labor in a system where, through hard work, \ningenuity, and sacrifice, they have a fair chance in the global \n``economyplace'' to succeed. That, too often, is not the case, and the \nindifference and the inaction that has led to this must change.\n  Our amendment enjoys broad bipartisan support. I am proud to say \nSenators Collins, Graham, and others support this undertaking. They \nknow it is essential. We have bicameral support. Representatives \nEnglish, Davis, and many others support this amendment. They too know \nthat something must be done.\n  Our approach enjoys support by both business and labor--the National \nManufacturers Association, and many representatives of organized \nlabor--because they have waited too long for justice, and the time for \njustice has arrived.\n  We have the broad support we enjoy because of a building consensus in \nour country. Even in a divided society, even in this divided \ninstitution, action is needed and can no longer be delayed or denied.\n  What is that consensus, Madam President? It is the American people \nmust devote themselves to succeeding in a global competition, that we \nmust provide for those who are adversely affected by that global \ncompetition, and that American workers and businesses have a right to \nexpect that our competitors in this competition will play by the same \nset of rules as do we.\n  America must commit itself, we must commit ourselves--it is our \nobligation--to doing those things that are necessary to succeed in the \nglobal marketplace. Nothing else will do. We cannot wall up our \ncountry. We cannot shut out those with whom we would compete. We saw \nthe consequences of that in Eastern Europe under communism. So when the \nwalls come down, as they invariably do, they could produce nothing that \nthe rest of the world could consume.\n  It reminds me, in some ways, of the siren song of protectionism of \nthe Greek king who once sought to turn back the tide and stood on the \nbeach commanding it not to come in, only to drown in the process. We \nmust not follow that path. But to avoid following\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\nthat path, we must have a strategy for success in the global \nmarketplace that involves a robust commitment to research and \ndevelopment in the new goods, the new services, the new technologies of \nthe future that will command good wages in the global marketplace, \nparticularly in the area of energy independence.\n  We have an opportunity, as a society, to create hundreds of thousands \nof good-paying jobs, to address our imbalance of payments, to \nstrengthen our finances, our economy, our environment, and our Nation's \nsecurity in the process. That commitment has been missing for too long.\n  It is penny-wise and pound-foolish when we cut back on our investment \nin research and development. It demonstrates a lack of national will \nwhen we do not commit ourselves to increased energy independence. That \nmust change.\n  What also must change is an increased commitment to an education for \nevery American child, particularly the less-fortunate third, so they \ncan be economically relevant in the global marketplace of today and \ntomorrow with the skills and the talents and the abilities to be \nglobally competitive.\n  For too many of our less fortunate children, that still is simply not \nthe case. So we have to redouble our efforts in K-12 education, and we \nneed to open up the doors of access to college opportunity for every \nAmerican child who is willing to work hard, play right, and do right \nthemselves to get there.\n  The growing gap between the haves and have nots in America today \nincreasingly is defined by those who have a college education and those \nwho do not. Over the last 20 years, those who dropped out of high \nschool or got a high school diploma that did not mean very much because \nthe grades were the result of social promotion rather than actual \nachievement have seen their standards of living decline precipitously. \nThose in our country who received a college degree have seen their \nstandards of living increase marginally. Those who have gotten an \nadvanced degree have seen a dramatic increase in their prosperity and \nstandard of living. So if we want to be globally competitive, we need \nto invest in the talents and the skills of our children and ensure that \nevery child can have a college opportunity. That is a debate for \nanother day. More needs to be done. More must be done if we are going \nto win the battle of global economic competition.\n  We also must do our part by committing ourselves to a course of \nfiscal sanity. The current budget imbalances simply are not \nsustainable, and they exacerbate the trade imbalance and the borrowing \nwe must undertake from abroad. When it comes to our own budget deficits \nand imbalance, we only have ourselves to blame. We have to summon the \nnational will to restore our finances, to ensure that we have a strong \nfinancial, fiscal situation in this country, to ensure that our \nchildren will inherit from us something better than our unpaid bills \nthat have to be paid with interest to foreign countries and \nincreasingly foreign banks. That is not right. We need to correct that \nsituation. We need to redouble our efforts to increase our national \nsavings through incentives for Americans to save more in the private \nsector so that we will increasingly be able to finance our demands at \nhome.\n  We need to look through the prism of innovation in all that we do to \nensure that we can be more rapid, more nimble, in terms of bringing new \ngoods and services to market, and when we do that we need to ensure \nthere is robust protection for our intellectual property rights abroad. \nAll too often, that is not the case. We cannot allow a situation to \ndevelop where, when we do our part through research and development, \nthrough education, through fiscal sanity, through increasing our own \ndomestic savings, through becoming more competitive and innovative, the \nfruits of that labor of that American genius are stolen by those abroad \nthrough violating our intellectual property rights. That cannot be \nallowed to continue further.\n  In addition to having a positive strategy for economic success in a \nglobal marketplace, we also have a moral responsibility to those who \nmay be dislocated through no fault of their own as a result of that \nglobal economic competition. We must reach out to those Americans who \nare displaced and ensure that they have an opportunity to get back on \nthe ladder of success, that every American has the prospect of being \nupwardly mobile in the global marketplace and that we do not just say \nto them, well, if they grew up 30 or 40 years ago and did not get the \neducation they need, if they happen to be employed in the wrong \nindustry that is suffering dislocations, that is too bad for them; they \nare in the scrap heap of history; they are on the wrong side of \nhistory; tough luck. That is social Darwinism, and we cannot take that \npath either.\n  For those of us who will benefit from the fruits of the global \nmarketplace, consumers and industries that are globally competitive and \nenjoy comparative advantage, we have to take some of that success, some \nof those benefits, and put it into training, retraining, job placement, \npension and health care portability, so that every American has a \nchance to be upwardly mobile and successful in the global marketplace.\n  There is also a growing consensus that even when we have done our \npart, even when we have adopted a strategy to be successful, even when \nwe have defined our comparative advantage, when we provided for those \nwho will be dislocated through no fault of their own, even when we have \ndone all of that, others must do their part, too. We cannot stand idly \nby and watch the ingenuity, hard work, and sacrifice of the American \npeople undone by the premeditated cheating--and that is what it is--of \nother countries because of their own narrow self-interests.\n  American workers and businesses too often are getting the shaft \ntoday, and that is not right. It is not right when those of us in the \nSenate stand idly by. It is not right when those in the administration \nturn a blind eye to this. That must change. We must enforce the rules \nof open global competition, and that is what our amendment will do. \nThat is our obligation to our fellow citizens and our children.\n  The cheating--and as I have said, that is what it is--comes in many \nforms, such as the theft of intellectual property. I am told that more \nthan 80 percent of the business software in China today is pirated. \nBarriers to U.S. exports, some in the form of tariffs, some not tariff \nbarriers, such as our beef exports to Japan today--more on that in a \nmoment--through currency manipulation, which we voted on in this Senate \nnot long ago, giving a built-in 25- to 30-percent advantage to \ncountries that do that--in this case, China--not because our workers \nare not as smart, not because they do not work as hard, not because the \nproducts are not as competitive, are simply because of financial \nengineering. Tens of thousands of Americans, when they get up in the \nmorning, before they get dressed and go to work, start off with that \nkind of disadvantage through no fault of their own. How can we possibly \nlook them in the face and tell them they are getting an even shake in \nthe global marketplace? How can we possibly call that free trade? It is \nnot. We know it is not. And it has to change.\n  Illegal subsidies is another form of cheating. Free rent, free power, \nloans never intended to be repaid--that is not free trade. It is the \nopposite of free trade. It is economic engineering by other countries \nto the detriment of American workers and businesses, and that has to \nstop. It is well known.\n  In its recent report to the Congress, the congressionally mandated \nand bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \nstated:\n\n       There was a general consensus in the testimony that China \n     remains in violation of its WTO obligations in a number of \n     important areas.\n\n  In a hearing before the Ways and Means Committee 2 weeks ago, a \nrepresentative of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce highlighted a number of \nconcerns:\n\n     . . . China's post-WTO accession use of industrial policy--\n\n  Not free trade, industrial policy--\n\n     including the use of targeted lending, subsidies, mandated \n     technology standards rather than voluntary, industry-led \n     international standards, discriminatory procurement policies, \n     and potentially, antitrust policy--to structure the \n     development of strategic sectors is of mounting concern.\n\n  Industrial policy, not free trade. That is what we seek to change, a \nglobal competitive marketplace where the\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\nlaws of comparative advantage will rule, where citizens of every \ncountry will have a right to work hard, think smart, be nimble, bring \ngoods and services to the marketplace, and let the best man and woman \nwin. Too often that is not the case today. It is the case on the part \nof our workers but not on the part of their competitors, and that is \nwhat has to stop. That is what this amendment will do.\n  Our Government is well aware of this but too often chooses to turn a \nblind eye. The time for the Senate turning a blind eye has to stop. I \nthink about the case of Batesville Tool and Die in Indiana and the fact \nthat their competitor, in this case from China, sells their product in \nthe United States of America for one-half of a penny above the cost of \nthe raw materials, leaving nothing for labor, nothing for \ntransportation, nothing for marketing. There has to be an illegal \nsubsidy there. It is the laws of physics and the laws of economics. \nCurrently there is nothing in our law that allows us to do anything \nabout it. If the laws of economics are going to make sense, our law \nbetter insist that we have a right to end this kind of industrial \npolicy and cheating. That is what our amendment will change.\n  I think about the National Association of Manufacturers, an \norganization that embraces free trade, and a pair of pliers they held \nup when we announced our amendment a few months ago, a pair of pliers \nsold at the cost of raw materials--the same thing, leaving nothing for \nanything else. Obviously an illegal subsidy violating the rules of the \nWTO is in place there, and that has to change.\n  I think about a foundry I visited in northeast Indiana where they \nstopped production so that I could address the workers several months \nago. A foundry is a dirty business. These guys had soot on their faces \nand grime on their clothes, and they gathered around to hear me speak. \nI looked at them, and I in good conscience could no longer look them in \nthe face, knowing the kind of burdens they labor under, the unlevel \nplaying field, the kind of cheating that takes place, knowing they are \nwilling to work hard for a living, and that too often that can be \nundone by those who are not willing to do the same or are willing to \ncheat to have their way. That is what has to stop, and that is what \nthis amendment will change.\n  The time has come to take a stand. Our prosperity is at stake. The \nglobal marketplace, the global trading system, cannot work. When our \nglobal competitors have a comparative advantage, we buy their goods, \nbut then when we have a comparative advantage, when American workers \ncan produce something quicker, smarter, and cheaper than anybody \nelse, they still do not get to sell their products abroad. They are \nstill defeated at home because of cheating. It just will not work, and \nthat is what this amendment will help to change. Our national \nsovereignty is at stake, our very sovereignty as a nation.\n\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues or the American people \nnoticed several weeks ago that the President of the United States got \non the phone and he called his colleague, the Prime Minister of Japan, \nand he said: You have been keeping our beef exports out of your country \nfor too long. We are pretty good at producing beef in the United \nStates, and you are using the excuse--and it is an excuse now--of the \nmad cow scare a couple of years ago as an informal trading barrier to \nkeep our products out. You know what, we buy a lot from you. You ought \nto bring this nontariff barrier down. It is only the right thing to do.\n  So they had this exchange, and then shortly thereafter, whether by \naccident or not, the Prime Minister happened to say, well, maybe the \ntime has come for Japan to start diversifying its financial holdings \nout of dollar-denominated assets, and for the next several hours the \nvalue of our currency, the value of our money, began to go into a free \nfall until some bureaucrat down in the bowels of the Finance Ministry \ncame out and said the Prime Minister did not really know what he was \ntalking about, it is not true.\n  Well, that is one thing. But a couple of weeks before that, there was \na rumor going through Seoul, the same kind of thing--maybe the South \nKoreans would start diversifying out of dollar-denominated assets. That \nstarted a run on our currency, too.\n  It is not a sign of strength, it is not a sign of independence, it is \nnot a sign of security when something as fundamental as the value of \nour money can be undermined by a slip of the tongue or a premeditated \nstatement or a rumor sweeping a foreign capital. That is not the sign \nof a great nation; it is the sign of dependency, of weakness. It is \nsomething that can no longer be allowed to continue if we are going to \nhave the kind of security for our children that we want them to have \nand that they deserve.\n  Make no mistake, our Nation's security is at stake. A strong military \nand the current financial imbalances we are running cannot be sustained \nindefinitely.\n  There was a book several years ago by Paul Kennedy called ``The Rise \nand Fall of Great Powers.'' It pointed out that the undoing of great \nnations had all too often been the result of their economic and \nfinancial weakness.\n  The percentage of GDP we are currently spending on national security \nand military expenditures substantially outstrips that of our economic \ncompetitors, freeing them to invest a substantially greater percentage \nof their wealth in productive assets.\n  As the only global superpower and the principal leader in the war \nagainst terror, we cannot afford to cut back on our investment in \nnational security. At the very least, we can insist that those who \nbenefit from our efforts in the fight against terror, who benefit from \nour efforts to provide for global security, play by the same set of \neconomic rules so that we do not undercut the very prosperity that \nallows us to fight the war on terror and provide for global economic \nsecurity. The two have to go hand in hand. For the last several years \nthere has been a decoupling that cannot go on indefinitely. If we do \nnot correct this situation, we not only undermine our prosperity and \nour financial strength, we undermine our very sovereignty and our \nNation's security. The debate about leveling the field and enforcing \nthe rules on global trade is very much, in the long run, a debate about \nnational security as well.\n\n  Finally, let me sum up by saying two things. First, I know a lot of \npeople want to talk about China. We had a debate on that and a vote \nwith regard to currency manipulation a couple of weeks ago. Our \nrelationship with China is one of the most important relationships over \nthe next 50 to 100 years. They are a great nation with a great culture \nand a bright future. Our relationship with them will be at times \ncomplex and difficult. It is only going to work if the relationship is \nmutually beneficial in a number of ways, and in the economic arena as \nwell.\n  The nation of China has its challenges and we want to see them \nsuccessfully meet those challenges. But we have challenges, too, and \nthey must be committed, equally committed to seeing us meet our \nchallenges if this relationship is going to work as it must. It is \nsimply not right that to ease the absorption of surplus workers in \nagriculture in China, we are asked artificially to throw out of work \nand put out of business American workers and businesses in our \nheartland. That is fundamentally not just. Stability and growth in \nChina are important, and we should help them in that regard but not at \nthe cost of our own. It is time that we insisted we achieve both.\n  Let me conclude by saying I am optimistic about our future. With the \nright kind of leadership there is little that the American people \ncannot accomplish. But as the old saying goes: If you don't know where \nyou are going, well, any road will lead you there. We must have a \nstrategy for success and prosperity. If we do, I am convinced we can \nget the job done because we have done it before.\n  If I had been addressing this Senate 100 years ago, more than half of \nour workers would have been employed in agriculture--more than half. \nToday it is about 3 or 4 percent. As we made the transition from an \nagricultural economy to a manufacturing-based economy, the United \nStates of America did not dry up and blow away. There were difficulties \nbut we met the challenge. We reinvented our economy and increased our \nprosperity and our standing in the world as a result.\n  If I had been addressing this Senate 50 years ago, more than 30 \npercent of\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\nthe American workers would have been employed in manufacturing. Today \nit is about 12 percent. Again, as the global economy began to change, \nas our domestic economy began to change, we did not dry up and blow \naway. There were difficulties. There were challenges. But we have been \ngrowing the service sector of the economy and the innovative and other \nparts of the economy.\n  So as we fight to save every kind of manufacturing job where we can \nbe competitive in advanced manufacturing and other sections of the \nmanufacturing sector, we have grown other parts of the American economy \nas well. We can continue to do that but only if we are willing to stand \nup for American interests and competitiveness and not allow the genius \nof our people to be stolen and undermined by the premeditated cheating \nand self-interest of other nations to which we turn a blind eye, or \ndon't have the stomach to stand up to. That has to stop and that is \nwhat our amendment will do.\n  It will enable the American people to preserve our prosperity--when \nwe are right, when we are competitive, when we have an advantage--and \nwill enable us to go on and grow parts of our economy and grow good \njobs at good wages where we have that advantage and allow our consumers \nto buy products from countries where they have the advantage. It will \ndo right by our children. It will do justice to our workers. It will \nstrengthen our national security, our sovereignty, our finances, and \nour prosperity. It is the right thing to do, and that is why I propose \nthis amendment and that is why I ask for my colleagues' support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator, it is my understanding, is one that has been in consideration \nin the Finance Committee. There is a freestanding bill called \n``Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act of 2005.'' Is that correct?\n  Mr. BAYH. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the chairman of the committee has \nadvised me that they have been working on this bill for quite some \ntime. As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and \nauthor of the highway bill, I suggest there are titles of the bill that \nare not within the jurisdiction of my committee. One is the Finance \nCommittee title. The title is not yet here, so we do not have that to \nconsider at this time.\n  I think it would be more appropriate later on, after we receive the \ntitle, to debate that in the normal process of legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  First, let me say I am profoundly disappointed by the way this issue \nhas been handled over the past several weeks.\n  My staff has been working hard with some of the proponents of this \nlegislation to fully understand the pros and cons of the legislation.\n  In fact, a meeting was held with the proponents just prior to a press \nrelease being issued saying that a hold was being placed on a nominee \nunless a vote were taken on the bill.\n  I thought we were making good progress. Needless to say, I was very \nsurprised to learn of that development. No one asked me about it.\n  Let's be clear, I share concerns about China's economic policies and \nthe impact of those policies on international trade and the U.S. \neconomy.\n  At this point, however, I'm not convinced that the Bayh amendment is \nthe best possible policy response we can provide to China's economic \npolicies.\n  The amendment would substantively change United States trade law, and \nit is imperative that the repercussions be fully understood before we \nmove ahead with the proposed change.\n  That's why the committee process should not be circumvented. The \nFinance Committee has jurisdiction over issues of international trade, \nand its expertise should be brought to bear on any trade issue before \nits consideration by the full Senate.\n  When that process is not respected, we run the risk of adopting ill-\nthought out policy which in the end could undermine the very intent of \nlegislation that is rushed in as an amendment, as Senator Bayh proposes \nwe do in this case.\n  For starters, I understand that the bill may not even be necessary, \nas it's possible this change could be implemented administratively \nrather than legislatively.\n  We should explore with Administration officials the feasibility of \nimplementing an administrative change, what that would entail and how \nthat might best be accomplished.\n  The proposed legislation doesn't give the Commerce Department any \nflexibility to develop appropriate regulations and procedures to \nimplement this provision.\n  Such a significant change from established practice should at least \nincorporate sufficient flexibility so that it can be implemented \nproperly. Otherwise, proponents run the risk of undermining their very \ngoal.\n  Why wouldn't proponents want to ensure that such a significant change \nin the operation of our trade laws is implemented properly?\n  Again, that's why the Finance Committee should have the opportunity \nto address the details.\n  There are other repercussions that should be examined. How does the \nproposed legislation relate to China's accession to the WTO for \nexample?\n  Is it consistent with the terms of our bilateral agreement on China's \nWTO accession?\n  Those questions should be answered before we move ahead on this \nlegislation.\n  Another very serious issue is the relationship between this \nlegislation and existing U.S. trade law.\n  It's quite possible that by adopting this bill we could undermine the \napplication of U.S. antidumping law, and I doubt any of my colleagues \nwould advocate that result.\n  It is even possible that this amendment could force us to relinquish \napplication of the nonmarket antidumping methodology in dumping cases.\n  That question needs to be addressed thoroughly before we move ahead \non this legislation. Proponents may offer blanket assertions to the \ncontrary, but that is not sufficient, in my view.\n  We should not run the risk of undermining our trade laws by pushing \nthis amendment onto a bill today.\n  I hope Senator Bayh will reconsider his decision and withdraw the \namendment.\n  If not, I hope my colleagues will join with me in opposing his \namendment until we can fully appreciate its repercussions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will be glad to respond to any questions the Senator \nhas, after I get one thing taken care of here.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:30 p.m. the Senate \nproceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 39, \nthe nomination of J. Michael Seabright, to be U.S. district judge for \nthe Southern District of Hawaii; provided further that there be 30 \nminutes for debate equally divided between the chairman and the ranking \nmember or designees, and that at the expiration or yielding back of the \ntime, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination with no intervening action or debate; provided further that \nfollowing the vote, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, as we said over and over again, I have a \nlist of about eight amendments people have said they want to come down \nand offer. This is the third day now we have been inviting them to come \ndown. So far only Senator Thune has brought his amendment in. We did \nadopt that amendment. I encourage others to come down.\n  I think this could very well be considered by most people the most \nsignificant vote on a bill we will be considering on the floor this \nentire year. We want to make sure, while we have the time, that we give \nadequate consideration and time for the amendments that different \nMembers may have. I invite them to come down at any time during this \nprocess. With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAYH. Did my colleague have a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding the junior Senator from Missouri \nwould like to have the floor for consideration of an amendment. But I \nwill yield the floor at this time.\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                 amendment no. 582 to amendment no. 567\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I have an amendment to send to the desk. \nI ask unanimous consent the Bayh amendment be set aside so I can do \nthat, offer the amendment; and then, at the end of the 3 or 4 minutes I \nam going to use to offer the amendment, that we would go back to the \nBayh amendment. That would be my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Talent] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 582 to amendment No. 567.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a \nprogram to promote the safe and efficient operation of first responder \n                               vehicles)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FIRST RESPONDER VEHICLE SAFETY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, in \n     consultation with the Administrator, National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration, shall--\n       (1) develop and implement a comprehensive program to \n     promote compliance with State and local laws intended to \n     increase the safe and efficient operation of first responder \n     vehicles;\n       (2) compile a list of best practices by State and local \n     governments to promote compliance with the laws described in \n     paragraph (1);\n       (3) analyze State and local laws intended to increase the \n     safe and efficient operation of first responder vehicles; and\n       (4) develop model legislation to increase the safe and \n     efficient operation of first responder vehicles.\n       (b) Partnerships.--The Secretary may enter into \n     partnerships with qualified organizations to carry out this \n     section.\n       (c) Public Outreach.--The Secretary shall use a variety of \n     public outreach strategies to carry out this section, \n     including public service announcements, publication of \n     informational materials, and posting information on the \n     Internet.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal \n     year 2006 to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma and my \nfriend from Indiana for allowing me to get this amendment pending. I am \nvery hopeful we will eventually get it accepted. I am working with the \nchairman and ranking members of both the full committee and \nsubcommittee to get that done.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to address the problem of the \nincreasing number of accidents occurring in which either parked first \nresponder vehicles are rear-ended by other vehicles or the first \nresponder is struck after leaving the vehicle.\n  In first responders--such an antiseptic term--we are talking about \nour police officers, our ambulance workers and drivers, our \nfirefighters who are dealing with the issue of a car that is parked on \nthe side of the road, maybe because the police officer pulled the car \naside, or because the car has been abandoned, or it is on fire. It is \nall too often the case in this country that our first responders who \nare working on those situations are injured or killed by a passing \nvehicle.\n  I will share the story of a Missouri law enforcement officer who \ntragically lost his life this way. I know there have been many more \nsuch as him around the country. Michael Newton was a State trooper for \nthe Missouri highway patrol. He stopped a vehicle on Interstate 70 in \nLafayette County, MO, for a traffic violation on May 22, 2003. He and \nthe other driver were sitting in the patrol car when they were struck \nfrom behind by a pickup carrying a flatbed trailer. Trooper Newton died \nat the scene. The driver he had stopped suffered serious burns. Trooper \nNewton was only 25 years old. He left a wife, two young sons, many \nloving relatives, and a community that deeply mourned his loss and was \nvery grateful for his service to the State of Missouri.\n  In 2003, 193 other people lost their lives in crashes involving \nemergency vehicles, including 141 lives lost in crashes involving \npolice vehicles, 29 lives lost in those involving ambulances, and 24 \nlives lost in crashes involving firetrucks.\n  According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \nvehicle-related incidents are the No. 1 cause of police officer \ninjuries and the No. 2 cause of police officer deaths. In 2004, 73 out \nof 153 police officer deaths were vehicle related. Not all of those \ninvolved parked cars, but most of them did.\n  I was very surprised to see those statistics and deeply concerned \nthat we have not informed people and raised their awareness about this \nproblem. That is what this amendment is designed to do. My Pass With \nCare amendment requires the Secretary to start a nationwide publicity \ncampaign through public service announcements, developing a Web site, \nproviding informational materials, to increase public awareness of this \ncrucial safety issue.\n  Our first responders, our police, our firefighters, our ambulance \nworkers dedicate their lives to helping protect the rest of us. They \nsave so many lives through their heroic efforts. If more people realize \nthey can help protect our first responders by quickly and safely \npulling over when they hear an emergency siren or being more careful \nwhen they see a first responder vehicle parked on the road or the \nshoulder of the road, that will reduce the risks for our law \nenforcement, health workers, and firefighters.\n  The amendment requires the Secretary, in consultation with the \nNational Highway Safety Administration, to develop and implement a \nprogram to promote compliance with State Pass With Care laws and ``move \nover'' laws. Those laws govern how motorists pass and yield to first \nresponders' vehicles.\n  The Secretary, under my amendment, would compile a list of best \npractices to promote compliance with such laws, would conduct an \nanalysis of the various State and local laws that deal with the safety \nof first responder vehicles, and from that analysis develop model \nlegislation that States can adopt should they choose to do so.\n  Unfortunately, only 27 States currently have Pass With Care laws or \n``move over'' laws. The amendment would help give guidance to the \nremaining States on drafting laws that would help save lives. The \nSecretary would be authorized to enter into partnerships with safety \norganizations and engage with public outreach to help improve first \nresponder safety.\n\n  This is not an amendment that would be coercive on the States. I \ntried to be sensitive to that in drafting it. It is what we can do as \nan alternative to mandating the States in this area to help provide a \nclearinghouse of information for them to help develop model legislation \nand also in appropriate ways to develop an increased public awareness \nof this problem.\n  If people become more aware of this as the bill goes through and as a \nresult of an awareness campaign the Secretary would conduct, that in \nitself would probably reduce the number of deaths.\n  I was surprised to hear of the number of first responders who are \nimperiled. If we can help them by raising awareness, I think we ought \nto do it. I am pleased to introduce the amendment on behalf of our \nfirst responders at risk on our roads and highways. They should not be \nat risk. I urge the Senate to pass the amendment to help strengthen \nthese laws, and ensure the safety of our first responders.\n  I certainly am willing to work with the managers of the bill to help \ndeal with any concerns they may have regarding the wording of the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3) to authorize funds for Federal aid \n     highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Inhofe amendment No. 567, to provide a complete substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this is the third day we have been on a \nbill we have been working on for 2\\1/2\\ years. It is the same bill \nessentially that was passed last year by a margin of 76 to 21. We are \nanxious to get people to come down to the floor for amendments. I don't \nknow of anyone coming down at this time. But I encourage all Members on \nboth sides of the aisle to come down and utilize this time so we can \nget the amendments behind us.\n  I understand the Senator from Illinois has some comments he wishes to \nmake. I yield to him some of our time at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the committee. \nLet me say I share his sense of urgency about the underlying bill. This \nis a bipartisan bill, a bill Democrats and Republicans want to see \npassed, a bill to finance the building of roads and bridges and \nairports, to finance mass transit in what is critical infrastructure \nfor America's economy. I do not have an amendment to the bill, but if I \ndid, I would offer it because I think those who have them should bring \nthem to the floor so we can move and get it done before we take a \nrecess next week. I urge my colleagues on the Democratic side to follow \nthe admonition of the chairman.\n  What brings me to the floor was a statement made earlier by the \nSenator from Utah which made reference to me. Senator Orrin Hatch and I \nare friends. We disagree on a lot of things.\n  We vote differently on a lot of issues and we debate furiously, but \nwe get along fine. I think that is what life should be like and what \nthe legislative process should be like. He made a reference earlier to \nthis whole question of the nuclear option, to which I would like to \nreturn for a few moments.\n  First, what is the nuclear option? People who don't follow the Senate \non a regular basis have to wonder are they using nuclear weapons on the \nfloor of the Senate? What could it be? ``Nuclear Option'' was a phrase \ncreated by Republican Senator Trent Lott to describe a procedure that \nmight be used to change the rules of the Senate. The reason Senator \nLott called it the nuclear option was because it is devastating in its \nimpact to the tradition and rules of the Senate.\n  I will put it into context. The Senate was created to give the \nminority in the Senate, as well as in the United States, a voice. There \nare two Senators from every State, large and small. Two Senators from \nthe smallest State have the same vote on the floor of the Senate as \nSenators from larger States, such as California, New York, Illinois, \nand Texas. That is the nature of the Senate. The rules of the Senate \nback that up. The rules of the Senate from the beginning said if any \nSenator stood up and objected, started a filibuster, the Senate would \ncome to a stop. You think to yourself, how can you run a Senate if any \nSenator can stop the train? Well, it forces you, if you are going to \nmove something forward in the Senate, to reach across the aisle to your \ncolleagues, to compromise, to find bipartisanship, so that things move \nthrough in a regular way and in a bipartisan way. That is the nature of \nthe filibuster.\n  Over the years, it has changed. You saw the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington,'' when Jimmy Stewart stood at his desk, with his idealism \nand his youth, arguing for his cause until he collapsed on the floor. \nHe was exercising a filibuster because he believed in it so intensely. \nWe have said over the years that you can do that to any nominee, bill, \nor law on the floor of the Senate; but if a large number of Senators, \nan extraordinary number of Senators, say it is time for the filibuster \nto end, it would end. The vote today is 60 votes. So if I am perplexed \nby an amendment offered by one of my colleagues, and I stand up to \ndebate it and decide I am going to hold the floor of the Senate as long \nas my voice and body can hold out, I can do that, until such point as \n60 colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, come together and say: \nEnough, we want to move to a vote. That is what it is all about.\n  So what has happened is the Republicans now control the House, \nSenate, and the White House. What they have said is they want to change \nthe rules. They want to change the rules in the middle of the game \nbecause they don't like the fact that Democratic Senators have used the \nfilibuster to stop 10 judicial nominees President Bush has sent to \nCongress, sent to the Senate.\n  Now, for the record, the President sent 215 nominees; 205 were \napproved and only 10 were not. Over 95 percent of the President's \njudicial nominees have gone through. We have the lowest vacancy rate on \nthe Federal bench in modern memory. So we don't have outrageous \nvacancies that need to be filled quickly. We decided--those of us who \nvoted for the filibusters--that these 10 nominees went way too far; \ntheir political views were inconsistent with the mainstream of America. \nThey were not consistent with the feelings and values of families \nacross the country on issues as diverse as the role of the Federal \nGovernment in protecting health and safety, which is an issue nominee \nJanice Rogers Brown takes a position on that is hard to believe. She \nhas taken a position on a case--a famous case called the Lockner case--\nwhich would basically take away the power of the Federal Government to \nregulate areas of health and safety when it comes to consumers and the \nenvironment. It is a radical position.\n  And then another nominee, William Myers--my concern about him and the \nconcern of many Senators is the fact that he has taken a radical \nposition when it comes to our Nation's treasury and heritage, our \nnatural and public lands. He has taken a position where he backs \ncertain lobby groups, but there is one that we think is inconsistent \nwith mainstream thinking in America. So there is an objection.\n  Other nominees have taken what we consider to be far-out positions \nthat don't reflect the mainstream of America and we have objected, \nwhich is our right. Now the President says: Enough, I am tired of \nlosing any nominee to the Senate. Don't we have 55 Republicans? Should \nwe not get what we want?\n  He is not the first President who has felt that way. Thomas Jefferson \nfelt that way. Thomas Jefferson, in the beginning of his second term, \ncame to the Senate and said: I am sick and tired of the judges who have \nbeen appointed to the Supreme Court. I want to start impeaching them.\n  You know what Jefferson's party said? No, Mr. President, you are \nwrong. The Constitution is more important than your Presidential power. \nThey said no to Thomas Jefferson.\n\n  Franklin Roosevelt did the same thing at the beginning of his second \nterm. He was unhappy that his New Deal legislation was being rejected. \nHe\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\ncame to the Senate and said: Let's change this and make sure we can put \nmore Justices on the Supreme Court and get the votes we want.\n  His Democratic Party in the Senate said: No, Mr. President, we love \nyou and we are glad you were elected, and we support your New Deal, but \nyou have gone too far. Presidential power is not more important than \nthe Constitution. They said no to him.\n  So now comes President Bush and Vice President Cheney, and they have \nsaid: We don't like the fact that we only have 95 percent of our \nnominees approved; we want them all. We want to change the rules of the \nSenate--in fact, we will break those rules to change them so that \nPresident Bush can get every single nominee. Unfortunately, very few on \nthat side of the aisle from the President's party are willing to stand \nup and say to this President, as Senators have said to President \nJefferson and President Roosevelt: You are going too far. What you are \ndoing here, sadly, is going to abuse the Constitution to build the \npower of the White House.\n  The Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, came in earlier and made a \nstatement. He said every nominee should have an up-or-down vote. On its \nface, that sounds reasonable. We understand the rules of the Senate \nallow the filibuster and an extraordinary majority for nominees. What \nSenator Hatch failed to mention was that when he was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee during the Clinton administration--those 8 years--\nover 60 Presidential nominees for the bench who were sent up by \nPresident Clinton to his committee were buried in committee without so \nmuch as a hearing. They didn't even have a chance to stand up and \ndefend themselves, explain their point of view. Senator Hatch said, no. \nOver 60 Presidential nominees for President Clinton were stopped by \nSenator Hatch on the Judiciary Committee. I know; I served on the \ncommittee. I watched it happen. I heard Senator Hatch say every nominee \nshould have an up-or-down vote. He is suffering from political amnesia. \nHe has forgotten when he was in charge, 60 nominees never even had a \nhearing, let alone an up-or-down vote.\n  So we come to this point, a point where I think the issues are very \nclear. The Republicans are prepared, with the help of Vice President \nCheney--who announced over the weekend he supports them--to break the \nrules of the Senate, which are in a book that is seldom drawn out of \nour desks. The rules of the Senate say it takes 67 votes to change the \nrules of the Senate. That is a big number, 67 out of 100. The \nRepublicans know they don't have 67 votes to change the filibuster \nrule, so they have decided to do it differently. They are going to wait \nuntil Vice President Cheney is in the chair, and they are going to make \na point of order that we should just have a simple majority vote on \njudicial nominees. And Vice President Cheney is going to rule--he \nalready said he would--and that is that. That is the end of the story.\n  So they are breaking the rules of the Senate to change the rules of \nthe Senate, to eliminate a tradition and rule that has been around for \n200 years. They are changing the rules in the middle of the game. The \nnet result of that is this: The Senate will lose power when it comes to \nchecks and balances. The President will have more power. It will mean \nthat the President--this President, unlike President Jefferson and \nPresident Roosevelt--will trump the Constitution and will basically \nsay: I am going to take more power away from the Senate. And his party \nwill go along with that, even though President Jefferson and President \nRoosevelt had members of their own party stand up and say: Mr. \nPresident, you have gone too far.\n  The net result--the one that troubles me the most--is that we are \ntalking about lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. If you take \npeople who are so far out of the mainstream and stick them on a Federal \nbench for life, let me tell you, we don't have a clue what that is \ngoing to mean. But it is certainly worrisome that they could rule and \nchange laws that we value as Americans--laws that, frankly, cross both \npolitical borders and Democrats and Republicans have supported. When \nyou put somebody on the bench with that much power for a lifetime, then \nyou have to worry about them.\n  So we have tried to come to some conclusion. Senator Reid of Nevada, \nour Democratic leader, came to the floor to describe in general terms \nwhat he has been doing. For weeks, he has been negotiating with Senator \nFrist and speaking to other Republican Senators about avoiding this \nconstitutional confrontation, avoiding a constitutional crisis, \navoiding this effort to change the rules in the middle of the game. He \nhas made an offer--a good-faith offer--to bring some of these judges \nforward, to talk about rule changes that are in the best interests of \nthis institution; and, frankly, Senator Frist said yesterday: No, we \nare not talking about it anymore. It is over.\n\n  That is unfortunate.\n  It is important that we continue a dialog. The good thing about the \nfilibuster is that it brings us together in order to move a nominee or \na bill. Republicans have to reach across the aisle to Democrats and \nDemocrats have to reach across to Republicans. That is the way it \nshould be in this Chamber. It should not be a line down the middle and \na wall that cannot be breached. That is exactly what we face if the \nRepublicans go forward with the nuclear option.\n  When I return to Illinois, they say: Senator, can we come together to \npass this highway bill Senator Inhofe is bringing to the floor? We will \nand it will be a good, bipartisan bill. We have been waiting, but let's \npass this bill on a bipartisan basis. They say: Senator, can't \nDemocrats and Republicans work together to do something about health \ninsurance? You don't even talk about it on the Senate floor. I think we \ncan. I know that business interests, as well as labor interests, want \nus to bring up this issue and resolve it. We should do it on a \nbipartisan basis. They say: Senator, can't you sit down and find a \nRepublican who wants to put more money into our schools for No Child \nLeft Behind, so that we can have better schools, better teachers, \nbetter students?\n  Of course, we should move toward bipartisanship. But the nuclear \noption, sadly, is going to divide us, split us. Make no mistake, if the \nnuclear option goes forward, this will be a different Senate and not \nvery good in the process, I am afraid. A lot will happen that will be \nbad for us. Some have said on the floor, well, certainly at that point \nthe Democrats are going to shut down the Senate and the Government. \nTrust me, that is not going to happen. We saw that tactic once. \nRemember the name Newt Gingrich and the Contract with America? He was \nso emboldened by Rush Limbaugh, he said if we shut down the Federal \nGovernment, nobody will notice. We noticed in a hurry and it hurt the \nRepublican Party when they did it. We are not going to make that \nmistake. We believe that important functions of this Government must \nmove forward. The defense of America, the support of our troops, the \npassage of critical appropriations bills, the passage of a highway \nbill--those issues are moving forward. But the ordinary day-to-day \nbusiness of the Senate, otherwise, is going to be changed a lot.\n  If the Republicans are prepared to break the rules to change the \nrules, sadly the Senate Democrats will have to say we must play by the \nrest of the rules. That means more time on the floor, more debate, \nSenators spending more time at their desks, more time in session, more \ntime in Washington. You hear the complaint that 5,000-page bills come \nbefore us that nobody reads. We will read them. Important amendments \nwill be read. Debate will take place, and instead of the Chamber almost \nalways being empty, it may be almost always full. Things will change.\n  I think there is a better way. Senator Reid has suggested a better \nway--that cooler heads prevail, that those truly interested in not only \nthe institution of the Senate but the value of the Constitution come \nforward. We can protect the filibuster. We can make certain that we do \nit in a sensible way. But we can only do it if we are in a dialog.\n  Senator Frist's comments yesterday are worrisome. At this point, I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the \nChicago Tribune. It is an editorial of April 25, which supports the \nDemocrats and opposes the nuclear option.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\n                 [From Chicago Tribune, Apr. 25, 2005]\n\n                      Democracy and the Filibuster\n\n       The most surprising thing about the Senate battle over the \n     filibuster is that a dusty 200-year-old procedure could \n     generate such fresh controversy. Republicans say Democrats \n     have abused it so badly to block judicial nominees that it \n     should be removed from their arsenal. Democrats say it is an \n     indispensable tool to prevent the president from turning the \n     federal courts over to extremist judges.\n       But the debate is really just the latest argument about the \n     central issue of our system of government: how much power the \n     majority should have.\n       There is no question that Democrats have misused the \n     leverage afforded by the filibuster. This device is supposed \n     to ensure that the Senate gets a full hearing on any \n     controversy before it votes. Facing a Republican president \n     and a Republican majority of 55 senators, however, Democrats \n     have deployed the threat of a filibuster not to delay votes \n     but to prevent them.\n       Contrary to Republican claims, though, this tactic is not \n     unprecedented, and it wasn't invented by the Democrats. \n     Republicans tried to filibuster several judges named by \n     President Clinton, even though they controlled the Senate at \n     the time.\n       Democrats were right to complain then, as Sen. Patrick \n     Leahy did in 1999: ``If we don't like somebody the president \n     nominates, vote him or her down. But don't hold them in this \n     anonymous unconscionable limbo, because in doing that, the \n     minority of senators really shame all senators.'' Republicans \n     are equally justified in objecting now.\n       But changing Senate rules to bar the use of filibusters \n     against judicial nominees, as Republican leader Bill Frist of \n     Tennessee has threatened to do, would be shortsighted and \n     ultimately unhealthy. The filibuster, whatever its potential \n     for misuse, is a vital safeguard against majority excesses. \n     As such, it buttresses a constitutional framework ingeniously \n     designed to keep the many from running roughshod over the \n     few.\n       Although Americans have great faith in democracy, a Martian \n     political scientist arriving here with no knowledge of our \n     federal framework might think its purpose was not to empower \n     the majority but to frustrate it. The Constitution contains a \n     variety of mechanisms designed to make sure that public \n     sentiment doesn't automatically get translated into policy.\n       The Bill of Rights, for instance, places certain subjects \n     off-limits. The separation of powers, dividing authority \n     among three different branches of government, serves as \n     another check on the will of the people. A president can \n     overrule the 535-member Congress and sustain a veto with as \n     few as 34 senators. The Senate itself, of course, is at odds \n     with pure democracy, because it allocates equal \n     representation to each state, regardless of population.\n       The filibuster is merely a Senate rule, not a \n     constitutional provision. But the reason it has survived for \n     so long is that it fits well into the overall structure of \n     our government.\n       Devices that obstruct the will of the majority can be an \n     awful nuisance. But in the long run, the protections they \n     offer against democratic excesses are worth the price.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Chicago Tribune, I can tell, is no \nliberal newspaper. They have a newspaper that takes conservative \npositions regularly, and they have decided that the nuclear option is \nthe wrong way to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am anxious to yield the floor to the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, who has an amendment to bring up at \nthis time. But before doing that, I have sat and listened very \ncarefully while Senator Hatch was talking about the constitutional \noption and the response from the Senator from Illinois. Sometimes you \nhave to leave the individuals and hear what is being said outside this \nChamber.\n  I have a couple editorials I am going to read at this time. The first \nis from yesterday's Investors Business Daily. Granted, that is \ngenerally a fairly conservative publication, and the next editorial I \nwill read certainly is not one that would be identified as even \nmoderate or conservative.\n  Investors Business Daily says:\n\n       Rules of order: The Democrats would have us believe \n     filibustering is a time-honored constitutional and Senate \n     tradition. It's not. And it wasn't that long ago that they \n     felt quite differently.\n       A showdown now looms after Republicans on the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee used their 10-8 majority to move the \n     nominations of Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen for \n     federal appeals court seats to the full Senate.\n       Democrats threaten to filibuster these picks, Majority \n     Leader Bill Frist threatens to employ the unfortunately named \n     ``nuclear option'' restoring the quaint notion that 51 votes \n     constitutes a majority, and Vice President Dick Cheney says \n     he's willing to be the tie-breaking vote to ban filibusters \n     of judicial nominees.\n       Democrats are trying to portray GOP efforts to restore \n     majority rule to the Senate as it relates to judicial \n     nominations as an assault on the traditions of the Senate and \n     the Constitution itself. As if the filibuster were James \n     Madison's dying wish.\n       As a practical matter, the filibuster didn't even exist \n     until the 1830s, when it was used to block legislation and \n     not judicial picks. It was used by Democrats to defend \n     slavery and oppose the Civil Rights Act--hardly noble \n     purposes.\n       In 1841, the filibuster was used by Sen. John Calhoun to \n     defend slaveholding interests. In 1957, then-Democratic Sen. \n     Strom Thurmond held the floor for 24 hours straight to block \n     civil rights legislation. And in 1964, 18 Democrats and one \n     Republican blocked the Civil Rights Act for 2\\1/2\\ months.\n       In 1916, Senator Robert La Follette, a Republican, used it \n     to block legislation to let merchant ships arm themselves \n     against German U-boats. This prompted the Senate in 1917, at \n     the behest of President Wilson, a Democrat, to adopt the \n     first cloture rule, rule XXII, requiring a two-thirds to end \n     debate.\n       This was amended 60 years later by none other than Robert \n     Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate's constitutional guardian and \n     conscience, who reduced it to a three-fifths requirement.\n       In sum: For the first 200 years of our republic, Senate \n     ``tradition'' never required 60 votes to approve judges. \n     Filibusters are neither an idea of the Founding Fathers nor a \n     historical tradition of the Senate. Cloture rules are a 20th \n     century phenomenon, with the current rule less than 30 years \n     old. Systematic filibustering of a president's appellate-\n     court nominees is totally unprecedented.\n       Democrats didn't always love the filibuster. In September \n     1999, in a debate over Clinton appellate-court nominees, Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy of Vermont thundered on the Senate floor: \n     ``Vote them up or down! That is what the Constitution speaks \n     of in our advise-and-consent capacity.'' An up-or-down vote, \n     he said then, was a ``constitutional responsibility.''\n       The year before, none other than Sen. Ted Kennedy of \n     Massachusetts solemnly intoned: ``We owe it to Americans to \n     give these (judicial) nominees a vote. If our Republican \n     colleagues don't like them, vote against them, but give them \n     a vote.''\n       In 1995, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa proposed a plan to end \n     filibusters identical to one now proposed by Frist. The \n     Harkin plan was supported by 19 Democrats, including Sens. \n     Kennedy, Barbara Boxer of California, Joseph Lieberman of \n     Connecticut, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and John Kerry of \n     Massachusetts.\n       Harkin proposed to establish a declining vote requirement \n     for cloture so that by the fourth cloture vote, a simple \n     majority of the Senate would suffice to end debate and allow \n     a floor vote on the matter at hand.\n       In the Constitution, when the Framers intended more than \n     simple majorities, they explicitly said so. For example, they \n     require a two-thirds majority to convict in an impeachment \n     trial, expel a member, override a presidential veto, approve \n     a treaty or propose a constitutional amendment.\n       Senate Democrats once opposed the filibustering of judicial \n     nominees; they now support and rail against a ``nuclear \n     option'' they once proposed themselves. Republicans should \n     expose this hypocrisy, stop worrying and learn to love the \n     bomb.\n\n  I will not read the whole editorial from the L.A. Times, from \nyesterday. I will read the first two paragraphs, in deference to my \ngood friend from Indiana.\n  They said:\n\n       These are confusing days in Washington. Born-again \n     conservative Christians who strongly want to see President \n     Bush's judicial nominees voted on are leading the charge \n     against the Senate filibuster, and liberal Democrats are \n     born-again believers in that reactionary, obstructionist \n     legislative tactic. Practically every big-name liberal \n     senator you can think of derided the filibuster a decade ago \n     but now sees the error of his or her ways and will go to \n     amusing lengths to try to convince you that the change of \n     heart is explained by something deeper than the mere \n     difference between being in the majority and being in the \n     minority.\n       At the risk of seeming dull or unfashionable for not \n     getting our own intellectual makeover, we still think \n     judicial candidates nominated by a president deserve an up-\n     or-down vote in the Senate. We hardly see eye to eye with the \n     far right on social issues, and we oppose some of these \n     judicial nominees, but we urge Republican leaders to press \n     ahead with their threat to nuke the filibuster. The so-called \n     nuclear option entails a finding by a straight majority that \n     filibusters are inappropriate in judicial confirmation \n     battles.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this entire editorial be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE.

The so-called \n     nuclear option entails a finding by a straight majority that \n     filibusters are inappropriate in judicial confirmation \n     battles.\n       But the Senate shouldn't stop with filibusters over judges. \n     It should strive to nuke the filibuster for all legislative \n     purposes.\n       The filibuster debate is a stark reminder of the \n     unprincipled and results-oriented nature of politics, as \n     senators readily switch sides for tactical advantage. \n     Politicians' lack of consistency on fundamental matters--the \n     debate over the proper balance of power between Washington \n     and the states would be another case in point--is far more \n     corrosive to the health of American democracy and the rule of \n     law than any number of Bush-appointed judges could ever be. \n     For one thing, it validates public wariness about politicians \n     professing deep convictions.\n       Liberal interest groups determined to keep Bush nominees \n     off the bench are in such a frenzy that they would have you \n     believe that the Senate filibuster lies at the heart of all \n     American freedoms, its lineage traceable to the Constitution, \n     if not the Magna Carta. The filibuster, a parliamentary \n     tactic allowing 41 senators to block a vote by extending \n     debate on a measure indefinitely, is indeed venerable--it can \n     be traced back two centuries. But it is merely the product of \n     the Senate's own rule-making, altered over time; the measure \n     was not part of the founding fathers' checks and balances to \n     prevent a tyranny of the majority. The Senate's structure \n     itself was part of that calculus.\n       The filibuster is a reactionary instrument that goes too \n     far in empowering a minority of senators. It's no accident \n     that most filibusters have hindered progressive crusades in \n     Washington, be it on civil rights or campaign finance reform. \n     California's Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, one of those \n     recent converts to the filibuster, embarrassed herself by \n     hailing Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) as her inspiration at a \n     pro-filibuster rally. At least Byrd is being consistent in \n     his support--he filibustered the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n       A showdown is looking increasingly likely, though it isn't \n     clear that all Republicans want this fight. Some of them \n     realize they will again be in the minority someday and that \n     the filibuster is a handy brake on the federal government's \n     activism. If their caution prevails, or if Republicans take \n     on the filibuster only in the narrow context of confirmation \n     battles, we will happily weigh in again in the future, still \n     on the anti-filibuster team.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I inquire of the Senator from Indiana, \nis he going to be offering an amendment?\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I am.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The highway bill is the pending business.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 568 to Amendment No. 567\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 568, \nand I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 568.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that \n  the provisions relating to countervailing duties apply to nonmarket \n                           economy countries)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                     TITLE ___--OVERSEAS SUBSIDIES \n\n     SECTION __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Stopping Overseas \n     Subsidies Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. __02. APPLICATION OF COUNTERVAILING DUTIES TO NONMARKET \n                   ECONOMY COUNTRIES.\n\n       Section 701(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \n     1671(a)(1)) is amended by inserting ``(including a nonmarket \n     economy country)'' after ``country'' each place it appears.\n\n     SEC. __03. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by section __02 apply to petitions \n     filed under section 702 of the Tariff Act of 1930 on or after \n     the date of the enactment of this title.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his \ncourtesy.\n  The highway bill we are currently debating is important, vitally \nimportant to building a strong economy for our Nation. It will create \njobs today and raise productivity tomorrow, strengthening the American \npeople in the global economic competition we face and, in so doing, \noffer better prosperity and security for our children.\n  This is only a small part of a bigger picture. It is only the \nbeginning of what must be done if we are to ensure American prosperity \nand national security and a future for our children of which we can be \nproud.\n  The American people need a debate--a debate that starts today--about \nhow to create that prosperity in a global economy, about what we must \ndo and to what we must commit ourselves, and also about what we have a \nright to expect from others. It is a debate that will take time--time \ntoday, time this week, time repeatedly this year and for the \nforeseeable future. It is a debate that will define our generation and \naffect the American people for generations to come. It is a struggle \nfrom which our current leaders have all too often been missing, \nincoherent, naive, and shortsighted, and that must change.\n  As my colleagues know, I feel so strongly about this subject that I \nrecently placed a hold--the first time I have done such a thing--on the \nprospective nomination of Ron Portman to be our next trade negotiator. \nI want to emphasize this action is not personal on my behalf. I met \nwith Mr. Portman. He is a fine man. I have every reason to believe he \nis eminently qualified for the position for which he has been \nnominated. But our obligation in this Senate is not merely to confirm \nhim in his new job but, in addition, to confirm that American workers \nand businesses can labor in a system where, through hard work, \ningenuity, and sacrifice, they have a fair chance in the global \n``economyplace'' to succeed. That, too often, is not the case, and the \nindifference and the inaction that has led to this must change.\n  Our amendment enjoys broad bipartisan support. I am proud to say \nSenators Collins, Graham, and others support this undertaking. They \nknow it is essential. We have bicameral support. Representatives \nEnglish, Davis, and many others support this amendment. They too know \nthat something must be done.\n  Our approach enjoys support by both business and labor--the National \nManufacturers Association, and many representatives of organized \nlabor--because they have waited too long for justice, and the time for \njustice has arrived.\n  We have the broad support we enjoy because of a building consensus in \nour country. Even in a divided society, even in this divided \ninstitution, action is needed and can no longer be delayed or denied.\n  What is that consensus, Madam President? It is the American people \nmust devote themselves to succeeding in a global competition, that we \nmust provide for those who are adversely affected by that global \ncompetition, and that American workers and businesses have a right to \nexpect that our competitors in this competition will play by the same \nset of rules as do we.\n  America must commit itself, we must commit ourselves--it is our \nobligation--to doing those things that are necessary to succeed in the \nglobal marketplace. Nothing else will do. We cannot wall up our \ncountry. We cannot shut out those with whom we would compete. We saw \nthe consequences of that in Eastern Europe under communism. So when the \nwalls come down, as they invariably do, they could produce nothing that \nthe rest of the world could consume.\n  It reminds me, in some ways, of the siren song of protectionism of \nthe Greek king who once sought to turn back the tide and stood on the \nbeach commanding it not to come in, only to drown in the process. We \nmust not follow that path. But to avoid following\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\nthat path, we must have a strategy for success in the global \nmarketplace that involves a robust commitment to research and \ndevelopment in the new goods, the new services, the new technologies of \nthe future that will command good wages in the global marketplace, \nparticularly in the area of energy independence.\n  We have an opportunity, as a society, to create hundreds of thousands \nof good-paying jobs, to address our imbalance of payments, to \nstrengthen our finances, our economy, our environment, and our Nation's \nsecurity in the process. That commitment has been missing for too long.\n  It is penny-wise and pound-foolish when we cut back on our investment \nin research and development. It demonstrates a lack of national will \nwhen we do not commit ourselves to increased energy independence. That \nmust change.\n  What also must change is an increased commitment to an education for \nevery American child, particularly the less-fortunate third, so they \ncan be economically relevant in the global marketplace of today and \ntomorrow with the skills and the talents and the abilities to be \nglobally competitive.\n  For too many of our less fortunate children, that still is simply not \nthe case. So we have to redouble our efforts in K-12 education, and we \nneed to open up the doors of access to college opportunity for every \nAmerican child who is willing to work hard, play right, and do right \nthemselves to get there.\n  The growing gap between the haves and have nots in America today \nincreasingly is defined by those who have a college education and those \nwho do not. Over the last 20 years, those who dropped out of high \nschool or got a high school diploma that did not mean very much because \nthe grades were the result of social promotion rather than actual \nachievement have seen their standards of living decline precipitously. \nThose in our country who received a college degree have seen their \nstandards of living increase marginally. Those who have gotten an \nadvanced degree have seen a dramatic increase in their prosperity and \nstandard of living. So if we want to be globally competitive, we need \nto invest in the talents and the skills of our children and ensure that \nevery child can have a college opportunity. That is a debate for \nanother day. More needs to be done. More must be done if we are going \nto win the battle of global economic competition.\n  We also must do our part by committing ourselves to a course of \nfiscal sanity. The current budget imbalances simply are not \nsustainable, and they exacerbate the trade imbalance and the borrowing \nwe must undertake from abroad. When it comes to our own budget deficits \nand imbalance, we only have ourselves to blame. We have to summon the \nnational will to restore our finances, to ensure that we have a strong \nfinancial, fiscal situation in this country, to ensure that our \nchildren will inherit from us something better than our unpaid bills \nthat have to be paid with interest to foreign countries and \nincreasingly foreign banks. That is not right. We need to correct that \nsituation. We need to redouble our efforts to increase our national \nsavings through incentives for Americans to save more in the private \nsector so that we will increasingly be able to finance our demands at \nhome.\n  We need to look through the prism of innovation in all that we do to \nensure that we can be more rapid, more nimble, in terms of bringing new \ngoods and services to market, and when we do that we need to ensure \nthere is robust protection for our intellectual property rights abroad. \nAll too often, that is not the case. We cannot allow a situation to \ndevelop where, when we do our part through research and development, \nthrough education, through fiscal sanity, through increasing our own \ndomestic savings, through becoming more competitive and innovative, the \nfruits of that labor of that American genius are stolen by those abroad \nthrough violating our intellectual property rights. That cannot be \nallowed to continue further.\n  In addition to having a positive strategy for economic success in a \nglobal marketplace, we also have a moral responsibility to those who \nmay be dislocated through no fault of their own as a result of that \nglobal economic competition. We must reach out to those Americans who \nare displaced and ensure that they have an opportunity to get back on \nthe ladder of success, that every American has the prospect of being \nupwardly mobile in the global marketplace and that we do not just say \nto them, well, if they grew up 30 or 40 years ago and did not get the \neducation they need, if they happen to be employed in the wrong \nindustry that is suffering dislocations, that is too bad for them; they \nare in the scrap heap of history; they are on the wrong side of \nhistory; tough luck. That is social Darwinism, and we cannot take that \npath either.\n  For those of us who will benefit from the fruits of the global \nmarketplace, consumers and industries that are globally competitive and \nenjoy comparative advantage, we have to take some of that success, some \nof those benefits, and put it into training, retraining, job placement, \npension and health care portability, so that every American has a \nchance to be upwardly mobile and successful in the global marketplace.\n  There is also a growing consensus that even when we have done our \npart, even when we have adopted a strategy to be successful, even when \nwe have defined our comparative advantage, when we provided for those \nwho will be dislocated through no fault of their own, even when we have \ndone all of that, others must do their part, too. We cannot stand idly \nby and watch the ingenuity, hard work, and sacrifice of the American \npeople undone by the premeditated cheating--and that is what it is--of \nother countries because of their own narrow self-interests.\n  American workers and businesses too often are getting the shaft \ntoday, and that is not right. It is not right when those of us in the \nSenate stand idly by. It is not right when those in the administration \nturn a blind eye to this. That must change. We must enforce the rules \nof open global competition, and that is what our amendment will do. \nThat is our obligation to our fellow citizens and our children.\n  The cheating--and as I have said, that is what it is--comes in many \nforms, such as the theft of intellectual property. I am told that more \nthan 80 percent of the business software in China today is pirated. \nBarriers to U.S. exports, some in the form of tariffs, some not tariff \nbarriers, such as our beef exports to Japan today--more on that in a \nmoment--through currency manipulation, which we voted on in this Senate \nnot long ago, giving a built-in 25- to 30-percent advantage to \ncountries that do that--in this case, China--not because our workers \nare not as smart, not because they do not work as hard, not because the \nproducts are not as competitive, are simply because of financial \nengineering. Tens of thousands of Americans, when they get up in the \nmorning, before they get dressed and go to work, start off with that \nkind of disadvantage through no fault of their own. How can we possibly \nlook them in the face and tell them they are getting an even shake in \nthe global marketplace? How can we possibly call that free trade? It is \nnot. We know it is not. And it has to change.\n  Illegal subsidies is another form of cheating. Free rent, free power, \nloans never intended to be repaid--that is not free trade. It is the \nopposite of free trade. It is economic engineering by other countries \nto the detriment of American workers and businesses, and that has to \nstop. It is well known.\n  In its recent report to the Congress, the congressionally mandated \nand bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \nstated:\n\n       There was a general consensus in the testimony that China \n     remains in violation of its WTO obligations in a number of \n     important areas.\n\n  In a hearing before the Ways and Means Committee 2 weeks ago, a \nrepresentative of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce highlighted a number of \nconcerns:\n\n     . . . China's post-WTO accession use of industrial policy--\n\n  Not free trade, industrial policy--\n\n     including the use of targeted lending, subsidies, mandated \n     technology standards rather than voluntary, industry-led \n     international standards, discriminatory procurement policies, \n     and potentially, antitrust policy--to structure the \n     development of strategic sectors is of mounting concern.\n\n  Industrial policy, not free trade. That is what we seek to change, a \nglobal competitive marketplace where the\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\nlaws of comparative advantage will rule, where citizens of every \ncountry will have a right to work hard, think smart, be nimble, bring \ngoods and services to the marketplace, and let the best man and woman \nwin. Too often that is not the case today. It is the case on the part \nof our workers but not on the part of their competitors, and that is \nwhat has to stop. That is what this amendment will do.\n  Our Government is well aware of this but too often chooses to turn a \nblind eye. The time for the Senate turning a blind eye has to stop. I \nthink about the case of Batesville Tool and Die in Indiana and the fact \nthat their competitor, in this case from China, sells their product in \nthe United States of America for one-half of a penny above the cost of \nthe raw materials, leaving nothing for labor, nothing for \ntransportation, nothing for marketing. There has to be an illegal \nsubsidy there. It is the laws of physics and the laws of economics. \nCurrently there is nothing in our law that allows us to do anything \nabout it. If the laws of economics are going to make sense, our law \nbetter insist that we have a right to end this kind of industrial \npolicy and cheating. That is what our amendment will change.\n  I think about the National Association of Manufacturers, an \norganization that embraces free trade, and a pair of pliers they held \nup when we announced our amendment a few months ago, a pair of pliers \nsold at the cost of raw materials--the same thing, leaving nothing for \nanything else. Obviously an illegal subsidy violating the rules of the \nWTO is in place there, and that has to change.\n  I think about a foundry I visited in northeast Indiana where they \nstopped production so that I could address the workers several months \nago. A foundry is a dirty business. These guys had soot on their faces \nand grime on their clothes, and they gathered around to hear me speak. \nI looked at them, and I in good conscience could no longer look them in \nthe face, knowing the kind of burdens they labor under, the unlevel \nplaying field, the kind of cheating that takes place, knowing they are \nwilling to work hard for a living, and that too often that can be \nundone by those who are not willing to do the same or are willing to \ncheat to have their way. That is what has to stop, and that is what \nthis amendment will change.\n  The time has come to take a stand. Our prosperity is at stake. The \nglobal marketplace, the global trading system, cannot work. When our \nglobal competitors have a comparative advantage, we buy their goods, \nbut then when we have a comparative advantage, when American workers \ncan produce something quicker, smarter, and cheaper than anybody \nelse, they still do not get to sell their products abroad. They are \nstill defeated at home because of cheating. It just will not work, and \nthat is what this amendment will help to change. Our national \nsovereignty is at stake, our very sovereignty as a nation.\n\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues or the American people \nnoticed several weeks ago that the President of the United States got \non the phone and he called his colleague, the Prime Minister of Japan, \nand he said: You have been keeping our beef exports out of your country \nfor too long. We are pretty good at producing beef in the United \nStates, and you are using the excuse--and it is an excuse now--of the \nmad cow scare a couple of years ago as an informal trading barrier to \nkeep our products out. You know what, we buy a lot from you. You ought \nto bring this nontariff barrier down. It is only the right thing to do.\n  So they had this exchange, and then shortly thereafter, whether by \naccident or not, the Prime Minister happened to say, well, maybe the \ntime has come for Japan to start diversifying its financial holdings \nout of dollar-denominated assets, and for the next several hours the \nvalue of our currency, the value of our money, began to go into a free \nfall until some bureaucrat down in the bowels of the Finance Ministry \ncame out and said the Prime Minister did not really know what he was \ntalking about, it is not true.\n  Well, that is one thing. But a couple of weeks before that, there was \na rumor going through Seoul, the same kind of thing--maybe the South \nKoreans would start diversifying out of dollar-denominated assets. That \nstarted a run on our currency, too.\n  It is not a sign of strength, it is not a sign of independence, it is \nnot a sign of security when something as fundamental as the value of \nour money can be undermined by a slip of the tongue or a premeditated \nstatement or a rumor sweeping a foreign capital. That is not the sign \nof a great nation; it is the sign of dependency, of weakness. It is \nsomething that can no longer be allowed to continue if we are going to \nhave the kind of security for our children that we want them to have \nand that they deserve.\n  Make no mistake, our Nation's security is at stake. A strong military \nand the current financial imbalances we are running cannot be sustained \nindefinitely.\n  There was a book several years ago by Paul Kennedy called ``The Rise \nand Fall of Great Powers.'' It pointed out that the undoing of great \nnations had all too often been the result of their economic and \nfinancial weakness.\n  The percentage of GDP we are currently spending on national security \nand military expenditures substantially outstrips that of our economic \ncompetitors, freeing them to invest a substantially greater percentage \nof their wealth in productive assets.\n  As the only global superpower and the principal leader in the war \nagainst terror, we cannot afford to cut back on our investment in \nnational security. At the very least, we can insist that those who \nbenefit from our efforts in the fight against terror, who benefit from \nour efforts to provide for global security, play by the same set of \neconomic rules so that we do not undercut the very prosperity that \nallows us to fight the war on terror and provide for global economic \nsecurity. The two have to go hand in hand. For the last several years \nthere has been a decoupling that cannot go on indefinitely. If we do \nnot correct this situation, we not only undermine our prosperity and \nour financial strength, we undermine our very sovereignty and our \nNation's security. The debate about leveling the field and enforcing \nthe rules on global trade is very much, in the long run, a debate about \nnational security as well.\n\n  Finally, let me sum up by saying two things. First, I know a lot of \npeople want to talk about China. We had a debate on that and a vote \nwith regard to currency manipulation a couple of weeks ago. Our \nrelationship with China is one of the most important relationships over \nthe next 50 to 100 years. They are a great nation with a great culture \nand a bright future. Our relationship with them will be at times \ncomplex and difficult. It is only going to work if the relationship is \nmutually beneficial in a number of ways, and in the economic arena as \nwell.\n  The nation of China has its challenges and we want to see them \nsuccessfully meet those challenges. But we have challenges, too, and \nthey must be committed, equally committed to seeing us meet our \nchallenges if this relationship is going to work as it must. It is \nsimply not right that to ease the absorption of surplus workers in \nagriculture in China, we are asked artificially to throw out of work \nand put out of business American workers and businesses in our \nheartland. That is fundamentally not just. Stability and growth in \nChina are important, and we should help them in that regard but not at \nthe cost of our own. It is time that we insisted we achieve both.\n  Let me conclude by saying I am optimistic about our future. With the \nright kind of leadership there is little that the American people \ncannot accomplish. But as the old saying goes: If you don't know where \nyou are going, well, any road will lead you there. We must have a \nstrategy for success and prosperity. If we do, I am convinced we can \nget the job done because we have done it before.\n  If I had been addressing this Senate 100 years ago, more than half of \nour workers would have been employed in agriculture--more than half. \nToday it is about 3 or 4 percent. As we made the transition from an \nagricultural economy to a manufacturing-based economy, the United \nStates of America did not dry up and blow away. There were difficulties \nbut we met the challenge. We reinvented our economy and increased our \nprosperity and our standing in the world as a result.\n  If I had been addressing this Senate 50 years ago, more than 30 \npercent of\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\nthe American workers would have been employed in manufacturing. Today \nit is about 12 percent. Again, as the global economy began to change, \nas our domestic economy began to change, we did not dry up and blow \naway. There were difficulties. There were challenges. But we have been \ngrowing the service sector of the economy and the innovative and other \nparts of the economy.\n  So as we fight to save every kind of manufacturing job where we can \nbe competitive in advanced manufacturing and other sections of the \nmanufacturing sector, we have grown other parts of the American economy \nas well. We can continue to do that but only if we are willing to stand \nup for American interests and competitiveness and not allow the genius \nof our people to be stolen and undermined by the premeditated cheating \nand self-interest of other nations to which we turn a blind eye, or \ndon't have the stomach to stand up to. That has to stop and that is \nwhat our amendment will do.\n  It will enable the American people to preserve our prosperity--when \nwe are right, when we are competitive, when we have an advantage--and \nwill enable us to go on and grow parts of our economy and grow good \njobs at good wages where we have that advantage and allow our consumers \nto buy products from countries where they have the advantage. It will \ndo right by our children. It will do justice to our workers. It will \nstrengthen our national security, our sovereignty, our finances, and \nour prosperity. It is the right thing to do, and that is why I propose \nthis amendment and that is why I ask for my colleagues' support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator, it is my understanding, is one that has been in consideration \nin the Finance Committee. There is a freestanding bill called \n``Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act of 2005.'' Is that correct?\n  Mr. BAYH. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the chairman of the committee has \nadvised me that they have been working on this bill for quite some \ntime. As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and \nauthor of the highway bill, I suggest there are titles of the bill that \nare not within the jurisdiction of my committee. One is the Finance \nCommittee title. The title is not yet here, so we do not have that to \nconsider at this time.\n  I think it would be more appropriate later on, after we receive the \ntitle, to debate that in the normal process of legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  First, let me say I am profoundly disappointed by the way this issue \nhas been handled over the past several weeks.\n  My staff has been working hard with some of the proponents of this \nlegislation to fully understand the pros and cons of the legislation.\n  In fact, a meeting was held with the proponents just prior to a press \nrelease being issued saying that a hold was being placed on a nominee \nunless a vote were taken on the bill.\n  I thought we were making good progress. Needless to say, I was very \nsurprised to learn of that development. No one asked me about it.\n  Let's be clear, I share concerns about China's economic policies and \nthe impact of those policies on international trade and the U.S. \neconomy.\n  At this point, however, I'm not convinced that the Bayh amendment is \nthe best possible policy response we can provide to China's economic \npolicies.\n  The amendment would substantively change United States trade law, and \nit is imperative that the repercussions be fully understood before we \nmove ahead with the proposed change.\n  That's why the committee process should not be circumvented. The \nFinance Committee has jurisdiction over issues of international trade, \nand its expertise should be brought to bear on any trade issue before \nits consideration by the full Senate.\n  When that process is not respected, we run the risk of adopting ill-\nthought out policy which in the end could undermine the very intent of \nlegislation that is rushed in as an amendment, as Senator Bayh proposes \nwe do in this case.\n  For starters, I understand that the bill may not even be necessary, \nas it's possible this change could be implemented administratively \nrather than legislatively.\n  We should explore with Administration officials the feasibility of \nimplementing an administrative change, what that would entail and how \nthat might best be accomplished.\n  The proposed legislation doesn't give the Commerce Department any \nflexibility to develop appropriate regulations and procedures to \nimplement this provision.\n  Such a significant change from established practice should at least \nincorporate sufficient flexibility so that it can be implemented \nproperly. Otherwise, proponents run the risk of undermining their very \ngoal.\n  Why wouldn't proponents want to ensure that such a significant change \nin the operation of our trade laws is implemented properly?\n  Again, that's why the Finance Committee should have the opportunity \nto address the details.\n  There are other repercussions that should be examined. How does the \nproposed legislation relate to China's accession to the WTO for \nexample?\n  Is it consistent with the terms of our bilateral agreement on China's \nWTO accession?\n  Those questions should be answered before we move ahead on this \nlegislation.\n  Another very serious issue is the relationship between this \nlegislation and existing U.S. trade law.\n  It's quite possible that by adopting this bill we could undermine the \napplication of U.S. antidumping law, and I doubt any of my colleagues \nwould advocate that result.\n  It is even possible that this amendment could force us to relinquish \napplication of the nonmarket antidumping methodology in dumping cases.\n  That question needs to be addressed thoroughly before we move ahead \non this legislation. Proponents may offer blanket assertions to the \ncontrary, but that is not sufficient, in my view.\n  We should not run the risk of undermining our trade laws by pushing \nthis amendment onto a bill today.\n  I hope Senator Bayh will reconsider his decision and withdraw the \namendment.\n  If not, I hope my colleagues will join with me in opposing his \namendment until we can fully appreciate its repercussions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will be glad to respond to any questions the Senator \nhas, after I get one thing taken care of here.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:30 p.m. the Senate \nproceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 39, \nthe nomination of J. Michael Seabright, to be U.S. district judge for \nthe Southern District of Hawaii; provided further that there be 30 \nminutes for debate equally divided between the chairman and the ranking \nmember or designees, and that at the expiration or yielding back of the \ntime, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination with no intervening action or debate; provided further that \nfollowing the vote, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, as we said over and over again, I have a \nlist of about eight amendments people have said they want to come down \nand offer. This is the third day now we have been inviting them to come \ndown. So far only Senator Thune has brought his amendment in. We did \nadopt that amendment. I encourage others to come down.\n  I think this could very well be considered by most people the most \nsignificant vote on a bill we will be considering on the floor this \nentire year. We want to make sure, while we have the time, that we give \nadequate consideration and time for the amendments that different \nMembers may have. I invite them to come down at any time during this \nprocess. With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAYH. Did my colleague have a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding the junior Senator from Missouri \nwould like to have the floor for consideration of an amendment. But I \nwill yield the floor at this time.\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                 amendment no. 582 to amendment no. 567\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I have an amendment to send to the desk. \nI ask unanimous consent the Bayh amendment be set aside so I can do \nthat, offer the amendment; and then, at the end of the 3 or 4 minutes I \nam going to use to offer the amendment, that we would go back to the \nBayh amendment. That would be my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Talent] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 582 to amendment No. 567.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a \nprogram to promote the safe and efficient operation of first responder \n                               vehicles)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FIRST RESPONDER VEHICLE SAFETY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, in \n     consultation with the Administrator, National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration, shall--\n       (1) develop and implement a comprehensive program to \n     promote compliance with State and local laws intended to \n     increase the safe and efficient operation of first responder \n     vehicles;\n       (2) compile a list of best practices by State and local \n     governments to promote compliance with the laws described in \n     paragraph (1);\n       (3) analyze State and local laws intended to increase the \n     safe and efficient operation of first responder vehicles; and\n       (4) develop model legislation to increase the safe and \n     efficient operation of first responder vehicles.\n       (b) Partnerships.--The Secretary may enter into \n     partnerships with qualified organizations to carry out this \n     section.\n       (c) Public Outreach.--The Secretary shall use a variety of \n     public outreach strategies to carry out this section, \n     including public service announcements, publication of \n     informational materials, and posting information on the \n     Internet.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal \n     year 2006 to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma and my \nfriend from Indiana for allowing me to get this amendment pending. I am \nvery hopeful we will eventually get it accepted. I am working with the \nchairman and ranking members of both the full committee and \nsubcommittee to get that done.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to address the problem of the \nincreasing number of accidents occurring in which either parked first \nresponder vehicles are rear-ended by other vehicles or the first \nresponder is struck after leaving the vehicle.\n  In first responders--such an antiseptic term--we are talking about \nour police officers, our ambulance workers and drivers, our \nfirefighters who are dealing with the issue of a car that is parked on \nthe side of the road, maybe because the police officer pulled the car \naside, or because the car has been abandoned, or it is on fire. It is \nall too often the case in this country that our first responders who \nare working on those situations are injured or killed by a passing \nvehicle.\n  I will share the story of a Missouri law enforcement officer who \ntragically lost his life this way. I know there have been many more \nsuch as him around the country. Michael Newton was a State trooper for \nthe Missouri highway patrol. He stopped a vehicle on Interstate 70 in \nLafayette County, MO, for a traffic violation on May 22, 2003. He and \nthe other driver were sitting in the patrol car when they were struck \nfrom behind by a pickup carrying a flatbed trailer. Trooper Newton died \nat the scene. The driver he had stopped suffered serious burns. Trooper \nNewton was only 25 years old. He left a wife, two young sons, many \nloving relatives, and a community that deeply mourned his loss and was \nvery grateful for his service to the State of Missouri.\n  In 2003, 193 other people lost their lives in crashes involving \nemergency vehicles, including 141 lives lost in crashes involving \npolice vehicles, 29 lives lost in those involving ambulances, and 24 \nlives lost in crashes involving firetrucks.\n  According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \nvehicle-related incidents are the No. 1 cause of police officer \ninjuries and the No. 2 cause of police officer deaths. In 2004, 73 out \nof 153 police officer deaths were vehicle related. Not all of those \ninvolved parked cars, but most of them did.\n  I was very surprised to see those statistics and deeply concerned \nthat we have not informed people and raised their awareness about this \nproblem. That is what this amendment is designed to do. My Pass With \nCare amendment requires the Secretary to start a nationwide publicity \ncampaign through public service announcements, developing a Web site, \nproviding informational materials, to increase public awareness of this \ncrucial safety issue.\n  Our first responders, our police, our firefighters, our ambulance \nworkers dedicate their lives to helping protect the rest of us. They \nsave so many lives through their heroic efforts. If more people realize \nthey can help protect our first responders by quickly and safely \npulling over when they hear an emergency siren or being more careful \nwhen they see a first responder vehicle parked on the road or the \nshoulder of the road, that will reduce the risks for our law \nenforcement, health workers, and firefighters.\n  The amendment requires the Secretary, in consultation with the \nNational Highway Safety Administration, to develop and implement a \nprogram to promote compliance with State Pass With Care laws and ``move \nover'' laws. Those laws govern how motorists pass and yield to first \nresponders' vehicles.\n  The Secretary, under my amendment, would compile a list of best \npractices to promote compliance with such laws, would conduct an \nanalysis of the various State and local laws that deal with the safety \nof first responder vehicles, and from that analysis develop model \nlegislation that States can adopt should they choose to do so.\n  Unfortunately, only 27 States currently have Pass With Care laws or \n``move over'' laws. The amendment would help give guidance to the \nremaining States on drafting laws that would help save lives. The \nSecretary would be authorized to enter into partnerships with safety \norganizations and engage with public outreach to help improve first \nresponder safety.\n\n  This is not an amendment that would be coercive on the States. I \ntried to be sensitive to that in drafting it. It is what we can do as \nan alternative to mandating the States in this area to help provide a \nclearinghouse of information for them to help develop model legislation \nand also in appropriate ways to develop an increased public awareness \nof this problem.\n  If people become more aware of this as the bill goes through and as a \nresult of an awareness campaign the Secretary would conduct, that in \nitself would probably reduce the number of deaths.\n  I was surprised to hear of the number of first responders who are \nimperiled. If we can help them by raising awareness, I think we ought \nto do it. I am pleased to introduce the amendment on behalf of our \nfirst responders at risk on our roads and highways. They should not be \nat risk. I urge the Senate to pass the amendment to help strengthen \nthese laws, and ensure the safety of our first responders.\n  I certainly am willing to work with the managers of the bill to help \ndeal with any concerns they may have regarding the wording of the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4378]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4378-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4378-S4380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF J. MICHAEL SEABRIGHT TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF HAWAII\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of J. Michael Seabright, of \nHawaii, to be United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 30 \nminutes, equally divided, for debate on the nomination.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased and hnored to speak in \nsupport of J. Michael Seabright of Honolulu, Hawaii, who has been \nnominated by the President to serve as a Federal district court judge \nfor the District of Hawaii.\n  Mr. Seabright graduated magna cum laude from his undergraduate alma \nmater of Tulane University, before going on to attend The National Law \nCenter at George Washington University, where he received his juris \ndoctor and graduated with high honors as a member of the Order of the \nCoif.\n  At George Washington, he further distinguished himself by serving as \nthe editor of the George Washington Journal of International Law & \nEconomics.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Seabright since he arrived in \nHawaii 20 years ago, having watched him as he successfully became a \nmember of the Hawaii State Bar Association, and became involved in our \ncommunity.\n  Now Mr. Seabright stands out as a leader in the legal side of law \nenforcement, where he developed the District of Hawaii plan for \nimplementing ``Operation Triggerlock-Hawaii,'' a Federal-local effort \naimed at the prosecution of violent armed career criminals in Federal \ncourt.\n  His broad experience in prosecution, from violent crimes to \ngovernment corruption, have provided him a balanced perspective of the \ncriminal justice system that will continue to serve him well as he \nprepares for this most recent development in his career of public \nservice.\n  Mr. Seabright's work for Hawaii goes beyond his professional \ncommitments as an assistant U.S. attorney, however. He has served on \nthe Hawaii Supreme Court's disciplinary board since 1995 and holds the \nchairmanship of its rules committee, which is charged with the drafting \nproposed rules for the Hawaii Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  He was also a member of the Hawaii State Board of Bar Examiners, and \nhas been an adjunct professor at the University of Hawaii William S. \nRichardson School of Law.\n  This extraordinary record of achievement has now culminated with his \nnomination to the Federal bench, and amply supports the favorable \nreports he has received from the Hawaii State Bar Association, the \nAmerican Bar Association, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  I am confident that his record will prove equally impressive to the \nfull Senate, and I trust that he will become the 206th of Mr. Bush's \njudicial nominees to be confirmed to the Federal bench. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in voting in favor of Mr. Seabright.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join \nSenator Inouye in support of the nomination of Mr. J. Michael Seabright \nfor the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii. The Hawaii \nState Bar Association has found Mr. Seabright to be highly qualified \nfor the position of U.S. District Court Judge in Hawaii. This is of \nsignificant importance to me, as I value the opinion of Hawaii's legal \ncommunity in evaluating those nominated to serve as judges.\n  Mr. Seabright has practiced law in the State of Hawaii for over 20 \nyears, in a number of capacities, including both private practice and \npublic service. Mr. Seabright has been employed by the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the District of Hawaii for the past 15 years, and he has \nheaded the white-collar and organized crime section since 2002.\n  I am very pleased that this position, after being vacant for so many \nyears, will now be filled by an individual as qualified as J. Michael \nSeabright. For the past few years, I have heard from jurists and a \nnumber of attorneys in Hawaii about the need to fill this judicial \nvacancy. I am encouraged to see that with the consideration of this \nnominee the Senate will continue its tradition of fulfilling its advice \nand consent role under the Constitution.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Mr. Seabright's nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has taken some time, but the Senate \nRepublican leadership will finally allow the Senate to consider the \nnomination of Michael Seabright to be a United States District Court \nJudge for Hawaii. I commend the distinguished Senators from Hawaii for \ntheir effort in identifying this consensus nominee. When Mr. Seabright \nis confirmed by an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of the Senate, he will \nbe the 206th nominee of this President confirmed to a lifetime \nappointment to our Federal courts.\n  This is only the second judicial nomination Senate Republicans have \nbeen willing to consider all year. There has been no filibuster of \njudicial nominees this year. Instead, it is the Senate Republican \nleadership that, through its deliberate inaction, is keeping judgeships \nunnecessarily vacant for months. With this nomination and with the \nnomination of Judge Crotty, I was the one asking for months for the \nnomination to be considered, debated, voted, and confirmed. For the \nlast several weeks, I have been calling upon the Republican readership \nto proceed to the confirmation of Michael Seabright to the District \nCourt of Hawaii.\n  All Democrats on the Judiciary Committee had been prepared to vote \nfavorably on this nomination for some time. We were prepared to report \nthe nomination last year, but it was not listed by the then-chairman on \na committee agenda. I thank Chairman Specter for including Mr. \nSeabright at our meeting on March 17. The nomination was unanimously \nreported and has been on the Senate Executive Calendar for more than a \nmonth. It is Senate Republicans who resisted a vote on this judicial \nnominee, not Democrats. In their fashion, they did so without any \nexplanation akin to the anonymous ``holds'' that doomed more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees not so long ago.\n  Once confirmed, Mr. Seabright will be the 206th of 216 nominees \nbrought before the full Senate for a vote to be confirmed. That means \nthat 829 of the 875 authorized judgeships in the Federal judiciary, or \n95 percent, will be filled. It is regrettable that Republican delay has \nnow pushed the Senate behind even the pace set by the Republican \nmajority in 1999, when President Clinton was in the White House. That \nyear, the Senate Republican leadership did not allow the Senate to \nconsider any circuit court nominees for the entire session and only 17 \ndistrict court nominees were confirmed. The Republican Senate has \nfallen behind that pace.\n  Of the 47 judicial vacancies now existing, President Bush has not \neven sent nominees for 29 of those vacancies, more than half. I have \nbeen encouraging the Bush administration to work with Senators to \nidentify qualified and consensus judicial nominees and do so, again, \ntoday. The Democratic leader and I sent the President a letter in this \nregard on April 5, but we have received no response.\n  It is now the last week in April. We are almost one-third through the \nyear and so far the President has sent only one new nominee for a \nFederal court vacancy all year--only one. Instead of sending back \ndivisive nominees, would it not be better for the country, the courts, \nthe American people, the Senate, and the administration if the White \nHouse would work with us to identify, and for the President to \nnominate, more consensus nominees such as Michael Seabright who can be \nconfirmed quickly with strong, bipartisan votes?\n  I commend the Senators from Hawaii for their efforts to work \ncooperatively to fill judicial vacancies. I only wish Republicans had \ntreated President Clinton's nominees to vacancies in Hawaii with \nsimilar courtesy. Had they, there would not have been the vacancies on \nthe Ninth Circuit and on the District Court. The work of the Senators \nfrom Hawaii is indicative of the type of bipartisan efforts Senate \nDemocrats have made with this President\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\nand remain willing to make. We can work together to fill judicial \nvacancies with qualified, consensus nominees. The vast majority of the \nmore than 200 judges confirmed during the last 3\\1/2\\ years were \nconfirmed with bipartisan support.\n  The truth is that in President Bush's first term, the 204 judges \nconfirmed were more than were confirmed in either of President Clinton \ntwo terms, more than during the term of this President's father, and \nmore than in Ronald Reagan's first term when he was being assisted by a \nRepublican majority in the Senate. By last December, we had reduced \njudicial vacancies from the 110 vacancies I inherited in the summer of \n2001 to the lowest level, lowest rate and lowest number in decades, \nsince Ronald Reagan was in office.\n  The Hawaii judgeship at issue here has been vacant for more than 4 \nyears, since December of 2000 when Judge Alan Kay took senior status. \nPresident Clinton made a nomination to that seat in advance of the \nvacancy, but the Republicans in control of the Senate refused to act on \nit. They preserved the vacancy for a Republican President.\n  In 2002, President Bush nominated James Rohlfing to the vacancy. That \nnomination failed, however, because in the view of his home State \nSenators and the American Bar Association, he was not qualified for the \nposition. It took the White House more than 2 additional years to \nagree. Finally, in May 2004 that nomination was withdrawn by President \nBush.\n  The administration finally got it right after consultation with the \nHawaii Senators. The President sent Michael Seabright's name to the \nSenate last September. An outstanding attorney who has experience in \nprivate practice as well as a sterling reputation as an Assistant \nUnited States Attorney, Mr. Seabright merited consideration and swift \nconfirmation. Despite his reputation as a law-and-order Republican, \nRepublicans would not move on Mr. Seabright's nomination last Congress. \nThe President took his time renominating Mr. Seabright and even then it \ntook repeated requests to get his nomination included on the agenda of \nthe committee. When he was considered on March 17, he was reported with \nunanimous support. Senate Democrats have long supported and requested \naction on this nomination.\n  I have been urging this President and Senate Republicans for years to \nwork with all Senators and engage in genuine, bipartisan consultation. \nThat process leads to the nomination, confirmation, and appointment of \nconsensus nominees with reputations for fairness. The Seabright \nnomination, the bipartisan support of his home State Senators, and the \ncommittee's action by a unanimous bipartisan vote is a perfect example \nof what I have been urging.\n  I have noted that there are currently 29 judicial vacancies for which \nthe President has delayed sending a nominee. In fact, he has sent the \nSenate only one new judicial nominee all year. I wish he would work \nwith all Senators to fill those remaining vacancies rather than through \nhis inaction and unnecessarily confrontational approach manufacture \nlongstanding vacancies. It is as if the President and his most partisan \nsupporters want to create a crisis.\n  Over the last weeks, we have heard some extremists call for mass \nimpeachments of judges, court-stripping, and punishing judges by \nreducing court budgets. Now we are seeing an effort at religious \nMcCarthyism by which Republican partisans inject religion into these \nmatters. Rather than promote crisis and confrontation, I urge the \nPresident to disavow the divisive campaign and, instead, do what most \nothers have and work with us to identify outstanding consensus \nnominees. It ill serves the country, the courts and, most importantly, \nthe American people for this administration and the Senate Republican \nleadership to continue down the road to conflict.\n  The Seabright nomination shows how unnecessary that conflict really \nis. Let us join together to debate and confirm consensus nominees to \nthese important lifetime posts on the Federal judiciary.\n  It is the Federal judiciary that is called upon to rein in the \npolitical branches when their actions contravene the constitutional \nlimits on governmental authority and restrict individual rights. It is \nthe Federal judiciary that has stood up to the overreaching of this \nadministration in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.\n  It is more and more the Federal judiciary that is being called upon \nto protect Americans' rights and liberties, our environment and to \nuphold the rule of law as the political branches under the control of \none party have overreached. Federal judges should protect the rights of \nall Americans, not be selected to advance a partisan or personal \nagenda. Once the judiciary is filled with partisans beholden to the \nadministration and willing to reinterpret the Constitution in line with \nthe administration's demands, who will be left to protect American \nvalues and the rights of the American people?\n  The Constitution establishes the Senate as a check and a balance on \nthe choices of a powerful President who might seek to make the Federal \njudiciary an extension of his administration or a wholly-owned \nsubsidiary of his political party. Today, Republicans are threatening \nto take away one of the few remaining checks on the power of the \nExecutive branch by their use of what has become knows as the nuclear \noption. This assault on our tradition of checks and balances and on the \nprotection of minority rights in the Senate and in our democracy should \nbe abandoned. Eliminating the filibuster by the nuclear option would \ndestroy the Constitution's design of the Senate as an effective check \non the Executive. The elimination of the filibuster would reduce any \nincentive for a President to consult with home State Senators or seek \nthe advice of the Senate on lifetime appointments to the Federal \njudiciary. It is a leap not only toward one-party rule but to an \nunchecked executive.\n  Rather than blowing up the Senate, let us honor the constitutional \ndesign of our system of checks and balances and work together to fill \njudicial vacancies with consensus nominees. The nuclear option is \nunnecessary. What is needed is a return to consultation and for the \nWhite House to recognize and respect the role of the Senate \nappointments process.\n  The American people have begun to see this threatened partisan power \ngrab for what it is and to realize that the threat and the potential \nharm are aimed at our democracy, at an independent and strong federal \njudiciary and, ultimately, at their rights and freedoms.\n  Mr. President, I commend the two Senators from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye and \nMr. Akaka, for their support and their work with the White House in \ngetting this nominee to the floor. I commend the White House for \nworking with them.\n  This nominee was confirmed unanimously in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Republicans and Democrats joined alike. I urge on our side \nof the aisle that all Senators vote for him.\n  I have been advised by the distinguished members of the Republican \nside of the aisle that they are willing to yield back their time. So I \nask that all time on either side on this nominee be yielded back so we \ncan go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof J. Michael Seabright, of Hawaii, to be United States District Judge \nfor the District of Hawaii?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, the Bayh amendment \nwill be the pending amendment.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to show my strong support \nfor the Bayh amendment on countervailing duties, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I commend my friend and colleague from Indiana for his \nvision on the issue of what we need to do to create a level playing \nfield for our businesses and workers. This is an important amendment.\n  I have spoken forcefully about our need to address the unfair trade \npractices of those with whom we trade. A necessary step in this process \nis to change those U.S. laws that hinder our industries from operating \non a level playing field. That is what this amendment addresses. Our \nbusinesses, our workers have an expectation that we will provide a \nlevel playing field for them, and we need to deliver on that. This \namendment is a good step in that direction.\n  Unfair trade practices are hurting our U.S. manufacturers and costing \njobs. In my State of Michigan, I regret to say, we now have the highest \nunemployment rate in the country. At the time when our Nation's \ncountervailing duty laws were approved in 1979, the Department of \nCommerce decided it was impracticable to apply those laws to nonmarket \neconomies such as China due to the difficulty of determining what \ndefines a government subsidy within the context of a state-controlled \neconomy.\n  However, since that time, many nonmarket economies have undertaken \nsignificant economic reforms that have liberalized the state control \nover their economies. Unfortunately, however, some of these nations, \nsuch as China, refuse to comply with standard international trading \nrules and practices and use subsidies and other economic incentives to \ngive their producers an unfair competitive advantage. This has a direct \nimpact on job loss in Michigan, as well as in other States.\n  As we all know--and it has been documented--these subsidies range \nfrom currency manipulation, to providing below interest rate loans to \nless than creditworthy companies, to providing preferential access to \nraw materials and other input. I should mention that I was very proud \nto be a part of the effort to get a very strong vote a few weeks ago; \n67 Members on both sides of the aisle joined to send a message both to \nthe White House and to China that we expect China to stop manipulating \ntheir currency, which means it costs more for us to sell to them than \nfor them to sell to us. It is part of what we need to do to level the \nplaying field. I hope that because we have joined together in the vote \nwe had on a very strong bipartisan basis, we will see the same kind of \nvote on this Bayh amendment.\n  I will give you a few examples of how this hurts Michigan \nmanufacturers and workers directly. Counterfeit automotive products are \na very big problem in Michigan. Not only does it kill American jobs, \nbut it has the potential to kill Americans as cheap, shoddy automotive \nproducts replace legitimate ones of higher quality. The American \nautomotive parts components industry loses an estimated $12 billion in \nsales on a global basis to counterfeiting. This must stop. We don't \neven keep statistics on the potential loss of life.\n  The United States is losing manufacturing jobs as a direct result of \nChina's policies. China's policies have cost our economy 1.5 million \njobs in the last 15 years and 51,000 jobs alone in Michigan. These job \nlosses are hurting all of our manufacturers, from apple juice, to auto \nparts, to clothing, to furniture.\n  At this stage, U.S. industries have no direct recourse to combat \nsubsidies used by nonmarket economies. They must rely upon the Federal \nGovernment to negotiate a settlement, or on the dispute settlement \nprocesses of international organizations, such as the WTO.\n  Why do we put such a strain on our own businesses? The remedies \navailable currently might eventually lead to relief, but it takes years \nto see relief. We are losing jobs every day. There are headlines every \nday in Michigan about job loss. We have to have a sense of urgency here \nin the Senate and in the Congress and in the White House.\n  The Bayh amendment would change the situation to ensure that \nnonmarket economies are subject to the same countervailing duty laws as \nall other trading nations.\n  At a recent Finance Committee hearing on his nomination, Congressman \nPortman said he thinks ``we . . . need an additional focus on China. \nAfter a top-to-bottom review, I would plan to shift some resources, \nincluding some people to that effort.''\n  I certainly encourage him to do that. I also want to indicate at this \ntime that Congressman Portman indicated support for a focus on creating \nan international trade prosecutor, or some people in his office who \nwould focus on the role of prosecutor more broadly on those other \ncountries that are violating rules. Senator Bayh has been a champion of \nthat effort, and I am very proud he has joined with me and Senator \nGraham in South Carolina in introducing specific legislation that \nrelates to creating an international trade prosecutor as well. All of \nthese pieces are important. We have taken one step to sending a message \nto China and to the administration that we expect them to address the \nissue of currency manipulation.\n  Now, this amendment is a very important piece in leveling the playing \nfield for our businesses and our workers. I also urge that we \nincorporate an international trade prosecutor who will be our American \nvoice for business and for workers on the broad issue of continuing to \nmake sure the rules are fair. I think these pieces together create hope \nfor the people we represent, whom we, in fact, would stand up for and \nstand up for American jobs.\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\n  While I have the floor, I want to speak briefly about something else \nthat also relates to American jobs. In addition to this important \namendment, we will be focusing on the broader issue of a strong SAFETEA \nTransportation bill. I am hopeful that we are going to get this done as \nquickly as possible. I am pleased that we have begun the process of \ndebating this critical issue.\n  The snow finally has melted in Michigan--at least for the moment--and \nwe are in the beginning of a new construction season. During the budget \ndebate, I was pleased to join with Senator Talent to lead an effort on \nan amendment to help the Senate produce a well-funded Transportation \nbill. I know Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus are working hard to \nhelp strengthen this bill that is in front of us.\n\n  As my colleagues know, this bill isn't just about improving roads and \ntransit systems and buses, but it is about creating jobs. Again, it is \nabsolutely critical that we do everything possible to create American \njobs and do it as quickly as possible. The Transportation bill is one \nof the fastest ways that we can bring good-paying jobs back to our \nStates.\n  The Department of Transportation estimates that every $1 billion of \nhighway spending creates 47,500 new, good-paying jobs, and it generates \nmore than $2 billion in economic activity.\n  Mr. President, we need this bill now. If there are efforts to extend \nit, we need to have it be a short extension beyond May 31. My \npreference is to get this done before the end of May because we are \ngoing to lose another construction season if we do not. We in Michigan \nhave projects ready to go the minute this bill is signed. It is \nabsolutely critical that we get this done as soon as possible.\n  Over the last 4 years, Michigan has lost jobs. This bill, as I said, \nwould create good-paying jobs that would help thousands of our families \nin Michigan. We are not talking about minimum wage jobs, we are talking \nabout well-paying jobs, good-paying jobs that help families pay their \nmortgages and save for retirement and put their children through \nschool.\n  Last year's bipartisan Senate bill that passed overwhelmingly would \nhave created over 99,000 jobs in Michigan alone. It is my hope that the \nSenate will pass another strong bill. I understand that the House and \nthe White House did not support the effort that we passed. Even though \nit was an important bipartisan effort and it showed in the Senate the \nbest about governing, in my opinion, and people worked very hard on \nboth sides of the aisle, it is very unfortunate that this was not \nsupported by the House or the White House. Now we have a bill back in \nfront of us and we need to make it the best we can possibly make it so \nthat we are creating jobs and meeting the needs of our communities. We \ncannot fix the problems that we have in our States in terms of \ninfrastructure and traffic congestion and issues of jobs and so on \nwithout the very best bill possible.\n  I am very hopeful--and I will do everything within my power, working \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle--to get the fairest, best \nbill that we can for the people we represent and to get that as quickly \nas we possibly can.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Bayh amendment and \nto move on to put together the final bill in the best way possible for \nboth those States such as mine, which are donor States, as well as for \nthe other States around the country, so that we can create the jobs \nthat are needed as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the Senator \nfrom Michigan, for her generous words, but for her leadership as well \non both of these important issues. She understands very well the \nTransportation bill will create jobs for our construction workers in \nthe short run and will improve our productivity in the long run but \nthat it is just part of a bigger piece of improving America's economic \ncompetitiveness, and a big part of that, in Michigan and Indiana and \nthe other 48 States, is when workers want to work hard, be smart, play \nby the rules, do the right thing, they need to be rewarded for those \nefforts and not have their hard-working sacrifices unfairly taken from \nthem by global competitors who do not play by the rules, who cheat, and \nare not willing to make the tough decisions our businesses and workers \nare asked to make.\n  I thank her for her leadership and for her kind words and look \nforward to working with her on these and other issues.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, right now the pending business is the Bayh \namendment. I stress again that both Senator Jeffords and I are inviting \nanyone to come down with amendments they have. Senator Bayh has \ngraciously agreed to set his aside for the consideration of any other \namendments, and then we would go back to his amendment. So I would not \nwant any Members who are watching the proceedings to believe they \ncannot get their amendment in. We do encourage them to bring their \namendments down. I would hate to have all of these stacked up at the \nlast minute. Now is the time to get consideration for amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today, our third day of debate on \nthe highway bill.\n  As we have stated before, this is vital legislation that will have an \nimpact on every American.\n  I join Senator Inhofe in calling on my colleagues to come to the \nfloor to offer amendments. With that said, I would like to address some \nof the important provisions in this bill.\n  I would like to spend a minute talking about bridges and our need to \nmake sure that adequate funding exists to maintain these structures.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have a passion for bridges and \nspecifically covered bridges.\n  While covered bridges are no longer critical parts of our Nation's \ninfrastructure, they provide an important link to our collective past \nand are feats of engineering and longevity.\n  The National Covered Bridge Preservation Program, which I authored in \n1998, has been a great success, albeit a slightly underfunded success.\n  From the Thetford Center Covered Bridge to the Weathersfield Falls \nCovered Bridge, I have taken great pride in being able to work to \nrehabilitate these bridges in Vermont.\n  Given my passion for the topic, many members may think that Vermont \nhas the Nation's largest number of these bridges.\n  In fact, Pennsylvania has 220 covered bridges, Ohio has 144 covered \nbridges, and Vermont has only 99 covered bridges.\n  Even California has 12 covered bridges and Missouri has 5.\n  It is my great regret that I do not believe Oklahoma has any of these \nfine structures.\n  While I may seem like a broken record talking about bridges, it is \ncritical that we pass a bill that adequately funds bridge maintenance \nand repair.\n  While I do not have the national statistics at my fingertips, those \nof you that travel around our Nation's Capital can readily attest to \nthe fact that the bridges in this city are choke points for commuters \nand commerce.\n  The DC Department of Transportation estimates that about $300 million \nis needed to repair 11 major bridges.\n  If we do not provide at least some of these funds, our economy will \nsuffer.\n  Senator Leahy and I have been working for years to provide funds to \nrehabilitate the Missisquoi Bay Bridge in Vermont.\n  This bridge links New York and Vermont and serves as an international \ncorridor to Canada.\n  In 1998, Vermont's congressional delegation secured funds in the \nhighway bill to begin the project, and unfortunately we are still at \nit.\n  I can hardly imagine how long it would take to upgrade the George\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\nWashington or Chesapeake Bay Bridges.\n  It is my hope that the Congress will send the President a bill with a \nrobust bridge program.\n  Our Nation's bridges, whether historic or not, are in a state of \ndisrepair and this bill is an important step in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont brings up a very \nsensitive subject to me, and that is one of bridges. It seems to me we \ndo have one covered bridge in Oklahoma. I am going to have to check on \nthat to make sure they get a share of this, whatever it is.\n  We do have a serious problem. The FHWA ranks various States and the \nconditions of their bridges, roads, and highways. Oklahoma is ranked \ndead last in the condition of its bridges, and it is a very serious \nmatter. It is also a very serious problem in terms of the number of \ndeaths we have.\n  One of the considerations that was involved in putting together a \nformula--and I state again how much work goes into a formula approach. \nI have said several times that it would be very easy to do it the other \nway where we just come up with a bunch of projects and satisfy 60 \nSenators and pass a bill and go home. That is not what we tried to do. \nOne of the considerations we have is the risk in the various States, \nthe number of mortalities.\n  Once again, at this point it is important to stress why we need to \nhave a bill. We are now on our sixth extension, and extensions do not \nwork. There is not a State of all 50 States that is not very anxiously \nawaiting this bill because with extensions there can be no planning. If \nwe do not get this done, we will not have any chance to improve our \ndonor States.\n  Oklahoma is a donor State. We have many donor States, and that is \nprobably the most sensitive single issue in the formulas, is how the \ndonor States are treated. But if we do not get this done, there is not \ngoing to be any change. We are right now at 90.5 percent. If we had \npassed the bill we had last year, which was a little more robust than \nthis bill, by the end of that 6-year period, every State would have \nachieved at least a 95-percent return. That is the return of money they \nhave paid into the trust fund.\n\n  As it is right now, in a lower amount, this would raise it a modest \namount but not that much further above 90.5 percent. It would be an \nimprovement, though.\n  If we do not have a bill and are operating under extensions, there \nwill not be any new safety core programs to help the States respond to \nthe thousands of deaths each year on the highways. In that respect, I \nthink you have to acknowledge that this bill is a matter of life and \ndeath. There will be many more deaths if we do not have a good highway \nbill.\n  If we don't have a highway bill, there will not be any streamlining \nof the environmental reviews. Critical projects will still be subjected \nto avoidable delays that can be avoided with the passage of this bill.\n  Along that line, I think with all the provisions of this bill that \nwas 2\\1/2\\ years in the making, there are a lot of provisions that my \ngood friend from Vermont accepted that he would have preferred not to \naccept. There are many provisions I accepted that I would have \npreferred not to accept. But this was a give and take in a spirit of \nbipartisan cooperation, and I think that is something people are \nstarving for right now. That is what they have in this bill.\n  If we do not have a bill, there is not going to be an increase in the \nability to use innovative financing, giving us a chance to do something \ndifferently than we have been doing it before. Where innovative \npartnership types of financing have taken place, it has extracted a lot \nof money from the private sector that is willing to get in there and \nparticipate in the TIFIA provisions of this bill, allowing them to do \nthat very thing.\n  There are a lot of members on our committee who were concerned about \nthe Safe Routes to Schools Program. That is in here. Again, if we are \noperating under an extension, if we do have an extension, if we do not \nhave the bill, we will not have that. It could be we will have young \npeople killed and injured on the way to school without this bill.\n  Without this bill, with just another extension, States would continue \nto have uncertainty in planning and delay in projects. I hope this \ndoesn't need much elaboration. It is only logical. If you know in \nadvance what is going to happen over the next 5 years or so, you can \nstart planning. You can plan your resources, plan your labor, plan the \namount of construction that is going to go on in each State so each \nState will get far more for each dollar spent than they would get on \njust an extension.\n  If we just get an extension, we are not going to have any new border \nprogram. I think the border States, many of them, should be the first \nones down here to encourage that this bill be passed, particularly \nthose who are affected by NAFTA traffic. We have a special provision in \nhere that takes care of borders as well as corridors. In the absence of \nthis, with just an extension, we are not going to have any of these \nprovisions.\n  Without the bill, we are going to have delay in the establishment of \nthe national commission to score how to fund transportation in the \nfuture. We have been doing it the same way for many years. There are \nbetter ways of doing it. This bill establishes this commission to study \nwhat innovative suggestions might come from the States, ways we can do \na better job of financing and getting private participation and get a \nlot more efficiency into the system.\n  When you look at what we are faced with today, we have an unusually \nhigh price of gasoline. As a result of that, people are not driving as \nmuch. If we had a gas tax that was geared to a percentage basis, it \nwould not make any difference. In fact, we would probably increase \nrevenues. But that is not the way it is. It is just a number of cents \nper gallon, so if there are fewer gallons bought, then there is less \nmoney that goes into it.\n  If we do not have a bill, if we just go on an extension, there will \nnot be any opportunity to address the chokepoints at intermodal \nconnectors. People think this is just a highway bill. They think back \nin the early days, back when Eisenhower, in World War II, was a major, \nhe realized the inefficiencies we had in this country in transportation \nwhen he was trying to move troops and move military equipment around \nthe country. When he became President, he drew upon that experience and \nestablished, for that reason, this National Highway System.\n  This goes all the way back to the Eisenhower administration, but this \ngoes further than it went at that time. Now we have chokepoints. A lot \nof people are not aware that my State of Oklahoma actually has a port. \nWe have the port of Catoosa, about 10 miles from my home in Tulsa. But \nthere are chokepoints in any transportation system. You can have a \nchannel, air transportation, rail transportation; it has to marry up \nand be consistent with the movement on the roads. This bill does that. \nThat is why we call it intermodal.\n  Last, the firewall protection of the highway trust fund would not be \ncontinued, thereby making the trust fund vulnerable to raids in order \nto pay for other programs. In every State, all 50 States, we have \nexperienced problems of people seeing an opportunity to steal money out \nof the trust fund and raid it, and they do it. They have certainly done \nit in my State of Oklahoma--not just the highway trust fund but other \ntrust funds, too. I know there are many States that have their own \nindividual highway trust fund where money is coming out of it. This is \nsomething we can protect at the national level by having firewalls. The \nfirewalls are intact in this bill.\n\n  There are a lot of reasons we have to do this other than just having \na highway bill and getting more construction. We have had the \nopportunity to talk about the complexities of a formula and all the \nthings that are in a formula. I believe it is worthwhile repeating some \nof them.\n  Formulas are not just, Are you a large State or are you a small \nState? They take into consideration many things. There are the \ninterstate maintenance programs that are a part of the formula, as are \nthe interstate lanes, the number of miles to be maintained, your \nNational Highway System miles--\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\nthat is part of the formula--the Surface Transportation Program, the \ntotal lane miles, the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation \nProgram, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, \nwhich is very important. It has taken a lot of time in committee to \ncome up with something on which we could agree.\n  We have low-income States. Oklahoma is a low-income State. We have \nlow-population States, such as Wyoming and Montana. We have low-\npopulation-density States. We have high-fatality-rate States. \nEverything I mentioned is part of the formula we are working on. We \nhave guaranteed minimum growth States, where growth is very slow, but \nthere is a factor that provides for a floor. We have guaranteed minimum \nrate of return donor States.\n  All are part of the consideration of a very complex, very difficult \nformula that is the proper way to do it. Again, we have said several \ntimes in the last 3 days, it would have been a lot easier for Senator \nBond and Senator Baucus and Senator Jeffords and myself to have put \ntogether a bill that did not have a formula; it just would do projects. \nBut we elected not to do that in order to get the most miles for our \nmoney and to be the most fair with all 50 States.\n  Our forefathers were great when they talked about putting together \nthis system where you have the House and the Senate. One is on \npopulation, the other is geographic areas. It is our responsibility to \nbe sure that each of these States is treated properly, is treated \nfairly. This bill has done that.\n  The Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, has the pending amendment on the \nfloor. As I stated before, he has agreed to set his amendment aside as \nsoon as there are any coming down. We have a list of about seven or \neight amendments that different Members wish to offer. This is the time \nto offer them.\n  As Senator Jeffords said, come on down. We want you to come down and \noffer it. You have much more time to spend on your amendments. You can \nexplain them. We have all day today, and we need to have these \namendments on the floor and considered. I know what is going to happen \nif we do not. We are going to get down toward the end of it. Who knows, \nthere may be cloture invoked where you are almost out of time and \neveryone is going to be yelling and screaming and crying they didn't \nhave adequate time to consider their amendments. So let me get on \nrecord right now and say you have adequate time. We invite you to come \ndown and present your amendments for consideration. As I said, Senator \nBayh has agreed to set his amendment aside should you come down and \nwant an amendment considered. Come on down. We are open for business.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it has been agreed that anyone who wants \nto seek the floor can seek the floor, and we will be returned to the \namendment under consideration, which is the Bayh amendment. We move to \ntemporarily set the Bayh amendment aside for the purpose of the \nSenator's statement.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the Senate to urge we move \nforward with our highway bill. We have worked on this for a very long \ntime. I was on the committee 6 years ago when we passed the original \nbill. We have not passed it the last couple of years but have simply \nextended it. I hope we can move forward.\n  There are a number of issues before the Senate that have immediate \nimpact. One of them is this highway bill, as well as the Energy bill.\n  There are other conversations going on, disputes about a number of \nissues, but overall we are here to do some work. This is something that \nis most important. Six extensions is six too many. We need a highway \nbill.\n  One of the problems is all of our highway departments, as they work \non highways, use contractors. Therefore, they need to make contracts \nahead of time. They have to know what funds are available. So it is \neven more important for this particular activity to know what the \nfunding is going to be over time than it is in any other agency of the \nGovernment.\n\n  Our State DOTs cannot make long-term plans unless they have some idea \nof what the funding is going to be. So projects are delayed in Wyoming, \nas I am sure they are in other States. One of our problems, of course, \nis we have a short construction season. So it is particularly important \nwe be able to plan ahead and know when the construction is going to \nhappen.\n  Federal funds account for nearly 70 percent of Wyoming's Department \nof Transportation highway construction budget. Even though we are \nrelatively low in population, we have a large State and, therefore, \nlots of highways, and so on.\n  The long-term reauthorization of the bill, of course, will create \njobs. Contractors have to have the assurance necessary to commit \nthemselves to equipment and hiring people. It has been said that $1 \nbillion invested in Federal highways equals 47,500 jobs. We are talking \nabout, in this bill, $280, $290 billion over time, so think of the \nnumber of jobs that are involved. Of course, it also creates jobs in \nrelated industries, such as those for engineers and those involved with \nstone, concrete, and fuel, and so on.\n  So there are so many reasons we should move forward with this bill. \nIt deals with transportation, jobs, standard of living, quality of \nlife. All these things are touched in this bill. Yet we seem to be \nawfully slow in moving it.\n  I am hopeful that as much time as has been spent on this bill in the \ncommittees, in the House, and so on, that we will be able to move \nforward and not have a whole series of amendments that seek to change \neverything. We have already been through that. We passed a bill in the \nSenate last year that was substantially higher. But because of the \nadministration, because of the ability to raise funds, it has to be \nlower. So it is there for a reason.\n  This idea that somehow we can change it again, I am sorry, but there \nis some realism in terms of funding, regardless of what the program is. \nThese programs, of course, are to come from gas taxes and the highway \nsystem. So I think it is very important.\n  I happen to be chairman of the Parks Subcommittee. This bill is very \nimportant for park roads. They currently receive about $165 million per \nyear. This bill will change that. So it will be about $1.4 billion over \n5 years. Of course, the highways are an essential element, particularly \nin the large parks we have in the West. They do not have the State \nthings, and so on. So it is very important.\n  I am not going to take a lot of time, but I wanted to try to \nemphasize how important this bill is to most of us, and how important \nit is to get this bill done, and also how much effort has gone into the \nbill to bring it to this point, and to discourage anyone from trying to \nmake too many changes in this bill because it has already been \nreviewed. It has already been bargained. Concessions have already been \nmade.\n  So we are ready to move forward. Quite frankly, it seems to me like \nthat is what we ought to be doing. So I urge everyone to give some \nthought to this bill. If they have ideas, let's talk about them, but \nlet's get this job done. Let's get it out.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Wyoming. I also represent a Northern State with a very short \nconstruction season. We were severely impacted last year by the \ninability to reach an agreement with the House and with the President. \nBut in fairness to all of us in the Senate, we were not the holdup in \nthat matter.\n  As I said on numerous occasions to the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Inhofe, and to the ranking member, Senator Jeffords, \nwe had a bipartisan agreement in the Senate that was best for Minnesota \nand I think for virtually every other State. I have not heard anybody \nsay they have too much Federal highway or transit money and don't know \nwhat to do with it. But, unfortunately, we ran\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\ninto the intransigence of the administration a year ago, and with the \ninsistence of the President, the concurrence of the House, and were \nunable to get what the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley, said was a fiscally sound and balanced--in terms of \nthe highway trust fund revenues--measure in the Senate.\n  So while I concur with the Senator from Wyoming, I might also point \nout, as it relates to this particular legislation, the Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, last week wrote to the Senate Republican \nleadership and urged that this measure be brought up this week. I \ncommend Senator Frist and Senator McConnell for deciding to proceed on \nthis very important matter for the people of this country rather than \nsome of the shenanigans that others were urging upon them. So we are \nproceeding on a measured basis, but not with any resistance or \nopposition by anybody on this side of the aisle.\n  We voted overwhelmingly to proceed on the motion to proceed earlier \nin the week. It is unfortunate timing that our long-planned Senate \nrecess for next week will truncate the process. But I share the \nSenator's view that this bill needs to be enacted as expeditiously as \npossible. I hope the conference committee will be able to proceed as \nquickly as possible thereafter, while recognizing the Senate bill has \nbeen, and continues to be, vastly superior to the House version in \nterms of additional funding. Those are matters worth arguing about and, \nhopefully, prevailing on because Minnesota needs the money even as much \nas we need the bill to be completed.\n  Mr. President, if there is no immediate business related to this \nmeasure--I spoke earlier with the bill's manager--I ask unanimous \nconsent that I have up to 10 minutes to speak as in morning business. \nIs this a propitious time to do so?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dayton are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, some people are not aware that when you \nhave something as massive as a highway bill, it is not just the \ncommittee I chair, the Environment and Public Works Committee, but \nother committees are involved, including the Finance Committee, the \nBanking Committee, and the Commerce Committee. As of right now, we \ndon't have the titles that come from those three committees, but we \nwill have one right now.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 573 to Amendment No. 567\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Shelby, I send an \namendment to the desk, the Federal Public Transportation Act of 2005, \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for Mr. Shelby and \n     Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered 573.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of April 26, 2005 under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me reemphasize to my friend from \nIndiana, as soon as this amendment is disposed of, we will return to \nthe regular order, which is the pending Bayh amendment.\n  This amendment, which was crafted on a bipartisan basis in the Senate \nBanking Committee, provides $51.6 billion to address growing public \ntransportation needs across the country.\n  It provides for record growth for public transportation and for the \nfirst time recognizes the growing needs in rural communities across the \ncountry, including my State and the State of the Presiding Officer, \nOklahoma, which has a rural population of greater than 57 percent. In \nfact, in the final year of this bill, the rural transportation program \nis doubled over its TEA-21 levels.\n  Additionally, it creates a new formula within the urbanized area \nformula called the ``Rural Low Density'' formula. Rural transit is as \nchallenging to provide as the distances between employment centers and \nhealth care centers are great.\n  This amendment also creates a formula to recognize ``growing \nStates''--those locations which are forecast to grow more quickly than \nthe average over the course of the next 15 years. This change will \nallow those States, which includes Oklahoma, to be proactive with \nregard to their transportation needs.\n  Finally, this amendment makes several modifications to enhance the \nrole of the private sector in public transportation. By creating \nopportunities for competition, public transportation services can be \nprovided more efficiently.\n  I am happy to have had the opportunity to work with Senator Shelby on \nthe development of this amendment. I look forward to working with him \non final passage and a successful conference report.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, that the \nlanguage be considered as original text as part of the substitute for \nthe purpose of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 573) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank Senators Shelby and Sarbanes \nbecause we cannot really entertain amendments that affect these titles \nuntil we have them done. We are anxious to get the other two titles on \nthe bill.\n  I will repeat our plea for people to come over with their amendments \nbecause the Senator from Indiana has agreed that he would set his \namendment aside when people come down, with the understanding we would \nreturn to his amendment upon completion of those amendments.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me repeat one more time, we are going \nto be open for business, as we were today, tomorrow. We will invite \npeople to come down.\n  I want to get on the record right now, very often we go through this \nexercise and when we get close to the end of the consideration of the \nbill, when cloture has been filed, everyone comes running and \nscreaming, saying they want to offer an amendment. Now is the time to \ndo it. Members can bring them down anytime tomorrow. I certainly invite \nany Member to come down and offer the amendment tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4384-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, this week, the Nation celebrates National \nSmall Business Week. It is a time when all of us join together, without \nany partisanship at all, to celebrate the hard work of millions of \nAmerican entrepreneurs. At the Small Business Administration Expo last \nnight at the Smithsonian, we recognized countless Americans who have \nhad the courage to put everything they have on the line in order to \nturn an idea into a business. We celebrated the business people of the \nyear from all of the 50 States in the country.\n  Today, these Americans, I think all of us recognize, are much more \nthan small business owners. They are employers, community leaders, and \nthey\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\nare the people who give life to the American dream. Our small business \nowners not only remind us of the opportunities that America provides to \nthose who are willing to work for it, but they remind us how much \nopportunity small business itself provides to all Americans. They drive \nour economy, compromising over 99 percent of all firms and over half of \nour GDP.\n  Two-thirds of all new American jobs are created by small businesses, \nand a majority of Americans depend on their small business employer for \nhealth insurance. Our small businesses are responsible for countless \ninventions and innovations that have elevated the standards of living \nin our country and for people around the world.\n  The entrepreneurial spirit I am talking about is alive and well in \nour country, though it faces a number of particular challenges: rising \nhealth care costs, imports, a reduction in the numbers of people going \ninto innovative jobs and pursuing careers in the sciences and in \nresearch and development. Nevertheless, three out of four adults in \nAmerica have considered starting a small business. With the advent of \nthe Internet, those numbers are rapidly going up.\n  I know my colleagues are familiar with the Small Business \nAdministration in a lot of different ways. We all understand how it is \ncharged with defending small business interests in the country. It \nhelps small businesses tackle issues ranging from initial development \nissues and startup issues and access to capital to Federal contracting \nand trade assistance. Those efforts are working relatively well. \nBusinesses such as Staples, Intel, Nike, America Online, Eskimo Joe's, \nCallaway Golf, FedEx, Hewlett-Packard, Jenny Craig, Ben and Jerry's, \nWinnebago, Sun Microsystems, Outback Steakhouse--you don't think of \nthem as small businesses in need of Federal assistance. But the fact is \nevery one of those businesses, and many more that have become household \nnames in America, got their initial startup with Federal assistance, \nwith venture capital or loans from the SBA, which they could not have \ngotten otherwise and couldn't get from traditional sources. Their \nowners have proven that sometimes outstanding business ideas deserve a \nchance, even when traditional lenders or venture capitalists won't take \nthat chance.\n  So we can ask the question, how many of these businesses may not have \nmade it without help from the SBA? How many jobs would have been lost? \nHow much tax revenue would have been lost to communities and the \ncountry? The benefits of small business expansion are numerous: a \nstronger economy, higher paying jobs, better prospects for women and \nminorities, innovation, cutting-edge products, increased opportunities \nfor countless Americans.\n  What is unique about the SBA investments is they pay for themselves \nand they pay for the SBA budget many times over with the tax revenues \nto the country. So supporting our small business is a win-win \nproposition for Americans. We can afford it. The people want it. Our \neconomy needs it.\n  That is why it is very hard to understand why this administration \ndoes not provide the full measure of support to the SBA and to those \nbusinesses. The SBA budget has been cut by over one-third since 2001--\nthe largest reduction of any Federal agency, despite the fact that it \nis one of the few Federal agencies that completely pays for itself. \nThose cuts would have been far greater if Congress had not intervened. \nI am pleased to say, on a bipartisan basis with Senators on both sides \nof the aisle, we joined together to intervene. The chairwoman of the \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, Senator Snowe, and I \nhave worked with Members of both sides in order to provide the funding \nthat was necessary and to prevent further cuts from taking place. Time \nand again we have received unanimous support in the Senate to rebuff \nproposed administration cuts that would have gone further. That is \nbecause supporting small businesses is not a partisan issue, and it \nnever should be. We should not have to fight so hard to provide support \nfor something that so obviously benefits all of us.\n  The administration loves to claim the pro-business mantle, but if \nthey were candid with the American people, they would clarify that most \nof that support, as we see in the Energy bill or the tax bill, means \nbig business, not small business.\n  If you look at the tax cuts, the administration claims the tax cuts \nprimarily benefit small businesses, but in reality, only the biggest \nsmall businesses get the majority of those cuts. More than half of \nsmall business owners received less than $500 in tax cuts, and almost a \nquarter of those businesses got no tax cuts at all.\n  If you look at energy policy, you can see that while American \nfamilies and small businesses have struggled with gas prices, oil \ncompanies earned record profits in the fourth quarter of 2004. Exxon-\nMobil was up 218 percent. Conoco-Phillips was up 145 percent. Shell was \nup 51 percent. ChevronTexaco was up 39 percent. BP was up 35 percent.\n  Show me the small business in America, except the rare small \nbusiness, that saw that kind of growth in the fourth quarter of last \nyear.\n  You can also look at this disparity at what is happening with respect \nto Federal contracts right now. Congress set the goal of the Federal \ngovernment awarding at least 23 percent of its contracting dollars to \nsmall businesses. So what did the administration do? They allowed $2 \nbillion worth of contracts to be reported as going to small businesses \nwhen, in fact, they went to some of the largest businesses in the \ncountry. The money went to Raytheon, in my State, Northrop Grumman, \nGeneral Dynamics, and Hewlett-Packard. Even the State of Texas was \ntreated as a small business.\n  An administration concerned with small business ought to be outraged \nby these facts, and it ought to do something about it. This \nadministration has facilitated the distortion of that Federal agency \ncontracting goal of 23 percent and, in fact, allowed a process to go \nforward that has undermined our ability to help the small businesses \nthat need it.\n  In addition, the administration has refused requests for an audit. \nThey have not taken substantive steps to reform the contracting \nprocess. They have not prosecuted anyone for misrepresenting their \norganization as a small business. And now the administration is \nsupporting efforts to make it easier for the Energy Department to shift \nmoney away from small businesses.\n  A bipartisan Senate has repeatedly stood up to the administration and \ncalled them to account for being too willing to ignore the challenges \nthat face small businesses. It is time to again join forces to assure \nthat this new challenge to small businesses, which is the diversion of \nfederal contracts and the distortion of the standards that apply to \nwhat is a small business and what is a large business, ought to be \nappropriately adjusted.\n  Small businesses are also particularly hard hit by health care. Most \nsmall business owners want to do right by their employees. They try \nhard to do that, but too many of them just cannot afford to offer \nhealth care anymore. Premiums are rising faster than inflation or \nwages, with double-digit increases in each in the last 4 years.\n  Since 2000, the premiums for family coverage have gone up 59 percent \ncompared with inflation increases of nearly 10 percent and wage growth \nof over 12 percent. Some small businesses have reported premium \nincreases of as much as 70 percent in one year. As a result, 5 percent \nfewer small businesses offered health benefits to their workers in 2004 \nthan in 2001. By contrast, 99 percent of the businesses with 200 or \nmore employees offer their workers health insurance. Of 45 million \nuninsured Americans, almost two-thirds are small business owners, their \nemployees and their families.\n  So I think all of us understand that in a nation founded on equity \nand equality of opportunity, it is important for us to address the \nquestion of health care costs. We need a plan that gives small business \naccess to the range of plan choices and consumer product protections \nthat are offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. \nAnd we need to give these small businesses affordable options through \nrefundable tax credits and Federal reinsurance plans that will reduce \npremiums for everyone.\n  Small businesses and entrepreneurs are America's single greatest \neconomic resource. There is not a big business in\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\nAmerica that did not begin in someone's garage, someone's attic, \nsomeone's basement, where people did not work out of a car for a period \nof time in an effort to try to grow that business. Time and again small \nbusinesses, not large corporations, have pulled our economy out of \ntrouble by creating the jobs and the products of the future.\n  For many entrepreneurs, the SBA is their only chance to earn their \nfair share of the American dream. As we celebrate small businesses and \nentrepreneurship this week, we all have a responsibility to defend that \ndream. We need to ensure that the SBA is adequately funded. We need to \nensure legislation never shortchanges small businesses, and we need to \nprovide a real plan for small business health care. The doors of \nopportunity must be open to everyone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4386-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4386-S4390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ALBERT EISELE'S ARTICLES ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, when I went to work in the Washington \noffice of then-Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota as a young, \nbeginning legislative assistant in 1975, Al Eisele was a Washington \ncorrespondent for the St. Paul Dispatch and Pioneer Press, Duluth \nHerald and News-Tribune, and other Knight-Ridder newspapers. In 1976, \nafter Senator Mondale was elected as Jimmy Carter's Vice President, he \nnamed Mr. Eisele as his press secretary and senior adviser, a position \nthat Mr. Eisele held for the next 4 years.\n  ``He previously covered me as a Washington correspondent for \nMinnesota newspapers during my 11 years in the Senate, so I obviously \nknow him well,'' Senator Mondale later explained. ``He was one of the \nmost well-respected and knowledgeable reporters in Washington, with a \nreputation for even-handedness, incisive reporting, and personal \nintegrity, which is why I asked him to join my staff.''\n  After the Carter-Mondale administration, Mr. Eisele helped found the \nCenter for National Policy in Washington; was a fellow at the Institute \nof Politics at Harvard; served as an assistant to Mr. William C. \nNorris, the founder and chief executive officer of Control Data \nCorporation in Minnesota; and started his own literary agency and \ninternational consulting firm, Cornerstone Associates.\n  For the past 10\\1/2\\ years, this native Minnesotan has been \ninstrumental in the success of The Hill, a nonpartisan, nonideological \nnewspaper covering Congress, that he helped found. Indeed, the April \n27, 2005, issue of The Hill includes the 500th column Mr. Eisele has \nwritten since the newspaper's inaugural issue of September 21, 1994. In \naddition, he has acted as a mentor for more than 50 young journalists \nwhom he helped train and who now work for many major newspapers, \nmagazines, and broadcast organizations.\n  Last month, Mr. Eisele traveled to Iraq to get, as he wrote, ``a \nfirsthand look at what the American military is up against in this \ngreatest projection of American power since Vietnam.''\n  With his customary dedication, he did not just visit Iraq; rather, he \ntraveled throughout the country for 10 days and interviewed everyone, \nfrom generals to privates, high-ranking Iraqi officials to ordinary \ncitizens, visiting Members of Congress, fellow journalists covering the \nwar, and private contractors involved in rebuilding Iraq's \ninfrastructure.\n  His subsequent articles and columns in The Hill provided many \ncompelling accounts of personal realities there, as well as very \nvaluable insights.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those articles be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Senators Encouraged by Progress in Iraq\n\n       Baghdad, Mar. 23, 2005.--Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid \n     (D-Nev.) led a bipartisan Senate delegation to Baghdad \n     Tuesday and left little doubt that the Senate will soon \n     approve an $81 billion supplemental appropriation passed by \n     the House last week, most of which will go to pay for \n     rebuilding Iraq's war-torn economy and countering insurgent \n     violence.\n       Reid and his six colleagues held a news conference at the \n     end of a whirlwind one-day visit during which they met with \n     top U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Iraq and \n     leaders of the three internal factions competing for control \n     of the government being established in the wake of the \n     January elections.\n       Reid, who was making his first trip to Iraq, said the \n     Senate will take up the supplemental appropriations bill when \n     it returns after the Easter recess, and indicated there is \n     little real opposition to it. He stressed the need for \n     continued U.S. support for reconstruction efforts, along with \n     training Iraqi security forces to replace U.S. military \n     personnel and help bolster the Iraqi economy and political \n     structure.\n       ``Everyone understands that reconstruction is an important \n     part of the U.S. mission here,'' he declared.\n       Reid and his colleagues, who included four Democrats and \n     two Republicans, all indicated they are encouraged by signs \n     of progress in carrying out the three-pronged U.S. strategy \n     of support for bolstering Iraq's security forces, economy and \n     political system.\n       ``One of the people we met with today called Iraq `an \n     infant democracy,' and we can't leave this infant alone,'' \n     said Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). ``I believe what we \n     are seeing here is good.''\n       Sen. Robert Bennett (R-Utah) compared this visit with an \n     earlier visit he made last year. ``I find a quiet optimism \n     instead of a cautious optimism,'' he said. He added, ``I \n     think that the elections and the strengthening of the Iraqi \n     security forces have given us hope that the seed of democracy \n     has been planted here. There's still a lot to do and we still \n     have a lot to worry about, but the signs are more optimistic \n     now than before.''\n       Even Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who has been a leading \n     critic of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, seemed \n     upbeat about the future of the new Iraq government.\n       Declaring that the success of Iraq's future stability \n     ``greatly depends on the training of Iraqi security forces,'' \n     she said, ``we got a very, very upbeat report'' from the top \n     U.S. military officials, including Gen. George Casey Jr., who \n     commands the multinational coalition forces, and Lt. Gen. \n     David Petraeus, commander of the NATO training mission here.\n       She added that it's essential that the new government, \n     which will be put together in the coming months, include all \n     elements of Iraqi society, especially women. ``I think it's \n     fair to say that all of us today gave that message'' to the \n     leaders of the three main ethnic factions in Iraq, the \n     majority Shiites, the minority Sunnis and the Kurds.\n       However, Boxer also indicated after the group's meeting \n     with the man who is expected to be Iraq's next prime \n     minister, Ibriham al-Jaafari, that he is not as upbeat about \n     the quality of the Iraqi police and security forces.\n       ``My sense was that he was certainly in no rush to hand \n     over security to his new police force,'' she said.\n       Other members of the Senate delegation included Patty \n     Murray (D-Wash.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and freshman Ken \n     Salazar (D-Colo.).\n       Salazar, who was making his first visit to Iraq, said, \n     ``This trip has enforced the enormity of the challenge in \n     Iraq and the need to help the Iraqi people.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  ``Translators Are a Special Target''\n\n       Baghdad, Mar. 25, 2005.--After 38 years in the United \n     States, Paul Oraha is back in his native Baghdad and working \n     only a short distance from the neighborhood where he grew up. \n     But he's not about to look up any old friends who might still \n     be around.\n       ``We are a target now,'' said Oraha, who works as a \n     translator for the U.S. Embassy and U.S.-led Multinational \n     Coalition. ``Translators are a special target because many \n     Iraqis feel we are traitors because we're working for \n     Americans against Iraq.\n       Oraha, 65, left Baghdad with his family in 1966 for \n     Detroit, where his father, a Mercedes Benz parts supplier, \n     found work in the auto industry. While his personal history \n     is different, Oraha's situation is the same as thousands of \n     other Iraqis whose lives are at risk because they work for, \n     or cooperate with, the Multinational Coalition.\n       Many Iraqi civilians, as well as military and security \n     personnel, government officials and civic leaders have been \n     killed or wounded by Iraqi insurgents and foreign Islamic \n     extremists since the March, 2003 invasion that ousted Saddam \n     Hussein.\n       Oraha, who later moved from Detroit to San Diego and served \n     in the U.S. Navy, returned to Iraq in July, 2004, now works \n     and lives in the heavily guarded international enclave in the \n     middle of Baghdad known as the Green Zone. A nearby bridge \n     that commemorates the bloody 1958 coup in which Saddam's \n     Baathist Party took power links the Karada neighborhood \n     across the Tigris River where he grew up.\n       And even though there are constant reminders of the \n     terrorist threat--several mortar rounds hit the bridge on \n     Monday night but did not injure anyone--Oraha feels the \n     security situation is improving.\n       ``This area used to get hit almost every day, but now it's \n     almost every other week,'' he said while smoking a cigarette \n     and drinking coffee one recent morning outside the Rasheed \n     Hotel where and he and many other Americans and foreigners \n     live. ``Security is the biggest problem here, but I think \n     we're making tremendous progress because the attacks have \n     slowed down.\n       Oraha said he thinks most Iraqis ``want us to be here and \n     stay here. They're very appreciative that we got rid of \n     Saddam and they look forward to having a better life. But \n     they're very concerned about the security\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\n     situation. They feel if it improves, they will have an \n     opportunity to rebuild their country and enjoy the benefits \n     of democracy.''\n       However, Oraha cautioned that many Iraqis are concerned \n     that the U.S. will not take the drastic steps they feel are \n     needed to discourage future terrorist activity.\n       ``They think the U.S. is not going to be tough enough in \n     dealing with the terrorists, that they're too concerned about \n     the human rights of terrorists who are blowing up people. \n     They feel they will take that as a sign of weakness and \n     operate with impunity.\n       He added, ``As an American, I believe in the Constitution \n     and its guarantees of the rights of those accused of crimes. \n     But I agree with Iraqis that we have to be tougher with \n     terrorists. Many Iraqis think some of these people should be \n     executed and the world should know about it.''\n       However, Oraha predicts that the new government that soon \n     will be elected ``is going to get tougher on terrorists \n     because they're going to have to answer to the Iraqi people, \n     who are tired of terrorism.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Improvised Explosives Becoming More Deadly in Iraq\n\n       Mosul, Iraq, Mar. 28, 2005.--They're one of the worst \n     nightmares for American military personnel or anyone \n     traveling with them on the dangerous roads of Iraq, even if \n     you're surrounded by tons of armor plate and moving at high \n     speed.\n       They're called IED's, military speak for Improvised \n     Explosive Devices, and they're the devil's own invention.\n       These fearsome homemade weapons are responsible for many of \n     the more than 1,700 deaths and 15,000 plus casualties \n     suffered by U.S. and coalition forces since the invasion of \n     Iraq two years ago this month. And they're getting more \n     deadly and numerous.\n       ``They've gone up exponentially in number and they're \n     getting more powerful all the time,'' said Lt. Col. Michael \n     Kurilla, whose 24th Infantry Regiment's First Battalion \n     patrols the western half of this northern Iraq city that has \n     the highest number of attacks by insurgents of any city in \n     Iraq.\n       Col. Kurilla was among some 50 Army officers who briefed \n     Gen. John Abizaid, commander of U.S. forces in the Gulf \n     region, and Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) on the military situation \n     in Ninevah province on Easter Sunday at a coalition base near \n     this city of two million, the third largest in Iraq.\n       Afterwards, the tall, handsome West Point graduate from Elk \n     River, Minn., explained the challenge these devilish devices \n     present to his 800-man unit.\n       When his battalion arrived in Iraq last October from Fort \n     Lewis, Wash., it didn't find a single IED while patrolling \n     the streets of Mosul. But in November, it found three, \n     followed by 15 in December, 50 in January, and 134 in \n     February. One of his soldiers was killed when one of his \n     unit's heavily armored Stryker vehicles was destroyed, and \n     many more have been injured.\n       ``We're still getting plenty of detonations, it's almost \n     constant,'' said Col. Kurilla, whose battalion has already \n     earned 182 Purple Heart medals, given to those injured in \n     combat.\n       Sgt. Loren Kirk, a member of the 25th Infantry Division's \n     First Brigade Stryker combat team, described the constant \n     danger posed by the IEDs.\n       ``We go all over Mosul and everybody gets hit, even in the \n     nice neighborhoods,'' he said. ``We can go a week without \n     getting hit. It just depends on where we are. We drive side-\n     by-side with cars on the street. They tend to give us a wide \n     berth, and because of VBEDS [Vehicle-based Explosive \n     Devices], we try to keep them at least 50 yards away.''\n       Kirk added, ``It's all timing. We could roll down the road \n     and drive by an IED and a minute later, a vehicle behind us \n     will get hit.''\n       Kirk, 37, took his unit's commander through the city's \n     crowded streets to the briefing from its base about 15 \n     minutes away. ``Our mission is to get him where he needs to \n     go, safely, escort troops or check on soldiers at a \n     checkpoint.''\n       The heavily armed 36,000-pound, eight-wheel vehicles were \n     first introduced to Iraq in 2003 as a replacement for the \n     1980s era Abrams tanks and the less well-armored Hummers, \n     which many units are still using while they wait for Strykers \n     to be delivered.\n       Every one of the Strykers in Kirk's battalion has been hit \n     by an IED at least twice, according to Specialist Seth \n     Christie, who rides in a partially exposed position atop \n     Kirk's Stryker.\n       So what's it like to take a hit from an IED?''\n       It scares the s - - - out of you,'' said Christie, 24, who \n     was slightly injured when his vehicle was hit by an IED in \n     January and he was knocked back into the vehicle. ``You feel \n     it in your chest, you feel it in your teeth. Your lungs fill \n     with smoke and everything goes black.''\n       Christie's buddy, Specialist Donald Armino, also 24, agrees \n     that IEDs are more numerous and powerful than a few months \n     ago. ``They're getting a lot bigger and a lot more \n     sophisticated,'' he said, often concealing them more cleverly \n     and magnifying their power by tying a half dozen or more 120-\n     mm mortar shells together and setting them off by remote \n     control, or using shaped charges that can penetrate six \n     inches of steel.\n       An even more vivid description of the destructive power of \n     IEDs was provided by four young Marine reservists from \n     Chicago who were relaxing at the coalition's main base near \n     the Baghdad airport while preparing to return home last \n     weekend.\n       ``What's it like?'' said Cpl. Johnny Lebron, 31, whose unit \n     driving armored Hummers found and disarmed 19 IEDs and was \n     hit by 21 during six-and-a-half months in the northern \n     province of Babil, a part of the Sunni triangle dubbed ``the \n     triangle of death.''\n       ``Well, it really rattles your cage. It's an experience you \n     can't describe. For four or five seconds, time seems to stand \n     still.''\n       Sgt. Timothy Jensen, 26, added, ``The explosion hits and \n     then everything goes black and the breath is sucked out of \n     your lungs. You feel like you're dead, floating in timeless \n     space. The first thing you worry about is the Marine next to \n     you. Once I know my Marines are good to go, we act on our \n     objective.''\n       But Sgt. Jensen conceded that it's hard to find those who \n     place and detonate the IEDs. ``You're really not going to be \n     able to get on them because they use remote devices from a \n     distance, and they're really hard to find.''\n       Unlike the Marines, the soldiers in Mosul who are equipped \n     with the heavily armed Strykers are thankful they have them.\n       ``The Stryker is a fantastic vehicle, much better than an \n     up-armored Hummer,'' said Sgt. Kirk. ``We're really lucky to \n     have them. I've got a lot of faith in this vehicle.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            U.S. Forces Thwart Major Escape in Southern Iraq\n\n       Camp Bucca, Iraq, Mar. 25, 2005.--U.S. military police \n     Friday thwarted a massive escape attempt by suspected \n     insurgents and terrorists from this southern Iraq Army base \n     that houses more than 6,000 detainees when they uncovered a \n     600-foot tunnel the detainees had dug under their compound.\n       ``We were very close to a very bad thing,'' Major Gen. \n     William Brandenburg said Friday after troops under his \n     command discovered the tunnel that prisoners had \n     painstakingly dug with the help of makeshift tools.\n       Within hours of the discovery on the first tunnel, a second \n     tunnel of about 300 feet was detected under an adjoining \n     compound in the camp, which holds 6,049 detainees.\n       The discoveries came just hours before Brandenburg, who \n     commands Multinational Force detainee operations in Iraq, \n     toured the camp with Gen. George Casey Jr., the top Army \n     general in Iraq and commander of the Multinational Coalition, \n     who was making his first visit to this remote desert camp in \n     southwestern Iraq near the Kuwaiti border.\n       Brandenburg said the prisoners, who include Iraqis and \n     suspected terrorists from other Arab countries, probably were \n     waiting for the dense fog that often rolls in at night from \n     the nearby Persian Gulf before attempting their escape.''\n       We get fog after midnight in which you can't see 100 \n     feet,'' he said. ``I think they were waiting on poor \n     visibility and I think there was a good chance they would \n     have gotten out of the camp.''\n       Brandenburg, whose command also includes the better known \n     but smaller Abu Ghraib camp near Baghdad, said soldiers in \n     charge of Camp Bucca suspected that an escape attempt might \n     be in the offing because they had found a small tunnel in \n     another part of the camp about five days ago, and had been \n     told by detainees that other tunnels were being dug.\n       Brandenburg also said that in recent days there were \n     ``people outside the camp who we're not used to seeing,'' \n     which was another indication that ``something was going on.''\n       Brandenburg, who was spending the night at the nearby \n     Basrah airport while waiting for Gen. Casey to arrive from \n     Baghdad Friday morning, said he was awoken at 1:30 a.m. by an \n     officer from Camp Bucca who said, ``Sir, you won't believe \n     what we've found.''\n       When Brandenburg and Casey arrived at Camp Bucca, they were \n     shown the tunnel's exit point, which was outside the chain \n     link fence and concertina wire that surrounds the camp's \n     eight compounds, each of which contains more than 600 \n     prisoners, and several smaller compounds.\n       The prisoners had used a cut-away five-gallon gas can \n     attached to a 60-foot-long rope to haul the sandy soil out of \n     the tunnel. They apparently used makeshift tools to dig and \n     reinforce the tunnel, and covered the entry point inside the \n     compound with a false floor made from wooden slats from their \n     beds, which in turn they concealed under two feet of dirt.\n       The detainees disposed of the dirt they had dug from the \n     tunnel by flushing it down their latrines, which gave camp \n     officials another clue that something was amiss when workers \n     emptying the latrines complained that the filters on their \n     trucks were getting jammed.\n       Col. James Brown, the commander of the 18th Military Police \n     Brigade that is in charge of Camp Bucca and Abu Ghraib, said \n     two detainees tried to escape 10 days ago but were caught. He \n     said the latest escape attempt was clearly planned to allow \n     more than 100 prisoners to flee the camp.\n       Brown said it is reasonable to assume that other tunnels \n     will be discovered in other parts of the camp.\n       Col. Brown said he made his troops view the movie, ``The \n     Great Escape,'' starring Steve McQueen, about a group of \n     American prisoners in a World War II German POW camp, so they \n     would think like people who were bent on escaping from his \n     facility.''\n       It's a great movie,'' he said. ``The trouble is we tend to \n     view life through the lens of who we are and not who somebody \n     else is. There are a lot of good lessons for us there.''\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\n       During Casey's tour of the camp, thousands of the prisoners \n     watched silently and sullenly as he and his entourage walked \n     past them, and as he climbed a watchtower for a panoramic \n     view.\n       As Casey walked past the compound where the second tunnel \n     was discovered, a soldier drove a large backhoe into the camp \n     and began digging up the tunnel.\n       Camp officials also showed Casey a large collection of \n     makeshift weapons taken from the detainees, including knives, \n     slingshots, and even a fake flak jacket made from Muslim \n     prayer shawls that resembled the real thing.\n       ``I am never amazed at what I see,'' Brandenburg said of \n     the ingenious technique used by the detainees in their escape \n     attempt.\n       At the end of his tour, Casey presented a special medal to \n     the young woman soldier, Specialist Lisa Wesson of Asheville, \n     N.C., who discovered the larger tunnel during a routine \n     investigation.\n       Camp Bucca is almost twice the size of Abu Ghraib, which \n     was the scene of last year's prisoner abuse scandal that has \n     prompted widespread changes in the handling of detainees. \n     There are 3,243 detainees at Abu Ghraib, and another 114 \n     after a camp near Baghdad International Airport, where Saddam \n     Hussein and members of his deposed government are being held \n     pending trials for crimes against humanity.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Embed Cavallaro Sees War From the Inside\n\n       Baghdad, Mar. 31, 2005.--After four trips to report on the \n     war in Iraq, no one understands the pluses and minuses of \n     being embedded with the U.S. military better than Gina \n     Cavallaro.\n       On the one hand, the former congressional aide and staff \n     writer for the Army Times knows it would be impossible to do \n     her job without relying on the military for logistical \n     support and protection in the dangerous combat zones she \n     routinely visits.\n       At the same time, she knows that the bonds she forms with \n     soldiers and Marines make it more difficult to be an \n     objective reporter, especially when one of them is killed or \n     wounded.\n       So it's not surprising that the 45-year-old Hillary Swank \n     look-alike was still trying to come to grips last week with \n     the death of a 20-year-old soldier who had become her \n     ``buddy'' and ``little brother.'' Spc. Francisco Martinez, a \n     forward observer in a field artillery unit, was killed by a \n     sniper the day before while she was standing a few feet away.\n       ``I haven't processed much of it yet,'' she said, \n     struggling with her emotions as she prepared to return to \n     Washington after nine weeks in Iraq.\n       ``It's very difficult to write about. When we go out on a \n     patrol, I feel that I need to get on the ground with the \n     soldiers, and I have done that dozens of times, knowing it \n     was dangerous. But I always know I'm here voluntarily, and \n     the last thing I wanted to see was a soldier getting \n     killed.''\n       But Martinez, who was with a Second Infantry Division \n     brigade combat team that was transferred from Korea last \n     September, wasn't just another soldier.\n       ``There's always one gregarious soldier who hangs out with \n     reporters,'' she said. ``He was my buddy, my shadow, my \n     escort. He was like a little brother. He stuck by me to make \n     sure I was safe. He was so young and so outgoing, and so \n     proud of what he was doing.''\n       She added, ``I only knew him for a couple of days, but we \n     had a lot in common. We both grew up in Puerto Rico, and when \n     you are with someone in a combat environment, it doesn't take \n     long to get to know them.'' The two often conversed in \n     Spanish and talked about life in their native Puerto Rico.\n       Cavallaro had spent eight days with Martinez's unit in \n     Ramadi, a hotbed of insurgent resistance 75 miles west of \n     Baghdad in an area the soldiers call the ``Wild West.'' While \n     she was there, an IED (Improvised Explosive Device) killed \n     four soldiers in an armored Humvee. ``It was huge, a big \n     bomb,'' she said. ``They are using more and more of them, and \n     they are also more snipers. I have to admit, I felt in danger \n     out there. I felt I was also a target.''\n       It was a routine patrol on a Sunday afternoon as Alpha \n     Company searched a dangerous neighborhood for a sniper who \n     had killed three soldiers and wounded several more. Cavallero \n     was taking a photograph when she heard a shot, very close by.\n       ``I was probably six feet in front of him,'' she said. ``I \n     turned around and was horrified to see him lying on the \n     ground.''\n       Martinez was wearing body armor, but the bullet seemed to \n     go under it, on the right side of his back. He was bleeding \n     heavily and told her he couldn't feel his legs.\n       Medics quickly put Martinez in an armored Humvee and took \n     him to an aid station only minutes away. Cavallera rode with \n     him, holding his hand and pleading with him in Spanish to \n     keep breathing and not fall asleep.\n       The medics told her Martinez probably would make it and she \n     watched as a medical evacuation helicopter took him to a \n     field hospital. But a few hours later, she learned that he \n     had died.\n       ``It was a little bit more of an exclamation point to this \n     trip than I wanted,'' she said. ``It just hurts when you lose \n     a friend. It really hurts.\n       For Cavallero, who visited Iraq twice in 2003 and once in \n     2004, it was a brutal reminder of how much more dangerous \n     Iraq has become for both soldiers and embedded journalists.\n       ``Absolutely, it's become more dangerous,'' she said. \n     ``When I first came here, the IED's hadn't started and the \n     insurgency didn't exist in any substantial way. I may be out \n     of line saying this, but I agree with the military that only \n     a small percentage of people are disrupting things here, but \n     they're doing a pretty good job of it. There's never not a \n     combat patrol. Whenever you go on patrol, it's always a \n     combat situation.''\n       Cavallaro, who writes for a predominantly military \n     readership, has mixed feelings about journalists being \n     embedded with troops.\n       ``I don't know,'' she said when asked if it affects how she \n     and other journalists report on the military. ``I just think \n     it makes it more difficult. I find the media is afraid to get \n     around on its own in Iraq, and rightly so. They're relying \n     more on the military to get them where they want to go, and \n     as a result, the military is getting smarter about getting \n     its own story told. It almost seems like a little bit of quid \n     pro quo.''\n       She added, ``I don't necessarily consider that a bad thing. \n     The military will get you around but it always wants to show \n     you its new sewage plant.''\n       Cavallaro was a reporter for the San Juan Star when she got \n     a job as press secretary to then-Del. Carlos Romero Barcelo \n     (D-P.R.), but decided her heart was still in reporting and \n     answered an ad in the Army Times.\n       She says she still hears complaints from soldiers about \n     negative coverage of the war. ``The most frequent question I \n     get is, `Do people back home care about us? Do they know \n     we're still here?'''\n       Asked for her view of how the war is going, Cavallaro says \n     she's ``not in a position to judge, but I do see the concept \n     of Iraqi security forces being the key to what happens \n     here.''\n       However, she added that ``there are some really impressive \n     Iraqi army troops and some really shoddy ones. But I've seen \n     some American soldiers who get it. They're taking the Iraqis \n     by the hand and showing them what the right looks like.''\n       If there's one aspect of war reporting that Cavallaro is \n     critical of, it's television. ``I don't know why it is, but \n     most soldiers tend to get their news from TV. Images are so \n     strong. They are projected in chow halls all over Iraq, but \n     it takes a dedicated effort for a soldier to look up news on \n     the Internet.\n       And when Cavallaro returns to her newspaper's Springfield, \n     Va., office, what will she be thinking about her last \n     assignment?\n       ``How much I hate leaving those soldiers behind,'' she \n     said. ``You can't be here and be embedded with soldiers and \n     not care about them, no matter how hard core you are. It \n     would take a really cynical person not to see them as \n     individuals.\n       ``I've seen reporters who are clearly anti-military, and I \n     don't begrudge them that.

The meeting between the two men who were \n     preparing to take over as America's top military and \n     diplomatic officials in Baghdad set in motion a three-\n     pronged strategy involving the U.S.-led coalition forces, \n     the American Embassy and the Iraqi government.\n       The men are Gen. George Casey Jr., the Army vice chief of \n     staff who had just been named commander of the multinational \n     forces in Iraq, and John Negroponte, who was about to trade \n     his job as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for that of \n     U.S. ambassador to Iraq.\n       Casey spoke about the meeting late last month. He was \n     returning to Iraq after a short vacation that ended with him \n     briefing President Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald \n     Rumsfeld at the White House. Casey flew back to Iraq aboard a \n     12-passenger C-37, the military version of the business jet \n     favored by corporate CEOs and celebrities.\n       ``Right after I found out I was going to Iraq, John was in \n     town and we agreed to get together,'' Casey said. ``He stayed \n     over on a Saturday, and we met in the morning at the \n     Pentagon.''\n       The purpose of their meeting was to develop a plan to build \n     on the Jan. 20 national assembly elections that would restore \n     a measure of stability, allow the Iraqis to create a post-\n     Saddam democratic government and begin to rebuild their \n     devastated economy and infrastructure. They agreed to focus \n     on the elections as the organizing point for their plan.\n       When Casey arrived June 28 at Camp Victory, the sprawling \n     coalition headquarters\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\n     base outside of Baghdad, the first thing he and Negroponte \n     did was put together a ``red team'' composed of top aides \n     from Casey's staff, the U.S. Embassy, the State Department \n     and the Central Intelligence Agency and its British \n     counterpart.\n       ``We felt we had to have a firm understanding of the enemy \n     and the war we were fighting,'' Casey said. ``I had our staff \n     working on a plan that focused on the same basic questions, \n     the nature of the enemy and its capabilities and intentions. \n     After about 30 days, we both came up with a product and we \n     merged them together and they pretty much reinforced each \n     other.''\n       The end result, Casey explained, was a plan that consisted \n     of four elements.\n       First, it was decided that ``the greatest threat, apart \n     from the insurgents and foreign fighters, was people hoping \n     for a return to Sunni dominance'' of the Shiite majority and \n     Kurdish minority. But it was clear that threat couldn't be \n     eliminated by military force alone.\n       ``You don't win a counterinsurgency [war] by military \n     means,'' Casey said. ``You win by integrating the political, \n     economic and military to produce a common outlook, by cutting \n     off the insurgents from popular support.\n       A second element was to build up the Iraqi security forces, \n     which called for creating 27 Iraqi Army battalions. The first \n     phase of that plan, ``a huge training and equipping operation \n     that is still going on,'' Casey said, was completed last \n     month, and the next phase, creating the Iraqis' own command \n     structure, is under way.\n       ``We felt we had to bring the insurgency to a level that \n     could be contained by Iraqi security forces while we helped \n     them build a sufficient capacity to deal with it. But it was \n     clear that Iraqi security forces were not ready to do that.''\n       The third part of the plan was aimed at rebuilding Iraq's \n     ruined economy.\n       ``On the economic side, we inherited a hugely complicated \n     and bureaucratic--I don't want to use the word `mess,' but I \n     guess I will. There were so many different [U.S.] agencies \n     that had their fingers in it, we felt we had to get ourselves \n     organized to deliver on the $18 billion aid package'' \n     approved by Congress. ``I'm not being critical of these guys, \n     but they put the package together in Baghdad without \n     consulting the people in the field.''\n       The Casey-Negroponte plan increased the 230-plus economic \n     aid and reconstruction projects that existed in June, 2004 to \n     more than 2,000 last month, and Casey predicts projects to \n     spend all $18 billion will be in place by this fall.\n       The fourth part of the plan was a two-part communications \n     strategy. ``One was to drive a wedge between the insurgents \n     and the population, to demonstrate that the insurgents and \n     terrorists have nothing good to offer for Iraq,'' Casey said. \n     ``The other part was to try to change the image of the \n     population toward the Coalition.\n       ``People always want to know, are we winning the hearts and \n     minds of the Iraqi people, and I say, `No, that's not what \n     we're here to do.' The people of Iraq will never welcome an \n     occupying force. What we need is their consent.''\n       Casey added, ``All four of these lines of operation are \n     working together in an integral way between us, the embassy \n     and the Iraqi government. That triangle--we actually have a \n     triangle in our plan--has the Iraqi government at the top, us \n     at one corner and the embassy at the other.\n       But while Casey said he is encouraged by early progress in \n     carrying out the ``triangle strategy,'' he cautioned that \n     success is far from certain. Casey, who earlier commanded the \n     1st Division in Kosovo, said he asked his predecessor, Lt. \n     Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, to compare the two countries.\n       ``He said Iraq is 10 times harder.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n          For Rhode Island's Reed, Codels are Solitary Affairs\n\n       Kuwait City, Apr. 6, 2005.--During the Easter Week recess, \n     when three other congressional delegations, consisting of 21 \n     senators and House members, were visiting Iraq, the codel led \n     by Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), was conspicuous for several \n     reasons.\n       First, Reed, a West Point graduate and former company \n     commander in the 82nd Airborne, was the only member of \n     Congress in his codel.\n       Second, instead of traveling with a battalion of aides like \n     those with the other codels, he was accompanied only by his \n     legislative assistant for military and foreign affairs, \n     Elizabeth King; Lt. Col. Vic Samuel, an Army legislative \n     liaison officer; and John Mulligan, the Washington bureau \n     chief of the Providence Journal.\n       Third, instead of flying into Baghdad for a few hours of \n     official briefings and then flying to Jordan or Kuwait at \n     day's end, Reed spent the better part of four days \n     hopscotching across Iraq, often aboard Blackhawk helicopters \n     manned by National Guard units from Rhode Island; meeting \n     with troops in some of the most dangerous parts of Iraq; and \n     questioning top U.S. military and diplomatic officials, and \n     Iraqi security forces as well.\n       Fourth, Reed--unlike Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-\n     Nev.)--wasn't making his first visit to this war-torn \n     country, where some 150,000 American troops and 24,000 troops \n     from 23 other member nations of the U.S.-led multinational \n     coalition are battling Muslim insurgents and terrorists \n     while trying to help create a new government and rebuild \n     Iraq's shattered infrastructure.\n       And finally, none of the other congressional visitors can \n     claim to have attended the U.S. Military Academy with Gen. \n     John Abizaid, the overall commander of U.S. forces in the \n     Persian Gulf region, or served in the Army with Maj. Gen. \n     William Brandenburg, who oversees detainee operations in \n     Iraq, including the infamous Abu Ghraib prison.\n       This was the fifth visit to Iraq for Reid, a 55-year-old \n     Harvard lawyer and former instructor at West Point. All but \n     the first, in 2002, have been solo affairs. And it may have \n     been that one that convinced Reed to shun multimember codels.\n       He was traveling with a half-dozen other senators to \n     Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan and nearing the end of the \n     long, exhausting trip when the other members decided they \n     didn't want to get up early the next morning to visit an Army \n     special forces unit near the Pakistan border.\n       But Reed insisted they go, he recalled during an early-\n     morning interview here before returning to the United States \n     on Monday. ``I got a little annoyed because these troops were \n     expecting us to come.''\n       Reed said he feels he can learn more about the actual \n     progress, or lack of it, by traveling alone.''\n       You can see a lot of places you couldn't necessarily go \n     with others'' because of security needs, he said as he wolfed \n     down a breakfast of baked beans, scrambled eggs, fried \n     potatoes and olives. ``It helps me to be able to do it on my \n     own. You can't substitute firsthand experience.''\n       He added, ``I like to characterize myself as someone who \n     comes out here on a fairly frequent basis to look at what's \n     happening on the ground and then reach judgments about what \n     we can do to succeed.''\n       Reed always makes it a point to visit troops from his \n     native state. There are about 400 in Iraq, and he visited \n     many of them, including Army troops in Baghdad, Marines in \n     Fallujah, the helicopter crews and a field artillery unit in \n     Mosul, and soldiers at a remote desert base in Kuwait.\n       Reed, a member of the Armed Services Committee, makes no \n     apologies for being a critic of the administration's policy \n     in Iraq, and to a lesser extent, Afghanistan.\n       ``My job is to be critical about what's going on and what \n     needs to be improved,'' he said, adding, ``I think my \n     criticism has been accurate, certainly in the operations in \n     the region, in that we didn't organize ourselves for the \n     appropriate occupation and stabilization'' after Saddam \n     Hussein was toppled, which happened two years ago this month.\n       ``It took a long time to get the needed equipment in here \n     for our troops. We made some serious errors in terms of de-\n     Baathification efforts, rather than trying to incorporate the \n     Sunnis, and disbanding the Iraq Army. There's a litany of \n     problems.''\n       And although Reed has high praise for the military effort \n     here, he added, ``You have to understand that this is not \n     over yet, militarily. And the notion that everything's fine \n     disregards the resilience of this insurgency and the deep-\n     seated political, historical and social forces that are at \n     work.\n       ``I think one of the greatest errors and misjudgments would \n     be at this point, so to speak, to get out, because the area \n     has one or two months of relative quiet--this is a long-term \n     effort, and, in a way, the hardest part, even now, is to \n     revamp an economic and political structure that doesn't have \n     that many democratic tendencies.''\n       Reed said Iraq has been ``brought right back to almost \n     where we began two years ago. And now we have the obligation \n     to reinforce military success with political and economic \n     progress, and the question is, do we have the resources and \n     the capability to do that?''\n       Reed also said he feels that civilian agencies haven't done \n     enough to rebuild Iraq's battered infrastructure by providing \n     ``the soft power that you need to stabilize the country.''\n       ``This is a major effort,'' he declared. ``We've got to get \n     it right. There are things that we're doing very well and \n     again I'd say that if we don't, if we take our eye off the \n     ball, we could find ourselves right back where we were six \n     months or a year ago. This place has the annoying habit of \n     every time you turn the corner, there's another corner. We \n     might be turning the corner, but watch out.''\n\n                     Battered Fallujah Key to Iraq\n\n       Fallujah, Iraq, Apr. 7, 2005.--This devastated former \n     insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad, where some of the worst \n     violence--and one of the grisliest scenes--of the two-year \n     war in Iraq took place, is shaping up as the key to the \n     success or failure of the Bush administration's historic \n     effort to reinvent Iraq.\n       That was evident last week as James Jeffrey, deputy chief \n     of mission of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, came here to \n     confer with the commander of the 23,000 Marines who still \n     patrol this dangerous region and to meet with some two dozen \n     local police and government officials, Arab sheiks and Sunni \n     clerics.\n       ``This is the future of Iraq,'' Lt. Gen. John Sattler, \n     commander of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force that drove \n     Iraqi insurgents and foreign Muslim fighters out of the city \n     in an epic 11-day battle last November, told the local \n     leaders as Jeffrey stood by.\n       The salty-tongued Sattler, who was reassigned to Camp \n     Pendleton, Calif., at the end of March, portrayed Fallujah as \n     a crucial test of the U.S.-led multinational coalition's\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\n     ability to provide security, assure political stability and \n     rebuild Iraq's shattered urban centers.\n       ``If you can make Fallujah work, it becomes a status symbol \n     and the whole Arab world will be looking at what they have \n     done for Fallujah,'' he said.\n       Sattler and Jeffrey also made it clear that the prospects \n     of reducing and eventually ending the commitment of some \n     175,000 U.S. and coalition troops in Iraq will be greatly \n     enhanced if Iraqi security forces can be trained and equipped \n     in sufficient numbers.\n       At the same time, they said, hundreds of millions of \n     dollars must be spent in Fallujah on economic reconstruction \n     by creating jobs and restoring basic services, including \n     water, sanitation facilities and electricity.\n       ``We're at the very beginning stages now,'' Sattler said. \n     He and about a dozen other senior Marine officers gave \n     Jeffrey an update on the military situation in their region \n     and, in turn, heard Jeffrey describe the political situation \n     and economic reconstruction effort before they met with the \n     local leaders.\n       The meetings in Fallujah came almost exactly a year after \n     the world was subjected to the ghastly scenes of the charred \n     remains of several American contractors whose bodies were \n     hung from a Fallujah bridge. The scene was the prelude to the \n     bloody battle in November that drove insurgents from their \n     fortified and well-armed base in Fallujah.\n       Jeffrey is running the U.S. Embassy until the arrival of \n     Zalmay Khalilzad, the current ambassador in Afghanistan whom \n     President Bush nominated Tuesday to replace John Negroponte \n     as ambassador to Iraq. Jeffrey gave the Marines an update on \n     the overall military, political and economic situation in \n     Iraq.\n       He said coalition forces have made ``tremendous progress'' \n     toward defeating the insurgent and al Qaeda elements in most \n     areas of Iraq, although the violence directed against \n     coalition forces and Iraqis who are cooperating with the \n     coalition ``is still very worrisome.''\n       And he said that 100 50-man units of Iraqi Army and \n     security forces, including local police, are in place, of \n     which about 50 are ready to be deployed nationwide. ``That's \n     a huge difference and huge investment,'' he said, with \n     between $5 billion and $6 billion already spent and about an \n     additional $10 billion committed by the end of this year.\n       But it's not the money, he said, ``it's the mentoring and \n     training that are important.''\n       On the political front, he said the successful outcome of \n     the Jan. 30 elections has provided important momentum, but he \n     expressed concern about the vacuum that exists until the \n     newly elected national assembly and its leaders are chosen.\n       The problem, he said, is that ``the old government is not \n     willing to take action, and the new government doesn't exist \n     yet. We're a bit frustrated, but that's democracy.''\n       Finally, on the economic reconstruction front, Jeffrey said \n     $100 million has already been spent on Fallujah, with another \n     $100 million in the pipeline.\n       ``Let's face it: We're winning,'' he said. ``It needs to be \n     said that we are winning. This is a very, very, very \n     difficult thing we're undertaking, but we're winning and we \n     need to continue pouring resources into Fallujah.''\n       Sattler acknowledged the difficulty of finding the right \n     local officials and working with them. ``There's dust on \n     everyone here,'' he said. ``So you have to go down until you \n     find somebody without blood on his hands. That's the person \n     you have to deal with.''\n       But one Agency for International Development official said \n     more and more local leaders are willing to cooperate in the \n     rebuilding effort.\n       ``We're beginning to see them at the table now, and they're \n     beginning to ask questions. We're shifting from one level to \n     another. We're dealing with the Iraqi mind and not the U.S. \n     mind. We're trying to deliver the goods, but it's going to be \n     a long process. It's water running into one more house. It's \n     electricity going into one more house.''\n       Sattler pointed out that more than 2,000 government workers \n     showed up for work in Fallujah the day before and ``15,000 \n     people came into town yesterday. There were less than a \n     thousand in December.''\n       A few days later, Sattler repeated his message while \n     hosting Gen. John Abizaid, commander of all U.S. forces in \n     the Persian Gulf region, and Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.).\n       ``A year ago, we had an insurgency that operated with \n     impunity inside Fallujah,'' Sattler said. But now there's a \n     growing partnership between U.S. troops and Iraqi security \n     forces that he said bodes well for the future.\n       Sattler said, ``We get a lot of visitors here, but you \n     haven't visited Iraq if you haven't visited Fallujah.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4390-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REGULATION OF 527 ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, earlier today, as a member of the Senate \nRules Committee, I participated in a markup of legislation that \npurports to regulate the so-called 527 organizations. What started out \nas campaign finance reform legislation in the view of many, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, in this body, unfortunately, turned, through \nthe amendment procedure and the markup, into a very different kind of \nlegislation.\n  I commend Senator Lott, chairman of the Rules Committee. He was \neminently fair throughout and gave each one of us an opportunity to \npresent our amendments to be fully considered and voted upon. But one \namendment that was introduced at the very outset, that was voted \nfavorably upon by all members of the majority caucus as well as I \nbelieve one or two Democrats, but not nearly enough to carry the \nlegislation, drastically shifted the bill to one that opens vast new \nopportunities for political action committees, special interests, to \nincrease their contributions and for Members of Congress, Members of \nthe Senate to direct those moneys to other political campaigns.\n  Specifically, the amendment that was adopted increased the \ncontributions allowed to political action committees from $5,000 to \n$7,500. That is a 50-percent increase.\n  The amendment increased the amount of money that political action \ncommittees could contribute to national political parties from $15,000 \nto $25,000. That is a 67-percent increase. And it eliminated the \nrestrictions on trade associations soliciting member companies for \nthose contributions without prior approval of those companies as well \nas limitations on the number of times each year they could be \nsolicited.\n  Most egregious, the amendment that was adopted allows Members of \nCongress to transfer unlimited amounts of money from their leadership \npolitical action committees to national parties and to the political \ncommittees that are established and maintained by a national political \nparty which includes such enterprises as the Democratic and Republican \nsenatorial campaign committees, congressional campaign committees, and \nother subdivisions and political committees of the national parties \nthat are used to directly attack Members of Congress for their \nreelections or to assist challengers or to assist incumbents.\n  It opened the door widely, broadly, in allowing Members of Congress \nto use their positions of power and influence to solicit these \ncontributions from special interests on a year-round, round-the-clock \nbasis and then turn those moneys over in unlimited amounts to all of \nthese other political activities.\n  So at the same time this legislation purported to restrict the \nability of individuals to make these kinds of large expenditures on \nbehalf of political causes and candidates, it threw the door wide open \nfor special interest groups to do exactly what they said they were \nprohibiting. It is a terrible step in the wrong direction. It is \nevidence, again, of why allowing incumbents to be involved in so-called \nelection law regarding their own self-interest is akin to giving a \nblowtorch to a pyromaniac. They simply cannot resist the abuses that \nare available to them.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this legislation cautiously as it \nproceeds to the Senate floor. It is a step in the wrong direction. I \nregret the action taken today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4390-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4390-S4391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant John W.

Mr. President, so often we talk about collaboration \nbetween the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense. Today, we have \na terrific example of such sharing. I specifically want to call \nattention to an innovative training program for nurse anesthetists. In \nan attempt to maximize scarce resources, VA and the U.S. Army have \npulled together their resources to help prepare VA for fields in \nanesthesia.\n  Out of this joint VA/DOD effort has transpired one of the top \nCertified Registered Nurse Anesthetist programs in the country. The \nprogram offered at the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School \nat Fort Sam Houston, TX, has been said by its students to provide top \nof the line Army training in the field of nurse anesthesia. This type \nof training can be carried over to VA and will promote a seamless \ntransition for those servicemembers that need continued treatment upon \nreturn from active duty.\n  In addition to the clinical training, during the second phase of the \nprogram, the students also receive invaluable lessons that simply \ncannot be taught in just any training facility. By sitting side by side \nwith Army and Air Force classmates, the students are able to gain a \ngreater appreciation and understanding for the different branches of \nthe armed services and the culture of the military. Knowing that they \nare being cared for by someone who understands their background and by \nsomeone who speaks their language, veterans are provided with a level \nof comfort that can only be beneficial as they receive health care \ntreatment.\n  This VA/DOD nurse anesthesia training program only provides a glimpse \nof the strides VA is making and hopefully will continue to make in \ntraining and educating current and future health care workers--despite \nbudget constraints. I applaud VA for its leadership to the health care \ncommunity and for its collaborative efforts to ensure quality health \ncare. As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, I will \ncontinue to fight for veterans and make sure that they receive the \nhealth care that they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4391-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHINESE TARIFFS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on April 6, 2005, I voted against a \nmotion to table amendment, No. 309, otherwise known as the Schumer \namendment, to the fiscal year 2006-2007 Foreign Affairs authorization \nbill. Upon careful consideration of this issue I have come to the \nconclusion that this amendment will be ineffective at best and harmful \nat worst. As it is currently written, the Schumer amendment will impose \na tariff on all Chinese imports. Sponsors of the amendment claim this \nmeasure is necessary in order to compel the Chinese Government to \nrevalue its currency.\n  I am a supporter of free trade. I also believe that the benefits of \nfree trade must be weighed against any harm that could be done to vital \nAmerican interests. Understandably, there is considerable angst over \nthe expanding trade deficit between the United States and China. Still, \nthis body should not be hasty to repeat a mistake of the 106th Congress \nwhen it acted to support a similar amendment to the 2000 China trade \nbill.\n  Similar to what the Schumer amendment proposes, provisions in the \nChina trade bill allowed the Federal Government to impose a de facto \ntariff in the form of dumping penalties against foreign companies. The \ncollected penalties were distributed to the companies that filed \ncomplaints in the U.S. It should be noted that the WTO defines \n``dumping'' as a situation where goods are sold below price normally \ncharged in home market. By contrast, and to the consternation of our \ntrade partners, domestic American companies have thought of dumping as \ngoods being sold below price normally charged in the U.S. market. Over \nthe past 4\\1/2\\ years since the bill was enacted, American companies \nhave collected over $1 billion in penalties from suits filed in the \nUnited States.\n  While that might not seem like such a bad thing, other governments \nhave been busy filing complaints with the World Trade Organization. \nThey are now determined to impose 15 percent tariffs against American \nexporters as punishment for the American ``dumping'' penalties. The \ncosts of these tariffs will be borne by all sorts of American \nmanufacturers and exporters. These tariffs will also punish American \nworkers by making their work products uncompetitive in the global \nmarket.\n  I raise this parallel because it reveals to us the dangers of not \nseeking resolution through an agreed-to and effective framework \nprovided by the WTO. The strength of the American economy has always \nbeen based on the openness of our markets. Unilaterally imposing \ntariffs on Chinese imports will act as an unfair tax on American \nexporters and that is a price we cannot afford to pay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4391-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4391-S4392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FREEDOM TO TRAVEL TO CUBA ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, on Monday, April 25, I introduced a bill, S. \n894, with Senator Dorgan that will make a small change in Cuba policy. \nIt deals only with travel provisions to Cuba.\n  I have been watching Cuba since the 1960s. I went to college at \nGeorge Washington University and was there at the time of the Cuban \nmissile crisis. I have had the opportunity to watch what has happened \nwith Cuba through the years and I am reminded of something my dad used \nto say: If you keep on doing what you have always been doing, you are \ngoing to wind up getting what you already got.\n  That is kind of been the situation with Cuba. We have been trying the \nsame thing for 40 years--over 40 years--and it has not worked. So I am \nsuggesting a change to get a few more people in there to increase \nconversation for people that understand the way the United States works \nand the way Cuba works and how they ought to drift more rapidly towards \nwhere we are.\n  Castro's cruelty to his own people has tempted us to tighten the \nalready strong restrictions on the relations between our two countries, \nand we did. We need to be successful in bringing about a better way of \nlife for the Cuban people.\n  When we stop Cuban-Americans from bringing financial assistance to \ntheir families in Cuba, and end the people to people exchanges, and \nstop the sale of agricultural and medicinal products to Cuba, we are \nnot hurting the Cuban Government, we are hurting the Cuban people. We \nare diminishing their faith and trust in the United States and reducing \nthe strength of the ties that bind the people of our two countries.\n  If we allow more and freer travel to Cuba, if we increase trade and \ndialogue, we take away Castro's ability to blame the hardships of the \nCuban people on the United States. In a very real sense, the better we \ntry to make things for the Cuban people, the more we will reduce the \nlevel and the tone of the rhetoric used against us by Fidel Castro.\n  As I mentioned before, it seems foolish to do the same thing over and \nover again and expect different results. That is what we are doing in \nCuba. We are continuing to exert pressure from our side and, as we do, \nwe are giving Castro a scapegoat to blame for the poor living \nconditions in his country in the process. It is time for a different \npolicy, one that goes further than embargoes and replaces a restrictive \nand confusing travel policy with a new one that will more effectively \nhelp us to achieve our goals in that country.\n  The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act is very straightforward. It states \nthat the President shall not prohibit, either directly or indirectly, \ntravel to or from Cuba by United States citizens or transactions \nincident to such travel.\n  In 1958 the Supreme Court affirmed our constitutional right to \ntravel, but the U.S. Government then prohibited Americans from spending \nmoney in Cuba. We simply said, OK, you have a right to travel, but try \ntraveling without spending a dime.\n  One of the reasons I became involved in this issue is because a \nCuban-American from Jackson, WY, had been in Cuba visiting his family, \ndoing his one\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\nvisit a year. As he left and was on the plane coming back to Wyoming, \none of his parents died. He could not go back there for a year. Under \nthe recent changes, he now would be unable to go back for 3 years. This \nis not a good situation for any family.\n  I must ask my colleagues why we are continuing to support a policy \nthat was basically implemented 40 years ago. Why are we supporting a \npolicy that has had little effect on the government we oppose? Why \ndon't we improve our policy so that it will improve conditions for the \nCuban people and their image of the United States?\n  The bill we are introducing makes real change in our policy toward \nCuba that will lead to real change for the people of Cuba. What better \nway to let the Cuban people know of our concern for their plight than \nfor them to hear it from their friends, and extended family from the \nUnited States. Or let them hear it from the American people who will go \nthere. The people of this country are our best ambassadors and we \nshould let them show the people of Cuba what we as a Nation are all \nabout. One thing we should not do is to play into Castro's hands by \ncontinuing to enact stricter and more stringent regulations and create \na situation where the United States is easy to blame for the problems \nin Cuba.\n  Unilateral sanctions will not improve human rights for Cuban \ncitizens. The rest of the world isn't doing what we are doing. They are \nbeing supplied by the rest of the world for everything that they need. \nOpen dialogue and exchange of ideas and commerce can move a country \ntoward democracy.\n  What better way to share the rewards of democracy than through people \nto people exchanges. Unilateral sanctions stop not just the flow of \ngoods, but the flow of ideas. Ideas of freedom and democracy are the \nkeys to positive change in any nation.\n  Some may ask why we want to increase dialogue right now, why open the \ndoor to Cuba when Castro behaves so poorly. No one is denying that the \nactions of Castro and his government are deplorable, as is his refusal \nto provide basic human rights to his people. But if you truly believe \nthat Castro is dictator with no good intentions, how can you say we \nshould wait for him to behave before we engage. He controls all the \nmedia in Cuba. The entire message that is coming out unless we have \npeople interacting is his message. Keeping the door closed and \nhollering at Castro on the other side does nothing. Let's do something, \nlet's open the door and talk to the Cuban people.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to take a look at S. 894 and join me \nin this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4392-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMEMORATING HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in light of the upcoming Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, I want to pay tribute to the men, women, and children \nwho suffered and were murdered at the hands of the Nazis in the death \ncamps across Europe. In 1951, the Israeli Knesset designated an \nofficial day on the Hebrew calendar, called Yom ha-Shoah, to \ncommemorate the Shoah or Holocaust. This important day falls on May \n5th.\n  ``Shoah'' is the Hebrew word meaning ``catastrophe,'' which speaks to \nthe tragic destruction of nearly the entirety of European Jewry during \nWorld War II. Perhaps no other place has been so linked to the Shoah \nthan Auschwitz, the liberation of which was solemnly marked earlier \nthis year.\n  Auschwitz now symbolizes the horror suffered by millions in an \nexpansive network of camps and sub-camps that stretched throughout much \nof Europe. Millions of people were deported to these camps throughout \nthe war. Many were summarily executed. Others were worked to death. \nSome were subjected to sadistic medical experimentation.\n  The death camp at Auschwitz was at the heart of the ``final \nsolution,'' the slaughter of innocents for no other reason than that \nthey were Jews. In addition, Poles, Roma and other minorities were \ntransported to Auschwitz and elsewhere for elimination. To put this \nstaggering human suffering into some scale, the equivalent of roughly \nhalf the current population of my home State of Kansas was murdered at \nAuschwitz alone.\n  I have had the privilege of visiting Yad Vashem in Jerusalem to honor \nthe memory of the victims of Shoah. The legacy of the Holocaust \nencompasses the memory of those that perished as well as those who \nsurvived. The testimonies of those who survived Auschwitz and other \ndeath camps attest to the capacity of evil. At the same time, the lives \nof the survivors underscore the resilience of the human spirit and the \nfact that good can and must prevail over evil.\n  Six decades after the smoldering flames of the Shoah were \nextinguished, we are still confronted with reality that the embers of \nanti-Semitism could today be fanned into a consuming fire. As chairman \nof the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I am committed \nto confronting and combating manifestations of anti-Semitism and \nrelated violence at home and abroad. I look forward to the upcoming \nOSCE conference in Cordoba, Spain, as it will assess what measures \ncountries are or are not taking to confront anti-Semitism. As a member \nof the Senate, I have and will continue to support the vital \neducational work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and \nother institutions.\n  While the world professed shock at the scope of the atrocities and \ncruelty of the Holocaust, it has not prevented genocides elsewhere, \nBosnia, Rwanda, and now Darfur. We I can best honor the memory of those \nkilled during the Holocaust and the survivors by giving real meaning to \n``never again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4392-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       TRIBUTE TO DAN TANG--SBA SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. \nDan Tang, who has been named by the Small Business Administration the \nSmall Business Owner of the Year.\n  Dan was born in China in 1962 and was raised in Canton, China. At 19 \nyears of age, Dan was forced to escape China. After eleven months in a \nrefugee camp, he finally received a visa to travel to the United \nStates. His dream of becoming an American citizen began in California. \nHe worked hard, saved his money and found his way to Colorado.\n  After moving to Aurora, CO, he met up with some friends who owned a \nlocal Chinese restaurant. He accepted a job offer to be the dish washer \nand began working his way up in the business. He went from washing \ndishes, then bussing tables and eventually was promoted to become a \ncook. Always working long days and saving his money, Dan was eventually \nable to open his own restaurant in 1990. The opening of the Heaven \nDragon was an enormous achievement for him and his family.\n  Today the Heaven Dragon is one of the best known family owned \nrestaurants in the Denver metro area. His reputation is so well known \nthat on a recent visit to Denver, President Bush requested his \nspeciality, Peking Duck.\n  Dan Tang is a true American success story. He is a role model for \nhard-working small business owners across the country who are creating \ntheir own American dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4392-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4392-S4393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CONSTABLE BILL BAILEY\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, there is something in the Texas \nsoil that produces colorful characters. From Judge Roy Bean, the law \nwest of the Pecos, to Admiral Chester Nimitz, to racecar driver Richard \nPetty, Texas has raised up men and women whose achievements and \npersonal flair have made our world not only a better place, but more \ninteresting.\n  One of Texas' most popular people is Harris County constable Bill \nBailey. Constable Bailey heads up a big operation, with 77 employees \nand a $4.3 million annual budget. He has been a constable for 21 years, \nwhose leadership was recognized when he was named president of the \nTexas Association of Counties.\n  This is a big achievement for anyone.\n  But Bill Bailey is not just anyone. Born Milton Odom Stanley, he was \nalways a gregarious attention-seeking youth. Before he graduated from \nhigh school, he landed his first job on a radio station in Temple. He \ncalled himself ``The Lone Wolf.''\n  When he graduated from high school in 1957, his career began to take \noff. He\n\n[[Page S4393]]\n\nwas hired by a station first in Round Rock, then in El Paso, where he \nenrolled at Texas Western College. Radio was so good, he dropped out of \ncollege and took a job with a chain. He ended up in Des Moines, IA, \nbroadcasting as Lee Western. During his job there, he had his first \nchild, who was born over Texas soil even though the birth took place in \na Des Moines hospital. Bill Bailey's mom sent him some dirt from his \nhometown which he wrapped in sterile cloth and placed under the \ndelivery table. That is an authentic Texan.\n  On New Year's Day, 1960, he tuned in to listen to the University of \nTexas play in the Cotton Bowl.\n  ``They cranked up `The Eyes of Texas,' and I just cried,'' Bill said. \n``I came home to Texas without a job.''\n  Later, he walked into Houston radio station KTHT to apply for a \nposition. The station had recently hired a man from St. Louis by the \nname of Bill Bailey and had invested heavily in a promotion using the \nsong, ``Won't you come home Bill Bailey, Won't you come home?'' The \nproblem was, the new man decided after two weeks to do just that and \nwent back home to St. Louis.\n  The station was desperate to recoup the cost of the advertising, so \nthe deal presented to young Milton Odom Stanley was to become Bill \nBailey. He kept the name ever since.\n  Two years later, Bill Bailey was hired by KIKK, known as KIKKer \nCountry in Houston, not long before the Urban Cowboy nationwide country \nmusic craze. By 1979, Bill Bailey was honored as the number one country \nmusic broadcaster in a major market, and Billboard magazine named him \nProgram Director of the Year.\n  At the top of his profession, Bill Bailey noted that radio \npersonalities were beginning to coarsen their acts to get higher \nratings. This went against the grain, because he knew young girls and \ngrandmothers would listen to his show. Since he was opposed to using \noff-color humor, Bill Bailey began looking for a way to switch careers.\n  The opportunity came when a vacancy opened for constable in Harris \nCounty Precinct 8. By this time, Bill had a law enforcement commission \nas a reserve officer in the Galena Park Police Department. In this \nrespect, he was following in the footsteps of his great, great, great \ngrandfather, Williamson County Sheriff Milton Tucker, who captured the \nlegendary outlaw Sam Bass in 1878 the day after Bass had been mortally \nwounded by Texas Rangers in Round Rock.\n  After winning a run-off election, he worked hard to make his office \nmore professional and improved every aspect of its operations. Bill \nstarted many initiatives in his office, not least of which is guarding \nthe homes of astronauts while they are in space.\n  Another measure was to provide powered impact wrenches with all his \npatrol cars so deputies can rapidly change tires for stranded \nmotorists.\n  ``I've gotten more mail from citizens who have had flats fixed than \nall the other cops-and-robbers stuff we do,'' he said.\n  I have known Bill for years. We rode horses together on the Salt \nGrass Trail and in the Houston Rodeo. He is a fine and good man.\n  Bill Bailey's other activities include serving part-time as an \nannouncer at the Texas Prison Rodeo for 15 years, and calling the calf \nscramble and grand entry salute at the Houston Livestock Show and \nRodeo. He has been active in that charity for 43 years.\n  It is no surprise that a man this talented has had so many names: \nMilton Stanley, ``Poogie'', his nickname as he grew up in Galena Park, \n``Lone Wolf'', Lee Western, Buffalo Bill Bailey and, finally, plain old \nBill Bailey.\n  Constable Bill Bailey may have had many names, but he has always been \na devoted family man, a believing Christian and a colorful credit to \nour State. Please join me in congratulating him as the City of Pasadena \nand the Pasadena Rotary Club host Bill Bailey Day on April 29, \n2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4393-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GEORGE KALLAS\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my State of Alaska is small in \npopulation but huge in territory, warmth and generosity. In a State \nwith a population of somewhat over 655,000 people, whose largest \ncommunity, the municipality of Anchorage, has a population of about \n275,000, the good deeds of people stand out.\n  The high level of civic engagement exhibited by the people of Alaska \nis impressive. Many Alaskans begin their morning with Rotary, take \nlunch at the Chamber of Commerce, the World Affairs Council or \nCommonwealth North, and spend their evenings supporting one of our many \ncultural, charitable and civic organizations.\n  Alaskans, whether life long residents of the State as I am, or people \ntransplanted to The Great Land, like George Kallas, play an active role \nin the life of our communities. The difference between a sourdough and \na cheechako, a newcomer, is not measured in longevity of residence. It \nis measured in contributions to the community.\n  Last Saturday, I joined with Alaskans in celebrating the life of \nGeorge Kallas who passed away at the age of 81 on April 19, 2005. \nGeorge Kallas came to Alaska in 1971. He was a native of Kansas City \nand will be buried there. A U.S. Army veteran of World War II, he was a \nmember of American Legion Post 28.\n  George's business, the Beef and Sea Restaurant, on the Old Seward \nHighway was a favored dining spot of Alaskans and visitors alike. \nLocated close to the heart of Alaska's oil and gas industry, it offered \na touch of Alaska hospitality and a taste of Alaska crab to thousands \nwho came to develop the Prudhoe Bay oilfield and the Trans Alaska \nPipeline System. George participated in the growth of Anchorage from \nsmall town to cosmopolitan metropolis. He operated the restaurant until \n1999 when he retired.\n  At Christmas George opened the restaurant to feed all of those who \ncared to come free of charge. At least 1,500 people, probably more, \ntook advantage of this wonderful Christmas present.\n  He was not merely a successful small businessperson, but a leader of \nthe small business community. George was proudest of his leadership \nrole in the Alaska Coalition of Small Business which advocated for the \ninterests of small business on issues from local to national \nimportance. He was also an active member of the Holy Transfiguration \nGreek Orthodox Church.\n  George was what we in Alaska refer to as a ``super voter,'' someone \nwho never missed the opportunity to vote. Even in his final months as a \nresident of the extended care facility at Providence Hospital, he \ninsisted that he be brought to the polls to perform his duty as a \ncitizen of Alaska and the United States.\n  I will miss George Kallas. Alaska will miss George Kallas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4393-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4393-S4394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB LIGOURI\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 7 years ago, Senator Jim Jeffords \nrecruited me to join him as a volunteer for a literacy program in \nWashington, DC, called Everybody Wins! The program is simple--spend one \nlunch hour a week at an elementary school reading with a child. This is \nthe ultimate power lunch.\n  It didn't take long and I was hooked. It is the most important and \nrewarding hour of my week. I also thought this was a program we needed \nin Iowa.\n  Three years ago, under the leadership of Bob Ligouri, Everybody Wins! \nIowa was launched. The Iowa program started as a small pilot program in \nthree central Iowa elementary schools involving 15 students and 15 \nadults. From those humble beginnings, Everybody Wins! Iowa has grown to \nover 200 volunteers in 12 central Iowa schools.\n  Starting a brand new non-profit organization is not easy. There were \nvolunteers to recruit, schools to identify, a board to create, \npaperwork to file and money to raise. Bob Ligouri built a solid \nfoundation for Everybody Wins! Iowa. He adapted the national program to \nbetter fit our State and put the organization on the right track for \nfuture growth.\n  Everybody Wins! Iowa was fortunate to have the opportunity to work \nwith Bob. He has long experience working with children as a coach of \nvarious athletic teams. He also led Special Olympics here in Iowa for \n10 years building it into an organization with 10,000 volunteers and \nathletes.\n  Bob Ligouri served as the executive director and later, as president \nof the board of directors for Everybody Wins! Iowa for over 3 years. He \nplanted the seeds, nurtured them and watched\n\n[[Page S4394]]\n\nthem blossom into a strong literacy and mentoring organization.\n  As Bob Ligouri moves on to dedicate more time to a new business \nventure, I express my sincere gratitude for the outstanding job he has \ndone for Everybody Wins! Iowa. His dedication and leadership was \ncritical to the Iowa program and he will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4394-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING PATRICIA POLAND\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize \nthe outstanding service of Patricia ``Judy'' Poland, who retires in May \nafter 30 years of dedicated efforts on behalf of the U.S. Army. For \nthree decades, Miss Poland has worked at the Army's Recruiting \nBattalion in Albany, NY. She retires as the Battalion's Chief of \nAdvertising and Public Affairs.\n  Miss Poland began her Government service in 1973 and has spent her \nentire career in the field of public affairs. It is fitting to note, \ntherefore, that she entered Federal service at the same time that the \nArmy began its daring initiative to become an All-Volunteer Force. Miss \nPoland's career spanned the full gamut of recruiting slogans, each of \nwhich reflected the changing temperament of the Nation, from ``Today's \nArmy Wants to Join You,'' through ``Be All You Can Be'' to the current \n``Army of One.'' She leaves an All-Volunteer Army sustained by \nsuccessful recruitment.\n  Judy Poland's efforts in Albany, NY, contributed greatly to the \nArmy's success.

Mr. President, today I wish to make a short \nstatement on the work of Tom Russo. Mr. Russo is a vice chairman of \nLehman Brothers, making his time some of the most valuable time in the \nworld. But, it is precisely what Mr. Russo does with this time that I \nwould like to speak about here today--in particular his work with the \nInstitute of International Education--IIE--and the scholar-rescue \nprogram.\n  Mr. Russo has played a leadership role in working with IIE to \nestablish a program that helps to bring scholars, whose lives are in \ndanger in their home countries, to the United States. Once in the \nUnited States, the scholars are matched with host universities \naccording to their academic specialty and the needs of the university. \nIn many ways, this program is a win-win. The scholars, and in some \ncases their families, are removed from harm's way. Universities in the \nU.S. get top-rate scholars to teach and conduct research, while IIE \nhelps to defray some of the costs to these institutions.\n  Of course, everyone would prefer that these scholars were able to \nremain in their home countries shaping the intellectual culture there, \nespecially the scholars themselves. But, these are cases where there is \nno other option. It is either leave or be killed. And we have a moral \nresponsibility to help these scholars escape and continue their work, \nin hopes of one day returning and advancing the knowledge base in their \nhome nations.\n  One only has to look at the newspaper to see that there is virtually \nunlimited demand for this program. Let me read a few sentences from an \narticle in last Wednesday's Washington Post, entitled ``Attacks Across \nIraq kill 12, Wound Over 60''. The article reads: ``Elsewhere in the \ncapital, masked men shot and killed a professor, Fuad Ibrahim Mohamed \nBayati, as he left home for the University of Baghdad, police said.''\n  Tom Russo and his colleagues, including Henry Jarecki, a board member \nof IIE, and Alan Goodman, the president of IIE, have worked tirelessly \nto build this program. I know this because on several different \noccasions I have met with Henry, Alan, or Tom about the scholar-rescue \nprogram. It is abundantly clear from our conversations that they are \ndeeply involved with the program and are passionate about the good work \nthat it is doing around the world. While the scholar-rescue program \ncannot prevent every tragedy, I can attest it is making a difference. I \nalso know that, instead of resting on their laurels, Mr. Russo, Dr. \nJarecki, Dr. Goodman, and others are laboring day and night to expand \nthe program to come to the aid of more scholars and their families.\n  I appreciate all Mr. Russo is doing and wanted to bring his work to \nthe attention of the Senate. I encourage all of my colleagues to read \nabout Tom Russo and the scholar-rescue program. I ask that an article \nfrom the New York Sun on Mr. Russo be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Sun, Apr. 11, 2005]\n\n     Lehman's Russo: ``Create a Culture of Doing the Right Thing''\n\n                           (By Pranay Gupte)\n\n       Thomas Russo, vice chairman of Lehman Brothers Incorporated \n     and the 155-year-old investment bank's chief legal officer, \n     had started this day with a meeting at 7:30 a.m. By the time \n     he came to lunch, he'd had three more meetings, and taken \n     several overseas and domestic calls in his additional role as \n     head of Lehman's corporate advisory division, with \n     responsibility for compliance, internal audit, government \n     relations, and the documentation group.\n       There was also some work in connection with Lehman's new \n     products committee and also the operating exposures \n     committee, both of which he chairs. There were a couple of \n     matters related to the Institute of International Education, \n     which administers the State Department's Fulbright Program, \n     and whose executive committee he heads.\n       And yes, there was a one-hour workout at a gym before his \n     workday started.\n       Were there enough hours in the clock for him, the \n     reporter--whose own deadline driven schedule had spawned \n     portliness, in contrast to his guest's dapper trimness--asked \n     Mr. Russo,\n       ``In everything I do, I always ask myself, `Am I doing the \n     best that I can?' '' Mr. Russo said. ``If you feel good about \n     what you do, then you can be at peace with yourself.''\n       He's handsomely compensated for what he does. Lehman gave \n     him $3 million last year, making him the highest-paid \n     corporate legal counsel in America after General Electric's \n     chief lawyer, Benjamin Heineman Jr., who drew $4.3 million, \n     according to a survey by Corporate Legal Times.\n       Mr. Russo certainly earns his salary and bonuses, \n     especially these days when Wall Street is under increased \n     scrutiny by regulatory institutions on account of assorted \n     scandals concerning corporate behavior. As Lehman's chief \n     legal officer, its Mr. Russo's responsibility to ensure \n     strict compliance with the law--particularly the 2002 \n     Sarbanes-Oxley Act on accounting and governance--on the part \n     of the firm's 20,300 employees.\n       Indeed, Mr. Russo was a key player in bringing about the \n     record $1.4 billion settlement by 10 Wall Street companies in \n     April 2003. Lehman, which paid $80 million in fines--\n     Citigroup paid $400 million--was among those accused by the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission and New York State \n     Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of conflicts of interest while \n     aiming to increase their investment-banking business.\n       ``The whole episode was bad for the industry, it was bad \n     for business,'' Mr. Russo said. ``It could be cited as an \n     example of us being our own worst enemy. While some have \n     accused regulators for being excessively zealous, for the \n     most part the industry brought this upon itself.''\n       What about the continuing tensions and torque of his work, \n     the reporter asked. How does he go about ensuring compliance \n     with the law in such a large organization as Lehman?\n       ``The only way to regain investors' trust is to create a \n     culture of doing the right thing,'' Mr. Russo said. ``I \n     always say to my colleagues, `If it feels wrong, just don't \n     do it.' You cannot compromise your integrity. Everyone in \n     financial services always needs to keep in mind that, first \n     and foremost, customers must be served to the best of our \n     ability. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of doing \n     the right thing.''\n       Mr. Russo's emphasis on ``doing the right thing,'' and his \n     probity, has acquired an almost mythic dimension in the \n     financial services industry. Some 84 million Americans have \n     invested more than $14 trillion in the equities markets in \n     the United States; more than 3.2 billion shares are typically \n     traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq every day.\n       That emphasis on morality is transmitted by Mr. Russo not \n     only to his associates at Lehman (which he joined in January \n     1993). It's a message that he conveys to hundreds of\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\n     other professionals, students, and young people with whom he \n     comes into contact each year through institutions such as the \n     IIE, the Economic Club of New York, the Foreign Policy \n     Association, the Fellows of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and \n     U.S. Council for International Business.\n       He's not a proselytizer, nor is his style preachy. The \n     soft-spoken Mr. Russo learned the art of subtlety from his \n     late father, Lucio, a Staten Island lawyer who was also a \n     member of the state Assembly for 22 years. He also learned \n     forthrightness and resourcefulness from his late mother, \n     Tina, who encouraged him to get summer jobs on the floor of \n     the American Stock Exchange; it was his mother who elicited \n     his continuing involvement with the March of Dimes, where \n     he's vice chairman. (His parents died in a car accident last \n     year.)\n       ``I figured out early in life that success is a matter of \n     focus and energy,'' Mr. Russo said. ``If you find something \n     that you like to do, then you've got to do it with all your \n     passion.''\n       It's an attitude that helped him ace undergraduate studies \n     at Fordham University, and Cornell University, where he \n     earned an MBA as well as a law degree. Mr. Russo was also \n     elected to the honor societies Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa \n     Phi. It's an attitude that helped him distinguish himself as \n     a young lawyer at the SEC, which he joined after Cornell.\n       It's an attitude that helped him become partner and member \n     of the management committee of the prestigious law firm \n     Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. And it's an attitude that most \n     certainly helped land him the job of the first director of \n     the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Division of \n     Trading and Markets. (Mr. Russo is also the author of two \n     books on federal securities and commodities laws, and \n     frequently writes for trade and mainstream publications on \n     commodities, securities, banking, and financial market \n     regulation.)\n       His career has fetched him numerous honors. The National \n     Law Journal listed him as one of the ``100 Most Influential \n     Lawyers in America.'' Not long ago, Mr. Russo was an \n     inaugural inductee into the Futures Industry Association Hall \n     of Fame. These honors are to be savored, of course, but Mr. \n     Russo isn't one to brag about them. During lunch, in fact, he \n     credited his colleagues and parents, and averred: ``I've been \n     enormously lucky in my life.''\n       There's one aspect of his luck that Mr. Russo chooses to \n     highlight--his wife, Marcy, who helps run a Jewish \n     educational foundation; and his children: twin daughters \n     Alexa and Morgan, 15, and son Tyler, 9.\n       The reporter obtained a sense of how much Mr. Russo's \n     family shares his dedication to education and cultural \n     bridge-building--which he said were essential not only for \n     sustaining America's economic might but also for engendering \n     enhanced awareness overseas of the homespun values of \n     tolerance, friendship, and hospitality that serve as \n     underpinnings of American society.\n       On the evening after the lunch with Mr. Russo, he'd invited \n     several young Fulbright scholars from Iraq, India, China, \n     Syria, and other countries to his Fifth Avenue apartment for \n     a reception. The view of Central Park was stunning; the food \n     was scrumptious. But the highlight of the evening was clearly \n     violin renditions of Bach by Alexa and Morgan, accompanied on \n     the piano by their fellow student from the Dalton School, \n     Gennifer Tsoi.\n       They often give such performances, Mr. Russo said, they \n     visit senior citizens' homes and hospices to give comfort and \n     spread good will through their music. The reporter thought: \n     Like father, like daughters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4395-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4395-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4395-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:12 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagree to the amendment of the Senate to the resolution (H.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for reimbursement of certified midwife services and to provide \nfor more equitable reimbursement rates for certified nurse-midwife \nservices; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Improving \nAccess to Nurse-Midwifery Care Act of 2005. For too many years, \ncertified nurse midwives, CNMs, have not received adequate \nreimbursement under the Medicare program, despite evidence that shows \nthe quality of care and outcomes for services provided by CNMs are \ncomparable to obstetricians and gynecologists. My legislation takes \nimportant steps to improve reimbursement for these important healthcare \nproviders.\n  There are approximately three million disabled women on Medicare who \nare of childbearing age; however, if they choose to utilize a CNM for \n``well women'' services, the CNM is only reimbursed at 65 percent of \nthe physician fee schedule. In practical terms, the typical well-woman \nvisit costs, on average, $50. But Medicare currently reimburses CNMs in \nrural areas only $14 for this visit, which could include a pap smear, \nmammogram, and other pre-cancer screenings. CNMs administer the same \ntests and incur the same costs as physicians but receive only 65 \npercent of the physician fee schedule for these services. This reduced \npayment is unfair and does not adequately reflect the services CNMs \nprovide to beneficiaries. At this incredibly low rate of reimbursement, \nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, MedPAC, agrees that a CNM \nsimply cannot afford to provide services to Medicare patients and has \nsupported increasing reimbursement for CNMs.\n  My legislation would make several changes to improve the ability of \nCNMs and certified midwives, CMs, to effectively serve the Medicare-\neligible population. First, and most importantly, my bill recognizes \nthe need to increase Medicare reimbursement for CNMs by raising the \nreimbursement level from 65 percent to 100 percent of the physician fee \nschedule. CNMs provide the same care as physicians; therefore, it is \nonly fair to reimburse CNMs at the same level.\n  In addition, the Improving Access to Nurse-Midwifery Care Act would \nguarantee payment for graduate medical education and includes technical \ncorrections that will clarify the reassignment of billing rights for \nCNMs who are employed by others. Finally, my bill would establish \nrecognition for a certified midwife, CM, to provide services under \nMedicare. Despite the fact that CNMs and CMs provide the same services, \nMedicare has yet to recognize CMs as eligible providers. My bill would \nchange this.\n  This bill will enhance access to ``well woman'' care for thousands of \nwomen in underserved communities and make several needed changes to \nimprove access to midwives. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Schumer, and \n        Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 912. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nclarify the jurisdiction of the United States over waters of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing important \nlegislation to affirm Federal jurisdiction over the waters of the \nUnited States. I am pleased to have three members of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee--the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer--as original cosponsors of this bill. I also thank Senators \nDayton, Kerry, Schumer, and Durbin for joining me in introducing this \nimportant legislation.\n  In the U.S. Supreme Court's January 2001 decision, Solid Waste Agency \nof Northern Cook County versus the Army Corps of Engineers, a 5 to 4 \nmajority limited the authority of Federal agencies to use the so-called \nmigratory bird rule as the basis for asserting Clean Water Act \njurisdiction over non-\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nnavigable, intrastate, isolated wetlands, streams, ponds, and other \nbodies of water.\n  This decision, known as the SWANCC decision, means that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers can no \nlonger enforce Federal Clean Water Act protection mechanisms to protect \na waterway solely on the basis that it is used as habitat for migratory \nbirds.\n  In its discussion of the case, the Court went beyond the issue of the \nmigratory bird rule and questioned whether Congress intended the Clean \nWater Act to provide protection for isolated ponds, streams, wetlands \nand other waters, as it had been interpreted to provide for most of the \nlast 30 years. While not the legal holding of the case, the Court's \ndiscussion has resulted in a wide variety of interpretations by EPA and \nCorps officials that jeopardize protection for wetlands, and other \nwaters. The wetlands at risk include prairie potholes and bogs, \nfamiliar to many in Wisconsin, and many other types of wetlands.\n  In effect, the Court's decision removed much of the Clean Water Act \nprotection for between 30 percent to 60 percent of the Nation's \nwetlands. An estimated 60 percent of the wetlands in my home State of \nWisconsin lost Federal protection. Wisconsin is not alone. The National \nAssociation of State Wetland Managers has been collecting data from \nStates across the country. For example, Nebraska estimates that it will \nlose protection for more than 40 percent of its wetlands. Indiana \nestimates it will lose 31 percent of total wetland acreage and 74 \npercent of the total number of wetlands. Delaware estimates the loss of \nprotection for 33 percent or more of its freshwater wetlands.\n  These wetlands absorb floodwaters, prevent pollution from reaching \nour rivers and streams, and provide crucial habitat for most of the \nNation's ducks and other waterfowl, as well as hundreds of other bird, \nfish, shellfish and amphibian species. Loss of these waters would have \na devastating effect on our environment.\n  In addition, by narrowing the water and wetland areas subject to \nfederal regulation, the decision also shifts more of the economic \nburden for regulating wetlands to state and local governments. My home \nState of Wisconsin has passed legislation to assume the regulation of \nisolated waters, but many other States have not. This patchwork of \nregulation means that the standards for protection of wetlands \nnationwide are unclear and confusing, jeopardizing the migratory birds \nand other wildlife that depend on these wetlands.\n  Since 2001, the confusion over the interpretation of the SWANCC \ndecision has grown. On January 15, 2003, the EPA and Army Corps of \nEngineers published in the Federal Register an Advanced Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking raising questions about the jurisdiction of the \nClean Water Act. Simultaneously, they released a guidance memo to their \nfield staff regarding Clean Water Act jurisdiction.\n  The agencies claim these actions are necessary because of the SWANCC \ncase. But both the guidance memo and the proposed rulemaking go far \nbeyond the holding in SWANCC. The guidance took effect right away and \nhas had an immediate impact. It tells the Corps and EPA staff to stop \nasserting jurisdiction over isolated waters without first obtaining \npermission from headquarters. Based on this guidance, waters that the \nEPA and Corps judge to be outside the Clean Water Act can be filled, \ndredged, and polluted without a permit or any other long-standing Clean \nWater Act safeguard.\n  The rulemaking announced the Administration's intention to consider \neven broader changes to Clean Water Act coverage for our waters. \nSpecifically, the agencies are questioning whether there is any basis \nfor asserting Clean Water Act jurisdiction over additional waters, like \nintermittent streams. The possibility for a redefinition of our waters \nis troubling because there is only one definition of the term ``water'' \nin the Clean Water Act. The wetlands program, the point source program \nwhich stops the dumping of pollution, and the non-point program \ngoverning polluted runoff all depend on this definition. Even though \nthe Administration rescinded this proposed rulemaking in December 2003, \nthe policy guidance remains in effect.\n  If we don't protect a category of waters from being filled under the \nwetlands program, we also fail to protect them from having trash or raw \nsewage dumped in them, or having other activities that violate the \nClean Water Act conducted in them as well.\n  Congress needs to re-establish the common understanding of the Clean \nWater Act's jurisdiction to protect all waters of the U.S.--the \nunderstanding that Congress held when the Act was adopted in 1972--as \nreflected in the law, legislative history, and longstanding \nregulations, practice, and judicial interpretations prior to the SWANCC \ndecision.\n  The proposed legislation is very simple. It does three things. First, \nit adopts a statutory definition of ``waters of the United States'' \nbased on a longstanding definition of waters in the EPA and Corps of \nEngineers' regulations. Second, it deletes the term ``navigable'' from \nthe Act to clarify that Congress's primary concern in 1972 was to \nprotect the nation's waters from pollution, rather than just sustain \nthe navigability of waterways, and to reinforce that original intent. \nFinally, it includes a set of findings that explain the factual basis \nfor Congress to assert its constitutional authority over waters and \nwetlands on all relevant constitutional grounds, including the Commerce \nClause, the Property Clause, the Treaty Clause, and Necessary and \nProper Clause.\n  In conclusion, I am very pleased to have the support of so many \nenvironmental and conservation groups, as well as organizations that \nrepresent those who regulate and manage our country's wetlands, such \nas: the Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthjustice, the National \nWildlife Federation, Sierra Club, American Rivers, the National Audubon \nSociety, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Defenders of Wildlife, \nthe Ocean Conservancy, Trout Unlimited, the Izaac Walton League, and \nthe Association of State Floodplain Managers. They know, as I do, that \nwe need to re-affirm the Federal Government's role in protecting our \nwater. This legislation is a first step in doing just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 912\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Water Authority \n     Restoration Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To reaffirm the original intent of Congress in enacting \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 \n     (86 Stat. 816) to restore and maintain the chemical, \n     physical, and biological integrity of the waters of the \n     United States.\n       (2) To clearly define the waters of the United States that \n     are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\n       (3) To provide protection to the waters of the United \n     States to the fullest extent of the legislative authority of \n     Congress under the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Water is a unique and precious resource that is \n     necessary to sustain human life and the life of animals and \n     plants.\n       (2) Water is used not only for human, animal, and plant \n     consumption, but is also important for agriculture, \n     transportation, flood control, energy production, recreation, \n     fishing and shellfishing, and municipal and commercial uses.\n       (3) In enacting amendments to the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act in 1972 and through subsequent amendment, \n     including the Clean Water Act of 1977 (91 Stat. 1566) and the \n     Water Quality Act of 1987 (101 Stat. 7), Congress established \n     the national objective of restoring and maintaining the \n     chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the waters of \n     the United States and recognized that achieving this \n     objective requires uniform, minimum national water quality \n     and aquatic ecosystem protection standards to restore and \n     maintain the natural structures and functions of the aquatic \n     ecosystems of the United States.\n       (4) Water is transported through interconnected hydrologic \n     cycles, and the pollution, impairment, or destruction of any \n     part of an aquatic system may affect the chemical, physical, \n     and biological integrity of other parts of the aquatic \n     system.\n       (5) Protection of intrastate waters, along with other \n     waters of the United States, is necessary to restore and \n     maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of \n     all waters in the United States.\n       (6) The regulation of discharges of pollutants into \n     interstate and intrastate waters is\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\n     an integral part of the comprehensive clean water regulatory \n     program of the United States.\n       (7) Small and periodically-flowing streams comprise the \n     majority of all stream channels in the United States and \n     serve critical biological and hydrological functions that \n     affect entire watersheds, including reducing the introduction \n     of pollutants to large streams and rivers, and especially \n     affecting the life cycles of aquatic organisms and the flow \n     of higher order streams during floods.\n       (8) The pollution or other degradation of waters of the \n     United States, individually and in the aggregate, has a \n     substantial relation to and effect on interstate commerce.\n       (9) Protection of the waters of the United States, \n     including intrastate waters, is necessary to prevent \n     significant harm to interstate commerce and sustain a robust \n     system of interstate commerce in the future.\n       (10) Waters, including wetlands, provide protection from \n     flooding, and draining or filling wetlands and channelizing \n     or filling streams, including intrastate wetlands and \n     streams, can cause or exacerbate flooding, placing a \n     significant burden on interstate commerce.\n       (11) Millions of people in the United States depend on \n     wetlands and other waters of the United States to filter \n     water and recharge surface and subsurface drinking water \n     supplies, protect human health, and create economic \n     opportunity.\n       (12) Millions of people in the United States enjoy \n     recreational activities that depend on intrastate waters, \n     such as waterfowl hunting, bird watching, fishing, and \n     photography and other graphic arts, and those activities and \n     associated travel generate billions of dollars of income each \n     year for the travel, tourism, recreation, and sporting \n     sectors of the economy of the United States.\n       (13) Activities that result in the discharge of pollutants \n     into waters of the United States are commercial or economic \n     in nature.\n       (14) States have the responsibility and right to prevent, \n     reduce, and eliminate pollution of waters, and the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act respects the rights and \n     responsibilities of States by preserving for States the \n     ability to manage permitting, grant, and research programs to \n     prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, and to establish \n     standards and programs more protective of a State's waters \n     than is provided under Federal standards and programs.\n       (15) Protecting the quality of and regulating activities \n     affecting the waters of the United States is a

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to establish a \nuniversity transportation center to be known as the ``Southwest Bridge \nResearch Center''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ncreating the Bridge Research Center at New Mexico State University. I \nwould also like to thank my good friend Senator Bingaman for \ncosponsoring this important bill.\n  New Mexico State University (NMSU) is uniquely qualified to be the \nhome of the Bridge Research Center. For over three decades NMSU has \napplied its considerable talents to solving technological problems \nrelated to bridge systems. It makes sense that we capitalize on NMSU's \nhistory and expertise in this field by establishing the bridge research \ncenter.\n  The Bridge Research Center will develop smart bridge evaluation \ntechniques using advanced sensors and instrumentation. Additionally, \nthe NMSU Bridge Center will improve bridge design methodologies, create \nnew inspection techniques for bridges, and find better ways to conduct \nnondestructive evaluation and testing. Finally, the Bridge Center will \nconduct research into high performance materials to address durability \nand retrofit needs.\n  I have no doubt that NMSU will apply its extensive capability to \ndevelop theoretical concepts into practical solutions for bridge \nproblems all across our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Southwest Bridge Research \n     Center Establishment Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. BRIDGE RESEARCH CENTER.\n\n       Section 5505 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(k) Southwest Bridge Research Center.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In addition to the university \n     transportation centers receiving grants under subsections (a) \n     and (b), the Secretary shall provide grants to New Mexico \n     State University, in collaboration with the Oklahoma \n     Transportation Center, to establish and operate a university \n     transportation center to be known as the `Southwest Bridge \n     Research Center' (referred to in this subsection as the \n     `Center').\n       ``(2) Purpose.--The purpose of the Center shall be to \n     contribute at a national level to a systems approach to \n     improving the overall performance of bridges, with an \n     emphasis on--\n       ``(A) increasing the number of highly skilled individuals \n     entering the field of transportation;\n       ``(B) improving the monitoring of structural health over \n     the life of bridges;\n       ``(C) developing innovative technologies for bridge testing \n     and assessment;\n       ``(D) developing technologies and procedures for ensuring \n     bridge safety, reliability, and security; and\n       ``(E) providing training in the methods for bridge \n     inspection and evaluation.\n       ``(3) Objectives.--The Center shall carry out--\n       ``(A) basic and applied research, the products of which \n     shall be judged by peers or other experts in the field to \n     advance the body of knowledge in transportation;\n       ``(B) an education program that includes multidisciplinary \n     course work and participation in research; and\n       ``(C) Aa ongoing program of technology transfer that makes \n     research results available to potential users in a form that \n     can be implemented.\n       ``(4) Maintenance of effort.--To be eligible to receive a \n     grant under this subsection, the institution specified in \n     paragraph (1) shall enter into an agreement with the \n     Secretary to ensure that, for each fiscal year after \n     establishment of the Center, the institution will fund \n     research activities relating to transportation in an amount \n     that is at least equal to the average annual amount of funds \n     expended for the activities for the 2 fiscal years preceding \n     the fiscal year in which the grant is received.\n       ``(5) Cost sharing.--\n       ``(A) Federal share.--The Federal share of the cost of any \n     activity carried out using funds from a grant provided under \n     this subsection shall be 50 percent.\n       ``(B) Non-federal share.--The non-Federal share of the cost \n     of any activity carried out using funds from a grant provided \n     under this subsection may include funds provided to the \n     recipient under any of sections 503, 504(b), and 505 of title \n     23.\n       ``(C) Ongoing programs.--After establishment of the Center, \n     the institution specified in paragraph (1) shall obligate for \n     each fiscal year not less than $200,000 in regularly budgeted \n     institutional funds to support ongoing transportation \n     research and education programs.\n       ``(6) Program coordination.--\n       ``(A) Coordination.--The Secretary shall--\n       ``(i) coordinate the research, education, training, and \n     technology transfer activities carried out by the Center;\n       ``(ii) disseminate the results of that research; and\n       ``(iii) establish and operate a clearinghouse for \n     information derived from that research.\n       ``(B) Annual review and evaluation.--At least annually, and \n     in accordance with the plan developed under section 508 of \n     title 23,\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\n     the Secretary shall review and evaluate each program carried \n     out by the Center using funds from a grant provided under \n     this subsection.\n       ``(7) Limitation on availability of funds.--Funds made \n     available to carry out this subsection shall remain available \n     for obligation for a period of 2 years after the last day of \n     the fiscal year for which the funds are authorized.\n       ``(8) Amount of grant.--For each of fiscal years 2005 \n     through 2010, the Secretary shall provide a grant in the \n     amount of $3,000,000 to the institution specified in \n     paragraph (1) to carry out this subsection.\n       ``(9) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund (other than \n     the Mass Transit Account) to carry out this subsection \n     $3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2010.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nSenator Domenici today to introduce legislation that I believe will go \na long way in helping to improve the safety and durability of the \nNation's highway bridges. It is with great pleasure we are today \nintroducing the New Mexico State University Bridge Research Center \nEstablishment Act of 2005.\n  The purpose of our bill is to authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to establish a new University Transportation Center \nfocused on the safety of highway bridges. The new center will lead the \nNation in the research and development of technologies for bridge \ntesting and monitoring, procedures for ensuring bridge safety and \nsecurity, and training in methods of bridge inspection. New Mexico \nState University is one of the Nation's leaders in bridge research and \nI believe worthy of being designated as one of the Nation's university \ntransportation centers.\n  Our highway network is a central component of our economy and \nfundamental to our freedom and quality of life. America's mobility is \nthe engine of our free market system. Transportation via cars, buses, \nand trucks plays a central role in our basic quality of life. Much of \nthe food we eat, the clothes we wear, the materials for our homes and \noffices, comes to us over the 4 million miles of our road network.\n  One critical element of our highway network is the highway bridges \nthat span streams, rivers, and canyons of our cities and rural areas. \nBridges also help traffic flow smoothly by carrying one road over \nanother.\n  Most highway bridges are easy to overlook. Notable exceptions are New \nEngland's covered bridges, the new Zakim Charles River Bridge in \nBoston, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, and the spectacular Rio \nGrande Gorge Bridge near Taos, NM. The fact is, according to the \nFederal Highway Administration, we have about 590,000 highway bridges \nin this country that are more than 20-feet long. The total bridge-deck \narea of these 590,000 bridges is an amazing 120 square miles, or \nslightly smaller in area than the entire city limits of Albuquerque, \nNM, roughly twice the size of the entire District of Columbia, or five \ntimes the area of New York's Manhattan Island. The State of Texas leads \nthe Nation with almost 49,000 bridges, about ten percent of the total. \nOhio is second with about 28,000 highway bridges.\n  A little known and disturbing fact about these 590,000 highway \nbridges is that nearly 78,000, or 13 percent, are considered to be \nstructurally deficient according to the most recent statistics from the \nFHWA. The percent of structurally deficient bridges varies widely among \nthe 50 states. For example, this chart shows the top ten states with \nthe highest percentage of deficient bridges.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                                      Percent of structurally deficient bridges\n                            State                                          Number of bridges               Number of structurally deficient bridges                   (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOklahoma.....................................................                                     23,312                                      7,307                                         31.3\nRhode Island.................................................                                        749                                        193                                         25.8\nPennsylvania.................................................                                     22,253                                      5,464                                         24.6\nMissouri.....................................................                                     23,791                                      5,028                                         21.1\nIowa.........................................................                                     24,902                                      5,259                                         21.1\nMississippi..................................................                                     16,838                                      3,379                                         20.1\nVermont......................................................                                      2,690                                        484                                         18.0\nSouth Dakota.................................................                                      5,961                                      1,072                                         18.0\nNorth Dakota.................................................                                      4,507                                        803                                         17.8\nNebraska.....................................................                                     15,455                                      2,550                                         16.5\nMichigan.....................................................                                     10,818                                      1,764                                         16.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe source is the FHWA National Bridge Inventory System, December 2004\n\n  Florida and Arizona have the lowest percentages of structurally \ndeficient bridges at less than 3 percent each.\n  Structurally deficient bridges are a particular concern in rural \nareas of our country. According to FHWA's 2002 edition of its \nConditions and Performance Report to Congress, 16 percent or rural \nbridges are structurally deficient compared to only 10 percent of urban \nbridges. The report estimates the average costs required to maintain \nthe existing 590,000 highway bridges is $7.3 billion per year.\n  Another surprising fact about our Nation's highway bridges is their \nage. Almost one-third of all highway bridges are more than 50 years \nold, and over 10,000 bridges are at least 100 years old. About 4,200 of \nthese century-old bridges are currently rated as structurally \ndeficient.\n  I do believe the number of deficient bridges in this country should \nbe a concern to all Senators. Ensuring that States and local \ncommunities have the funds they need to help correct these deficient \nbridges will be one of my priorities when Congress reauthorizes TEA-21. \nHowever, because there may not be sufficient Federal and State funding \nto address all of the deficient bridges, it will be important to \nidentify the bridges that are most in need of replacement or \nrehabilitation.\n  To ensure the most efficient use of limited resources, Congress \nshould also address the need for new technologies to help States \nmonitor the condition of the Nation's 590,000 highway bridges and \ndetermine priorities for repair or replacement. Such monitoring \ntechnologies, or ``smart bridges,'' should be quick, efficient, and not \ndamage the bridge in any way. I am very pleased that New Mexico State \nUniversity is one of the Nation's pioneers in the development of non-\ndestructive methods of determining the physical condition of highway \nbridges. Such smart bridges can record and transmit information on \ntheir current structural condition as well as on the traffic crossing \nthem. Sensors embedded in the concrete monitor the stresses on the \nbridge as the weather changes or under the weight of vehicles and show \nhow the materials change with age. The information can then be used by \nengineers to help design more durable and economical bridges. \nEventually NMSU's methods could be used to help design better \nbuildings.\n  In 1998, NMSU installed 67 fiber-optic sensors on an existing steel \nbridge on Interstate 10 in Las Cruces and converted it into a ``smart \nbridge.'' This award-winning project was the first application of \nfiber-optic sensors to highway bridges. In 2000, sensors were \nincorporated directly in a concrete bridge during construction to \nmonitor the curing of the concrete; the bridge crosses the Rio Puerco \non Interstate 40, west of Albuquerque. A third smart bridge, on I10 \nover University Avenue in Las Cruces, opened in July 2004.\n  In February 2003 I had an opportunity to tour the facilities at NMSU \nand to see firsthand the fine facilities and work being conducted on \nbridge technology. NMSU has an actual 40-foot ``bridge'' in a \nlaboratory on campus to allow studies of instrumentation and data \ncollection.\n  I will ask unanimous consent that two recent articles describing \nNMSU's accomplishments on smart bridge technology be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement.\n  New Mexico State is also a leader in other areas of bridge \ninspection. The university has provided training for bridge inspectors \nfor over 30 years. It has also developed expertise in using a virtual \nreality approach to document a bridge's physical condition.\n  This is just a glimpse at the high quality bridge research at New \nMexico Sate University. The university is widely recognized as national \nleader in\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\nall aspects of bridge research and technology. I believe it is fully \nappropriate for NMSU to be recognized as the university technology \nbridge research center.\n  The bill we are introducing today authorizes the Secretary of \nTransportation to establish and operate the New Mexico State University \nBridge Research Center. I do believe NMSU has earned this honor. The \nbill mirrors the language for University Transportation Centers in the \nSenate-passed SAFETEA from the 108th Congress and provides $40 million \nin funding over 6 years from the Highway Trust Fund to operate the \nbridge technology center.\n  The Federal Highway Administration has long recognized the quality of \nthe work at NMSU and has provided grants to support their outstanding \nwork. In November 2004, NMSU's bridge center was awarded a $400,000 \ngrant to install fiber-sensors in a new bridge over Interstate 10 in \nDona Ana, NM. The sensors will relay information about the effects of \nstress on the bridge long before any signs of aging are visible. This \nis the fourth bridge in New Mexico to be equipped with the smart bridge \ntechnology. NMSU's Dr. Rola Idriss is the principal investigator of \nthese projects.\n  NMSU's work is also being recognized internationally. Highway \ndepartments in Switzerland, Belgium, and Japan are experimenting with \nthe smart bridge technology. In October 2004, NMSU's Dr. David Jauregui \nand Dr. Ken White were invited speakers for the International \nConference on Bridge Inspection and Bridge Management in Beijing, \nChina. Dr. White delivered the keynote address for the conference. NMSU \nis currently developing a memorandum of agreement with the Chinese \nbridge community to develop a bridge inspection and management training \nprogram.\n  Congress has also already recognized the fine work at NMSU. For \nexample, at my request, Congress provided $600,000 in 2001 for bridge \nresearch at New Mexico State University, $250,000 in 2003, $500,000 in \n2004 and $125,000 for the current fiscal year.\n  The specific purpose of NMSU's Bridge Research Center will be to \ncontribute to improving the performance of the Nation's highway \nbridges. The center will emphasize five goals: 1. Increasing the number \nof skilled individuals entering the field of transportation; 2. \nImproving the monitoring of the structural health of highway bridges; \n3. Developing innovative technologies for testing and assessment of \nbridges; 4. Developing technologies and procedures for ensuring bridge \nsafety, reliability, and security; and 5. Providing training in the \nmethods of bridge inspection and evaluation.\n  Building on NMSU's research work, the University Technology Center \nwill develop a strong educational component, including degree \nopportunities in bridge engineering at both the undergraduate and \ngraduate levels. In addition, the center will have a cooperative \ncertificate program for training and professional development. Distance \neducation technology and computer-based learning will allow programs to \nbe offered at any of the universities.\n  The engineers at New Mexico State University have applied their vast \ntalents, tools, and techniques to solving technological problems with \nhighway bridges for over 30 years. The team is well established and \nmaintains cutting-edge expertise. The members of the team are \nrecognized and respected at the national and international levels \nthrough accomplishments in bridge testing, monitoring, and evaluation.\n  I ask all senators to support the designation of the New Mexico State \nUniversity Bridge Research Center. I look forward to working this year \nwith the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nSenator Inhofe, and Senator Jeffords, the ranking member, to \nincorporate this bill into the full 6-year reauthorization of the \ntransportation bill.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Albuquerque Journal, Mar. 1, 2004]\n\n     NMSU Designs High-Tech Beams To Monitor Soundness of Structure\n\n                            (By Andrew Webb)\n\n       What if a highway bridge could actually tell you it was \n     wearing out? Or, how about a building that could warn its \n     owners of unseen structural damage after an earthquake?\n       That's what researchers from New Mexico State University \n     hope to produce by embedding high-tech optical sensors in \n     concrete beams. The six 90-ton beams, each with 120 sensors, \n     will support the westbound lanes of the Interstate 10 \n     overpass at University Avenue in Las Cruces, expected to be \n     completed in July.\n       When the bridge is complete, the sensors will give federal \n     and state highway departments feedback about the performance \n     of its design, the new high-performance concrete it is made \n     of, and its structural soundness as it ages, says NMSU \n     professor of civil engineering Rola Idriss.\n       ``We'll get information on how the bridge carries its load \n     throughout its entire life,'' said Idriss. She was in \n     Albuquerque last week to help supervise the placement of the \n     sensors and fiber-optic lines in molds at an Albuquerque \n     construction materials business.\n       The bridge will be the first of its kind in the country, \n     Idriss says. NMSU embedded similar sensors, which are \n     manufactured by the Swiss flrm Smartec, in a much smaller \n     Interstate 40 bridge over the Rio Puerco west of Albuquerque \n     in 2000.\n       ``That research was very promising, so we're taking what we \n     learned on that bridge and putting it on a much larger \n     Interstate bridge,'' says Jimmy Camp, a state bridge engineer \n     with the New Mexico Department of Transportation, which \n     helped fund the $500,000 sensor project along with the \n     Federal Highway Administration.\n       The total cost of the Las Cruces project, which began last \n     summer, is about $6.3 million.\n       As the expected lifespan of concrete bridges has gone from \n     about 50 years in the Interstate system's early days to \n     nearly 80, builders are seeking better data on bridge \n     conditions, Camp says.\n       ``We make a lot of assumptions with bridge theory,'' he \n     says.\n\n\n                             OPTIC MONITORS\n\n       The project entails stringing fiber-optic lines throughout \n     the concrete, through which beams of light are shot. As the \n     beam strains or stretches, the properties of the light \n     change. Those changes are picked up by sensors and relayed to \n     a data collection box near the bridge for eventual analysis \n     by NMSU, which then will give the information to the highway \n     department, Idriss said.\n       ``Those changes can be calibrated to measure the strain,'' \n     she said.\n       At present, inspection of bridges and other concrete \n     structures is done primarily by visual analysis and \n     electronic sensors on outside surfaces.\n       ``Here, you're actually getting measurements from within,'' \n     Idriss said, adding that the added costs would be \n     insignificant in large projects.\n       She said she thinks the technology could be applied to \n     other structures, such as buildings.\n       ``It could become an industry standard,'' she said. ``Right \n     now, it's still in its infancy.''\n       Highway departments in Switzerland, Belgium and Japan are \n     experimenting with similar technology, she said. About 20 of \n     the 560,000 major highway bridges in the U.S. have some sort \n     of onboard sensors to detect changes, vibration and other \n     factors, according to the Federal Highway Administration.\n       The beams were cast at Albuquerque-based Rinker Prestress, \n     a division of Florida-based Rinker Materials, which employs \n     75 people at three New Mexico plants.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Oct. 4, 2004]\n\n            Interstate 10 Bridge To Provide How Bridges Age\n\n       Las Cruces, N.M.--Sensors monitoring stresses on an \n     Interstate 10 bridge will give researchers information on how \n     materials age.\n       New Mexico State University tested the technology earlier \n     on a bridge over the Rio Puerco near Albuquerque. It \n     installed the technology in late summer in the I-10 bridge in \n     Las Cruces.\n       The idea is that the bridge will provide information for \n     researchers on how to build bridges with high-performance \n     concretes, which could save highway departments money in the \n     future, said Wil Dooley, bridge engineer for the Federal \n     Highway Administration's state division.\n       Inside the bridge's beams are fiber optic sensors that \n     monitor how each component bends and changes in different \n     weather and with varying weights of vehicles.\n       The sensors carry data from the bridge to a locker-size box \n     near an off ramp, where NMSU scientists download the data \n     each week to a portable computer.\n       ``These newer concretes are more durable and they're going \n     to last longer,'' Dooley said. ``All our calculations for how \n     to build bridges are made on traditional concrete. Studying \n     new concretes in the smart bridge will help us modify those \n     equations and make new bridges that last longer and cost less \n     to build.''\n       NMSU researchers embedded 120 optical sensors in each of \n     six 90-ton concrete beams in the I-10 overpass. Beams of \n     light are carried by fiber optic lines laced through the \n     beams. As the beam strains or stretches, the properties of \n     the light change.\n       New Mexico is an ideal location to test stresses on \n     different types of concrete. Hot days and cold nights cause \n     concrete to bend and flex, and that happens more in New \n     Mexico than in many other states, Dooley said.\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\n       Rola Idriss, an NMSU civil engineering professor who is \n     developing the smart bridge technology, said the researchers \n     could download information from the sensors remotely, but the \n     I-10 bridge is close to campus.\n       In the future, when the technology is put into bridges in \n     rural areas, highway departments could monitor them \n     remotely--even monitoring all the bridges in the state from \n     one location, she said.\n       ``This is a trend to the future,'' Idriss said. ``The \n     bridge can give you real data about how things are aging. We \n     can use that data to fix problems early and design better \n     bridges with fewer problems in the future.''\n       Highway engineers intend to put the technology next into a \n     bridge on U.S. 70 near White Sands National Monument.\n       That might be ideal for testing remote monitoring systems, \n     Idriss said.\n       Dooley said the technology also could be used in large \n     projects to sense corrosion and allow problems to be \n     corrected before a catastrophic failure, Dooley said.\n       Adding sensors does not add much expense. The I-10 bridge \n     cost $6.2 million; the sensors and monitoring equipment, \n     along with the expense of studying the data, ran $500,000 \n     more, with the money coming from the Federal Highway \n     Administration and state Department of Transportation, Idriss \n     said.\n       ``We're basically proving out the technology for them,'' \n     she said. ``The information we gather feeds right back to \n     them. They tell us what they want and we research it.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 914. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \ncompetitive grant program to build capacity in veterinary medical \neducation and expand the workforce of veterinarians engaged in public \nhealth practice and biomedical research; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, April 27, 2005, marks an important day for \nhealth care, especially personnel involved in public health \nspecialties, because it is the day that I introduced the Veterinary \nWorkforce Expansion Act, VWEA. This bill will create a new competitive \ngrant program in the Department of Health and Human Services for \ncapital improvements to the Nation's veterinary medical colleges.\n  Many Americans do not realize that veterinarians are essential for \nearly detection and response to unusual disease events that could be \nlinked to newly emerging infectious diseases such as monkeypox, SARS, \nand West Nile Virus, just to name a few. The training and education \nthat veterinarians receive prepares them to address the concerns of \nbioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases, most of which are \ntransmitted from animals to man. In fact, 80 percent of biothreat \nagents of concern fall into this category. I believe veterinarians \nshould be our first-responders when it comes to these threats. I know \nthat they are uniquely qualified to address these issues because I have \nreceived this training myself. I received my DVM from Colorado State \nUniversity and have kept my license current every year since I closed \nmy clinic and ran for elected office.\n  Veterinarians are a unique national resource, as they are the only \nhealth professionals trained in multi-species comparative medicine. As \na result of this training, the veterinary profession is able to provide \nan extraordinary link between agriculture and human medicine. The uses \nmade of this link have been extensive, with multiple benefits to \nsociety.\n  Currently, approximately 20 percent, 15,000, of all veterinarians in \nthe United States are I engaged in either private population-health \npractice with a significant food animal component or public practice in \none of its various forms. The need for new graduates entering the field \nis imperative to preparing the country for the threats of agroterrorism \nand bioterrorism. If new graduates do not enter these fields, \ngovernment, nongovernmental organizations, industry, and agribusiness \nwill employ lesser qualified individuals to fill their needs.\n  There is a critical shortage of veterinarians working in public \nhealth areas. The Health Resources and Services Administration, U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, U.S. Public Health Service, veterinary \nacademia, National Research Council, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nare unified in reporting that the shortage of veterinarians in the \nworkforce will only continue to worsen. Combined with a rapidly growing \npopulation and increased human to animal interaction, there is an \nurgent need to adequately prepare the Nation's veterinary colleges so \nthey may educate the workforce of the future.\n  The VWEA would allow credentialed schools of veterinary medicine to \ncompete for Federal grant funding under the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. These grants would be for capital costs associated with \nexpanding the existing schools of veterinary medicine or their academic \nprograms in the areas of public health practice. This new grant program \nwill be authorized for 10 fiscal years. At that point, it is my hope \nand goal that the veterinary medical colleges will be adequately \nprepared to educate the veterinary workforce for the future.\n  For more than 100 years, veterinary medical colleges have effectively \ndelivered a core educational program that has enabled veterinarians to \nadapt and respond to evolving societal needs. Being a veterinarian \nmyself, I want to continue this tradition by expanding existing \nveterinary colleges. I hope that you will join me in my efforts to \nprotect the Nation's public health by providing much-needed support for \nveterinary medical education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 916. A bill to provide for the release of certain land from the \nSunrise Mountain Instant Study Area in the State of Nevada and to grant \na right-of-way across the released land for the construction and \nmaintenance of a flood control project; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Orchard \nDetention Basin Flood Control Act for myself and Senator Ensign. This \nAct will release approximately 65 acres of land managed by the Bureau \nof Land Management in Clark County, NV; from the Sunrise Mountain \nInstant Study Area to allow the construction of an important flood \ncontrol project.\n  The Orchard Detention Basin project is part of the Clark County \nRegional Flood Control District's Master Plan to protect the Las Vegas \nValley from flooding. This comprehensive floodplain management program \nis designed to protect private and public lands from flood damage and \nto save lives in this rapidly growing metropolitan area. When \ncompleted, the Orchard Detention Basin project will protect \napproximately 1,800 acres of urban development from flooding and reduce \nthe magnitude of flooding further downstream.\n  The boundary change executed by this legislation is needed because a \nportion of the detention basin project lies within the boundaries of \nthe Sunrise Mountain Instant Study Area. An ``instant study area'' \ndesignation places development restrictions on public lands similar to \nthose on wilderness study areas. This designation currently prevents \nthe construction of this important flood control project, leaving the \nland and residents living downstream vulnerable to flood damage.\n  Even though the Las Vegas Valley is a desert, flash flooding is an \nall too common problem affecting the people in Las Vegas. Along with \nproperty damage and deaths related to flooding, Clark County residents \nexperience inconvenience resulting from impassable roads during \nflooding events. Support services such as police, fire and ambulance \ncan also be delayed, creating life-threatening incidents.\n  I look forward to working with the Energy Committee and my other \ndistinguished friends to move this bill in a timely manner during the \ncurrent session.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 916\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38; United States Code, to make \npermanent the pilot program for direct housing loans for Native \nAmerican veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to offer legislation that \nwould make the Native American Veteran Housing Loan Pilot Program \npermanent. In April 1992, I sponsored a bill that established the \nNative American Veteran Housing Loan Pilot Program. That bill later \nbecame Public Law 102-547 and authorized the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) to establish a pilot program that would provide veterans \nwith assistance in purchasing, constructing, and improving homes \nthrough 1997. This pilot program has been extended several times. In \nfact, last Session Congress extended this pilot program by three years.\n  Through January of this year, 443 loans were created under this \nprogram. It is time to make this program permanent.\n  The Native American home ownership rate is about half the rate of the \ngeneral U.S. population. This issue partially stems from the fact that \nlenders generally require that buyers own the parcel of land on which \ntheir homes will be located. This is difficult for many in Indian \nCountry, Alaska, and Hawaii because their homes are on trust lands. \nMost lenders decline these loan applications because Federal law \nprohibits a lender from taking possession of Native trust lands in the \nevent of a default. Several Federal programs have been developed to \nprovide home ownership opportunities to Native Americans. The Native \nAmerican Veteran Housing Loan Program is one such program that has \nhelped to make home ownership a reality for indigenous peoples, \nparticularly Native Hawaiians.\n  Under this program, VA offers loan guaranties that protect lenders \nagainst loss up to the amount of the guaranty if the borrower fails to \nrepay the loan. Previous to the Native American Veteran Housing Loan \nProgram, Native American veterans who resided on these lands were \nunable to qualify for VA home-loan benefits. With the Native American \nVeteran Housing Loan Program, indigenous peoples residing on trust \nlands are now able to use this very important VA benefit.\n  The Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program is intended to serve \nveterans who are eligible for homes under the Hawaiian Homes Commission \nAct, and who reside on Pacific Islands lands that have been communally \nowned by cultural tradition and on Native American trust lands on the \ncontinental United States. This VA-administered program assists Native \nAmerican veterans by providing them direct loans to build or purchase \nhomes on such lands.\n  Before VA can make a loan on tribal trust land, the tribe must enter \ninto a Memorandum of Understanding with VA to clarify some of the \nissues that could arise when administering the program. During fiscal \nyear 2004, VA entered into two Memoranda of Understanding with tribal \nentities. In addition, VA is currently negotiating nine Memoranda of \nUnderstanding with Native American tribes. Trust lands that are \neligible for this program include tribally and individually held \ntrusts. Per a Memorandum of Understanding between VA and the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs (BIA), VA and BIA Regional Offices work to implement \nthis loan program together. Additionally, VA personnel continue to \nconduct outreach with tribal representatives to solicit assistance in \nreaching out to tribal members who are veterans.\n  Per capita, Native Americans have the highest percentage of people \nserving in the United States Armed Forces. While they represent less \nthat 1 percent of the population, they make up 1.6 percent of the Armed \nForces. I want to reiterate that through January of 2005, 443 loans \nhave been made to Native Americans under this program. This allows \nthose who have served our nation so honorably and their families to be \na part of the American Dream of home ownership. We need to make the \nNative American Veteran Housing Loan permanent this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 917\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for Flexible Fuel Vehicle (FFV) refueling \ncapability at new and existing refueling station facilities to promote \nenergy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we have all heard from folks back home \nabout the high price of gasoline. When you pull into a gas station to \nfill up your tank, you're now paying some of the highest prices of all \ntime.\n  And when you turn on the news, you see that our dependence on foreign \noil keeps us tied to one of the most dangerous and unstable regions in \nthe world. With oil at more than $50 per barrel, some argue that the \nbest way to deal with high gasoline prices is to wait it out--to wait \nuntil the world market dynamics change.\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\n  I disagree with that mindset. For too long now, we've relied too \nheavily on foreign oil to fuel our energy needs in this country. This \nis not good for the United States--not for our economy, not for our \nnational security, and not for our people.\n  The bill I am introducing today, along with my distinguished \ncolleagues from Illinois and Missouri, is designed to do something \nabout fuel prices and our reliance on foreign oil--something rooted in \nreality, something achievable in the short term, and something that \nactually works.\n  Last week, I visited a gasoline station in Springfield, IL, where \nalong with regular gasoline, a new kind of fuel is offered for \nconsumers--a fuel known as E-85. E-85 is a clean, alternative form of \ntransportation fuel consisting of a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 \npercent gasoline. Ethanol is made from renewable, Midwestern corn, and \nit is 40-60 cents cheaper per gallon than standard gasoline. Last week, \nat this Springfield station, regular gasoline was listed at $2.06 and \nE-85 was selling for $1.69.\n  Not every car can run on E-85 fuel--but there are millions of cars \nthat can. They're known as ``flexible-fuel vehicles,'' and the auto \nindustry is turning out hundreds of thousands of them every year. And \nif any of you are wondering whether cars will run as well on E-85 as \nthey would on regular gas, just ask the Indy 500, which recently \nannounced that all of their cars will soon run on E-85 fuel.\n  The only problem we have now is that we're in short supply of E-85 \nstations. While there are more than 180,000 gas stations all over \nAmerica, there are only about 400 E-85 stations. And although E-85 has \nmany environmental benefits and is a higher performing fuel, the fuel \neconomy of E-85 is slightly lower than that of regular gasoline. An \nadditional incentive is needed to help ensure that the cost of this \nclean fuel remains competitive with that of regular gasoline.\n  That is why I'm introducing a bill to provide a tax credit of 50% for \nbuilding an E-85 fuel station and a tax credit of 35 cents per gallon \nof E-85 fuel. This provision is similar to a provision that already has \npassed the Senate three times. I hope my colleagues will pass this \nprovision again.\n  We've talked for too long about energy independence in this country, \nand I think this bill gives us an opportunity to actually get something \ndone about it. I urge the support of my colleagues of this bill, and I \nthank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 918\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Incentives for the retail sale of alternative fuels as motor \n              vehicle fuel.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to decrease the dependence of \n     the United States on foreign oil by increasing the use of \n     high ratio blends of gasoline with a minimum 85 percent \n     domestically derived ethanol content (E-85) as an alternative \n     fuel and providing greater access to this fuel for American \n     motorists.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The growing United States reliance on foreign produced \n     petroleum and the recent escalation of crude oil prices \n     demands that all prudent measures be undertaken to increase \n     United States refining capacity, domestic oil production, and \n     expanded utilization of alternative forms of transportation \n     fuels and infrastructure.\n       (2) Recent studies confirm the environmental and overall \n     energy security benefits of high ratio blends of gasoline \n     with a minimum 85 percent domestically derived ethanol \n     content (E-85), especially with regard to the reduction of \n     greenhouse gas emissions from the national on-road passenger \n     car vehicle fleet.\n       (3) The market penetration of E-85 capable Flexible Fuel \n     Vehicles (FFVs) now exceeds 5,000,000 with an additional \n     1,000,000 or more FFVs expected to be added annually as \n     automakers continue to respond positively to congressionally \n     provided production incentives.\n       (4) It is further recognized that actual implementation of \n     the use of E-85 fuel has been significantly underutilized due \n     primarily to the lack of E-85 refueling infrastructure \n     availability and promotion and that such utilization rate \n     will continue to lag unless resources are provided to \n     substantially accelerate national refueling infrastructure \n     development.\n       (5) Additionally, incentives in the form of tax credits can \n     serve to stimulate infrastructure development and E-85 fuel \n     utilization.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to enhance \ncompetition among and between rail carriers in order to ensure \nefficient rail service and reasonable rail rates, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as the Senate begins the important task of \ndebating the highway bill reauthorization, another critical \ninfrastructure issue comes to mind: railroads. In Montana, we rely \nheavily on both passenger and freight rail for our transportation \nneeds. However, Montana is served by only one major railroad, resulting \nin shippers being captive to little or no competition for price or \nservice quality. That lack of competition hurts our competitiveness for \nagriculture and manufacturing. It drives up the cost of electricity, \nbecause of the increased costs for coal. Sometimes, it even costs us \njobs in Montana.\n  To address the problems faced by many captive shippers, I am \nintroducing today the Railroad Competition Act of 2005. I am joined by \nmy colleagues, Senators Rockefeller, Dorgan, Craig, Dayton, Vitter, \nThune, Johnson, Baucus, and Coleman. This legislation will extend \ncompetition to many captive rail customers and correct problems in the \nSurface Transportation Board's implementation of railroad deregulation. \nSpecifically, the legislation ensures that rail customers will receive \nrate quotes for movements between various points on a railroad's \nsystem; frees regional and short line railroads to provide access to \nadditional major systems; provides captive rail customers who cannot \nafford to participate in expensive rate challenge proceedings access to \narbitration; and directs the STB to adopt a more realistic and workable \nrate reasonableness standard.\n  In addition to a lack of competition in many markets, the rail \nindustry in America is badly in need of investment into its \ninfrastructure. To address the infrastructure problem, the legislation \nincreases ten-fold the current Railroad Rehabilitation and \nInfrastructure Financing program. The legislation also expands who is \neligible for the loans and loan guarantees, so that qualified shipping \nentities can also invest in rail infrastructure.\n  This is about jobs, plain and simple. Last year, when the intermodal \nhub in Shelby, Montana was closed, over 40 jobs were lost. The Port \nAuthority in Shelby reached out to the railroads to persuade them to \nkeep the hub open, but without competition, the single supplier chose \nto close. Those jobs are real losses in Shelby, a town of a little over \n3,000 people. As high rail rates make U.S. products less competitive, \nimports flow in to fill the gap--and that costs us jobs. I understand \nthat the rail industry employs a lot of people, and I am glad for those \njobs. But we can not let lack of choice and competition in price and \nservice cost us jobs in other areas.\n  Since passage of the Staggers Act in 1980, the railroad industry has \nexperienced significant consolidation, from over 40 major railroads \ndown to 7. Roughly 35 percent of the rail traffic in America is \ncaptive, driving up the cost of transportation and placing a heavy \nburden on shippers.\n  Captive shippers, like my farmers in Montana, have nowhere to go to \nseek relief. The Surface Transportation Board, the watchdogs over the \nrail system, is a complicated and expensive mess that hardly provides a \nfair forum for disputes. To bring a rate reasonableness case, \nchallenging the unfair rates charged to captive shippers, a rail \ncustomer must first file huge fees--fees that will double in the coming \nweeks. Then, the customer must construct a hypothetical railroad and \nprove to the STB that rail transportation theoretically can be provided \nat a lower fee. That process can cost over $2 million per case, and \ntake years to see through. At the end, even if the shipper wins, all he \ngets is a lower fee in the future. Too often, damages for past \novercharging are not awarded. Meanwhile, the railroad sits idly by, \nunder no obligation to justify its rates, and continues to collect the \nexorbitant fees that are under dispute. This system can not stand.\n  The Railroad Competition Act of 2005 directs the STB to address this \nnonsensical system, and develops a final offer arbitration option, \nallowing shippers to take their case to a neutral arbiter. These \nprovisions are necessary, not to\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\npunish railroads, but to develop a level playing field that keeps my \nsmall businesses and agriculture producers in business.\n  Railroads are an essential part of our nation's infrastructure, a \nvast system that includes our highways, railroads, electric \ntransmission lines, pipelines, and digital infrastructure. In a rural \nstate like Montana, we rely on the rails to cover long distances \nefficiently, so rail must remain a viable shipping option. We need to \nachieve affordability, while still allowing sustainability for the \nrailroads. There is a necessary public interest in our shared \ninfrastructure, and the Railroad Competition Act of 2005 is designed to \naddress legitimate public concerns, in Montana and around the nation, \nabout rail operations. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nsecure passage of this important legislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join with \nmy colleagues Senator Burns, Senator Dorgan, Senator Craig, Senator \nDayton, Senator Vitter, Senator Johnson, Senator Thune, Senator \nColeman, and Senator Baucus to introduce the Railroad Competition Act \nof 2005. This legislation encourages the competition and consumer \nprotection in the freight railroad market that Congress intended when \nit partially deregulated the industry in 1980 with the passage of the \nStaggers Act.\n  Introduction of legislation in this vein is a bit of a ritual for \nthis Senator. West Virginia industries depend on efficient and \ndependable rail service at fair prices to move their products to \nmarket. This is a perfectly reasonable goal. However, for shippers \nwithout competitive rail access--referred to as captive shippers--it is \na cruel and impossible dream. I have tried for years, with partners \nfrom both sides of the aisle and all parts of the country, to change \nthe status quo, and improve the economic situation for rail shippers \nand retail shoppers. This is the seventh time since 1985 I have \nsponsored legislation to address this issue, and the fifth congress in \na row in which I have worked closely with my good friends Conrad Burns \nand Byron Dorgan to help shippers and their customers. And I won't give \nup until I actually succeed.\n  Predictably, the railroads will overreact to this bill with scathing \naccusations of what we are doing. In truth, we intend nothing more \nradical than helping shippers, consumers, and the railroads themselves, \nreap the benefits of the basic principles of capitalism--the ability of \nsophisticated actors to conduct arms-length negotiations for \ncompetition, service, and fair prices. Currently, Class I railroads \novercharge and underserve captive shippers with impunity, and with an \nantitrust exemption preventing meaningful oversight by Congress. \nCustomers have no power. This means higher prices for electricity, \nfood, medicine, paper products; the chemicals to protect our water \nsupply and crops, and the basic ingredients of the plastics in many of \nthe goods we purchase. This is crucial to protecting commerce in the \nUnited States. So far, we have been thwarted, though we remain \nundeterred in our efforts and confident of the validity of our \nobjectives.\n  In the 1970s, Congress observed a bloated freight rail network, \nunprofitable railroads, and service was anything but efficient and \ndependable. When the Staggers Act was passed in 1980, Congress gave a \ngreen light to deregulation of the railroad industry. But, as with the \nderegulation of every other industry that Congress has allowed, there \nwere to be constraints on the ability of railroads to abuse shippers \nleft captive to just one railroad. The Staggers Act left it to the \nInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to watch over a partially \nderegulated industry carrying out Staggers' dual goals: Improving the \nfinancial health and viability of the railroads; and improving and \nmaintaining service for shippers. The ICC was responsible for ensuring \nfair treatment and reasonable rates for those shippers made captive by \nmergers or business decisions allowed under Staggers.\n\n  The success of Staggers has been completely one-sided. Captive rail \nshippers in my state of West Virginia have told me--since before I came \nto the United States Senate--that service was horrible and rates being \ncharged were too high. That is still true today. When I was first \nrunning for the Senate, the country was served by about 40 ``Class I'' \nrailroads. After Staggers the railroad industry ``rationalized'' its \nroutes--meaning it dropped unprofitable lines and left more and more \nshippers captive to just one railroad.\n  A virtually unimpeded string of rail mergers during the last 25 years \nhas only compounded the problem. The number of Class I railroads has \ndropped to seven. Four of these--CSX and Norfolk Southern in the East \nand Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the Union Pacific in the West--\ncompletely dominate the industry, accounting for about 90 percent of \nthe freight rail traffic in the nation.\n  This is simple. Fewer market participants mean less competition, and \nless competition opens up the possibility of the abuse of local \nmonopoly power. Under the misadministration of the Staggers Act, first \nby the ICC, and later by its successor agency the Surface \nTransportation Board (STB), abuse of captive shippers has not only \ngotten worse, but it has been unjustly bestowed a veneer of propriety \nby a series of unwise administrative decisions and at least one court \ncase that gave grudging deference to an agency, the STB, that has \nfailed to carry out the clear directions of Congress. The STB, to which \nshippers have looked for a solution, has become a facilitator of the \nproblem.\n  The goals of the Railroad Competition Act are really quite mundane. \nMy colleagues and I hope only to give life to a freight rail system \noriginally envisioned by the drafters of the Staggers Act. We hope to \nsend to the President a bill that will allow captive shippers the most \nbasic right in business negotiations: They will be able to get the \nrailroads that ship their products simply to quote a rate for the \nservice.\n  My colleagues may be amazed to find out that the STB's current \nreading of the Staggers Act allows shippers no such right. Our \nlegislation will simply require railroads to tell their customers the \ncost of moving a certain quantity of product from their manufacturing \nfacility to their customer. Point A to Point B. Nothing in business is \nmore basic, but it is a basic of business negotiations captive shippers \ndo not currently enjoy. Additionally, our legislation also would do the \nfollowing: clarifies that the STB shall promote competition among rail \ncarriers, helping to maintain both reasonable freight rail rates and \nconsistent and efficient rail service; creates a system of ``final \noffer'' arbitration for matters before the STB; authorizes the STB to \nremove so-called ``paper barriers'' that prevent short-line and \nregional railroads from providing improved service to shippers; \nrequires STB to act in the public interest and removes required showing \nof railroads' anti-competitive conduct; caps filing fees for STB rate \ncases at the level of federal district courts (reducing filing fee from \nthe current fee $65,000, which is to be doubled in 2005); calls for a \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) study of rail competition; allows \nelected officials and state railroad regulators to petition the STB for \ndeclarations of ``areas of inadequate rail competition,'' with \nappropriate remedies; creates position of Rail Customer Advocate at \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); and expands infrastructure \nmodernization loan guarantee program.\n  In closing I would suggest that, rather than the highly charged \narguments we have engaged in over the years, my colleagues encourage \nthe railroads to take shippers' concerns seriously, and that we all \nwork to create a freight rail marketplace made up of companies hungry, \nin the best capitalist sense of that word, to do business. That is the \ngoal of the Railroad Competition Act, and I look forward to its \nconsideration by the full Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 920.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING VOTES BY ELECTORS AFTER \n                   DEATH OR INCAPACITY OF NOMINEES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) during a Presidential election year, the nominees of \n     each political party for the office of President and Vice \n     President should jointly announce and designate on or before \n     the final day of the convention (or related event) at which \n     they are nominated the individuals for whom the electors of \n     President and Vice President who are pledged to vote for such \n     nominees should give their votes for such offices in the \n     event that such nominees are deceased or permanently \n     incapacitated prior to the date of the meeting of the \n     electors of each State under section 7 of title 3, United \n     States Code;\n       (2) in the event a nominee for President is deceased or \n     permanently incapacitated prior to the date referred to in \n     paragraph (1) (but the nominee for Vice President of the same \n     political party is not deceased or permanently \n     incapacitated), the electors of President who are pledged to \n     vote for the nominee should give their votes to the nominee \n     of the same political party for the office of Vice President, \n     and the electors of Vice President who are pledged to vote \n     for the nominee for Vice President should give their votes to \n     the individual designated for such office by the nominees \n     under paragraph (1);\n       (3) in the event a nominee for Vice President is deceased \n     or permanently incapacitated prior to the date referred to in \n     paragraph (1) (but the nominee for President of the same \n     political party is not deceased or permanently \n     incapacitated), the electors of Vice President who are \n     pledged to vote for such nominee should give their votes to \n     the individual designated for such office by the nominees \n     under paragraph (1);\n       (4) in the event that both the nominee for President and \n     the nominee for Vice President of the same political party \n     are deceased or permanently incapacitated prior to the date \n     referred to in paragraph (1), the electors of President and \n     Vice President who are pledged to vote for such nominees \n     should vote for the individuals designated for each such \n     office by the nominees under paragraph (1); and\n       (5) political parties should establish rules and procedures \n     consistent with the procedures described in the preceding \n     paragraphs, including procedures to obtain written pledges \n     from electors to vote in the manner described in such \n     paragraphs.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT AND \n                   THE SMOOTH TRANSITION OF EXECUTIVE POWER.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that during the period \n     preceding the end of a term of office in which a President \n     will not be serving a succeeding term--\n       (1) that President should consider submitting the \n     nominations of individuals to the Senate who are selected by \n     the President-elect for offices that fall within the line of \n     succession;\n       (2) the Senate should consider conducting confirmation \n     proceedings and votes on the nominations described under \n     paragraph (1), to the extent determined appropriate by the \n     Senate, between January 3 and January 20 before the \n     Inauguration; and\n       (3) that President should consider agreeing to sign and \n     deliver commissions for all approved nominations on January \n     20 before the Inauguration to ensure continuity of \n     Government.\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       The Presidential Succession Act of 2005--introduced by U.S. \n     Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and U.S, Representative Brad \n     Sherman (D-CA) on April 27, 2005--makes a number of \n     significant improvements to the current Presidential \n     Succession Act, in order to ensure the continuity of the \n     Presidency in the event of a terrorist attack or other \n     crisis. This legislation implements Article II, Section 1, \n     Clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that ``the \n     Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, \n     Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice \n     President, declaring what Officer shall then act as \n     President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the \n     Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.''\n       This legislation is a more modest version of two bills \n     introduced by Senator Cornyn and Representative Sherman in \n     the last Congress to reform the Presidential Succession Act. \n     Because many constitutional experts believe that members of \n     Congress are constitutionally ineligible to serve in the line \n     of succession, both S. 2073 and H.R. 2749 would have \n     addressed a potential constitutional crisis by removing the \n     House Speaker and Senate President pro tempore from the line \n     of succession. By contrast, the 2005 version of the bill does \n     not attempt to address that particular controversy, but \n     instead leaves the Speaker and President pro tempore in the \n     line of succession. It is hoped that Congress will enact the \n     Presidential Succession Act of 2005 quickly, and that the \n     more controversial but nevertheless critical constitutional \n     issues arising out of current law can be addressed as well \n     through separate legislation.\n\n\n                        Section 1. Short title.\n\n            Section 2. Presidential Succession Act reforms.\n\n       Amending the line of succession. This provision adds the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security to the line of succession. \n     Under current law, the Secretary of Homeland Security does \n     not fall within the line of succession. During the 108th \n     Congress, the Senate approved legislation to place the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security right behind the Attorney \n     General in the line of succession, but that proposal ran into \n     opposition in the House. This provision attempts to avoid \n     that controversy by placing the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security at the end of the current line of succession.\n       In addition, this provision addresses the difficulty that \n     arises from the fact that all current members of the line of \n     succession generally work and live in the greater Washington, \n     D.C. area. Due to current law, a catastrophic incident in the \n     D.C. area could theoretically eliminate the entire line of \n     succession and leave the nation without anyone legally \n     eligible to serve as President for an extended period of \n     time. Accordingly, this provisions adds at the end of line of \n     succession senior federal officials who do not generally work \n     and live in the D.C. area specifically, the U.S. Ambassador \n     to the United Nations and the U.S. Ambassadors to each of the \n     four other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \n     (Great Britain, Russia, China, and France).\n       Reforming Cabinet succession. This provision eliminates the \n     requirement that a cabinet secretary must resign in order to \n     succeed to the Presidency. By doing so, this provision \n     helps ensure that a cabinet secretary will not hesitate to \n     take the reins, by ensuring that there will be a cabinet \n     position to which the officer may return after any period \n     of service as Acting President. This provision also helps \n     cure a potential constitutional defect in current law; \n     some constitutional scholars argue that only a current \n     ``officer'' may act as President under Article II.\n       In addition, this provision addresses the so-called \n     ``bumping off'' problem in current law. The current \n     Presidential succession statute puts the Executive Branch in \n     a precarious position vis-a-vis Congress, because it allows \n     the House Speaker or Senate President pro tempore to assert \n     their right under current law to take over the reins at any \n     time from a cabinet officer who holds office as Acting \n     President. This aspect of current law raises serious \n     constitutional separation of powers problems, because it \n     effectively places the Presidency at the mercy of \n     Congressional leaders. In addition, current law raises a \n     potential constitutional problem because Article II, Section \n     1, Clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution states that any officer \n     who shall act as President ``shall act accordingly, until the \n     Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.'' \n     This provision eliminates this ``bumping off'' problem in \n     current law by eliminating the ability of the House Speaker \n     or Senate President pro tempore to assert their right under \n     current law to take over the reins from a cabinet officer \n     holding office as Acting President.\n       Finally, this provision ensures that only individuals who \n     are actually confirmed to the Cabinet-level office are \n     eligible to serve in the line of succession. By doing so, \n     this provision prevents lower-level officers who rise to the \n     position of an acting Cabinet secretary from then acting as \n     President.\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\n       Section 3. Presidential succession during the Presidential \n     selection process. This provision states the sense of \n     Congress that steps must be taken to ensure smooth \n     Presidential succession in the event of a crisis during the \n     Presidential selection process. The provision states that, \n     prior to their political party's nominating conventions, \n     candidates for President and Vice President should announce \n     individuals who should be chosen by members of the Electoral \n     College in the event that either the Presidential or Vice \n     Presidential nominee is killed or permanently incapacitated \n     prior to the Electoral College vote. The provision also \n     advises the political parties to craft rules and procedures \n     consistent with these principles.\n       Section 4. Presidential succession during the Presidential \n     transition. This provision is modeled after S. Con. Res. 89 \n     and H. Res. 775 from the last Congress. It states the sense \n     of Congress that, in the event of the election of a new \n     President, the outgoing Administration and incoming \n     Administration should work together to ensure a smooth \n     transition. Under current law, in the event of a terrorist \n     attack on the inauguration or other crisis, a member of the \n     prior Administration could theoretically rise to serve as \n     Acting President, because new Cabinet officers may have not \n     yet been nominated, confirmed, and appointed by that time. \n     Accordingly, this provision calls for cooperation between \n     outgoing and incoming Administrations to achieve smooth \n     Presidential transitions. It recommends that the outgoing \n     President nominate the individuals selected by the incoming \n     President for offices that fall within the line of \n     succession, it advises the Senate to act on those nominees to \n     the extent it deems appropriate prior to the inaugural event \n     on January 20, and finally, it recommends that the outgoing \n     President appoint confirmed individuals to their posts on \n     January 20 before the inaugural event.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2005.\n     Chairman Ken Mehlman,\n     Republican National Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Chairman Howard Dean,\n     Democratic National Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Mehlman and Chairman Dean: This morning, we \n     introduce the Presidential Succession Act of 2005, to update \n     the existing Presidential Succession Act of 1947. The bill \n     addresses some of the most pressing problems in the current \n     law to ensure that, should tragedy strike, the nation will \n     have a clear and legitimate president.\n       One of the primary areas of concern is the period between \n     the nominating conventions and the casting of Electoral. \n     votes. Should a presidential or vice-presidential nominee be \n     unable to proceed as a nominee between these two events, \n     general election voters and electors would face great \n     uncertainty about their votes. We are concerned about the \n     potential mischief and instability in our government that \n     could arise in such event.\n       We have attached language from the Presidential Succession \n     act of 2005 which calls on political parties to address this \n     issue with appropriate party rules changes and public \n     declarations. Specifically, these changes would call upon the \n     presidential and vice-presidential nominees to jointly name \n     successors should tragedy occur. If only the presidential \n     nominee is unable to continue in an election, the vice \n     presidential nominee would become the presidential nominee.\n       There is no reason for the political parties to await \n     Congressional action. The vagaries of current party rules can \n     be solved much sooner. We call on you to take action.\n       Should you have questions or need additional information, \n     please do not hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Cornyn,\n                                             United States Senate.\n                                                     Brad Sherman,\n                           United States House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. \n        Clinton):\n  S. 921. A bill to provide for secondary school reform, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a bill \nwith Senators Durbin, Kennedy, and Clinton that will help our Nation's \nhigh school students graduate with the knowledge necessary to succeed \nin post-secondary education and the skills needed to succeed in the \nworkforce.\n  Unfortunately too many high school students today are not completing \nhigh school at all or with the skills necessary to enter post-secondary \neducation or the workforce. The statistics are staggering. Every day, \n3,000 teenagers drop out of high school. This year over 500,000 \nstudents will drop out of high school. Overall, less than 70 percent of \nhigh school students will graduate and less than 50 percent of high \nschool students of color will graduate.\n  Of 100 9th graders, less than 70 percent will graduate on time, only \n38 percent will directly enter college, only 26 percent will still be \nenrolled in their sophomore year, and only 18 percent will graduate \nfrom college. That number is even lower for minority students. Forty \npercent of students entering 4-year colleges and nearly 70 percent of \nstudents entering community colleges will take remedial classes in \nreading, writing or math, extending their years in and the cost of \ncollege.\n  Only one-third of the U.S. workforce has any post-secondary education \nbut it is estimated that 60 percent of new jobs in the 21st century \nwill require a post-secondary education. Business will spend billions \nof dollars on remediation for their employees in reading, writing and \nmath.\n  We can do better and we must do better for our Nation's students, \ntheir families, and American business. Currently, high school students \nare graduating at meager rates and even if they are graduating from \nhigh school, they are not leaving high school with the skills and \nknowledge to enter the workforce or be successful in college. That is \nwhy I have written and am introducing the Pathways for All Students to \nSucceed Act or the PASS Act.\n  The PASS Act targets high school reform in three key areas: core \nacademics, improving graduation rates, and assistance to low-performing \nschools to improve student achievement through innovative models. The \nPASS Act will help improve student achievement in core academics and \nreduce the need for remediation in college and the workplace through \ngrants for schools to hire literacy and math coaches. Literacy and math \ncoaches bring professional development back into schools and \nclassrooms. Coaches help teachers identify which students are having \nreading or math problems, how to respond to such problems, and how to \nintegrate literacy and math skills across curricula.\n  The PASS Act also targets dropouts and low graduation rates through \ngrants for academic counselors and a meaningful graduation rate \ncalculation. Time after time I have talked to students in their senior \nyear who have said, ``I didn't know I needed four years of math to \ngraduate and get into college.'' Part of the problem is that our \ncounselors are completely overwhelmed. The current national average \nratio of students to counselors is over 450 to 1. My bill would provide \ngrants to bring that ratio down to 150 to 1. Academic counselors will \nalso work with students and their families to create 6 year graduation \nand career plans that will help students identify what classes they \nneed to graduate and achieve their post-secondary goals, whether those \ngoals are training or college, and identify support services such as \nGEAR UP and TRIO that are available to the student.\n  The PASS Act also provides grants to schools for data collection, and \nspecifically on graduation rates. Currently schools do not have a way \nto accurately calculate graduation rates. The Department of Education \nonly requires schools to report the graduation rate based on 12th grade \ndata and we all know that is not when students drop out. The PASS Act \nprovides schools with funding to collect, disaggregate, and report \naccurate graduation rates so that schools can correctly diagnose and \naddress problems facing specific student populations.\n  And lastly the PASS Act provides additional funding for schools \nlabeled ``in need of improvement'' to implement proven, innovative \nreforms leading to gains in student achievement. I often talk to \nprincipals who tell me they know what they need to do to improve their \nschools; they just don't have the funds to make the necessary changes. \nSuch reforms include smaller learning communities, adolescent literacy \nprograms, whole school reforms, personalized learning environments, and \nprograms that target transitions between middle and secondary school.\n  Congress must act now and act boldly to correct the shortfalls in our \nnation's high schools. We can and must do better. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in supporting this bill and addressing the needs of our \nhigh school students.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\n                                 S. 921\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pathways for All Students to \n     Succeed Act''.\n\n          TITLE I--READING AND MATHEMATICS SKILLS FOR SUCCESS\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), as amended by the No Child \n     Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110, 115 Stat. 1425), \n     provides a strong framework for helping children in the early \n     grades, our Nation still needs a comprehensive strategy to \n     address the literacy problems and learning gaps of students \n     in middle school and secondary school.\n       (2) Approximately 60 percent of students in the poorest \n     communities fail to graduate from secondary school on time, \n     in large part because of severe reading deficits that \n     contribute to academic failure.\n       (3) Forty percent of students attending high minority \n     enrollment secondary schools enroll in remedial reading \n     coursework when entering higher education, in an effort to \n     gain the skills their secondary education failed to provide.\n       (4) While 33 percent of all low-income students are \n     enrolled in secondary schools, only 15 percent of the funding \n     targeted to disadvantaged students goes to secondary schools.\n       (5) Data from the 1998 National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress show that 32 percent of boys and 19 percent of girls \n     in eighth grade cannot read at a basic level. These numbers \n     do not change significantly in the secondary school years and \n     are even more dramatic when students are identified by \n     minority status.\n       (6) The 2002 National Assessment of Educational Progress \n     writing scores indicate that while the percentage of fourth \n     and eighth graders writing at or above a basic level \n     increased between 1998 and 2002, the percentage of 12th \n     graders writing at or above a basic level decreased. These \n     numbers show that our concentrated efforts for elementary \n     school students have improved their writing skills, but by \n     neglecting the needs of secondary school students, we are \n     squandering these gains.\n       (7) The United States cannot maintain its position as the \n     world's strongest economy if we continue to ignore the \n     literacy needs of adolescents in middle school and secondary \n     school.\n       (8) The achievement gap between White and Asian students \n     and Black and Hispanic students remains wide in the area of \n     mathematics.\n       (9) The 2003 National Assessment of Education Progress \n     shows that the achievement gap between the mathematics scores \n     of eighth grade Black and Hispanic students and White \n     students is the same in 2003 as in 1990.\n       (10) The 2003 National Assessment of Education Progress \n     shows that eighth grade students eligible for a free or \n     reduced-price school lunch did not meet the basic mathematics \n     score, unlike non-eligible students.\n       (11) According to the latest results from international \n     assessments, 15-year-olds from the United States performed \n     below the international average in mathematics literacy and \n     problem-solving, placing 27th out of 39 countries.\n       (12) Only 13 of the United States workforce has any post-\n     secondary education, yet 60 percent of new jobs in the 21st \n     century will require post-secondary education.\n\n     SEC. 102.

The numbers for minority students are even lower.\n       (11) Even secondary school graduates going on to college \n     are struggling with basic literacy skills, with 40 percent of \n     all 4-year college students taking a remedial course and 63 \n     percent of all community college students assigned to at \n     least 1 remedial course.\n\n     SEC. 302.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support the introduction \ntoday, along with my colleagues Senators Clinton and Kennedy, of \nSenator Murray's bill to improve America's high schools.\n  We have all heard a lot of talk these days about the need to improve \nAmerica's high schools. Bill Gates makes the point that the academic \ncaliber of our high school graduates is one of the greatest factors in \nour country's ability to innovate and to compete internationally in \ntechnological advancements. The CEO of Intel, Craig Barrett, tells the \nstory of the how U.S. students are eclipsed in the international \nscience competition his firm sponsors. University presidents I meet \nwith talk about the strain that remedial education for incoming \nfreshmen places on the school's faculty and budgets.\n  The President's budget this year includes his high school initiative, \nwhich proposes to redirect money to high schools. There's a big catch, \nthough. The President says that to fund his high school initiative we \nneed to eliminate one of our most effective education programs for high \nschools, technical schools and colleges--Perkins Vocational and \nTechnical Education grants.\n  There is a better way. The Pathways for All Students to Success \n(PASS) Act provides the resources schools need to sharpen the focus on \nliteracy and math--skills critical to success in the workforce or in \npost-secondary studies. High schools can employ literacy and math \ncoaches to help support and supplement the teachers in traditional \nclassrooms. The legislation also allows for additional academic \ncounseling, to provide that targeted, individualized assistance that \nmany students need to achieve proficiency in key academic areas.\n  The PASS Act also provides funding that allows schools not meeting \nnational standards to implement proven, comprehensive school reform to \nhelp students learn. Finally, current data on high school graduation \nrates is incomplete, inconsistent and often inaccurate. That makes it \nharder for schools to know which populations of students are most in \nneed of additional attention. This legislation provides funding for \nschool systems to collect, disaggregate and report accurate graduation \nrates.\n  Now is the time to strengthen our high schools. Expectations in the \nworkplace and on post-secondary campuses are higher than ever for high \nschool graduates. The PASS Act supports students working toward high \nschool graduation, enhancing their pathway to success.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 922. A bill to establish and provide for the treatment of \nIndividual Development Accounts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I along with Senator Lieberman am \nintroducing the Savings and Working Families Act of 2005.\n  The need for this legislation comes at a time when Americans face an \nongoing savings and assets crisis. One third of all Americans have no \nassets available for investment, and another fifth have only negligible \nassets. The United States household savings rate lags far behind that \nof other industrial nations, constraining national economic growth and \nkeeping many Americans from entering the economic mainstream by buying \na house, obtaining an adequate education, or starting a business.\n  Low-income Americans face a huge hurdle when trying to save. \nIndividual Development Accounts, IDAs, provide them with a way to work \ntoward building assets while instilling the practice of savings into \ntheir everyday lives. IDAs are one of the most promising tools that \nenable low-income and low-wealth American families to save, build \nassets, and enter the financial mainstream. Based on the idea that all \nAmericans should have access, through the tax code or through direct \nexpenditures, to the structures that subsidize homeownership and \nretirement savings of wealthier families, IDAs encourage savings \nefforts among the poor by offering them a one-to-one match for their \nown deposits. IDAs reward the monthly savings of working-poor families \nwho are trying to buy their first home, pay for post-secondary \neducation, or start a small business. These matched savings accounts \nare similar to 401(k) plans and other matched savings accounts, but can \nserve a broad range of purposes.\n  The Savings and Working Families Act of 2005 builds on existing IDA \nprograms by creating tax credit incentives for an additional 900,000 \naccounts. Individuals between 18 and 60 who are not dependents or \nstudents and meet the income requirements would be eligible to \nestablish and contribute to an IDA. For single filers, the income limit \nwould be $20,000 in modified aggregate gross income, AGI. The \ncorresponding thresholds for head-of-household and joint filers would \nbe $30,000 and $40,000, respectively.\n  Participants could generally withdraw their contributions and \nmatching funds for qualified purposes, which include certain higher \neducation expenses, first-time home purchase expenditures, and small \nbusiness capitalization.\n  Additionally, this bill would create a tax credit to defray the cost \nof establishing and running IDA programs, contributing matching funds \nto the appropriate accounts, and providing financial education to \naccount holders. Program sponsors could be qualified institutions, \nqualified nonprofits, or\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\nqualified Indian tribes, and would have to be an institution eligible \nunder current law to serve as the custodian of IRAs. Sponsors could \nclaim a tax credit that would have two components. The first would be a \n$50 credit per account to offset the ongoing costs of maintaining and \nadministering each account and providing financial education to \nparticipants. Except for the first year that an account is open, the \ncredit would be available only for accounts with a balance, at year's \nend, of more than $100. In addition, there would be a credit for the \ndollar-to-dollar matching amounts.\n\n  IDAs work to spur savings by low-income individuals. The American \nDream Demonstration, ADD, a 14-site IDA program, has proven that low-\nincome families, with proper incentives and support, can and do save \nfor longer-term goals. In ADD, average monthly net deposits per \nparticipant were $19.07, with the average participant saving 50 percent \nof the monthly savings target and making deposits in 6 of 12 months. \nParticipants accumulated an average of $700 per year including matching \ncontributions. Importantly, deposits increased as the monthly target \nincreased, indicating that low-income families' saving behavior, like \nthat of wealthier individuals; is influenced by the incentives they \nreceive.\n  Additionally, key to the success of IDAs is the economic education \nthat participants receive. Information about repairing credit, reducing \nexpenditures, applying for the Earned Income Tax Credit, avoiding \npredatory lenders, and accessing financial services helps IDA \nparticipants to reach savings goals and to integrate themselves into \nthe mainstream economic system. The encouragement and connection to \nsupportive services helps low-income individuals to keep early \nwithdrawals to a minimum and overcome obstacles to saving. Banks and \ncredit unions benefit from these new customer relations, and States \nbenefit from decreased presence of check-cashing, pawnshop, and other \npredatory outlets.\n  But more than income enhancement, asset accumulation affects \nindividuals' confidence about the future, willingness to defer \ngratification, avoidance of risky behavior, and investment in \ncommunity. In families where assets are owned, children do better in \nschool, voting participation increases, and family stability improves. \nReliance on public assistance decreases as families use their assets to \naccess higher education and better jobs, reduce their housing costs \nthrough ownership, and create their own job opportunities through \nentrepreneurship.\n  We must re-instill the value that Americans once put into saving and \npromote an ownership society. Saving must once again become a national \nvirtue. At stake are not just the financial security and prosperity of \nAmericans as individuals but America as a nation. This bill takes a \nstep in reaching out to low-income Americans to meet this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Savings and Working Families Act \nof 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 923. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto require a State to promote financial education under the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program and to allow financial \neducation to count as a work activity under that program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the TANF \nFinancial Education Promotion Act of 2005 in order to call attention to \nan important issue for low-income families financial literacy. I am \nproud to be reintroducing this bill during the month of April, which is \nFinancial Literacy Month.\n  One of the goals of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n(TANF) Program is to help low-income families transition from welfare \nto work. However, there is more to leaving poverty than just finding a \njob. Welfare recipients must learn the skills that will help them build \nsavings and establish good credit so that they can stay off welfare. \nCurrently, TANF does not offer financial education to low-income \nindividuals, leaving welfare recipients at risk of dependence upon \npublic assistance.\n  Furthermore, millions of low-income families, including families \nreceiving TANF, are unbanked. These households tend to do their banking \nat check-cashing outlets that charge exorbitant fees for such services. \nA lack of basic consumer finance education, including lack of \nfamiliarity with how a checking or savings account works, has been \ncited as a major reason why millions of Americans do not set up such \naccounts.\n  Not only are low-income people more likely to be unbanked than other \nindividuals, but they are also the most vulnerable to abusive lending \npractices and hostile credit arrangements. Those with the fewest \nfinancial resources end up paying the most to obtain financing. \nFinancial education that addresses predatory lending will help prevent \nlow-income families from becoming victims of unaffordable loan \npayments, equity stripping, and foreclosure.\n  Burdened by significant financial needs, welfare recipients need \npractical information on the fundamentals of saving, household \nbudgeting, taxes, and credit. With this knowledge, individuals will be \nbetter equipped to move toward self-sufficiency and maintain financial \nindependence.\n  The TANF Financial Education Promotion Act makes strides in financial \nliteracy for welfare recipients by requiring states to use TANF funds \nto collaborate with community-based organizations, banks, and community \ncolleges to create financial education programs for low-income families \nreceiving welfare and for those transitioning from welfare to work.\n  I am not alone in advocating financial literacy for TANF recipients. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said, ``Educational and \ntraining programs may be the most critical service offered by \ncommunity-based organizations to enhance the ability of lower-income \nhouseholds to accumulate assets.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in helping the most vulnerable \nfamilies in the United States get access to the tools they will need to \nsuccessfully make the transition from welfare to work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 923\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``TANF Financial Education \n     Promotion Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Most recipients of assistance under the Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program established \n     under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and individuals moving toward self-\n     sufficiency operate outside the financial mainstream, paying \n     high costs to handle their finances and saving little for \n     emergencies or the future.\n       (2) Currently, personal debt levels and bankruptcy filing \n     rates are high and savings rates are at their lowest levels \n     in 70 years. The inability of many households to budget, \n     save, and invest prevents them from laying the foundation for \n     a secure financial future.\n       (3) Financial planning can help families meet near-term \n     obligations and maximize their longer-term well being, \n     especially valuable for populations that have traditionally \n     been underserved by our financial system.\n       (4) Financial education can give individuals the necessary \n     financial tools to create household budgets, initiate savings \n     plans, and acquire assets.\n       (5) Financial education can prevent vulnerable customers \n     from becoming entangled in financially devastating credit \n     arrangements.\n       (6) Financial education that addresses abusive lending \n     practices targeted at specific neighborhoods or vulnerable \n     segments of the population can prevent unaffordable payments, \n     equity stripping, and foreclosure.\n       (7) Financial education speaks to the broader purpose of \n     the TANF Program to equip individuals with the tools to \n     succeed and support themselves and their families in self-\n     sufficiency.\n\n     SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO PROMOTE FINANCIAL EDUCATION UNDER \n                   TANF.\n\n       (a) State Plan.--Section 402(a)(1)(A) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 602(a)(1)(A)) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(vii) Establish goals and take action to promote \n     financial education, as defined in section 407(j), among \n     parents and caretakers receiving assistance under the program \n     through collaboration with community-based organizations, \n     financial institutions, and the Cooperative State Research, \n     Education, and Extension Service of the Department of \n     Agriculture.''.\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\n       (b) Inclusion of Financial Education as a Work Activity.--\n     Section 407 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C 607) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)(1)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or (12)'' and \n     inserting ``(12), or (13)''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``or (12)'' each place \n     it appears and inserting ``(12), or (13)'';\n       (2) in subsection (d)--\n       (A) in paragraph (11), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in paragraph (12), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(13) financial education, as defined in subsection \n     (j).''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(j) Definition of Financial Education.--In this part, the \n     term `financial education' means education that promotes an \n     understanding of consumer, economic, and personal finance \n     concepts, including the basic principles involved with \n     earning, budgeting, spending, saving, investing, and \n     taxation.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     take effect on October 1, 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 924. A bill to establish a grant program to enhance the financial \nand retirement literacy of mid-life and older Americans to reduce \nfinancial abuse and fraud among such Americans, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about an \nissue that I believe should be a lifelong goal for all Americans--\nfinancial literacy.\n  More specifically, I want to highlight the necessity of financial \nliteracy for men and women who are close to retirement. Senior citizens \nare too often the victims of predatory mortgage and lending abuses and \nother financial scams. AARP surveys show that over half of \ntelemarketing fraud victims are age 50 or older. In fact, financial \nexploitation is the largest single category of abuse against older \npersons. It is clear that the vulnerability of this population stems \nfrom a lack of financial knowledge, so it is more important than ever \nthat this Congress take steps to increase the availability of financial \neducation for midlife and senior citizens.\n  Not only does poor financial literacy leave older Americans \nvulnerable to financial fraud, but it also leads to poor retirement \nplanning. In the next thirty years, the number of Americans over the \nage of 65 will double. For many of these Americans, Social Security \nalone will be insufficient to cover all their expenses, particularly as \nhealth care costs rise. Only about half of American workers are \ncurrently participating in any pension plan, leaving more than 75 \nmillion Americans without an employer-sponsored pension. Even worse is \nthe fact that fifty million Americans have no retirement savings \nwhatsoever. These statistics are frightening. As our population lives \nlonger, we must focus on retirement education for mid-life and aging \nAmericans as well as consumer education for seniors.\n  My legislation, the Education for Retirement Security Act will \naddress the need for financial literacy among seniors by creating a \n$100 million competitive grant program that would provide resources to \nState and area agencies on aging, and nonprofit community based \norganizations, to provide financial education to mid-life and older \nAmericans. The goal of this education is to enhance these individuals' \nfinancial and retirement knowledge and reduce their vulnerability to \nfinancial abuse and fraud, including telemarketing, mortgage, and \npension fraud. The bill also creates a national technical assistance \nprogram that will designate at least one national grantee to provide \nfinancial education materials and training to local grantees.\n  I am proud to be reintroducing this legislation during the month of \nApril, which is Financial Literacy Month.\n  We must offer those individuals who are close to or in retirement the \ntools they will need to make sound financial decisions and prepare \nappropriately for their retirement. The Education for Retirement \nSecurity Act will help older Americans learn how to avoid scams and \ninvest well. With savvy financial planning and smart consumer skills, \nsenior citizens will be more empowered to protect themselves and \nultimately be better able to enjoy a more secure retirement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 924\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Education for Retirement \n     Security Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Improving financial literacy is a critical and complex \n     task for Americans of all ages.\n       (2) Low levels of savings and high levels of personal and \n     real estate debt are serious problems for many households \n     nearing retirement.\n       (3) Only 53 percent of working Americans have any form of \n     pension coverage. Three out of four women aged 65 or over \n     receive no income from employer-provided pensions.\n       (4) The more limited timeframe that mid-life and older \n     individuals and families have to assess the realities of \n     their individual circumstances, to recover from counter-\n     productive choices and decisionmaking processes, and to \n     benefit from more informed financial practices, has immediate \n     impact and near term consequences for Americans nearing or of \n     retirement age.\n       (5) Research indicates that there are now 4 basic sources \n     of retirement income security. Those sources are social \n     security benefits, pensions and savings, healthcare insurance \n     coverage, and, for an increasing number of older individuals, \n     necessary earnings from working during one's ``retirement'' \n     years.\n       (6) Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals \n     in the United States is expected to double, from 35,000,000 \n     to nearly 75,000,000, and long-term care costs are expected \n     to skyrocket.\n       (7) Financial exploitation is the largest single category \n     of abuse against older individuals and this population \n     comprises more than \\1/2\\ of all telemarketing victims in the \n     United States.\n       (8) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Identity Theft Data \n     Clearinghouse has reported that incidents of identity theft \n     targeting individuals over the age of 60 increased from 1,821 \n     victims in 2000 to 21,084 victims in 2004, an increase of \n     more than 11 times in number.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote youth financial education; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Youth \nFinancial Education Act. I am pleased to introduce this bill during the \nmonth of April--Financial Literacy Month.\n  It is hard to underestimate the importance of financial literacy for \nour youth. As credit, banking, and financial systems in this country \nbecome more and more complex, it is time to make sure that our \neducation system teaches our children the fundamental principles of \nearning, spending, saving and investing, so that they can be successful \ncitizens. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said himself that \n``Improving basic financial education at the elementary and secondary \nschool levels is essential to providing a foundation for financial \nliteracy that can help prevent younger people from making poor \nfinancial decisions.'' It is crucial not only for the well-being of our \nchildren, but for the future of our society as a whole that all \ncitizens understand how to manage a checking account, use a credit \ncard, and estimate their taxes.\n  According to the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial \nLiteracy's Survey of High School Seniors, which measures students' \naptitude and ability to manage financial resources such as credit \ncards, insurance, retirement funds and savings accounts, only 52.3 \npercent of students answered the survey questions correctly. In less \nthan a year, 54 percent of these students who go onto college will \ncarry a credit card. These statistics make it evident that we must do \nmore to arm our youth with the tools they need to make informed \ndecisions about the fiscal realities they will face upon entering \ncollege or the workforce.\n  In 2004, only 7 states required students to complete a course that \nincludes personal finance before graduating from high school. In my \nhome State of New Jersey, New Egypt High School is the only school that \nrequires a course financial education. Several years ago I had the \npleasure of teaching a class of these students, and came away impressed \nwith their knowledge and competency in financial matters.\n  While awareness of the importance of financial literacy is improving, \nit is still not being addressed appropriately in schools. Our schools \nmust prepare our children to succeed in every way, including in their \nfinancial decisions.\n  I am pleased that I successfully added a provision to the No Child \nLeft Behind Act giving elementary and secondary schools access to funds \nthat will allow them to include financial education as part of their \nbasic educational curriculum. Although this was an important step in \nthe right direction, Congress can and should do more to address this \nIssue.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide grants to States \nto help them develop and implement financial education programs in \nelementary and secondary schools. These programs will offer \nprofessional development for teachers and prepare them to provide \nfinancial education. It would also establish a national clearinghouse \nfor instructional materials and information regarding model financial \neducation programs.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate debated the Bankruptcy Reform Bill that \nseeks to change the rules governing bankruptcy. While I agree that \nbankruptcy reform should provide an incentive for capable individuals \nto honor their financial obligations, this legislation will make it \nthat much more difficult for people who have fallen into debt to \ndeclare bankruptcy. With these reforms imminent, it will be all the \nmore critical to take a proactive approach to the problem of personal \ndebt in this country and make sure that the next generation learns how \nto better manage their money.\n  I ask for my colleagues to join me in support of the Youth Financial \nEducation Act, which will equip our nation's youth with skills to \nbecome responsible consumers and enjoy economic security as well as \neconomic opportunity in their futures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 925\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROMOTING YOUTH FINANCIAL LITERACY.\n\n       Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n              ``PART D--PROMOTING YOUTH FINANCIAL LITERACY\n\n     ``SEC. 4401.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the credit for producing fuel from a nonconventional source shall \napply to gas produced onshore from a formation more than 15,000 feet \ndeep; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I proudly rise to introduce The \nNatural Gas Production Act of 2005.\n  One of the challenges facing our economy is increasing energy prices. \nTake, for example, natural gas that accounts for 22 percent of American \nenergy consumption. According to the Energy Information Administration, \nover the next 20 years, U.S. natural gas consumption will increase by \nover 50 percent. At the same time, U.S. natural gas production will \nonly grow by 14 percent. At a time when natural gas prices are already \nat an all time high, it is critical that we increase our supply by \ndeveloping our domestic natural gas.\n  This legislation will provide an incentive to increase the supply of \ndomestically produced natural gas, which in turn will help alleviate \nhigh natural gas prices.\n  The Natural Gas Production Act of 2005 will add natural gas produced \nfrom formations more than 15,000 feet deep (Deep Gas), to the list of \nqualifying fuels for the Section 29 non-conventional tax credit. \nExperts consider deep gas drilling at more than 15,000 feet to be a \nnon-conventional source of energy production.\n  Studies show the resource potential below 15,000 feet for natural gas \nis great. The Department of Energy's Strategic Center for Natural Gas \nhas estimated there to be 130 trillion cubic feet below 15,000 feet in \nthe lower 48. In comparison, that is equal to the proven and potential \nreserves on the Alaskan North Slope.\n  While these vast reserves remain, very little production is occurring \nfrom depths greater than 15,000. Deep gas wells require a considerable \namount of time and money. On average these wells cost more than $6.1 \nmillion, and for wells deeper than 20,000 feet costs can exceed $16 \nmillion. Add to that the minimum one-year and longer drilling time and \nyou can clearly see that Federal drilling incentives are needed to help \npromote and speed production of this enormous potential resource.\n  To drill a deep well, a drilling rig will employ about 25 people \ndirectly. In 1979, 128 deep well completions in Oklahoma created 2,630 \njobs. In addition to direct jobs, economists estimate that 60 to 75 \nindirect jobs will be created as well.\n  Due to changes in the regulatory governance of the industry and \ncyclical market conditions over the next two and one-half decades, deep \ndrilling activity all across the country has declined substantially.\n  I am introducing this legislation, along with Senator Vitter, today \nto encourage more domestic production in an area of proven reserves \nthat will increase our supply. I thank Senator Vitter for his work and \nI urge members to support us in this effort. I ask consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  If you have any questions, please contact Mike Ference on my Staff at \n224-1036.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand and improve coverage of mental health services under the \nmedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the Medicare Mental Health \nModernization Act of 2005.\n  Our Nation's Medicare beneficiaries--our elderly and disabled \npopulation--have limited access to mental health services. Medicare \nrestricts the types of mental health services available to \nbeneficiaries and the types of providers who are allowed to offer such \ncare. It also charges higher copayments for mental health services than \nit does for all other health care. In order to receive mental health \ncare, seniors and the disabled must pay 50 percent of the cost of a \nvisit to their mental health specialist, as opposed to the 20 percent \nthat they pay for other services. Medicare also limits the number of \ndays a beneficiary can receive mental health care in a hospital setting \nto 190 days over an individual's lifetime.\n  We must address this problem. The need is glaring. Almost 20 percent \nof Americans over age 65 have a serious mental disorder. They suffer \nfrom depression, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, anxiety, late-life \nschizophrenia and, all too often, substance abuse. These are serious \nillnesses that must be treated. Unfortunately, they are often \nunidentified by primary care physicians, or the appropriate services \nare simply out of reach. Americans age 65 and older have the highest \nrate of suicide of any other population in the United States. An \nalarming 70 percent of elderly suicide victims have visited their \nprimary care doctor in the month prior to committing suicide.\n  Medicare is also the primary source of health insurance for millions \nof nonelderly disabled. More than 20 percent of these individuals \nsuffer from mental illness and/or addiction. This very needy population \nfaces the same discrimination in their mental health coverage.\n  As our population ages, the burden of mental illness on seniors, \ntheir families, and the health care system will only continue increase. \nExperts estimate that by the year 2030, 15 million people over 65 will \nhave psychiatric disorders, with the number of individuals suffering \nfrom Alzheimer's disease doubling. If we do not reform the Medicare \nprogram to provide greater access to detection and treatment of mental \nillness, the cost of not treating these diseases will rapidly escalate. \nWithout the appropriate outpatient mental health services, too many of \nour seniors are forced into nursing homes and hospitals. If We truly \nwant to modernize Medicare and make it more efficient, we must provide \naccess to these services. Not only will they likely reduce costs in the \nlong term, but they will also increase Medicare beneficiaries' quality \nof life.\n  The Medicare Mental Health Modernization Act takes critical steps to \naddress these issues. First, the bill reduces the 50 percent copayment \nfor mental health services to 20 percent. The proposed 20 percent \ncopayment is the same as the copayment for all other outpatient \nservices in Medicare. Second, the bill would provide access to \nintensive residential services for those who are suffering from severe \nmental illness. This will give people with Alzheimer's disease and \nother serious mental illness the opportunity to be cared for in their \nhomes or in community-based settings. Third, the bill expands the \nnumber of qualified mental health professionals eligible to provide \nservices through the Medicare program. This includes licensed \nprofessional mental health counselors, clinical social workers, and \nmarriage and family therapists. This expansion of qualified providers \nis critical to ensuring that seniors throughout the nation, \nparticularly those in rural areas, are able to receive the services \nthey need.\n  In closing, I urge all of my colleagues to step forward to support \nthe Medicare Mental Health Modernization Act of 2005. It is time for \nthe Medicare program to stop discriminating against seniors and the \ndisabled who are suffering from mental illness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN:\n  S. 928. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\nimmediate and permanent repeal of the estate tax on family-owned \nbusinesses and farms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, four years ago, as projected budget \nsurpluses reached over $5 trillion, Congress passed a tax cut bill that \nbegan the process of addressing the unfairness of the estate tax. Now \nin 2005, the surpluses have long since disappeared, and Congress has \nmade no further progress on estate tax relief for America's family-\nowned farms and businesses--many of whom still pay this tax today.\n  Earlier this month, the House once again voted for a complete repeal \nof the estate tax. I myself have consistently supported complete \nrepeal, I have voted in favor of full repeal on multiple occasions, and \nI will continue to support full repeal should that option be brought to \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate for a vote in the future. Nevertheless, \ngiven the persistent state of our more than $400 billion annual \ndeficits, it is increasingly doubtful such a bill could obtain the \nnecessary votes in the Senate for passage right now.\n  I'm not alone in feeling that the votes just aren't there for full \nrepeal. President of the U.S. Chamber, Tom Donahue, was quoted this \nweek stating that the Chamber would likely support a good compromise \ncoming out of the Senate. We all understand the state of affairs and I \nwant to echo Mr. Donahue's sentiments. We must work together to bring \nrelief to those that this tax affects most--family-owned farms and \nbusinesses.\n  It is the family-owned farms and businesses across Arkansas and all \nacross this Nation that serve as the backbone of our rural communities. \nTo put it simply, they are the economic engines of rural America. It is \nthe family-owned businesses that provide jobs, wages, and health care \nfor my constituents. It is the family-owned businesses that sponsor \nLittle League, they pay local taxes, they are a part of the community. \nThey live there. And that's why family-owned businesses aren't the ones \nthat are shutting down and heading off-shore. When we force family \nbusinesses to spend valuable assets on estate planning and life \ninsurance rather than on investing and expanding their businesses, we \nare putting them at a disadvantage to their publically-traded \ncompetitors. I, for one, intend to fight for these family businesses, \nfight for these communities, and fight for the jobs in rural America.\n  In the wake of the House vote and the real lack of votes here in the \nSenate to pass a complete repeal bill, talk of compromise has raised \nspeculation of higher exemptions and/or lower tax rates as an \nalternative to complete repeal.\n\n  Quite frankly, I believe these compromise approaches are incomplete \nsolutions to the problems faced by family-owned farms and businesses. \nCertainly, I understand that a higher exemption and lower rates will be \nconsidered as part of a compromise. But both are expensive and \ninefficient methods to specifically reach family-owned farms and \nbusinesses.\n  Given the restraints of our budget deficits today, I ask, how can we \nraise the exemption high enough, or lower the rates low enough, to \nprovide necessary relief for family farms and businesses?\n  We could not get there in 2001 when projected surpluses reached $5 \ntrillion. What makes us think we can solve this problem today with \nprojected deficits totaling $2.6 trillion in the President's budget?\n  We took these approaches in 2001, and family-owned farms and \nbusinesses still face this tax today, so we should be leery of any \ncompromise approach that considers only rates and exemptions. They were \nincomplete compromise solutions then--and they will be tomorrow.\n  In this environment, I feel we are seriously losing ground on coming \nto a fair and final resolution of this issue. In the meantime, the \ncurrent state of the law places many family-owned businesses in an \nextremely uncertain and precarious position--a law that taxes family-\nowned businesses today, then repeals the tax in 2010, and then snaps \nback to pre-2001 law in 2011 is simply not responsible on our part. \nThis amounts to nothing more than a nightmarish rollercoaster ride for \nthe businesses we intended to help!\n  So, we need to set some priorities and go about the business of \nlifting this tax from these family-owned farms and businesses first.\n  On the subject of setting priorities, I would like to relay a \nstatistic that may startle my colleagues a bit. The IRS Statistics of \nIncome for 2003 show that only 7.4 percent of the estate tax is paid on \n``farm assets, closely held stock, or other non-corporate business \nassets.'' These 7.4 percent should be our first priority in any \ncompromise the estate tax. The remaining 92.6 percent of assets--such \nas widely-held stock, bonds, insurance proceeds, art, and real estate \npartnerships--should not drive or dictate our actions at the expense of \nAmerica's family-owned farms and businesses.\n  This simple statistic helps lead us to a targeted solution which \nshould cost less and immediately help those we intended to help in the \nfirst place. Today, I introduce the ``Estate Tax Repeal Acceleration \nfor Family-Owned Businesses and Farms Act''--or ExTRA. Under ExTRA, an \nestate may voluntarily elect to exclude an unlimited portion of family \nbusiness assets from the estate tax. The carryover basis rules will \napply to these business assets and no estate tax will be paid on them. \nThat is the same deal that repeal promises--but we do so immediately \nand permanently--and at a fraction of the cost.\n  My bill does not seek to change current law to repeal the estate tax. \nIt would leave in place the scheduled increases in the unified credit, \nthe decreases in rates, and the repeal of the estate tax in 2010. My \nbill would only seek to rectify the special circumstances of family-\nowned businesses and farms, in an attempt, not to inflame the issue \nfurther, but to resolve this issue now and forever for those this \neffort was originally intended to help.\n  The goal of the Lincoln bill is that no family-owned farm or business \nwill ever pay the estate tax. Americans are driven to build their lives \nand their communities and they want to be able to pass that on to the \nnext generation. What comes of the American dream if someone works hard \nall their life to build something to pass on to their family, their \nlegacy, and it has to be sold for taxes.\n  If there is an idea that will protect the American dream and the \nfamily-owned business, we should not be reluctant to put it on the \ntable. Today, I am introducing such an idea, and I firmly believe such \nan approach must be part of any compromise if one is reached. In fact, \nI will not support any compromise that does not take care of family \nbusinesses in Arkansas.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look and study the Lincoln bill to \nimmediately and permanently repeal the estate tax for family owned \nfarms and businesses.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 928\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide liability protection to nonprofit volunteer \npilot organizations flying for public benefit and to the pilots and \nstaff of such organizations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation that I \nreintroduced today with a number of my Senate colleagues--the Volunteer \nPilot Organization Protection Act of 2005.\n  The spirit of volunteerism is indelibly rooted in our Nation's \nhistory. From when early settlers landed in Jamestown in 1607 to when \nour citizen soldiers took up arms against the British Crown in the \nRevolutionary War, volunteerism has always been a part of American \nculture.\n  But that unwavering spirit did not stop there, it has continued and \nthrived in many individuals and charitable organizations today. One \nsuch group of organizations that has selflessly given back so much to \nVirginians and Americans are charitable medical transportation systems \noperated by volunteer pilot organizations, VPOs.\n  The mission and purpose of public benefit and non-profit volunteer \npilot organizations involved in patient transport is to ensure that no \nfinancially needy patient is denied access to distant specialized \nmedical evaluation, diagnosis or treatment for lack of a means of long-\ndistance medical air transportation. The principal goal is to remove \nthe geographical and financial burdens that would deny access to \nspecialized care.\n  Last year public benefit flying non-profit volunteer pilot \norganizations provided long-distance, no-cost transportation for over \n40,000 patients and their escorts in times of special need. Mr. \nPresident, this year, that figure will likely grow to roughly 54,000 \npeople.\n  One such organization that has played an intricate part in this \nmission is Angel Flight. Angel Flight is a not-for-profit grassroots \norganization with a volunteer corps of more than 6,200 volunteer \npilots/plane owners--divided into six regions across the United \nStates--who fly under the banner of Angel Flight America. Angel Flight \nprovides flights of hope and healing by transporting patients and their \nfamilies in private planes, free of charge, to hospitals for medical \ntreatment.\n  Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Department \nof Transportation and the FAA closed airports and grounded commercial \nair traffic, but the FAA allowed Angel Flight volunteers to fly. Angel \nFlight pilots flew firefighters, families of victims of the bombings, \nRed Cross personnel, medical and other supplies including the \nprotective booties for the Search and Rescue dogs to New York and \nWashington, DC.\n  In my years of public service, I have always maintained that we must \nprovide access to care to all Virginians and Americans. Medical care \nshould be available to all individuals. Sadly, our Nation is facing a \nmedical crisis. Medical malpractice insurance costs and Medicare \nphysician reimbursement are forcing many of our doctors to stop seeing \n``high-risk'' patients or Medicare beneficiaries and in some cases \nforcing our doctors to give up practice altogether and retire. As a \nresult, patients have to travel great distances to receive the medical \ncare that they need to live happy, healthy and productive lives. \nUnfortunately, a number of these patients do not have the financial \nmeans to travel long distances, thus, ultimately denying patients \naccess to life-saving or quality of life improving specialized \ntreatment.\n  We can say the same with patients who rely on volunteer pilot \norganizations such as Angel Flight or one of its subsidiary groups like \nMercy Medical Airlift in my home Commonwealth of Virginia. \nUnfortunately, due to the public's apparent notion that organizations \nthat use airplanes are financially well-off and have deep pockets, many \nof the volunteer pilot organizations are open to frivolous and junk \nlawsuits. This leads to an access to care issue.\n  Also, aviation insurance has skyrocketed up in price and non-owned \naircraft liability insurance is no longer reasonably available to \nvolunteer pilot organizations. Many insurance companies had always \nprovided this type of insurance but post September 11, 2001, this \ninsurance is scarcely found and if found, the costs have increased \ngreatly, to the astronomical sums of $5 million a year. Because of the \nexorbitant costs of insurance, volunteer pilot organizations have a \ndifficult time recruiting and retaining pilots and professional \npersons.\n  I would like to submit an editorial written by the Virginian Pilot. \nThis editorial correctly identifies the obstacles that these volunteer \npilot organizations have to go through. I would like that editorial \ninserted here.\n  That is why I decided to introduce the Volunteer Pilot Organization \nProtection Act. In 1997, Congress passed the Volunteer Protection Act, \nwhich handled much of the liability issue for volunteer endeavors in \nthe country; however, this legislation did not adequately address \naviation-related matters.\n  My bill amends the highly regarded Good Samaritan Act to provide \nnecessary liability protections in the area of charitable medical air \ntransportation and promote volunteer pilot organizations. More \nspecifically, this legislation will protect volunteer pilot \norganizations, their boards and small paid staff and nonflying \nvolunteers from liability should there be an accident. The VPOs are \nsimply the ``match-makers'' between the volunteer pilot willing to help \na neighbor and the needy patient family. The pilot has full and sole \nresponsibility for conducting the flight in a safe manner in accordance \nwith Federal Aviation Regulations. In addition, this legislation will \nprovide liability protection for the individual volunteer pilot over \nand above the liability insurance that they are required to carry.\n  Furthermore, the Volunteer Pilot Protection Act will provide \nliability protection for ``referring agencies'' who tell their patients \nthat the charitable flight service is available. Referring hospitals \nand clinics are becoming unwilling to inform their patients that \ncharitable medical air transportation help is available for fear of a \nliability against them should something happen in a subsequent \nvolunteer pilot flight. Hence, organizations like the Shriners Hospital \nSystem and the American Cancer Society would be able to make known \navailable volunteer pilot services to transport their patients to \nShriners or other hospitals where they receive care.\n  I know a few people have concerns that this bill would provide \nblanket immunity to Volunteer Pilot Organizations but I want to stress \nthat my bill requires insurance on the part of the pilot and if there \nis negligence on behalf of the pilot, the injured party does have legal \nrecourse. This bill does not provide blanket immunity to VPOs, but has \nbeen carefully worded to allow\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\nlegal action to be brought against the insurance policy of the pilot in \nevent of negligence.\n  By providing volunteer pilots with liability protection, insurance \nrates for these pilots will ultimately be reduced. Therefore, more \npilots will be able to afford insurance and fly for the public good. \nWith less-costly insurance available, I am confident that more pilots \nwill generously give their time to fly for and help the medically \nneedy.\n  This bill enjoys the support of a number of charitable organizations, \nincluding the Children's Organ Transplant Association, the National \nOrganization for Rare Disorders, the Air Care Alliance, the Independent \nCharities of America, the Health and Medical Research Charities of \nAmerica, the National Association of Hospital Hospitality Houses, and \nmany others.\n  Not only does this legislation enjoy the support of numerous \ncharitable organizations, it also enjoyed the support of the United \nStates House of Representatives. On September 14, 2004, the House of \nRepresentatives passed the Volunteer Pilot Organization Protection Act \nof2004 by a vote of 385-12. Mr. President, this is a clear indication \nthat this bill has broad bipartisan support in the House and I know the \nHouse will once again pass this commonsense legislation.\n  I am confident that this legislation will start a trend to help curb \nthe large amounts of counterproductive lawsuits, lower insurance costs, \nand promote the spirit of volunteerism that has been rooted in the \nframework of our country's storied history. I, along with the volunteer \npilots and organizations, and with the thousands of families who rely \nand may rely on the help of volunteer pilot organizations, urge the \nSenate to quickly and finally pass this legislation in the 109th \nCongress.\n  I would like to thank Congresswoman Thelma Drake, our newest member \nto the Virginia team, for taking over this legislation for former \nCongressman Ed Schrock and introducing the companion bill on the House \nside. In addition, I would also like to thank the original cosponsors \nof this legislation, Senators Chambliss, Inhofe, Coburn, Talent, \nCornyn, and Isakson for their support as we work to pass this vitally \nnecessary legislation.\n\n                 [From the (Norfolk) Virginian-Pilot, \n                             Mar. 11, 2003]\n\n             Shield Helpful Pilots From Frivolous Lawsuits\n\n       In the realm of volunteers, few outshine the generous folks \n     at Angel Flight.\n       This nonprofit organization flies patients for whom air \n     transport would be otherwise unaffordable to medical \n     facilities around the country. Private pilots spirit \n     individuals to dialysis, chemotherapy sessions, organ \n     transplants and other surgeries by donating their aircraft \n     and their valuable time. The goal is a noble one: to ensure \n     that no one in need is denied medical care for lack of long-\n     distance transportation.\n       But in our lawsuit-happy society, even these warmhearted \n     souls can't escape the possibility of landing in court. While \n     a law known as the Volunteer Protection Act shields most \n     people who give their time to worthy causes from frivolous \n     suits, it doesn't cover volunteer pilots or flight \n     organizers. Liability insurance costs for Angel Flight and \n     similar nonprofits have skyrocketed from $1,000 to more than \n     $25,000 annually.\n       This prohibitive price tag threatens the future of Angel \n     Flight, which is funded solely through donations. A \n     spokeswoman for Angel Flight Mid-Atlantic, headquartered in \n     Virginia Beach, said the burden will ultimately fall on sick \n     and needy patients. And with 600 volunteer pilots \n     transporting an average of 100 medical cases a month, \n     literally thousands of lives may be affected by this \n     oversight in the law.\n       Fortunately, lawmakers are paying attention. U.S. Rep. Ed \n     Schrock recently introduced bipartisan legislation to add \n     volunteer-pilot organizations to the ranks of those covered \n     by the Volunteer Protection Act. U.S. Sen. George Allen is \n     expected to introduce a similar measure in the Senate. \n     Congress should pass these bills, the sooner the better. \n     Keeping Angel Flight aloft is literally a life-and-death \n     matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 930. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nrespect to drug safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I introduce Senate Bill 930, the \nFood and Drug Administration Safety Act of 2005. I am pleased that \nSenator Dodd is co-sponsoring another piece of drug safety legislation \nwith me. This legislation is part of a sustained effort to restore \npublic confidence in the Federal Government's food and drug safety \nagency. Enactment of this bill will be another meaningful step toward \ngreater accountability and transparency at the FDA. Importantly, this \nlegislation provides the FDA with some much needed authorities to \nensure the safety and efficacy of drugs for the long haul.\n  The Food and Drug Administration cannot always serve the American \npeople and the interests of the drug industry at the same time. These \ntwo interests are often at odds with each other. When there is a \nconflict the American people should win out each and every time. The \nVioxx situation is a classic example of this inherent conflict. \nAmerican consumers demand and deserve assurances that the medicines in \ntheir cabinets are safe. The risks associated with a drug should be \noutweighed by its benefits, and this risk-benefit analysis should not \nbe negotiated by the industry behind closed doors. Unfortunately, \nreforms at the FDA are necessary to place drug safety front and center \nonce and for all.\n  When drugs go on the market, they are used by exponentially larger \nnumbers of people than were involved in the pre-approval trials. What \nJohn Q. Public deserves and demands is for the FDA to embrace a renewed \nmission to pursue aggressively key safety questions that the industry \nwould sometimes prefer to ignore. The FDA must protect the health of \nthe public by considering not only the benefits but also the risks of \ndrugs for the tens of millions of Americans who actually use new drugs \nalready available in the marketplace. The FDA's post-market evaluation \nand research needs to be a separate but equal partner with pre-approval \nevaluation. Indeed FDA's post marketing surveillance function can no \nlonger take a back seat within the agency.\n  I have been pressing for necessary reforms at the FDA--both \nadministrative and legislative--and the focus of these reforms center \non a reorganization of the FDA. The Food and Drug Administration Safety \nAct of 2005 will establish an independent Center within the FDA--the \nCenter for Post-market Drug Evaluation and Research (CPDER). The new \nCenter's primary mission, vision and values will focus on conducting \nrisk assessment for approved drugs and biological products once they \nare on the market. The Director of the Center will report directly to \nthe FDA Commissioner and will be responsible for monitoring and \nassessing the safety and efficacy of drugs and biological products.\n  Today's legislation is focused on the equal importance of pre-\nmarketing evaluations by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research \n(CDER)--the pre-market Center--and post-marketing evaluations by the \nnewly established post-market Center. Consultation and coordination \nbetween pre-market and post-market Centers will be essential, but their \nrelationship will place them on equal footing with the other. The \npresent Office of Drug Safety will no longer be effectively under the \nthumb of the Office of New Drugs. We are hopeful that this \nreorganization of the FDA will go a long way toward eliminating the \nconflict of interest that shadows the FDA's post-market risk assessment \npresently.\n  Today's legislation will also: authorize the Director to require \nmanufacturers to conduct post-market clinical or observational studies \nif there are questions about the safety or efficacy of a drug or \nbiological product.\n  Authorize the Director to determine whether an approved drug or \nlicensed biological product may present an unreasonable risk to the \nhealth of patients or the general public, given the known benefits.\n  Authorize the Director to take corrective action if a drug or \nbiological product presents an unreasonable risk to patients or the \ngeneral public--including the authority to make changes to the label or \napproved indication, place restrictions on product distribution, \nrequire physician and consumer education, and require the use of other \nrisk management tools.\n  Allow the Director to withdraw approval of a drug or biological \nproduct if necessary to protect the public health.\n  Require submission of advertising prior to dissemination, and certain \nadvertising disclosures related to risks and benefits to patients, if \none or more\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nof the three following conditions is met: the Director has determined \nthat the product may present an unreasonable risk to patients, the \nproduct is the subject of an outstanding post-market study requirement, \nor the product was approved within the last two years.\n  Establish strong enforcement mechanisms, including civil monetary \npenalties, for those who fail to comply.\n  Ensure that the Director benefits from all appropriate resources, \nincluding but not limited to consultation with the Center for Drug \nEvaluation and Research (CDER) or the Center for Biologics Evaluation \nand Research (CBER), and makes all decisions based on a risk-benefit \nanalysis.\n  Ensure that all findings and decisions made by CPDER are transparent.\n  Require a report and recommendations to Congress on post-market \nsurveillance of medical devices.\n  Authorize graduated appropriations totaling $500 million over five \nyears to ensure that CPDER has the resources to accomplish its goals.\n  Today's legislation is another important step toward reforming the \nFDA. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort by cosponsoring \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Grassley in \nannouncing the introduction of the Food and Drug Administration Safety \nAct of 2005 (FDASA). I would like to thank Senator Grassley for his \ncommitment to this issue and his willingness to work on this important \nlegislation in a bipartisan manner. Senator Grassley and I have spent \nthe past several months crafting this legislation, which will create a \nnew center within the FDA that will be responsible for ensuring that \nprescription drugs are safe once they are on the market.\n  Our hope is that the creation of this new center will restore \nconfidence in the medicines that so many Americans rely on to safeguard \ntheir health and well-being. Patients should be able to rest-assured \nthat the drugs they take to help them will not hurt them instead.\n  The American pharmaceutical industry is a true success story. Their \nincredible innovations over the last few decades have saved and \nimproved millions of lives, and made prescription drugs an integral \npart of quality health care. I am proud to say that Connecticut is home \nto a number of leading pharmaceutical companies. There is very little \nquestion that the American drug industry is the world leader. This is \ndue, in no small part, to the FDA. Throughout the world, the FDA seal \nof approval--the words ``FDA Approved''--has stood as the gold standard \nfor safety and quality.\n  Unfortunately, events of the past year have put patients at risk and \nhave seriously tarnished the FDA's image. Recent developments have cast \ninto doubt the FDA's ability to ensure that the drugs that it approves \nare safe--especially once they are on the market. These concerns are \nbad for patients, bad for physicians, and bad for the drug industry.\n  Like many Americans, I have been deeply disturbed by the revelations \nof significant risk associated with widely used medications to treat \npain and depression. These revelations raise real and legitimate \nquestions about the safety of drugs that have already been approved. It \nwould be one thing if these drugs were in a trial phase, but safety \nissues are being identified in drugs that are already on the market and \nwidely used. Health risks significant enough to remove drugs from the \nmarket or significantly restrict their use are becoming clear only \nafter millions of Americans have been exposed to real or potential \nharm.\n  It has been estimated that more than 100,000 Americans might have \nbeen seriously injured or killed by a popular pain medication, while \nmillions of children have been prescribed antidepressants that could \nput them at risk. This recent spate of popular medicines being \nidentified as unsafe underscores the need to take additional steps to \nmonitor and protect safety after a drug has been approved.\n  The legislation that Senator Grassley and I are introducing today \nwill do three things to restore confidence in the words ``FDA \nApproved,'' and ensure that the FDA has all the tools that it needs to \nprotect patients. First and foremost, it will establish within the FDA \na new center--the Center for Postmarket Drug Evaluation and Research \n(CPDER)--which will report directly to the FDA Commissioner and be \nresponsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs and \nbiological products once they are on the market.\n  I strongly believe that the creation of such a new, independent \ncenter is necessary. There have been disturbing reports that suggest \nthat the FDA does not place enough emphasis on drug safety, and that \nconcerns raised by those in the Office of Drug Safety (ODS) are \nsometimes ignored and even suppressed. An internal study conducted by \nthe HHS Office of the Inspector General in 2002 revealed that \napproximately one-fifth of drug reviewers had been pressured to approve \na drug despite concerns about safety, efficacy, or quality. In \naddition, more than one-third said they were ``not at all'' or only \n``somewhat'' confident that final decisions of the Center for Drug \nEvaluation and Research (CDER) adequately assessed safety. The creation \nof a new center will raise the profile of drug safety within the \nagency.\n  Second, our bill will provide the Director of CPDER with significant \nnew authorities, including: the authority to require drug companies to \nconduct postmarket studies of their products if there are questions \nabout safety or effectiveness; the authority to take corrective \nactions, such as labeling changes, restricted distribution, and other \nrisk management tools, if an unreasonable risk exists; the authority to \nreview drug advertisements before they are disseminated, and to require \ncertain disclosures about increased risk; and in extreme cases, the \nauthority to pull the product off the market.\n  These new authorities will allow the FDA to act quickly to get \nanswers when there are questions about the safety of a drug, and to act \ndecisively to mitigate the risks when the evidence shows that a drug \npresents a safety issue. With these authorities, we will never again \nhave a situation where a critical labeling change takes two years to \ncomplete, as was the case with Vioxx. When we are talking about drugs \nthat are already on the market and in widespread use, any delay can put \nmillions of patients in harm's way.\n  Third and lastly, this legislation will authorize the appropriation \nof $500 million over the next 5 years to provide the new center with \nthe resources to carry out the provisions of this legislation.\n  I would like to thank several groups that have endorsed this bill, \nand that were instrumental in its drafting, including Consumer's Union, \nthe Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the National \nOrganization for Rare Disorders (NORD), the National Women's Health \nNetwork (NWHN), the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), the \nConsumer Federation of America, and the Center for Medical Consumers.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues, including \nSenator Enzi and Senator Kennedy on the HELP Committee, to see this \nlegislation enacted as soon as possible. By strengthening the ability \nof the FDA to ensure the safety of prescription drugs once they are on \nthe market, this legislation will allow physicians to prescribe, and \npatients to use, prescription drugs without wondering if the medicines \nintended to help them will hurt them instead. It will help ensure that \nthe term ``FDA-Approved'' will remain the gold standard for safety and \nquality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 931. A bill to reduce temporarily the duty on certain articles of \nnatural cork; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress the difference between the import tariff placed on unfinished \ncork and refined cork. Unfinished cork has a higher import tariff than \nalready-refined cork--this problem is in need of a resolution.\n  Unfinished cork is the principal element of a fishing pole's grip and \nmust be imported as it is not available domestically. Many fishing rod \ncompanies reside in Montana, such as the R.L. Winston Rod Company of \nTwin Bridges. I am aware that fishing rod manufacturers, particularly \nfly-fishing rod manufacturers, are under pressure to increase the price \nof their equipment because of prohibitively high tariff on the import \nof unfinished cork.\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\nWhile the tariff on already-finished cork is 6 percent, unfinished cork \nis subject to a 14 percent tariff. It just does not make good sense to \ncharge a significantly higher levy on an unfinished product that is \nimported and then handcrafted by American workers.\n  This inconsistency must end by leveling the difference between the \ntwo tariffs. The reduction will enable American workers to continue \nmanufacturing custom-made fishing rod grips, keep the price of all \nfishing poles down, and bring a measure of common sense to this portion \nof our tariff law. Once resolved, domestic businesses will be able to \nfinish fly rods here, leading to an increasingly competitive place in \nthe market for American goods. With this change Montana's small \nbusinesses will benefit as will our overall economy in the state.\n  I am pleased that some of my colleagues in the House have decided to \nassist in this effort. I truly appreciate the work of Representative \nSimmons of Connecticut, who is leading this legislation in the House. \nHe has already signed on 17 co-sponsors to this legislation at last \ncount. His assistance has been invaluable, and I look forward to \nworking with him as this legislation moves forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for paid sick leave to ensure that \nAmericans can address their own health needs and the health needs of \ntheir families; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the ability of American families to live \nthe American dream is becoming harder and harder. With each passing \nmonth, it's more difficult for families to earn a living--to pay the \nmortgage and the doctor bills, and send their sons and daughters to \ncollege.\n  In the Bush economy, families are worried about their job security, \ntheir income, and the cost of living. They're working longer and harder \nand finding it more and more difficult to balance their work and their \nfamily responsibilities.\n  Most Americans assume that paid sick days are a right. They're not. \nHalf of all American workers are not guaranteed the right to time off \nwhen they're ill, without losing their pay, or even their job.\n  In 1993, Congress and the administration guaranteed unpaid leave for \nmillions of working men and women to deal with serious medical \nproblems.\n  It's time to build on this success, and ensure that millions of \nworkers can also take time off when they need an annual check-up, when \ntheir children are sick with a cold, and when their ailing elderly \nparents need to be taken to the doctor.\n  Hard-working men and women deserve better. That's why Congresswoman \nDeLauro and I are introducing legislation to guarantee workers 7 days \nof paid sick leave a year to care for their own medical needs and those \nof their family members. This proposal covers workers at all \nbusinesses, except small businesses with fewer than 15 employees.\n  This is a family issue. When my son was diagnosed with cancer in his \nleg as a child, and had to undergo surgery, I was able to take the time \nI needed to be there for him. But year after year, countless employees \nhave to choose between the job they need and the family they love. \nFamilies deserve the flexibility to care for each other when they get \nsick.\n  It's an economic issue. Paid sick days actually save businesses money \nthrough reduced turnover and increased productivity. A recent study by \nCornell University examined the problem of employees coming to work \ndespite medical problems. They found it costs business $180 billion \nannually in lost productivity.\n  It's also a public health issue. Too often, employees come to work \nsick and co-workers and many others can easily be infected. Recently, a \ncourt ruled that because of the lack of paid sick leave, a stomach \nvirus in one worker infected 600 guests and 300 employees at the Reno \nHilton Hotel in Nevada.\n  Paid sick days will help prevent the spread of illnesses like that. \nTaking time off to treat illnesses and injuries will save health costs \nin the long run. It will make an important difference for insurers, for \nhospitals, and for the health of millions of Americans.\n  It's long past time to provide paid sick days for workers. This bill \nis a first step to guarantee that every worker who needs sick leave has \nit and can afford to take it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4428-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4428-S4429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 126--HONORING FRED T.

Military Commander may impose in his \n     discretion'';\n       Whereas the United States Army issued Civilian Exclusion \n     Order Number 34, directing that after May 9, 1942, all \n     persons of Japanese ancestry were to be removed from \n     designated areas of the West Coast because they were \n     considered to be a security threat;\n       Whereas in response to that Civilian Exclusion Order, Fred \n     Korematsu's family reported to Tanforan, a former racetrack \n     in the San Francisco area that was used as 1 of 15 temporary \n     detention centers, before being sent to an internment camp in \n     Topaz, Utah;\n       Whereas more than 120,000 Japanese Americans were similarly \n     detained in 10 permanent War Relocation Authority camps \n     located in isolated desert areas of the States of Arizona, \n     Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming, \n     without any charges brought or due process accorded;\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu, then 22 years old and working as a \n     shipyard welder in Oakland, California, refused to join his \n     family in reporting to Tanforan, based on his belief that he \n     was a loyal American and not a security threat;\n       Whereas on May 30, 1942, Fred Korematsu was arrested and \n     jailed for remaining in a military area, tried in United \n     States district court, found guilty of violating Civilian \n     Exclusion Order Number 34, and sentenced to 5 years of \n     probation;\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu unsuccessfully challenged that \n     Civilian Exclusion Order as it applied to him, and appealed \n     the decision of the district court to the United States\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\n     Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, where his conviction \n     was sustained;\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu was subsequently confined with his \n     family in the internment camp in Topaz for 2 years, and \n     during that time, he appealed his conviction to the United \n     States Supreme Court;\n       Whereas on December 18, 1944, the Supreme Court issued its \n     decision in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, which \n     upheld Fred Korematsu's conviction by a vote of 6-to-3, based \n     on the finding of the Supreme Court that Fred Korematsu was \n     not removed from his home ``because of hostility to him or \n     his race'' but because the United States was at war with \n     Japan and the United States military ``feared an invasion of \n     our West Coast'';\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu continued to maintain his innocence \n     for decades following World War II;\n       Whereas, under section 552 of title 5, United States Code \n     (commonly known as the ``Freedom of Information Act''), an \n     historian discovered numerous government documents indicating \n     that, at the time Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, \n     was decided, the Federal Government suppressed findings that \n     Japanese Americans on the West Coast were not security \n     threats;\n       Whereas in light of this newly discovered information, Fred \n     Korematsu filed a writ of error coram nobis with the United \n     States District Court for the Northern District of \n     California;\n       Whereas on November 10, 1983, United States District Judge \n     Marilyn Hall Patel overturned Fred Korematsu's conviction, \n     concluding that senior government officials knew there was no \n     factual basis for the claim of ``military necessity'' when \n     they presented their case before the Supreme Court in 1944;\n       Whereas in that decision, Judge Patel stated that, while \n     Korematsu v. United States ``remains on the pages of our \n     legal and political history . . . [as] historical precedent \n     it stands as a constant caution that in times of war or \n     declared military necessity our institutions must be vigilant \n     in protecting constitutional guarantees'';\n       Whereas the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment \n     of Civilians, authorized by Congress in 1980 to review the \n     facts and circumstances surrounding the relocation and \n     internment of Japanese Americans under Executive Order Number \n     9066 (42 Fed. Reg. 1563), concluded that ``today the decision \n     in Korematsu lies overruled in the court of history'';\n       Whereas the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment \n     of Civilians concluded that a ``grave personal injustice was \n     done to the American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese \n     ancestry who, without individual review or any probative \n     evidence against them were excluded, removed and detained by \n     the United States during World War II'', and that those acts \n     were ``motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime \n     hysteria, and a failure of political leadership'';\n       Whereas the overturning of Fred Korematsu's conviction and \n     the findings of Commission on Wartime Relocation and \n     Internment of Civilians influenced the decision by Congress \n     to pass the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 U.S.C. App. 1989b \n     et seq.) to request a Presidential apology and symbolic \n     payment of compensation to persons of Japanese ancestry who \n     lost liberty or property because of discriminatory action by \n     the Federal Government;\n       Whereas on August 10, 1988, President Reagan signed that \n     Act into law, stating, ``[H]ere we admit a wrong; here we \n     reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under \n     the law'';\n       Whereas on January 15, 1998, President Clinton awarded the \n     Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United \n     States, to Fred Korematsu, stating, ``In the long history of \n     our country's constant search for justice, some names of \n     ordinary citizens stand for millions of souls: Plessy, Brown, \n     Parks. To that distinguished list, today we add the name of \n     Fred Korematsu.'';\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu remained a tireless advocate for \n     civil liberties and justice throughout his life, particularly \n     speaking out against racial discrimination and violence \n     targeting Arab, Muslim, South Asian, and Sikh Americans in \n     the wake of the September 11, 2001, tragedy, and cautioning \n     the Federal Government against repeating mistakes of the past \n     by singling out individuals for heightened scrutiny on the \n     basis of race, ethnicity, or religion;\n       Whereas on March 30, 2005, Fred Korematsu died at the age \n     of 86 in Larkspur, California; and\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu was a role model for all Americans \n     who love the United States and the promises contained in the \n     Constitution, and his strength and perseverance serve as an \n     inspiration for all people striving for equality and justice: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors Fred T. Korematsu for his loyalty and patriotism \n     to the United States, his work to advocate for the civil \n     rights and civil liberties of all Americans, and his \n     dedication to justice and equality; and\n       (2) expresses its deepest condolences to his family, \n     friends, and supporters on his death.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4429-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 127--CONGRATULATING CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THEIR \n   STUDENTS, PARENTS, TEACHERS, AND ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS THE UNITED \n  STATES FOR THEIR ONGOING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EDUCATION, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Frist, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nSununu, Mr. Alexander, Mr. DeMint, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Burr, and \nMr. Allard) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 127\n\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality education and \n     challenge our students to reach their potential;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public entity that are responding to the needs of \n     our communities, families, and students and promoting the \n     principles of quality, choice, and innovation;\n       Whereas in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, they are held accountable by their \n     sponsors for improving student achievement and for their \n     financial and other operations;\n       Whereas 41 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have passed laws authorizing \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas nearly 3,300 charter schools are now operating in \n     40 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico and serving approximately 900,000 students;\n       Whereas over the last 10 years, Congress has provided more \n     than $1,500,000,000 in support to the charter school movement \n     through facilities financing assistance and grants for \n     planning, startup, implementation, and dissemination;\n       Whereas charter schools improve their students' achievement \n     and stimulate improvement in traditional public schools;\n       Whereas charter schools must meet the student achievement \n     accountability requirements under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 in the same manner as \n     traditional public schools, and often set higher and \n     additional individual goals to ensure that they are of high \n     quality and truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents new freedom to choose \n     their public school, routinely measure parental satisfaction \n     levels, and must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and their communities;\n       Whereas nearly 40 percent of charter schools report having \n     a waiting list, and the total number of students on all such \n     waiting lists is enough to fill over 1,000 average-sized \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas charter schools nationwide serve a higher \n     percentage of low-income and minority students than the \n     traditional public system;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the Administration, Congress, State Governors \n     and legislatures, educators, and parents across the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas the sixth annual National Charter Schools Week, to \n     be held May 1 through 7, 2005, is an event sponsored by \n     charter schools and grassroots charter school organizations \n     across the United States to recognize the significant \n     impacts, achievements, and innovations of charter schools: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate acknowledges and commends charter schools \n     and their students, parents, teachers, and administrators \n     across the United States for their ongoing contributions to \n     education and improving and strengthening our public school \n     system;\n       (2) the Senate supports the sixth annual National Charter \n     Schools Week; and\n       (3) it is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United \n     States to conduct appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities to demonstrate support for charter schools during \n     this weeklong celebration in communities throughout the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4429-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4429-S4430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 582.

Korematsu for \n     his loyalty and patriotism to the United States and \n     expressing condolences to his family, friends, and supporters \n     on his death.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, with no intervening action, and that any \nstatements relating to this resolution be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I would like to say a brief word or two about this \nresolution honoring the life of a great American who passed away \nrecently. I am proud to be joined by Senators Inouye and Stevens on \nthis resolution.\n\n  Three weeks ago, when I heard that Fred Korematsu died at the age of \n86, I came to the Senate floor and paid my tribute. But because his \nplace in our Nation's history is so important, I have come to the floor \nagain to ask the entire Senate to recognize this man with this \nresolution.\n  In recent months, I have had several occasions to mention Fred \nKorematsu's name in committee and floor proceedings, because the story \nabout the injustices he and thousands of others faced as a Japanese \nAmerican during from World War II is one that we should never forget.\n  Today, as our Nation is engaged in a global war on terrorism and when \nwe are confronting the issues of the balance between civil liberties \nand security, Fred Korematsu's name is a reminder that we need to learn \nfrom our history, as difficult and shameful as it may be.\n  In November 2003, Fred Korematsu filed a brief before the Supreme \nCourt in a case involving the detentions at Guantanamo Bay. His brief \ncontained a simple plea to the government: ``to avoid repeating the \nmistakes of the past, this court should make clear that the United \nStates respects constitutional and human rights, even in times of \nwar.''\n  As leaders in Washington, we are responsible for a wide range of \nlegislative and policy decisions that will have impact on millions of \nlives of our fellow Americans. As we deliberate and debate these \nissues, I hope all my colleagues will continue to heed the wise words \nof this humble man.\n  Fred Korematsu died on March 30 at his daughter's home in Larkspur, \nCA, after a long illness. He leaves behind his wife, Kathryn, and their \nson and daughter. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their family and \nfriends, and we honor his memory today with this resolution.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution honoring a true \nAmerican hero.\n  Fred Korematsu is a family name known to every student who has ever \ngone through law school. It was Mr. Korematsu who filed the law case \nprotesting the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. \nHis family, like so many others, was discriminated against simply \nbecause of their heritage. We now realize it was a serious mistake and \na great disservice to many loyal and patriotic Japanese Americans.\n  His recent passing was a reminder of this man's courage throughout \nhis life, and I hope that this resolution, when it is sent to his \nfamily, will be a fitting tribute from the Senate for all the \ncontributions they and his family have made to America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Senate \nresolution honoring Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu for his loyalty and \npatriotism to the United States and expressing condolences to Fred's \nfamily, friends and supporters on his passing.\n  On March 30, 2005, our Nation lost a deeply compassionate man and a \ngreat American patriot. Fred profoundly influenced the course of \nAmerican history and legal jurisprudence when he led a courageous legal \nchallenge against the internment of Japanese Americans by the United \nStates Government. Fred was born in Oakland, CA, in 1919. His parents \nwere Japanese immigrants who ran a flower nursery while Fred attended \nCastlemont High School and later the Master School of Welding. Fred \nworked on the Oakland docks as a steel welder and was quickly promoted \nto a foreman position.\n  The war in Europe, however, changed his life. America began providing \nsupplies to Great Britain in its war against Germany and Germany's \nallies, including the country of Japan. At home in California, when \nFred entered restaurants, waiters refused to serve him because of his \nancestry. Fred's union terminated his membership, and Fred lost his \njob. American by birth, Fred wished to prove his patriotism by joining \nthe United States Coast Guard, but the recruiting officer refused his \napplication. Fred eventually found work with a mobile trailer company, \nbut after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, his employer \nfired him.\n  Fred was 22 years old when President Roosevelt issued Executive Order \n9066, authorizing military commanders on the West Coast to issue \nwhatever orders necessary for national security. Curfews, exclusionary \norders, and the internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans soon followed, \nand the Korematsu family was taken to the Tanforan racetrack in San \nMateo. Fred, however, held a deep conviction that the constitutional \nrights of Japanese Americans were being violated by the internment \norder issued without any real evidence of disloyalty, without specific \ncharges, and without trial, and so Fred chose to defy the order.\n\n  Fred assumed a non-Japanese identity and even had plastic surgery in \nan attempt to change his appearance. Nevertheless, the police stopped \nhim in San Leandro and Fred was charged with violating the military's \nexclusion order. Fred was sent to Federal prison and later to live with \nhis family in a\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nhorse stall at the Tanforan racetrack. The Korematsus performed hard \nlabor behind barbed wire and under the watch of armed guards. Other \nJapanese Americans in the internment camp avoided him, fearing for the \nsafety of their own families. The Federal district court found Fred \nguilty of violating military exclusion orders, and sentenced him to 5 \nyears of probation under military authority. Fred appealed that \ndecision. Meanwhile, after a year and a half of laboring in the \ninterment camp, Fred's skill as a welder enabled him to leave the camp, \non the condition that he not return to California. He got a job as a \nwelder in an iron works company in Salt Lake City, and eventually, made \nhis way to Detroit.\n  Fred's appeal reached the Supreme Court in 1944. The Court upheld the \nlower court's ruling in a 6-3 vote, citing the simple reason that the \ninternment of American citizens of Japanese ancestry was a military \nnecessity in light of the war with Japan. Fred petitioned for a \nrehearing, but it was denied in February 1945.\n  Fred eventually met and married Kathryn and raised a family. Like \nmany Japanese Americans, Fred tried to put his internment experiences \nbehind him, but he was unable to pursue many job opportunities because \nhis violation of the exclusion order left him with a criminal record. \nHe once worked on an application to become a real estate broker, but \nwhen he came across the question that asked whether he had prior \ncriminal convictions, he threw the application away. Although Fred \nworked as a draftsman, he did not apply to work at larger companies or \ngovernment agencies, as they would not hire someone who had a prior \nconviction on record. Without a pension, Fred worked part time to make \nends meet, even while in his eighties.\n  In the early 1980s, a volunteer legal team began to accumulate \nevidence that government officials had possessed significant \ninformation that Japanese Americans had not posed an actual threat to \nnational security at the time of the interment, and the team approached \nFred to file a coram nobis petition to review events that occurred 40 \nyears earlier that denied Fred a fair hearing.\n  In late 1983, a Federal court in San Francisco overturned Fred's \nguilty conviction, stating that the Government's case at the time had \nbeen based on false and biased information.\n  The court's decision was a landmark and a critical turning point in \nhistory. The volunteer legal team that gravitated to Fred was driven by \nhis courage, his unshakable sense of right and wrong, and his faith in \nthe American Constitution. The court's 1983 holding in Korematsu v. \nU.S., coram nobis, set in motion a chain of important events. Shortly \nfollowing the success of that case, Congress ordered a commission \nreport on the internment of Japanese Americans. Upon the commission's \nfinding that internment orders were issued without proper basis, \nCongress in 1988 passed legislation for a Presidential apology and \nreparations to Japanese American internees.\n  Ten years later, in 1998, President Bill Clinton awarded Fred with \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the \nUnited States. During that ceremony, the President stated, ``In the \nlong history of our country's constant search for justice, some names \nof ordinary citizens stand for millions of souls--Plessy, Brown, Parks. \nTo that distinguished list today we add the name of Fred Korematsu.''\n  To many, Fred was more than just a distinguished name. Fred shared \nhis riveting and protracted story about justice with thousands of young \nAmericans, and he has deeply touched and inspired a new generation of \ncivil rights attorneys. Fred's zest for life, courage, patriotism, \ncompassion, gentle humor, strong will, and delight in teaching others \nhas endeared him to many. He graced our midst, and by example, \nencouraged all of us to never abandon our Nation's cherished \nconstitutional principles and values.\n  Fred Korematsu was a devoted husband and father, a teacher, a \ntrailblazer, a hero, and a great American.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 126) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 126\n\n       Whereas on January 30, 1919, Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu was \n     born in Oakland, California, to Japanese immigrants;\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu graduated from Oakland High School \n     and tried on 2 occasions to enlist in the United States Army \n     but was not accepted due to a physical disability;\n       Whereas on December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the United \n     States military base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, forcing the \n     United States to enter World War II against Japan, Germany, \n     and Italy;\n       Whereas on February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt signed Executive Order number 9066 (42 Fed. Reg. \n     1563) as ``protection against espionage and against sabotage \n     to national defense'', which authorized the designation of \n     ``military areas . . . from which any or all persons may be \n     excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person \n     to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever \n     restriction the . . . Military Commander may impose in his \n     discretion'';\n       Whereas the United States Army issued Civilian Exclusion \n     Order Number 34, directing that after May 9, 1942, all \n     persons of Japanese ancestry were to be removed from \n     designated areas of the West Coast because they were \n     considered to be a security threat;\n       Whereas in response to that Civilian Exclusion Order, Fred \n     Korematsu's family reported to Tanforan, a former racetrack \n     in the San Francisco area that was used as 1 of 15 temporary \n     detention centers, before being sent to an internment camp in \n     Topaz, Utah;\n       Whereas more than 120,000 Japanese Americans were similarly \n     detained in 10 permanent War Relocation Authority camps \n     located in isolated desert areas of the States of Arizona, \n     Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming, \n     without any charges brought or due process accorded;\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu, then 22 years old and working as a \n     shipyard welder in Oakland, California, refused to join his \n     family in reporting to Tanforan, based on his belief that he \n     was a loyal American and not a security threat;\n       Whereas on May 30, 1942, Fred Korematsu was arrested and \n     jailed for remaining in a military area, tried in United \n     States district court, found guilty of violating Civilian \n     Exclusion Order Number 34, and sentenced to 5 years of \n     probation;\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu unsuccessfully challenged that \n     Civilian Exclusion Order as it applied to him, and appealed \n     the decision of the district court to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, where his conviction was \n     sustained;\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu was subsequently confined with his \n     family in the internment camp in Topaz for 2 years, and \n     during that time, he appealed his conviction to the United \n     States Supreme Court;\n       Whereas on December 18, 1944, the Supreme Court issued its \n     decision in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, which \n     upheld Fred Korematsu's conviction by a vote of 6-to-3, based \n     on the finding of the Supreme Court that Fred Korematsu was \n     not removed from his home ``because of hostility to him or \n     his race'' but because the United States was at war with \n     Japan and the United States military ``feared an invasion of \n     our West Coast'';\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu continued to maintain his innocence \n     for decades following World War II;\n       Whereas, under section 552 of title 5, United States Code \n     (commonly known as the ``Freedom of Information Act''), an \n     historian discovered numerous government documents indicating \n     that, at the time Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, \n     was decided, the Federal Government suppressed findings that \n     Japanese Americans on the West Coast were not security \n     threats;\n       Whereas in light of this newly discovered information, Fred \n     Korematsu filed a writ of error coram nobis with the United \n     States District Court for the Northern District of \n     California;\n       Whereas on November 10, 1983, United States District Judge \n     Marilyn Hall Patel overturned Fred Korematsu's conviction, \n     concluding that senior government officials knew there was no \n     factual basis for the claim of ``military necessity'' when \n     they presented their case before the Supreme Court in 1944;\n       Whereas in that decision, Judge Patel stated that, while \n     Korematsu v. United States ``remains on the pages of our \n     legal and political history...[as] historical precedent it \n     stands as a constant caution that in times of war or declared \n     military necessity our institutions must be vigilant in \n     protecting constitutional guarantees'';\n       Whereas the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment \n     of Civilians, authorized by Congress in 1980 to review the \n     facts and circumstances surrounding the relocation and \n     internment of Japanese Americans under Executive Order Number \n     9066 (42 Fed. Reg. 1563), concluded that ``today the decision \n     in Korematsu lies overruled in the court of history'';\n       Whereas the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment \n     of Civilians concluded that a ``grave personal injustice was \n     done to the American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese \n     ancestry who, without individual review or any probative \n     evidence against them were excluded, removed and detained by \n     the United States during World War II'', and that those acts \n     were ``motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime \n     hysteria, and a failure of political leadership'';\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\n       Whereas the overturning of Fred Korematsu's conviction and \n     the findings of Commission on Wartime Relocation and \n     Internment of Civilians influenced the decision by Congress \n     to pass the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 U.S.C. App. 1989b \n     et seq.) to request a Presidential apology and symbolic \n     payment of compensation to persons of Japanese ancestry who \n     lost liberty or property because of discriminatory action by \n     the Federal Government;\n       Whereas on August 10, 1988, President Reagan signed that \n     Act into law, stating, ``[H]ere we admit a wrong; here we \n     reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under \n     the law'';\n       Whereas on January 15, 1998, President Clinton awarded the \n     Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United \n     States, to Fred Korematsu, stating, ``In the long history of \n     our country's constant search for justice, some names of \n     ordinary citizens stand for millions of souls: Plessy, Brown, \n     Parks. To that distinguished list, today we add the name of \n     Fred Korematsu.'';\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu remained a tireless advocate for \n     civil liberties and justice throughout his life, particularly \n     speaking out against racial discrimination and violence \n     targeting Arab, Muslim, South Asian, and Sikh Americans in \n     the wake of the September 11, 2001, tragedy, and cautioning \n     the Federal Government against repeating mistakes of the past \n     by singling out individuals for heightened scrutiny on the \n     basis of race, ethnicity, or religion;\n       Whereas on March 30, 2005, Fred Korematsu died at the age \n     of 86 in Larkspur, California; and\n       Whereas Fred Korematsu was a role model for all Americans \n     who love the United States and the promises contained in the \n     Constitution, and his strength and perseverance serve as an \n     inspiration for all people striving for equality and justice: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors Fred T. Korematsu for his loyalty and patriotism \n     to the United States, his work to advocate for the civil \n     rights and civil liberties of all Americans, and his \n     dedication to justice and equality; and\n       (2) expresses its deepest condolences to his family, \n     friends, and supporters on his death.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4434-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4434-S4435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING CHARTER SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 127, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 127) congratulating charter schools \n     and their students, parents, teachers, and administrators \n     across the United States for their ongoing contributions to \n     education, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleagues Senators \nLieberman, Frist, Landrieu, Sununu, Alexander, DeMint, Dole, Vitter, \nBurr, in support of this resolution to designate the week of May 1 \nthrough May 7, 2005 as National Charter Schools Week. This year marks \nthe 13th anniversary of the opening of the nation's first charter \nschool in Minnesota. Since that time, charter schools have experienced \ntremendous growth as more and more parents discover for themselves why \nsurveys show such high levels of parental satisfaction with charter \nschools. Today, there are almost 3,300 charter schools serving nearly \n900,000 students in 40 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto \nRico, up from 3,000 schools serving 750,000 students just 1 year ago. \nNearly 40 percent of these schools report having waiting lists, and \nthere are enough students on these waiting lists to fill another 1,000 \naverage-sized charter schools.\n  Charter schools serve a unique role in public education. They are \ndesigned to be free from many of the burdensome regulations and \npolicies that govern traditional public schools. They are founded and \nrun by principals, teachers and parents who share a common vision of \neducation, a vision which guides each and every decision made at the \nschools, from hiring personnel to selecting curricula. Furthermore, \ncharter schools are held strictly accountable for student performance--\nif they fail to educate their students well and meet the goals of their \ncharters, they are closed. Most importantly, charter schools are \nraising student achievement. Research has shown that charter school \nstudents are more likely to be proficient in reading and math than \nstudents in neighboring traditional schools, and that the greatest \nachievement gains can be seen among African American, Hispanic, and \nlow-income students. Research also shows that the longer charter \nschools have been in operation, the more they outdistance traditional \nscores in student performance.\n  Since each charter school represents the unique vision of its \nfounders, these schools vary greatly, but all strive for excellence. \nThere are countless examples of charter schools that are having an \nenormous impact on their students both academically and personally, and \non the surrounding community.\n  For example, the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center in San Fernando, \nCA, serves students in grades K-12, 97 percent of whom qualify for free \nlunch, and 87 percent of whom speak limited English. Fifteen years ago, \nthe Vaughn Street School was a haven for drug deals and violence, and \nstudents' test scores were the lowest in the San Fernando Valley. Since \nit converted to a charter school in 1993, Vaughn rose from the ninth \npercentile in language arts and the eleventh percentile in math to \nbecome a National Blue Ribbon School. Test scores have gone up 330 \npercent in the past 5 years alone. As a result of the autonomy granted \nby converting to charter status, Vaughn has been able to redirect \nconsiderable resources to programmatic efforts, including an extended \nschool year and comprehensive afterschool program. The school has also \nexpanded its offerings to the greater community, including a school-\nbased clinic, family center, business co-op, and library.\n  Cincinnati's W.E.B. DuBois Academy, serving children in grades 1 \nthrough 8, recently became the only elementary school in the city and \none of only 102 schools in Ohio to be recognized as a ``School of \nPromise.'' The recognition follows a period of remarkable improvement \nfor the low-income school, which now boasts that 100 percent of its \nstudents passed State tests in six areas. The school has met the \nState's requirements for Adequate Yearly Progress, and is closing the \nachievement gap--and has generated a lengthy waiting list along the \nway. The W.E.B. DuBois Academy attributes its success to extended \nresearch-based instructional time, performance-based pay for teachers, \nstrict discipline, and a rewards system that reinforces outstanding \nacademic performance. Says founder Wilson H. Willard III, ``We've \nimplemented a research-based system that addresses the constraints that \ncompromise traditional education. In doing so, we've generated \nsuccessful academic results for hundreds of our students. . . . defying \nconvention has built success for the school, and most importantly, each \nstudent in it. In the end, that's what really matters.''\n  These are but a few of the promising schools in the charter movement, \nwhich includes a wide range of schools serving a variety of different \nlearning needs and styles, often at a lower cost than traditional \npublic schools. I am pleased that four such schools have launched in \nNew Hampshire this year, ranging from the State's first school for deaf \nand hard of hearing students to academies focused on the arts, \ntechnology, and business. Several more schools will soon open their \ndoors in the Granite State, offering additional options for parents and \nstudents, including those most at risk.\n  I expect that we will see charter schools continue to expand both in \nNew Hampshire and nationally. Three years ago, the President signed \ninto law the No Child Left Behind Act, which gives parents in low-\nperforming schools the option to transfer their children to another \npublic school. No Child Left Behind also provides school districts with \nthe option of converting low-performing schools into charter schools. I \nbelieve these provisions will strengthen the charter school movement by \ncreating more opportunities for charter school development. And, as \nparents exercise their right to school choice and ``vote with their \nfeet'', the demand for charters schools will increase.\n  I commend the ever-growing number of people involved in the charter \nschool movement, from parents and teachers to community leaders and \nmembers of the business community. Together, they have led the charge \nin education reform and are helping transform our system of public \neducation. Districts with a large number of charter schools have \nreported that they are becoming more customer service-oriented, \nincreasing interaction with parents, and creating new education \nprograms, many of which are similar to those offered by charter \nschools. These improvements benefit all our students,\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\nnot just those who choose charter schools.\n  I encourage my colleagues to visit a charter school during National \nCharter Schools Week to witness firsthand the ways in which these \ninnovative schools are making a difference, both in the lives of the \nstudents they serve as well as in the communities in which they reside.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 127) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 127\n\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality education and \n     challenge our students to reach their potential;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public entity that are responding to the needs of \n     our communities, families, and students and promoting the \n     principles of quality, choice, and innovation;\n       Whereas in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, they are held accountable by their \n     sponsors for improving student achievement and for their \n     financial and other operations;\n       Whereas 41 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have passed laws authorizing \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas nearly 3,300 charter schools are now operating in \n     40 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico and serving approximately 900,000 students;\n       Whereas over the last 10 years, Congress has provided more \n     than $1,500,000,000 in support to the charter school movement \n     through facilities financing assistance and grants for \n     planning, startup, implementation, and dissemination;\n       Whereas charter schools improve their students' achievement \n     and stimulate improvement in traditional public schools;\n       Whereas charter schools must meet the student achievement \n     accountability requirements under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 in the same manner as \n     traditional public schools, and often set higher and \n     additional individual goals to ensure that they are of high \n     quality and truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents new freedom to choose \n     their public school, routinely measure parental satisfaction \n     levels, and must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and their communities;\n       Whereas nearly 40 percent of charter schools report having \n     a waiting list, and the total number of students on all such \n     waiting lists is enough to fill over 1,000 average-sized \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas charter schools nationwide serve a higher \n     percentage of low-income and minority students than the \n     traditional public system;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the Administration, Congress, State Governors \n     and legislatures, educators, and parents across the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas the sixth annual National Charter Schools Week, to \n     be held May 1 through 7, 2005, is an event sponsored by \n     charter schools and grassroots charter school organizations \n     across the United States to recognize the significant \n     impacts, achievements, and innovations of charter schools: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate acknowledges and commends charter schools \n     and their students, parents, teachers, and administrators \n     across the United States for their ongoing contributions to \n     education and improving and strengthening our public school \n     system;\n       (2) the Senate supports the sixth annual National Charter \n     Schools Week; and\n       (3) it is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United \n     States to conduct appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities to demonstrate support for charter schools during \n     this weeklong celebration in communities throughout the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4435-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, today the American people have spoken, and \nthey have spoken very firmly. It should be a day of celebration in the \nUnited States Capitol. A few hours ago, we saw responsible Republican \nleaders in the House of Representatives come together to do the right \nthing by abandoning the attempt to change the ethics rules. We will \nawait the final outcome but I am told it has all been done, that they \nwill have to go to the House floor and approve changing the rules back \nfrom where they are now to where they need to be--that is, the way they \nused to be. The American people are very perceptive. They can tell when \nsomething is going on that simply is not fair. What we had in the House \nof Representatives is one of the leaders, with the abuse of power that \ntakes place so often around here, took himself out of the criticism \nthat he was receiving from the Ethics Committee. He was reprimanded on \nthree separate occasions within 1 year but he did not have to worry \nabout any more censures or reprimands because they simply changed the \nrules.\n  That is where the American people came in. They know that the rules \ncannot be changed in the middle of the game. Today, the Republicans in \nthe House heard that message.\n  As this Chamber wrestles with its own possible rule change in the \nnext few weeks, I urge my Republican colleagues to pay attention to how \nthe American people feel about what is being attempted. It does not \nmatter how many times one comes to the Senate floor and says there has \nnot been a filibuster on a judge ever before, it is simply not true, \nunderlined and underscored.\n  I note the tone has been different, and I am happy about that. My \ndistinguished friend, the Senator from Utah, came to the floor today \nand said there has not been a filibuster of a judge that has come to \nthe floor. Well, that still is not true but it is better than what he \nsaid before. What he was saying, in the language we understand in \nCongress, is the Republicans in the Judiciary Committee turned down 69 \njudges that President Clinton wanted. They did not come to the floor. \nThey did not come to the committee. Senator Hatch is right, they \ncertainly did not get a floor vote.\n  Also, we keep hearing we have to have up-or-down votes on judicial \nnominations. I was somewhat amazed yesterday by what people from the \nother side of the aisle said, that we are going to allow filibusters on \nother nominations that come from the President. Now, let us see what \nlogic there is here. On a lifetime appointment, that is a judge who \nbecomes a district court judge or a circuit court judge, they can be \nappointed at age 35 and serve for the next 40 years, and we cannot use \nour advise and consent that we have as Senators? But if someone is \ngoing to serve for a few months or a few years, as other nominations, \nthen we can talk as long as we want, our ability to speak is not taken \naway there?\n  If we look at this, there might be something more there than meets \nthe eye. The American people are not interested in seeing us fight \nabout the rules or pursuing partisan goals. That is why this body has \nto come together and worked out this issue. We need to take on issues \nthe American people wrestle with every day. Whether it is in Chicago; \nOklahoma City; Reno; Pittsburgh; Dover, DE, wherever it is, the people \nin those communities are interested in health care--as a subset, \nprescription drugs--and they certainly are interested in gas prices. As \nI have said on the floor the last few days, Nevada is paying $2.65 a \ngallon. If you have a small car it is $30.\n\n  Veterans--we need to take care of veterans, better than what I see in \nthis budget. The American people want us to talk about this.\n  They want us to talk about education.\n  They also want us to see that the checks and balances created by our \nFounding Fathers are not trampled on, this provision of the \nConstitution. I hope we are not heading down that road with the nuclear \noption, which turns the Senate into a rubber stamp, which destroys the \nchecks and balances. As I said in the past, I will do everything within \nmy power to avoid that option and today gives me hope we can avoid \nthat.\n  The American people did not like what they saw with the abuse of \npower in the House of Representatives. What did they do? They spoke out \nloudly. As a result, the Speaker and others in the House of \nRepresentatives said we are no longer going to protect one of our own, \nbecause it is an abuse of power, and we are going to go back to the \nrules the way they used to be. That is a victory for the American \npeople. I hope we can accomplish the same here today.\n  As I said yesterday, it would be a great visual if Senator Frist and \nI could walk down this aisle--he stands here, I stand here--and say we \nhave got a deal for the American people.\n  There is so much work to do, we should not be fighting over these \nrules. If the Republicans insist on putting politics ahead of the \nAmerican people, we are going to make sure the Senate works for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say I followed his remarks closely. If I \nunderstand what has just happened in the House of Representatives, or \nis about to happen, it is that they decided the changes in the ethics \nrules which were promulgated to protect perhaps one Member or two \nMembers from close scrutiny, in terms of their conduct, are now going \nto be changed. I think, if I am not mistaken, this will be the second \ntime in the last few months--in recent times, that the Republican \nleadership in the House of Representatives has changed the ethics rules \nand then, after public response, came back and restored the ethics \nrules.\n  Is this not similar to a situation we are facing on the Senate side, \nwhere there are at least some who are talking about the nuclear option, \na term that Senator Lott came up with, that would change the rules of \nthe Senate in the middle of our session, rules that have been in place \nfor almost 200 years?\n  Mr. REID. I would answer to my friend, not only is there a suggestion \nabout changing the rules, but they are going to do it by breaking the \nrules. To change a rule here in the Senate takes a simple majority. But \nif somebody wants to speak in an extensive manner relating to that rule \nchange, you have to break a filibuster. They are not willing to do \nthat. They are going to use brute force and break the rules to change \nthe rules. That is what they are talking about.\n  So even though what went on in the House of Representatives is bad, \nwhat is contemplated here is even worse than that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada if he will yield for an \nadditional question through the Chair. I would like to ask the Senator, \nis it not true that the Democrats, in the minority in the House of \nRepresentatives, stood together and argued that the integrity of the \nHouse of Representatives was at stake because of these changes in \nethics rules to favor one Republican leader, or perhaps two, and that \nby standing together and appealing to the Nation, that they were \nsuccessful, and now the Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives has announced they are going to restore the original \nethics rules?\n  Mr. REID. I say in answer to my friend, I applaud, I commend the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives from the State of Illinois for \nrealizing that what had gone on was wrong, and it is being changed as \nwe speak. So the Speaker got the message loudly and clearly from the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would also ask the Senator from Nevada through the \nChair, is it not also true that as we have started talking to the \nAmerican people about the so-called nuclear option, the term that \nSenator Trent Lott came up with, as we have talked to the people about \nthe nuclear option across the country, is it not true there has been an \nincredible reaction? I would say to the Senator from Nevada, many of us \nbelieved this was an arcane debate that most people wouldn't follow. \nBut we are finding that overwhelmingly the people across America share \nthe view of the Democrats on\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nthis issue, that we should not change the rules in the middle of the \ngame and eliminate the filibuster on judicial nominees, that we should \nnot assault the basic principle of checks and balances also under the \nConstitution, and, finally, we should stand our ground to make sure \nthat, on a bipartisan basis, we pick judges for lifetime appointments, \njudges who are in touch with the values and needs of simple Americans \nand their families?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the answer is yes. Yesterday, I got a \ncopy of an editorial from a newspaper in Nevada, a newspaper out of \nFallon, NV. In 1998, I got 21 percent of the vote in that county. I \nhave said before, a homeless person could have gotten that many votes \nin Churchill County, but that is how many votes I got. So I got the \neditorial and it said, ``Stop Mr. Smith.''\n  As we know, there are some ads running that show the great movie with \nJimmy Stewart as Mr. Smith coming to Washington to give a long speech \nas a Senator.\n  I said: I will read it. I read that editorial. It was so magnificent. \nI ask unanimous consent I be allowed to have that printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Shut up, Mr. Smith\n\n                            (By Glen McAdoo)\n\n       Nevada, April 25.--Remember when you were a kid and there \n     was always at least one whiner on the block who had to win at \n     all costs? If you were playing baseball and the whiners got \n     three strikes they wanted to change the rules in the middle \n     of the game so they could have at least four strikes. \n     Furthermore they wanted to call the balls and strikes \n     themselves. If, by miracle, they finally did strike out, \n     becoming the third out, they wanted to change the rules so \n     that their team got four outs. Remember those whiners? They \n     would pout and cry or jump up and down and scream bloody \n     murder until they got their way. Remember them?\n       Well, they are still around. They comprise the majority of \n     the House and Senate leadership in Washington, D.C. They're \n     not called whiners anymore, today we call them Republicans.\n       Remember the movie, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' \n     starring James Stewart? Well, you won't find a Mr. Smith \n     among these modern day whiners. And if they have their way, \n     Mr. Smith will never again grace the hallowed halls in our \n     Nation's Capitol. The Republicans want to do away with one of \n     the great traditions in our Government--the filibuster. In an \n     attempt to prevent the Democrats from stopping the \n     appointment of Judges who echo the shallow thoughts of the \n     most extreme far right, the Republicans are up to no good--\n     again.\n       ``Stay home Mr. Smith, there is no place for big mouths \n     like you in the Capitol. Save your breath. Go home to the \n     folks who sent you here. We are in charge now and we would \n     rather you keep your big mouth shut. So what if you are \n     right. Shut your lip. We know what is best for everyone and \n     we don't need a do-gooder like you gumming up the works. \n     What's that you say Mr. Smith? You say we are even angry with \n     the Federal Judges we appointed. That's about half of them. \n     Judges should decide cases based on the law and not public \n     opinion, you say? Darn you, a little truth could spoil \n     everything. See, that's why we want you to shut up and go \n     home,'' so would say the Republicans to Mr. Smith.\n       Last week, Senator Harry Reid brought forth a million names \n     of people who don't want the rules changed. These people \n     believe the filibuster should stay as part of a time honored \n     practice.\n       The filibuster may be the only way to stop overzealous \n     lawmakers who insist on approving the worst of President \n     Bush's misguided nominees to the Federal Bench. We must keep \n     the filibuster, and use it when necessary, and if the \n     petulant pouting pompous Republicans in the Senate don't like \n     it they can take their ball and go home. So there!\n       How quickly they forget. The Republicans have used the \n     filibuster many times. Have they forgotten Abe Fortas in 1968 \n     or Clinton's nominee to the ninth circuit Richard Paez in \n     2000. All told the Republicans used the filibuster six times \n     in attempts to block Clinton's Judicial nominees. What \n     hypocrites.\n       In the House of Representatives things are just as bad. \n     Republicans have now changed the rules to make it nearly \n     impossible to have a public inquiry and possibly oust Tom \n     DeLay (R-Texas) on ethics charges. According to Congressman \n     Barney Frank, the Republican leadership has now removed from \n     the ethics committee any Republican with the slightest bit of \n     independence and replaced them with people who will acquiesce \n     to the leadership's wishes. In the past, if the committee \n     were deadlocked five to five a public investigation would go \n     forward. With the rules change it is dead in the water, \n     unless one of these mighty midgets of morality says yea and \n     makes it six to five. These foul balls want four strikes and \n     four outs.\n       The self proclaimed model for the moral right, Mr. DeLay, \n     could turn out to be one of the slimiest characters we have \n     ever seen in such a high office. We will probably never know \n     for sure unless one of the spineless Republicans on the \n     ethics panel gets some backbone and makes their private \n     probe, public. That may happen, they are under a lot of \n     pressure, but I wouldn't bet on it.\n       We don't need a bunch of rule changes in the House and \n     Senate. What we need to do is replace a bunch of Republicans \n     with Democrats.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the first paragraph--and I am paraphrasing \nbut not by very much--starts out by saying: You remember when you were \ngrowing up and you had this kid who was never happy? You couldn't win a \ngame because he kept changing the rules in the middle of the game, and \nif you didn't allow the change, all he did was whine about it?\n  They went on for long, maybe six or seven paragraphs, saying: What is \ngoing on in Washington? Trying to change the rules in the middle of the \ngame is un-American.\n  This is from Fallon, NV.\n  So the answer is yes, the American people are speaking. If you can \nget a newspaper in Fallon, NV, to write a harsh criticism of the \nRepublican leadership we have in the Senate, they should listen \nbecause, believe me, I got 21 percent of the vote in that county.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield for a question through \nthe Chair, is it not true that the filibuster, because it requires 60 \nvotes to overcome, really requires the Senate to work to compromise, to \nfind bipartisan solutions to their differences, and brings us together \nin a bipartisan fashion? Is this not the same thing that the Democratic \nleader just alluded to, that we should use that same bipartisan \napproach not only when it comes to lifetime appointments for judges and \ncontroversial issues but to find constructive solutions to issues such \nas the challenge of health care, the cost of health insurance, the need \nto help families pay for college education--all of the things we should \nput on our agenda but, sadly, have not been part of the discussion in \nthis Republican majority Senate so far this year?\n  Mr. REID. Let me say to my friend, a perfect example of that is what \nis going on on the floor as we speak. One of our colleagues, the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, has an issue. He \noffered an amendment to this bill.\n  The reason he offered it to this bill is he wanted to make a \nstatement about something that is going on in China. He believes trade \npolicies there are unfair and unbalanced. He offered an amendment on \nthis bill.\n  You can debate whether it should be on this bill, but it is on this \nbill. He offered an amendment. We have a right to do that. He, as a \nresult of what he has done, held up the nomination of Rob Portman, \nCongressman Portman to be Trade Representative. I like Congressman \nPortman, a good man. I think he will do a good job as our Trade \nRepresentative.\n  As we speak, because of this filibuster that he, in effect, is \nconducting--not necessarily on this bill, but he is not going to let \nPortman go forward, so we will have to vote 2 days from now--the \nparties have come together. They are talking. I am confident we will \nwork that out and Portman will be approved tomorrow.\n  The answer is yes. One of the good things about this institution we \nhave found in the 214 years it has been in existence is that the \nfilibuster, which has been in existence since the beginning, from the \ndays of George Washington--we have changed the rules as relates to it a \nlittle bit but never by breaking the rules.\n  I say to my distinguished friend, the senior Senator from Illinois, \nin all the political writings about filibuster, that is one of the \nthings they talk about as a positive. It forces people to get together \nbecause sometimes in this body you become very fixed. You think you are \nthe only person who knows what is going on and you need to examine \nyourself. The other person has an issue. The Senator from Illinois is \nabsolutely right. It brings people together.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask one final question of the Senator from \nNevada through the Chair? I know what the Senator said about his \ncommitment to the traditions of the Senate, to the constitutional \nprinciples that guide the Senate, such as the protection of the \nminority so there will never be another tyranny of the majority; that \nyou will\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nhave this filibuster that gives the minority, always, a voice in the \ndealings of the Senate.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada--and I share his belief--is committed \nto this constitutional principle that goes back to our Founding \nFathers. But I want to ask the Senator from Nevada in closing: Is it \nnot true, as you announced yesterday, that despite this commitment to \nthis core principle that you have reached out to the other side, to the \nRepublican leadership, in an effort to try to find some common ground \nto work through our difficulties and differences over several different \njudges; that you have spoken directly to Senator Frist and many \nRepublican Senators in an effort to try to resolve this, and that, \nsadly, Senator Frist came to the floor yesterday and announced he \nwouldn't be party to any negotiations to try to work this out?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, first of all, in defense of Senator \nFrist, the statement he gave was before we had our meeting. I have \nconfidence Senator Frist is weighing the offer I gave him.\n  Let me say this to all my friends, including the distinguished junior \nSenator from Pennsylvania: I am not going to dwell on what took place \nduring the Clinton administration. Most people would acknowledge it was \nnot right. I am not going to dwell on what took place these last 4 \nyears of the Bush administration because I am sure people can make a \ncase, as advocates can, that maybe we did not do the right thing in \nthose years.\n  I am asking my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle to \ngive us a chance. Let's work our way through this. We are not out \nplotting to take the next Supreme Court nominee who comes before the \nSenate, waiting in the wings to knock him or her out. We are not \nwaiting to knock out circuit judges or district court judges.\n  Test us. We have proven so far this year that we are willing to work \nwith the majority. We have done some pretty good stuff in spite of a \nnumber of things we could have held up for a long time. As I said \nyesterday, we could have held up class action for a long time. Just to \ngo to conference takes three separate cloture votes. Bankruptcy could \nhave taken a lot of time.\n  We legislated the way the Senate used to legislate. We had a bill \ncome to the Senate. A person offered an amendment. He spoke in favor of \nit. People came and joined in that. People spoke against it. And we did \nthings the old-fashioned way--we voted on them and then sent the bill \nto the House. That is the way we did it.\n  We have to develop faith in what we are trying to do. I am saying to \neveryone, trust us. Yes, I have spoken to Republican Senators. I have \nspoken to every one of the Democrat Senators. I have spoken to quite a \nfew Republican Senators. I hope they give us the benefit of the doubt.\n  We are not working from a position of weakness. The American people \nwant us to do this. They want us to join together, to pass legislation. \nThey do not want anyone breaking the rules to change the rules.\n  This is so important for our country. We need to come together to \nwork out our differences. It is not only important to this institution, \nit is important to our country.\n  I thank very much my friend from Illinois for his questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent I be able to speak for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no problem with my friend speaking. \nMy friend has to catch a train, and he has had unanimous consent to \nspeak here for a long period of time. I think he should be able to go \nfirst. I object. I want my friend from Delaware to go first.\n  Mr. CARPER. I appreciate that. I will miss my train, but go ahead. I \nyield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator is going to miss his train because of my \n7 minutes, not because of his own speech, I will withhold. But if he is \ngoing to miss the train because of his speech--\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection has been heard.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I promise to \nbe very brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been here 4 years. I have never \nplaced a hold, as I recall, on any nomination for anyone to serve in \nthis administration.\n  When Christie Whitman was nominated to head up EPA, I said: \nCongratulations. What can I do to help get you confirmed and to confirm \nthe members of the team you want to surround yourself with? And I went \nto work on it.\n  When Mike Levitt was nominated to succeed her, I called Mike Levitt--\nboth him and Governor Whitman, with whom I served--I called Mike Levitt \nand I said: Congratulations. What can I do to help get you confirmed \nand the team you want to surround yourself with? And I went to work on \nit.\n\n  When Tommy Thompson was nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, I called to congratulate him and said: What can I do to help \nget you confirmed and confirm the team you want to surround you? And I \nwent to work on it.\n  When Tom Ridge was nominated to be Secretary of Homeland Security, I \ncalled him and I said: Congratulations. What can I do to help get you \nconfirmed and to confirm the team you want around you?\n  For me to stand here today in an effort to stop, at least for a short \nwhile, the nomination of Stephen Johnson to be Administrator of EPA is \nout of character for me. That is not the way I do business. I hope my \ncolleagues realize that after 4 years I am a guy who likes to work \nacross the aisle, and whether the issues are some of the issues Senator \nReid just mentioned--class action reform, bankruptcy reform \nlegislation, now asbestos, overhauling the postal system, comprehensive \nenergy bill--I am one on the Democrat side who looks forward to working \nnot only with my colleagues but with our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  We have problems in our country, challenges we face on all fronts. \nAmong those challenges we face is what to do to improve the quality of \nour air and how we can do that in a way that does not cost consumers an \narm and a leg. What can we do to improve the quality of our air that \ndoes not encourage the shifting of utility plants from coal, which we \nhave in abundance, to natural gas, which we don't.\n  We have had sort of a Hobson's choice in the last couple of years--\nthe administration's clear skies proposals, multipollutant bill dealing \nwith reducing sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury from utility \nplants, compared to the proposal of our colleague from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, and others, who would propose to go further, a lot further, a \nlot faster than the administration on those three pollutants, and add a \nfourth, carbon dioxide.\n  The Presiding Officer, as well as my friend from Pennsylvania--we \nhave all served in the House together. I don't know about them, but \nwhen I served in the House, I never liked it when I was dealt a \nHobson's choice--a position over here and another position over here. I \nnever liked it.\n  One of the great things about the Senate is we can craft something in \nthe middle. What I sought to do in working with people such as Senator \nLamar Alexander from Tennessee, Lincoln Chafee from Rhode Island, and \nJudd Gregg from New Hampshire, was to come up with something in the \nmiddle, a centrist approach that we believe reduces the emission of \nsulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury from utility plants, gets a \nstart in slowing down the growth of emissions from CO2, and \ndoes so in a way that does not cost consumers an arm and a leg and, \nfrankly, does not lead to a lot of shifting off of coal and onto \nnatural gas.\n  We introduced legislation the first time in 2002. That was the year I \nfirst asked EPA for comparative analysis, comparing the \nadministration's clear skies proposal with our bipartisan bill with the \nJeffords bill. In 2003 we got a lot of raw data and not much analysis \nfrom EPA. Along with the raw data and the limited analysis they sent \nus, they said some of the assumptions on which this analysis was \nconducted are, frankly, out of date and that the information we have \nshared with you is maybe not as valid as it otherwise would be.\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\n  We renewed the request and asked for the comparative analysis of the \nPresident's proposal of the clear skies with the Jeffords proposal and \nour proposal in the middle. We found out in 2004--we heard the \ninformation could not be provided because it looked as if Congress, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, was not going to move to \ncleaner legislation in 2004, so they did not want the EPA to do the \nanalysis.\n  We renewed our request in 2005 for the comparative analysis, and we \nwere told that no, the EPA does not have time because we are moving so \nquickly toward enactment of clean air legislation.\n  We are now in a situation where the President's proposal was not \napproved by committee, and we are not moving anything. The only thing \nthat is moving right now is lawyers--to file lawsuits on behalf of \nenvironmental groups or on behalf of utilities. It is not a good \nsituation.\n  I came here to legislate. I didn't come here to litigate. I came here \nto get things done.\n  We have about 50,000 people in my State who suffer from asthma, and \nabout 20,000 of them are kids. We have too much smog in my State--the \nozone problem and too much smog--especially in the summertime, more \nthan we do in other parts of the country. We have in my State too much \nmercury that has been ingested by fish, and pregnant women in Delaware \nand other places around the country eat those fish. There are high \nlevels of mercury in those fish. We know what it does to the brains of \nthe unborn those pregnant women carry.\n  Not everybody believes carbon dioxide leads to global warming and \nthat we are actually seeing a temperature rising on this planet of \nours. I will tell you NASA says this year will be the warmest year on \nrecord since we have been keeping records, and we have been keeping \nrecords for 150 years. We are told that 9 out of the last 10 years have \nbeen the warmest years since we have been keeping temperature records \nin this country.\n  The glaciers--I have seen some of them, and maybe others here have, \ntoo--are disappearing way up North and way down South. The snowcaps on \nsome of the tallest mountains in the world are disappearing, too. We \nare actually seeing temperatures rise. We are seeing sea levels rise.\n  I am not going to get into an argument today about whether there is a \nreal problem. I believe there is. I respect the views of others who \ndisagree, but I think the preponderance of scientific evidence says we \nneed to get started on this issue.\n  How does that lead us to the nomination of Stephen Johnson? I have \nbeen asking for 3 years, from the EPA, for scientific analysis that \nwill enable our committee and, frankly, the Senate to decide what kind \nof clean air legislation, multipollutant legislation, to move out of \ncommittee to bring to the Senate floor. Frankly, we have not gotten an \naltogether satisfactory response.\n  The responses are getting a little better, but we are not quite where \nI think we need to be. Stephen Johnson is a good man. He will be a good \nadministrator if this administration will let him do his job. If we do \nnot have the scientific analysis we need to be able to use good science \nto decide how far, how fast to go in reducing the emissions of these \nfour pollutants, we are not going to get a clean air bill. It is just \nthat simple.\n  Someday, we will have a Democratic President. It could be in a couple \nyears. It could be longer than that. Someday, we will have a Democratic \nmajority in the Senate, maybe even in the House. I do not think it \nshould matter who is in the White House or who is in the majority here \nin the Senate. We need to work across the aisle on issues such as this. \nIf you look at the history of this body: clean air, bipartisan \nlegislation; clean water, bipartisan legislation; brownfields, \nbipartisan legislation.\n  If we are going to find agreement, common ground on multipollutant \nlegislation, it is going to be because we work together, not because \nEPA was compelled to withhold data or information from one side or the \nother, but because they shared that information, and we used that \ninformation and good science to go forward.\n  Let me close with this. There is going to be a vote on cloture--it \ncould be tomorrow; it could be Friday--on Stephen Johnson. As much as I \nam convinced he is a good man and would be a good administrator of EPA, \nI am even more convinced we need not just a good person to head up EPA, \nbut we need strong, balanced multipollutant legislation in this \ncountry. The only way I believe that legislation is going to move \nthrough our committee and through this Senate is if we have good, \ncomparable analysis, good comprehensive analysis. It is not hard to \nget.\n  I spoke with Mr. Johnson twice today. He was good enough to respond \nto me in writing to my requests. We met and talked a number of times. \nHe has suggested to me what he thinks might be a compromise on the \namount of information they would be willing to share. I responded, in \nturn, with a counterproposal. In my judgment, it is eminently \nreasonable.\n  I would hope somebody on the other side--our Republican friends \neither here or down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue--would see that maybe \nthe better part of valor and a way to get to a win-win situation is to \nsimply say: We will provide the information that has been requested. We \nwill stop squabbling about it and just provide it.\n  If they do that, we can negotiate in earnest this spring on a \nmultipollutant bill; and we can pass, this year, that legislation. I \nwould call that a win-win situation--a win-win because Stephen Johnson \nwould be allowed, literally, to be confirmed this week to head up EPA; \nand our country would be on the road to having air that is cleaner to \nbreathe and less polluted with sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and \nmercury; and we would have a world where the threat of global warming \nhas been reduced a little bit as well. Those are two good outcomes.\n  My hope is, before we push this ball any further down the court, we \ncan come to agreement and get those two things done.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time and thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his accommodation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had the opportunity to listen to the \nDemocratic leader for a few moments talking about the House of \nRepresentatives and the compromise the House of Representatives just \nachieved on their ethics consideration.\n  Three comments about that compromise: No. 1, it is interesting that \n``compromise'' means the Republicans do what the Democrats insisted \nupon them doing. That is a compromise, No. 1.\n  No. 2, that compromise meant the House went back to the way the House \nhas always done things when it came to ethics. The compromise was to go \nback to the precedent and rules of the House they have always used.\n  Third, that compromise means--and the Senator from Oklahoma has had \nexperience over in the House, as have I--the rules of the House will \ncontinue to be that if a Member has an ethics claim filed against them \nby someone--and the Ethics Committee is equally divided--particularly, \nif it is a Member where there happens to be political value in having \nan ethics claim filed against them, if the other side decides, \npolitically, they are simply not going to hear the case, it stays on \nthe docket forever, for as long as the session lasts, with no need to \ndispose or rule on that. So the ethics charge hangs out there without a \ndecision. It automatically goes forward, in other words, unless there \nis a decision on the part of a bipartisan majority to end the \ndiscussion.\n  I think what we have seen in the past--and I know Members of the \nHouse are concerned about this--is\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nthat there has been an abuse, a politicization of the ethics process. \nWe all know how damaging it is because the only thing we have in this \nbody and before our constituents is our word and our reputation. They \nare intangible things that are easily affected and certainly are \naffected when ethics charges are filed. That does not mean ethics \nviolations have been found but simply that ethics charges have been \nfiled.\n  The mere fact a charge has been filed is a very damaging thing to the \nreputation of a Member. To have that out there, without any need for \ndisposition, I think is very dangerous and has proven to be--and I \nthink will continue to be--a bad precedent.\n  But that is compromise. I make the argument that capitulation is not \ncompromise. But I will agree on the second point I made, that going \nback to the way we have done things in the past is usually a pretty \ngood idea when you really aren't sure how to deal with things. So I too \nsay I am glad that the speaker, the leader, and others in the House \nhave broken this logjam, and they have done so in a way they can at \nleast move the process forward in the House. I too commend the \nRepublican leadership for trying to move it forward.\n  I will say the same thing could be done here in the Senate. If we \nhave a sincere disagreement as to how we should proceed with respect to \njudicial nominations, we could look to the example of the House of \nRepresentatives and go back to the way we did things for years and \nyears and years. The way we have done things for years and years and \nyears, 214 years prior to the last session of Congress, was that \nnominations that came to the floor of the Senate received an up-or-down \nvote.\n  It was very interesting. The Senator from Nevada criticized one of \nour Republican Members who suggested that we would be willing to \ncompromise by not including all executive nominations, just including \ncertain executive nominations. When that was proffered, the Senator \nfrom Nevada criticized this compromise and said: It is disingenuous \nbecause it is not intellectually consistent. Lots of compromises \naren't. But that was for the sake of compromise, to say that we \nbelieve--and 214 years of history have shown, and the tradition and the \nprecedent of the Senate is--when executive nominations arrive on the \nfloor of the Senate, they receive an up-or-down vote. That is the \nprecedent. There is not one instance in which someone who had majority \nsupport here on the floor of the Senate for a judicial nomination did \nnot receive an up-or-down vote and get confirmed, not one precedent \nuntil 2 years ago. Then things changed.\n  So we have suggested we would like to go back to that 214-year \nprecedent that served this country very well. We didn't have the \nacrimony we see here today. The Senator from Nevada repeatedly talked \nabout how the public wants us to get things done. Then don't change the \nrules of the game and then complain the public is angry with the fact \nthat we are not getting things done. Look at the cause of the \ncontroversy.\n  The cause of the controversy lies with the previous leader of the \nDemocrats, who put forward a strategy, a plan, a scheme to \nfundamentally shift the power away from the President to 41 Members of \nthe Senate to determine what nominees will be confirmed in the Senate. \nThat could have been done. I would agree with the Senator from Nevada \nand everybody else here. It could have been done 200 years ago. It \ncould have been done 100 years ago. It could have been done 10 years \nago. But it never was done. We showed restraint. I showed restraint.\n  The Senator from Nevada talked about how I could look back at the \nClinton administration and see how President Clinton's nominees were \ndisadvantaged. Let's look back to the Clinton administration. I can \nthink of two people I recall very clearly to whom I was adamantly \nopposed. They had records as judges that were deplorable in my mind. \nThey didn't follow the law. They were activists on the court. They put \ntheir interpretation and their views ahead of the law repeatedly. \nRichard Paez and Marsha Berzon were their names. They were nominated \nfor the circuit court.\n  I adamantly opposed them. They were bad judges and, in my opinion, \nthis country would be in worse shape by having them on the circuit \ncourt. I wanted them defeated. They were against a lot of what I \nstrongly believed was bad for this country. That is what they were for, \nthings which I strongly believed were bad for the country.\n  There were a lot of groups outside, a lot of conservative groups, \njust as they are hearing from a lot of liberal groups, who said: Do it, \nblock their nomination. Yes, they have majority support, but block \ntheir nomination because they will do so much damage. They are bad. \nThat is what these outside groups were saying: These folks will \nundermine the judiciary.\n  There is always a temptation to let the current fury cloud your \njudgment and to think about the immediate political posture or the next \nelection or the folks who brought you here and do what they ask you to \ndo.\n  We had a leader, at that time, in Trent Lott, and we had a chairman, \nin Orrin Hatch, who said: I understand how you feel. I oppose these \njudges too. But there is something more here in the Senate than the \npassions of the day. There is something more than the groups who may \nsupport your campaigns today. When we do things that change the \nprecedent of the Senate, it ripples, maybe forever, and can \nfundamentally change the balance of power, the way the judiciary \nfunctions, the way the executive functions and, as you have seen in the \nlast 2 years, the way this body functions or ``misfunctions'' as a \nresult.\n  So for that moment in which I really wanted to block their \nnominations, when Trent Lott and Orrin Hatch filed cloture on those two \nnominees to move the vote forward, not to block their nomination, but \nto move their vote forward, I voted along with 85 of my colleagues. A \nvast majority of Republicans and all the Democrats voted to allow their \nvote to come. Richard Paez did not get 60 votes when his confirmation \ncame up. In other words, had we wanted to filibuster Richard Paez, we \nwould have been successful. He would not have gotten 60 votes. He would \nnot be a judge on the circuit today had we wanted to block his \nnomination.\n  But my belief is--and the vast majority of Republicans' belief was at \nthat time--as much as we opposed the nomination, we supported the \ntradition and the precedent of the Senate because we are but stewards \nof this place. We don't own this institution. Yes, we say we run this \ninstitution. We don't run this institution. We are simply stewards. We \nare passersby. When we crack the foundation of the way things have been \ndone and worked for this country for 200-plus years, we leave behind a \nfoundation that may not sustain us as a people.\n  To stand before the Senate, as my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have done repeatedly over the last few weeks, and talk about how \nthey are being aggrieved by what the Senate Republicans are trying to \ndo and calling this the nuclear option repeatedly, and suggesting \nsomehow or another this is destroying the filibuster, when it was never \nused--underscore that, never used--to block a judge on the floor of the \nSenate prior to the last session of Congress, when the Democratic \nminority decided they could not resist, they had to put politics over \nprocess. They had to put partisanship over the stability of this \ninstitution for the long term.\n  I suspect there are a lot of folks on the other side of the aisle who \nregret that happening, and they probably regret it today. Where are the \nstatesmen? Where are the folks who quietly whisper to one another that \nthis was wrong? Where are they to stand up and set it straight?\n  I desperately hope we do not have to cast this vote on the floor of \nthe Senate to return the precedent of the Senate to the way it has been \nfor 214 years because it would show what two sides were able to do for \n214 years. I say to the Presiding Officer from Oklahoma, think about \nall of the conflicts and passions that have occurred through all of the \ngreat debates in the Senate. People were shot in the Senate, and there \nwere fisticuffs and beatings. The passions must have been incredible at \ncertain times. But we always were able to understand that there were \nsome things bigger than the passion of the moment. This institution is \none of\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nthem. The way this institution functioned to balance powers was one of \nthem. What the other side of the aisle is doing, I say to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, is fracturing the foundation of this institution.\n  So I hope we don't have a vote. I hope we don't have a vote. I hope \nthere will be some on both sides of the aisle who would look to the \n214-year precedent when, in spite of strong disagreements, the Senate \nwas able to find comity to get things done.\n  We need to get things done. I know the Democratic leader has \nthreatened to shut down the Senate--his words, not mine, ``shut down \nthe Senate''--if they don't get their compromise. What is their \ncompromise? They want to continue to do what they did in the last \nsession of the Congress. That is their compromise. I find it somewhat \nremarkable that the Senator from Illinois praised the Senator from \nNevada for his ``compromise.'' His compromise says if the ten judges \nthey were blocking from the last session--they have successfully \nblocked three because they have been withdrawn, and now they are \nsuggesting they want to block at least three more. They don't care \nwhich ones they are. I know this was all driven by pure concern about \neach and every one of these, but for some reason they can pick which \nthree. Some might suggest this is less about the individual and more \nabout politics, but now we are sort of in this compromise and, fine, \nlet's compromise. Fine. We will take ten, we get to kill six, and you \nget to pick the four we move forward with. That is compromise. Oh, and \nby the way, we reserve the right to continue to do this in the future. \nThis is the great Henry Clay type of statement that we see before the \nSenate: Of the ten that we have blocked--against every precedent of the \nSenate--we will take six, and these fine individuals, all well \nqualified by the ABA--the ``gold standard,'' in Senator Leahy's words, \nnot mine--we will take these fine upstanding people in the community \nand tarnish their reputations for the rest of their lives.\n  By the way, you pick the three we are going to tarnish, and we will \nlet you have four nominees. By the way, you can go ahead and expect \nthat we will block others in the future.\n  That is their compromise. That is the great olive branch: We will \ncontinue to abuse 214 years of history.\n  I ask anyone if you can point out one nominee for the court on the \nfloor of the Senate who had majority support who was blocked by \nfilibuster. Name one who had majority support. It never happened. So \nwhat is the compromise? The compromise is that six judges who had \nmajority support on the floor of the Senate will be denied \nconfirmation, and we will do so to others in the future if we so \ndesire. That is the compromise. I don't think most people objectively \nlooking at that would see that as much of a compromise.\n  The Senator from Illinois said another remarkable thing. I will go \nback and check the record. I find it hard to believe. He said Senator \nFrist came to the floor yesterday and said he would not be a party to \nany negotiation on this issue. That is what the Senator from Illinois \nsaid.\n  Let me review the record. Senator Frist, in the last session of \nCongress, offered a compromise with Zell Miller called the Frist-Miller \napproach. It was a compromise. It is still a compromise that is out \nthere. I know for a fact--and I suspect others on the other side of the \naisle do, too--that Senator Frist has repeatedly offered compromises to \nthe Democratic leader.\n  I know also for a fact that the Senate majority leader, Senator \nFrist, is very much open to negotiation and compromise, to return the \nprecedent of the Senate and find a way in which we get back to what was \njust lauded by the other side of the aisle--returning, as the House \njust did, to the way they have always done things. So, too, would we \nlike to do that--return to the way we have always done things. But that \nis too much of a reach, I suspect, for some because we have partisan \nagendas. We have, even more so, I suggest, not just partisan agendas \nbecause I think in part it is driven by partisanship, but I think it is \nmostly driven by ideology.\n\n  What I think is sadly true is that the agenda of the other side of \nthe aisle--which we have not seen a whole lot of as far as solutions; \nwe have seen a lot of obstruction, not a whole lot of ideas but a lot \nof obstruction--is not accomplished in democratic forums anymore. It is \naccomplished through the courts. So I think what we are seeing is a \ngasp of saying that we can no longer win elections on our agenda. We \ncan no longer win votes on the floor of the Senate with our agenda--the \nmost radical elements of our agenda, anyway--so we must hold on to the \ncourts. We must hold on and make sure those individuals who are willing \nto be activists on the court and overturn the will of the Congress, \ncreate new rights in the Constitution, bypass the democratic process, \namend the Constitution through court edict, as opposed to the \ntraditional way laid out by our Founders, we want to make sure that we \nstill have the ability to enact our agenda on the courts.\n  Another point I will make is that I am very much for the filibuster. \nI believe the filibuster is exactly what our Founders intended when it \ncomes to legislation--absolutely what they intended, that the Senate \nwould be a place where the hot tea would be poured into the saucer and \ncooled. I support it and, in fact, I voted to support it because when I \nwas first elected to the Senate, some Democratic Members offered a \nchange to the rules that would have eliminated the filibuster and gone \nto a simple majority on all legislative matters.\n  This was interesting because at the time, as I said, the Republicans \nwere in the majority, and yet Democrats were offering this rather \nsavory morsel out there for those of us who recently came to the Senate \nand wanted to get a lot of things done and understood how difficult it \nwould be. We had a Contract With America, we may recall--the House was \nmoving forward and wanting to pass a lot of bills. We had a lot of \nmomentum over here. There was a part of me that said: That would be \ngreat, we could get rid of this. I said: No, the Founders had it right, \nthe traditions of the Senate are right. We do not need to change this \ninstitution because of the whims of the moment, because of the passions \nof the day, because of the interest groups off Capitol Hill that would \nwant us to do so.\n  No, we have a higher duty. We have a higher duty. That duty is to \nthis institution because this institution is the bulwark of this \ndemocracy that protects us from doing rash and sometimes irrational \nthings in which at times the public gets swept up. No, that is what \nthis institution is for when it comes to legislative passions.\n  By the way, there were 19 people, 19 Democrats who voted to end the \nlegislative filibuster, but not one Republican. Not one. So the \nlegislative filibuster is important, and it will remain in place as a \nresult of anything we do over the next few weeks with respect to \njudicial nominations.\n  I close by saying I am hopeful we can find a compromise, but what I \nkeep hearing from the other side is this incredible spinning that \nsomehow or other what has gone on here in the last 2 years was part of \nthe normal course, and the fact that this was done in previous \nCongresses, as the Senator from Nevada mentioned, in committee, in \ncommittee these nominations were killed.\n  Were these nominations killed? Some nominations were held and \ndefeated in committee, that is right. By whom? By the majority--by the \nmajority. The majority on the floor of the Senate has defeated \nnominations. The majority in committee has defeated nominations. But \nnever before has the minority in committee defeated a nomination. Never \nbefore has the minority on the floor defeated a nomination. Never \nbefore has the minority been able to dictate to a President who they \nwill nominate either for their Cabinet or for some of the most \nimportant positions in the judiciary. Never before until now.\n  This is taking power away from a popularly elected President who, \nunder the Constitution, has the right to nominate people. President \nClinton, I believe, had over 350 judges confirmed. I think I voted \nagainst maybe 5, 6, something like that; less than 10, I know that. I \ndid not agree ideologically with probably more than 10, but as I went \nhome and had to face some of my constituents who were upset with me for \nvoting for one judge or another because they did not like their \npolitics, I said: You will have to take it up with the American people \nbecause President\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\nClinton won the election, and he has a right to nominate who he wants \nas long as they are within the mainstream. That does not mean they are \ngoing to agree with me philosophically. There are a lot of people in \nthe mainstream who are center and left of center who have a right to \nserve, as people who are right of center have a right to serve, and I \nam not going to impose my ideology on somebody else's nominees.\n  That is what is going on today. It is an ideological litmus test, and \nit is now infecting this body to the detriment of the Senate.\n  I hope cooler heads will prevail, and that those of us who showed \nrestraint and did not vote for filibusters, voted for cloture on \nnominees we did not like--that there will be those who will stand up \nand do the same on the other side of the aisle in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4442-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4442-S4443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FILIBUSTER HISTORY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know it is late, and I will be very \nbrief. I want to make a quick response to my colleague and friend from \nPennsylvania, Senator Santorum. I am sorry I had to leave the floor \nwhile he was speaking.\n  What I am about to say I would be happy to say with Senator Santorum \nin the Chamber and would be happy to respond to tomorrow. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania made the point that he thinks the golden rule here \nis, the principle here is that every judicial nominee is entitled to a \nmajority vote up or down.\n  That is an interesting idea, and it might be appealing to some people \nif they do not know the rules of the Senate. For 214 years, we have \nsaid if you bring an amendment, a bill, or a nomination to the floor of \nthe Senate, it is subject to Senate rules. And Senate rules are very \nclear. Any Senator can take the floor and begin a debate and hold the \nfloor as long as that Senator physically can, unless 60--now 60 members \nof the Senate--vote otherwise. So you need an extraordinary majority--\n60 Senators--to stop a filibuster. That is the way it has always been.\n  In the beginning it was different. Senators could not stop a \nfilibuster until 1919. In 1919 it took 67 votes; a few years back we \nchanged that to 60 votes. But it has always taken more than a majority \nto stop a filibuster.\n  In ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' Jimmy Stewart is on the floor, \nholding the floor as long as he did. That is the Senate. That is the \ntradition of the Senate.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says it has always been a majority \nvote. Sadly, he is mistaken. There has always been the opportunity for \nfilibuster on a nomination.\n  So he was mistaken in that assertion.\n  The second thing the Senator from Pennsylvania was mistaken about was \nhis oft-repeated comments that never, ever, not once in the history of \nthe Senate--we hear it from the Senator from Pennsylvania and others \nhas a filibuster been used on a judicial nomination. It has never been \ndone until the Democrats recently did it to a number of President \nBush's nominees.\n  Unfortunately, again, history is not on the side of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. On 12 different occasions, beginning in 1881, filibusters \nhave been used to stop judicial nominations. In 1881, it was Stanley \nMatthews to be a Supreme Court Justice; 1968, Abe Fortas to be Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court was subjected to a filibuster; right on \ndown through the Clinton administration, when, in fact, on two \ndifferent occasions--maybe more, as I look at this list--there were \nfilibusters applied to Clinton nominees. So for the Republican side of \nthe aisle to consistently state what history tells us is not true is \nunfortunate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this history of \nfilibusters and judges so anyone who follows congressional proceedings \ncan read the names and circumstances for each and every judge who has \nbeen subjected to a filibuster in the history of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   History of Filibusters and Judges\n\n       Prior to the start of the George W. Bush administration in \n     2001, the following 11 judicial nominations needed 60 (or \n     more) votes--cloture--in order to end a filibuster:\n       1881: Stanley Matthews to be a Supreme Court Justice.\n       1968: Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \n     (cloture required \\2/3\\ of those voting).\n       1971: William Rehnquist to be a Supreme Court Justice \n     (cloture required \\2/3\\ of those voting).\n       1980: Stephen Breyer to be a Judge on the First Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       1984: J. Harvie Wilkinson to be a Judge on the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       1986: Sidney Fitzwater to be a Judge for the Northern \n     District of Texas.\n       1986: William Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the Supreme \n     Court.\n       1992: Edward Earl Carnes, Jr. to be a Judge on the Eleventh \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       1994: H. Lee Sarokin to be a Judge on the Third Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       1999: Brian Theadore Stewart to be a Judge for the District \n     of Utah.\n       2000: Richard Paez to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals.\n       2000: Marsha Berzon to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       Because of a filibuster, cloture was filed on the following \n     two judicial nominations, but was later withdrawn:\n       1986: Daniel Manion to be a Judge on the Seventh Circuit \n     Court of Appeals Senator Biden told then Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole that ``he was ready to call off an expected filibuster \n     and vote immediately on Manion's nomination.''--Congressional \n     Quarterly Almanac, 1986.\n       1994: Rosemary Barkett to be a Judge on the Eleventh \n     Circuit Court of Appeals ``. . . lacking the votes to sustain \n     a filibuster, Republicans agreed to proceed to a confirmation \n     vote after Democrats agreed to a daylong debate on the \n     nomination.''--Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1994.\n       Following are comments by Republicans during the filibuster \n     on the Paez and Berzon nominations in 2000, confirming that \n     there was, in fact, a filibuster:\n       ``. . . it is no secret that I have been the person who has \n     filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge \n     Paez.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 9, 2000.\n       ``So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that \n     we don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of \n     the Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional \n     role.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 7, 2000.\n       ``Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, \n     after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could \n     still delay a final vote on the nomination.''--Senator Orrin \n     Hatch, March 9, 2000, when a Senator offered a motion to \n     indefinitely postpone the Paez nomination after cloture had \n     been invoked.\n       In 2000, during consideration of the Paez nomination, the \n     following Senator was among those who voted to continue the \n     filibuster: Senator Bill Frist--Vote #37, 106th Congress, \n     Second Session, March 8, 2000.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is very \ndiscreet in how he explains his view of dealing with judges, that every \njudge should be allowed a majority up-or-down vote. That is not a bad \nconcept if that really was what the Senator from Pennsylvania could \npoint to in his own record. Under President Clinton's administration, \nnine of the President's judicial nominees to the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania were confirmed by the Senate, while eight were never even \ngiven hearings before the Judiciary Committee. So the Senators who are \nnow begging for majority votes and majority rules thought nothing of \ncloseting and burying these judicial nominees under the Clinton \nadministration, to the point where they had no possibility of being \nconfirmed.\n  Let me be specific. John Bingler was nominated by President Clinton. \nSenator Santorum exercised his discretion over nominations in his State \nand held up this nomination for 2 years, until Mr. Bingler withdrew.\n  Robert Freedberg, another nominee by President Clinton. Senator \nSantorum delayed the entire slate of judicial candidates, saying the \nPresident didn't honor an earlier agreement to nominate a particular \nPittsburgh attorney whom he, Senator Santorum, wanted.\n  Lynette Norton. As was reported by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette on \nJuly 22, 2000:\n\n       Sen. Rick Santorum insisted yesterday the Senate will not \n     act on any nomination for the U.S. District Court here until \n     next presidential administration . . .\n\n  He was very clear on what his agenda was: it was to hold up \nnominations that were going to be filled by President Clinton until, \nhopefully, in his\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\neyes, a Republican President was elected.\n  Repeatedly, Senator Santorum used his own form of a filibuster to \ndeny even a hearing or a vote in the Senate to these judicial nominees. \nNow he stands aghast, appalled, incredulous, that anyone would oppose a \njudicial nominee of President Bush.\n  We should stand by the traditions of the Senate. Let's not change the \nrules in the middle of the game. Let's not violate the time-honored \nprinciple of checks and balances which says the Senate as an \ninstitution will have the last word on lifetime appointments to the \nFederal bench.\n  Even though President Bush has been successful with over 95 percent \nof his nominees being approved by the Senate, mark my words, a few of \nthem should not have been approved for lifetime appointments. Our view \non our side of the aisle, both liberal and conservative, a handful went \ntoo far. Their positions on the role of Government in protecting our \nhealth and safety, the role of Government in protecting our \nenvironment, the rights of women, privacy under our Constitution, their \nviews were so extreme and so radical they were not deserving, at least \nto the mind of many of my colleagues, to have a lifetime appointment to \nthe Federal bench.\n  It is best when in doubt to stick with the Constitution. It is best \nwhen in doubt to stick with the traditions of the Senate. It is best \nwhen in doubt to stick with the filibuster, which requires compromise, \nrequires bipartisanship, and moves us to a point where we can and must \nwork together to achieve goals of this Nation and to serve the people \nwho were kind enough to give us this great opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/27/senate-section/article/S4443-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
