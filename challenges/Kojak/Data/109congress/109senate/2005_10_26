Mr. President, this morning we have set aside the first 30 \nminutes for a period of morning business. We will then proceed to \nconsideration of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. Senator Specter has \ncommitments from several Senators this morning to come offer their \namendments. In addition to those to be offered, we already have several \npending from yesterday. We will be calling rollcall votes throughout \nthe course of today to dispose of these amendments, and we will \nannounce when Senators can expect those votes.\n  I remind my colleagues that a cloture motion was filed last night on \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations bill. That cloture vote will occur on \nThursday morning. Under rule XXII, Senators have until 1 o'clock today \nto file their first-degree amendments at the desk. We will finish this \nbill this week. It is up to the Senate to decide if we are going to be \nhere late Thursday or Friday, but we will finish the bill. If Senators \nare reasonable in their requests for amendments and debate times, we \nmay well be able to finish tomorrow; if not, we will continue on Friday \nto finish this final appropriations bill. Again, I congratulate all of \nour colleagues for sticking together and systematically going through \neach of the appropriations bills over the last several weeks.\n  Mr. REID. If I could direct a question to the distinguished majority \nleader, it is my understanding we are not going to recess at 1:45 for \nNegroponte. People can go or not, and we will still continue Senate \nbusiness.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. We will continue working today. Again, I \nwant to restate the conversation that the distinguished Democratic \nleader and I had yesterday regarding these votes over the course of the \nday. We want people to come over on time so we can proceed in a \ndisciplined, orderly way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am here this morning to talk about a \ndangerous flaw in the Medicare prescription drug program that is about \nto take effect. This flaw is a ticking time bomb for more than 6 \nmillion Americans, for our communities and our health care providers. \nThat fuse is going to detonate on January 1.\n  We cannot allow low-income seniors and the disabled to lose their \ndirect coverage. We cannot leave our doctors and hospitals and nursing \nhomes unprepared for the biggest change in decades. And we should not \nbe pushing hundreds of thousands of people who need care onto our local \ncommunities. We can't wait. We have to fix this problem today. That is \nwhy I will be offering an amendment later this morning.\n  I have been working with Senators Rockefeller and Bingaman to address \nthe immediate crisis. I thank them for their leadership. I have also \nintroduced my own bill to protect our most vulnerable. It is the \nMedicare HEALS Act, S. 1822.\n\n[[Page S11854]]\n\n  I have been traveling around my State. I have been meeting with \npeople in Seattle, Lakewood, Yakima, Aberdeen, and Olympia. I want my \ncolleagues to know, everywhere I go, people are angry and confused. And \nthey are very worried, with good reason.\n  One senior told me:\n\n       Everyone I have talked to is totally confused--my doctor, \n     my pharmacist, even the Medicare number you are supposed to \n     call.\n\n  Another one said:\n\n       If we can't understand this, this whole [Medicare] plan is \n     going to fail.\n\n  Everywhere I went, people were confused. There were questions that I \ncouldn't answer. When I turned to the doctors sitting next to me, they \ndidn't know the answer. And neither did the pharmacists or the patient \nadvocates. If Senators and doctors and experts do not understand this, \nhow can we expect an 80-year-old person with serious medical problems \nto understand this complicated new program? We can't. So we need more \ntime and more resources to make this prescription drug plan work.\n  One person I met with said:\n\n       Please give us more time. Give us the chance to understand \n     this so we don't make a mistake when we sign up.\n\n  One panelist told me:\n\n       Taking away something from those that need it the most . . \n     . is not the American way.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. That is why I am here this morning to talk \nabout this, and that is why I will be offering an amendment shortly \nafter we go to the bill.\n  I have many concerns with the Medicare prescription drug law. I voted \nagainst it in 2003 because I believed that seniors deserve better and \nthat America can do better than that. I am concerned about the \ncomplexity, the coverage gap, whether needed drugs will be covered. I \nam concerned about retirees losing the good coverage they have today. \nAnd I am concerned about the late enrollment penalty that is going to \npunish seniors who need more time to pick the right plan. I am working \nwith many other Senators to address all of those concerns. But today \nthe most urgent problem is the way the new law treats our most \nvulnerable people, people with low incomes, the disabled, and those \nfacing serious medical challenges like AIDS.\n  This law takes away the critical drug coverage these people have \ntoday and puts them into a new program that could charge them more \nmoney in exchange for less drug coverage. If they don't sign up for a \nplan, they are randomly assigned one. Either way, the prescriptions \nthey need may not be covered. Because these Americans are living on the \nfinancial brink, an interruption of their drug coverage or a new \ncopayment could keep them from getting the drugs they need to live on. \nThe people who are being affected don't know what is going to happen. \nThe doctors and pharmacists, they don't understand it either. This \nentire mess is going to burst into the open on January 1. We need to \ntake action to prevent this catastrophe now because it is only a few \nmonths away.\n  To understand this problem, let's look at how our most vulnerable get \ntheir prescription drugs today and how that is about to change. Today, \nabout 6.4 million Americans with low incomes get help from two \nprograms: Medicare at the Federal level and Medicaid at the State \nlevel. These individuals are sometimes what we call dual eligibles \nbecause they are eligible for assistance from both Medicare and \nMedicaid. What Medicare does not cover, the States usually cover. For \nexample, the Federal program did not cover prescription drugs. The \nState programs filled in that gap. The State coverage is often called \nwraparound coverage, and it is critical for our most vulnerable \nfamilies. As a result, these individuals get the drugs they need, often \nwithout copayments or deductibles.\n  But there is a big problem coming January 1. The new drug program \nprohibits States from providing the extra help they do provide today. \nInstead, what it does is move these people into the Medicare program \nalone, which will require higher out-of-pocket payments and which will \nmost likely cover fewer drugs. To me, it doesn't make sense to take \naway the good coverage that vulnerable families have today, force them \ninto a program that might not meet their needs, charge them more money \nin the process, and then prohibit our States from helping out these \nmost vulnerable people. It doesn't make sense, but that is exactly what \nthis new drug program will do unless we fix it before January 1.\n\n  In fact, the new Medicare prescription drug program changes the \ncoverage of our most vulnerable in five ways: It imposes higher costs--\nthose are premiums, copays and deductibles; it covers fewer drugs; it \nblocks States from providing extra help as they do today; it provides \nno transition period to ensure that these low-income residents don't \nface these gaps in coverage; and it penalizes people who need more time \nto pick the right plan for them.\n  These are real people we are talking about. I want to introduce two \nof them. Earlier this month in Seattle, I met a woman named Kathryn \nCole. She is 36 years old. She is disabled, and she is living on Social \nSecurity disability. She fills about 15 prescriptions each month, and \nher monthly income is $757. She told me:\n\n       Even if the copay were only $5, that adds up to $75 a \n     month. I don't have the kind of extra money to squeeze out of \n     my budget.\n\n  Kathryn asked me:\n\n       Which week am I supposed to not eat?\n\n  People like Kathryn are living on the financial edge. They cannot \nafford to pay more for their medication. They need our help. In \nOlympia, WA, I met a man named William Havens. He is 50 years old, \nliving with HIV/AIDS. He takes 43 pills a day. William told me:\n\n       For the first time [in my life], I realize I'm going to \n     have to make a choice between pills and food.\n\n  It is outrageous that this new law is going to make life so much \nharder for people like Kathryn and William. In addition to hurting \npeople, the new drug program is going to hurt our health care system. \nIt is going to have a costly impact on nursing homes, doctors, \npharmacists, and hospitals. Many of these dual-eligible individuals \nlive in nursing homes. Now nursing homes are going to have to navigate \nall these new plans out there.\n  In my State of Washington, there are at least 14 of these new plans. \nSome States have as many as 40 or more, all with different costs and \ndifferent formularies. Nursing home managers are going to have to see \nwhich plan each resident has been assigned to and if their needed drugs \nare covered.\n  In Olympia, I met with a Dr. David Fairbrook. He is in private \npractice, and he is also the medical director of two skilled nursing \nfacilities which care for 150 people. He was very concerned about his \npatients being randomly assigned to plans that don't meet their medical \nneeds. He said patients may be denied drugs. They may be forced to \nchange their medications, and they could face a time-consuming, \nstressful appeals process. He predicts there will be ``chaos for \nnursing staff regarding coordination of multiple suppliers. It further \nduplicates paperwork and documentation requirements.''\n  That is a tremendous new administrative burden for understaffed and \nunderfunded nursing homes and care providers who care for people we \nknow--our parents, grandparents, sisters, and brothers.\n  That is who is going to be affected by this new law if we don't take \naction.\n  Unless we act, the new program is going to make the work of our \npharmacists across the country much harder. They are literally going to \nbe on the front lines. They may well be forced to deny coverage to \nseniors. And by the way, each one of these pharmacists has to go in \ncontract with each of these new drug plans in their States.\n  Now CMS is telling us that pharmacists will be able to look up and \nsee what plan someone has been assigned to. But frankly, I have to say, \ngiven the error and the mistakes CMS has made so far, I don't have a \nlot of confidence that this is going to be a flawless situation in \ntransition. Remember, the people who will be hurt have no financial \ncushion. They are living on fixed incomes and they don't have an extra \n$20 or $30 for copayments or premiums. If they are turned away at the \npharmacy counter, they do not have the money to pay for those drugs now \nand get reimbursed later when all the paperwork is sorted out.\n  Doctors are going to be on the front line in this, too. Doctors are \ngoing to have to know which drugs are on the formulary. They may have \nto help patients appeal any denials, and they will\n\n[[Page S11855]]\n\nhave to treat patients who have gone without their medicine.\n  One doctor told me, ``Doctors don't have the information they need on \nthis yet. If patients pick the wrong plan and their medicine is not \ncovered, it can have serious medical harm.''\n  Hospitals are also going to be affected. They are going to have to \nnavigate all of these new plans. They are going to have to deal with \npatients who haven't been able to get their prescriptions. In fact, for \nmany poor families, the only place to get these medicines will be the \nemergency room, and that is going to increase the cost of health care \nfor every single one of us.\n  So as you can see, this new drug law is going to impose an expensive \nand very confusing administrative burden on our doctors, on our \npharmacists, on our hospitals, and our nursing homes. In this country I \nthink we can do a lot better than that.\n  The amendment I will be offering today says let's fix this problem \nbefore people realize they can't get the prescriptions they need. My \namendment simply provides emergency funding to prevent this disaster.\n  First, it ensures that our most vulnerable don't lose their current \ndrug coverage. It will provide $2 billion in emergency funding to make \nsure our low-income seniors do not lose their benefits or suffer a gap \nin coverage. That money will allow our States to help the low-income \nresidents they have, people who currently get help from State drug \nassistance programs, and people being helped by AIDS drug assistance \nprograms.\n  My amendment will protect our most vulnerable, including any \nbeneficiary with income below 150 percent of the Federal poverty level \nand any beneficiary currently eligible for Medicaid through ``spend \ndown'' requirements.\n  It is going to give our States the flexibility to protect the people \nwho live in those States. States could provide coverage through \nMedicaid or as a separate drug assistance program. And importantly, my \namendment provides accountability. States will be required to notify \nCMS of their plan for ensuring no lapse in benefits for low-income \nbeneficiaries.\n  Secondly, my amendment ensures that everyone knows about the changes \nthat are coming. It requires States to notify those currently eligible \nfor Medicaid and Medicare assistance. I can't tell you how many people \nI talked to when I was in my State who said: I have not been notified \nthat I need to make a change. No one has told me. And yet we are 2 \nmonths away from them being assigned a plan.\n  States would also notify pharmacists. They would notify community \nhealth centers, rural health clinics, hospitals, critical access \nhospitals, doctors, and other Medicaid-eligible providers that \nassistance is available.\n  Providers will be allowed to seek reimbursement for any uncompensated \ncosts associated with providing medically necessary drugs to these \npeople.\n  In summary, my amendment simply protects our most vulnerable and \nmakes sure that everyone involved knows what is happening.\n  This new Medicare prescription drug plan that has been passed has a \nlot of problems, but the most urgent one is what is going to happen to \nour most vulnerable patients and the difficulty it will cause our \nhealth care providers such as hospitals, nursing homes, doctors, and \npharmacists. Time is running out. As of January 1, millions of \nvulnerable Americans are going to be forced into a new system they \nhaven't been told about, they don't understand, and it will not meet \ntheir needs. We can avoid this train wreck. Senators who are concerned \nabout the health and well-being of their own constituents but who are \nconcerned about the costs have other options. We can support efforts on \nthe reconciliation to provide additional time to transition into this \nplan and we can make changes to the Medicare Modernization Act to let \nthe States provide coverage they have available through Medicaid during \nthis transition.\n  No matter what, this is a problem. Either we spend the money now to \nprevent this crisis, I warn my colleagues, or we are going to have to \npush back the deadline so we can make this transition smoothly. \nPeople's lives are hanging in the balance.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up today for those who don't have a \nvoice, and for the doctors, hospitals, pharmacists, and nursing homes, \nand give them the relief and protection my amendment provides.\n  I will be offering this amendment in the Chamber today and I urge my \ncolleagues' support.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11855-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11855-S11857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come this morning to speak about a need \nfor fiscal responsibility. Over 200 years ago, George Washington warned \nthat ``Government is not reason. It is not eloquence. It is force. Like \nfire, it can be a dangerous servant or a fearful master.'' Even when \ngovernment functions properly as a servant, Washington observed, it is \ndangerous.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to talk about--and to urge a need for \nsomething to happen in this Senate and in this Congress--fiscal \nresponsibility. While Congress has been talking about spending measure \nafter spending measure over the past several weeks, Americans have been \ntalking about Congress' loose spending of their tax dollars. What many \nlawmakers have referred to as the fiscal policy of the Government has \ncome to mean nothing more than the Government's dangerous tendency \ntoward fiscal recklessness.\n  Fiscal responsibility is premised on the simple concept that less is \nmore. Less government spending means more freedom for individual \nAmericans and increased levels of economic activity and rates of \neconomic growth for the country. Several studies confirm this.\n\n       A Public Finance Review study indicated that: ``Higher \n     total government expenditure, no matter how financed, is \n     associated with a lower growth rate of real per capita gross \n     state product.''\n       A study by the Journal of Monetary Economics found that: \n     ``There is substantial crowding out of private spending by \n     government spending. Permanent changes in government spending \n     lead to a negative wealth effect.''\n       And an International Monetary Fund study showed that: \n     ``Average growth for the preceding 5-year period was higher \n     in countries with small governments both periods.''\n\n  The cumulative evidence in these studies suggests one important \nthing--government spending hampers the economic growth of our country. \nEven more than this, the growth of government spending is economically \ndestructive.\n  Every dollar the government spends is one taken from an American, and \nis one less dollar in the productive, private sector economy.\n  Every dollar the government spends to fund agencies imposes large \ncosts on the economy's productive sector, no matter how small the \nagency.\n  Every dollar the government spends on programs such as welfare and \nunemployment insurance encourages bad behavior by providing incentives \nfor Americans to remain unemployed and choose leisure over work. Every \ndollar the government spends this way goes to making Americans passive \nsupplicants rather than active citizens, particularly at a time when \nthe number of those dependent on the government is growing and the \nnumber supporting it is shrinking.\n  We have been seeing those numbers talked about over the last good \nnumber of years--who is taxed and who is not, who is paying in to the \nGovernment versus who is not. We are now edging toward 50 percent of \nthe American people not paying taxes, and yet we still hear this great \ndebate in the Senate about, well, the tax cuts are only for the \nwealthy. The tax cuts are for people who pay taxes versus those who do \nnot pay taxes. There is a very important reality check that has to \noccur out there.\n  When I am home visiting with folks at our town meetings and I say a \nfamily of four making $27,000 to $30,000 a year does not pay Federal \ntaxes anymore, that is a fact. Yet somehow we get this rich versus poor \ndebate in this Chamber. It is really those who pay taxes versus those \nwho do not pay taxes and become the recipients of the largesse of \nGovernment.\n  Every dollar the Government spends to subsidize both health care and \neducation distorts competitive processes in the marketplace and makes \nStates increasingly more dependent, and their budgets become distorted \nbecause they are the ones that have had that historic Government \nresponsibility. Every\n\n[[Page S11856]]\n\ndollar the Government spends to deliver services is one that should be \nin the private sector allowing the marketplace to choose its efficiency \nand its effectiveness.\n  There are some interesting figures. In 2005, Washington spent $2.470 \ntrillion, raised $2.154 trillion, and ran a $317 billion budget \ndeficit. This deficit is 2.5 percent of gross domestic product. Some \nwill say that is the lowest ever; it doesn't mean anything. $317 \nbillion is a lot of money.\n  Spending increased by 8 percent in 2005 and is up 33 percent overall \nsince 2001.\n  In 2005, inflation-adjusted federal spending neared $22,000 per \nhousehold, the highest level since World War II.\n  Federal spending has increased by 33 percent since 2001, from $1.863 \ntrillion to $2.470 trillion. Defense and 9/11-related costs have only \naccounted for a smaller-than-expected portion of this:\n  From 2001 to 2003, spending expanded by $296 billion, 45 percent of \nwhich went to defense and 9/11-related costs, and 55 percent of which \nwent to new Federal spending unrelated to defense and 9/11. This is an \n11 percent jump in Federal spending, the fastest growth in a decade.\n  From 2001 to 2005, discretionary spending surged 48 percent, from \n$649 billion to $969 billion.\n  Current spending on entitlement consumes nearly 60 percent of all \nprogram spending, a record 10.8 percent of gross domestic product, and \nis projected to nearly double over the next decade.\n  Long-term trends project the cost of Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid to jump from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2005 to 18.9 percent of GDP \nby 2050. Federal program spending is projected to reach 27.6 percent of \nGDP by 2050.\n  By 2050, our children and our children's children will be footing the \nbill for our current fiscal irresponsibility.\n  Nearly 200 hundred years ago, Thomas Jefferson said that ``although a \nrepublican government is slow to move, yet once in motion, its momentum \nbecomes irresistible.'' There was a time not too long ago when \nRepublicans stood up, made the case for smaller government, and made it \nhappen. From 1998 to 2001, we did this by enjoying record budget \nsurpluses.\n  The time for action is upon us once again.\n  The Federal Government's spending momentum, however, makes tax cuts, \nreductions in pork, and slashes in subsidies only first steps toward a \nreal solution. The only long-term, fundamental, permanent reform that \nwould effectively dispel the danger of current fiscal recklessness and \nrestore fiscal responsibility is a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution like the one I reintroduced earlier this year.\n  Jefferson once said, ``with respect to future debt; would it not be \nwise and just for that nation to declare in the constitution they are \nforming that neither the legislature, nor the nation itself can validly \ncontract more debt than they may pay?'' I think he's right and urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting a balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution to restore the past principles of fiscal responsibility \nenvisioned by the Founding Fathers and to safeguard the future by \nproviding a bill of economic rights for our children.\n  It is important we understand the impact that Federal spending has, \nand it is clearly time some of us come to the floor and challenge all \nof us to recognize what we are doing, where we are going, and the \namount of money being spent. Now we recognize more than ever before, \nwith the natural disasters hitting our country that are unprecedented \nin their impact on human lives, that we have a new responsibility to \nhelp those citizens who have lost everything gain a little back. \nSomehow we think we can go on doing that at our current level of \nspending, but it is time we get a little realistic about some belt \ntightening around here, even if it is at last year's rate of spending \nversus an increased level of spending for the next budget.\n  I think Americans want us to wake up, realize what we are doing, and \nthe impact this kind of spending has both in the short term on our \neconomy and in the long term on our economy both for us, our children, \nand our grandchildren.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, we are moving into an important part of \nour budget plan for the year. Ideally, for the Congress to operate, we \nneed to reach an agreement between the House and the Senate. We did \nthat this year. In the past years we have not been able to do it. It is \ncalled the budget. As a member of the Budget Committee, I was delighted \nto see that happen. We laid out spending parameters for all of the \nvarious agencies, and then we also laid out a plan as to how we were \ngoing to control spending. We are going to do more things to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  The Budget Committee is going to be meeting this afternoon to put \ntogether the final steps of what we call reconciliation. We look at \nwhat we can do to reduce spending. It is called the Deficit Reduction \nOmnibus Reconciliation Act. The most important two words in that \nparticular piece of legislation are ``deficit reduction.''\n  In the budget, we had laid out a plan to reduce the deficit by $34.7 \nbillion. That is net now, and so we need to keep that process moving. \nThis is going to move us into an important aspect of our debate next \nweek where we are going to begin debating on the floor of the Senate \nthe Deficit Reduction Act. It is important we work hard to reduce the \ndeficit. Why is it important? Because we do not want to be passing on \ntoday's obligations to future generations and robbing their futures \nbecause of the spending.\n  If we look at what has been happening with deficit spending in recent \nyears, it has been growing, and I think it concerns a lot of Members of \nthe Senate. It is easy to express concerns, but it is difficult \nsometimes to get the votes we need in order to hold down deficit \nspending. So the Members of the Senate are going to have an opportunity \nto see how committed they are to reducing the deficit. This only \napplies to spending as was outlined in the budget resolution that we \npassed earlier this year.\n\n  There is another aspect to spending, emergency spending. I happen to \nbelieve we need to work harder to find offsets on emergency spending. \nWe have ignored that aspect. Everybody wants to push for emergency \nspending because it gets them around the budget rules, and they do not \nhave to worry about the spending in their programs that perhaps they \ncould not get adopted as part of the appropriations or the budget or \nboth.\n  We are going to be moving into a critical time next week. I think it \nis important that Members of the Senate remember we have a commitment \nto future generations. We may have to cast some tough votes next week \nto keep our plan going on reducing the deficit by $34.7 billion. I \nhappen to think it may come out a little better than that. I guess I am \nan eternal optimist. But it is very important. It is a start. It is not \nas much as we should be doing, but it is a start. It addresses some \nmandatory spending programs, which seem to be the toughest for Members \naround here to address, and it addresses some discretionary spending.\n  If we look out into the future, the greatest obligations that are \naffecting our budget are Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It is \ndifficult to make decisions to reduce those programs. It is easier to \ngo to discretionary spending, but that is not where we are seeing the \nreal growth in spending. We are going to have to make more difficult \ndecisions beyond next week.\n  Next week is going to be a test on just how determined we are and how \ncommitted we are to reducing deficit spending.\n  What the President has done in stimulating our economy with some tax \nreductions has proved fruitful. This year, we are seeing the results of \nthose tax cuts with close to $100 million in revenue that was \nunanticipated at the first of the year, which obviously could have gone \nto deficit spending, but the emergency spending and what has happened \nwith Hurricane Katrina and all the emergencies that have occurred in \nSeptember has created a problem in being able to reduce the deficit as \nmuch as some of us had hoped.\n  Hopefully, we can hold this small amount of deficit spending that we \nare going to be bringing to the floor next week. It is important that \nwe do. I urge\n\n[[Page S11857]]\n\nmy colleagues in the Senate to join me and the other members of the \nBudget Committee when we report this bill out to hold it so at least we \ncan reduce the deficit by $34.7 billion. It is important to the future \nof this country that we at least take this first step. It is something \nwe need to work hard on if we expect a prosperous future for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  My children are now grown and have good salaries. My grandchildren \nare now going to school. I want to see them have the same opportunities \nto grow and save their money and not have to face high tax rates \nbecause we exceeded spending in our generation. It is a challenge. It \nis a challenge, though, that we must meet. It is a challenge that we \ncannot put off, and the sooner we address this challenge, the sooner we \nare going to reduce deficit spending.\n  Mr. President, I think my time is about ready to expire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will use a little more of my time. This is really \nimportant. It is an important time. I commend the chairman of the \nBudget Committee for working hard to try and hold down our deficits. I \nknow he was very frustrated when the budget resolution was before the \nSenate earlier this year. I know he had some real hope of holding down \nspending even more than what finally ended up in the budget bill. I \nhave supported him in trying to hold down the deficit. We do that by \nholding down spending.\n  I know he seems somewhat frustrated now because he has not been able \nto do as much as he wanted to do to eliminate the deficit. I think it \nis important that we stand behind the Budget Committee members, that we \nstand behind the chairman of the Budget Committee in trying to reduce \nthe deficit.\n  Spending should not be running on automatic pilot. To keep this \neconomy growing and keep it strong, we are just going to have to make \nsome tough decisions. So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nour chairman next week in a first step towards reducing the deficit.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11857-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia has been \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator, as I may, without any objections, \nfor 10 minutes, and I retain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2194, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Gregg offered an \namendment to increase funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, LIHEAP, by $1.276 billion yesterday. He will offset the \nspending by an across-the-board cut of almost 1 percent to all other \nprograms funded by this bill--cuts to programs that protect the public \nhealth of our Nation, cuts to research to cure diseases, cuts to \neducational programs that help children reach their potential and build \nbright futures, and cuts to labor programs to help our workers remain \ncompetitive in the global economy. These cuts are very difficult and, \nindeed, I think should be avoided at all costs.\n  This is the wrong level of funding for the LIHEAP bill and, second, \nit is the wrong way to go about paying for these costs.\n  First, Senator Gregg based the amount of funding in his amendment on \na letter Senator Collins and I wrote to the appropriators in September. \nWe were pleased to be joined by 43 of our colleagues in requesting \n$1.276 billion in emergency spending for LIHEAP. Since that time, 51 of \nour colleagues have joined us to vote for an increase in spending to \n$5.1 billion, the full authorized amount. At this point, a majority of \nthe Senate is on record supporting a much higher level of funding for \nthe State grant program.\n  The second point about Senator Gregg's amendment is that the $1.276 \nbillion level of funding requested in our letter is different from the \nmoney we have been discussing and voting on in the last several days. \nThe $1.276 billion was for emergency funding that could be used by the \nPresident at his discretion. This would give the President the ability \nto target assistance to the States most in need of additional funding \nbased on increases in energy prices and weather conditions.\n  Senator Gregg's amendment adds the additional funding into the State \nblock grant program, not the emergency discretionary program. \nIronically, because of the formula allocation of this program, the \ncold-weather States that Senator Gregg and all of us are attempting to \nhelp this winter may see only slight increases in funding.\n  I have been provided with different analyses of the LIHEAP formula \nand what States will gain and lose under the Gregg amendment. This, I \nmust say, is a rather arcane formula which produces at least two \ninterpretations. Based on data from the Department of Health and Human \nServices and a preliminary analysis by CRS, States, such as Minnesota, \nWashington, and Wisconsin, will see no increase in funding under \nSenator Gregg's amendment. Iowa will see an increase of under 3 \npercent. Oregon will see less than a 7.5-percent increase, and Maine \nless than 10 percent, hardly the targeting we need to ensure these \nStates are prepared for the cold weather that is upon us and the high \nenergy prices.\n  Under a second scenario, another analysis--and this is according to \nthe Economic Opportunity Study also based on data from Health and Human \nServices--States, such as Maine, New Hampshire, Iowa, Minnesota, South \nDakota, Alaska, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana, may receive only a \nslight increase under the Gregg amendment and less funding than they \nreceived last year when these States received both their block grant \nallocation and emergency funds. This will be less funding when energy \nbills are rising 50 percent, and the Gregg amendment is proposing $1 \nbillion in increased spending.\n  The reason there are at least two different scenarios is because of \nthe complex nature of this formula. The current LIHEAP formula favors \nfunding to cold-weather States up to $1.97 billion in appropriations. \nFor funds above that level, a new formula determines the allocation of \nfunding. This new formula directs funding to warm-weather States in the \nSouth and Southwest. Therefore, cold weather States in New England, the \nMidwest, and the North will see fewer additional dollars despite the \nincrease offered by Senator Gregg. Cold weather States that need a \nsubstantial increase in assistance now to address rising energy prices \nwill not get the funding they need under the amendment of Senator \nGregg.\n\n  The amendment Senator Collins and I offered adds $2.92 billion to the \nState LIHEAP block grant program. This funding, coupled with the money \ncurrently provided in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, will provide a \ntotal of $5.1 billion for LIHEAP, the level authorized in the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. This law was passed by this Congress and signed \ninto law by the President just 3 months ago. The $5.1 billion level of \nfunding acknowledges the program needs and would fully satisfy the \ndemands caused by this winter and rising energy prices or at least go a \nsubstantial way to satisfy all the demands throughout the country. Our \namendment adds the $2.92 billion to the block grant program which \nprovides direct assistance to the States. Our funding level is \nsufficient to ensure both cold weather and warm weather States get the \nfunding they need.\n  The other problem that the $1.276 billion level raises is, because of \nincome data, because of cold weather, because of the number of \nAmericans who qualify, we need every dollar we can get to help \nAmericans this winter, particularly seniors. There are 32 million \nhouseholds eligible for LIHEAP assistance under the law, and yet we are \nserving only 5 million. So this is a situation where demand far exceeds \nneeds even at robust funding levels, and at the $19.9 billion level, it \nis dramatically unsatisfactory. Seniors just received a $65 adjustment, \nbut this is totally inadequate to deal with the soaring energy prices \nin all the cold States of this Nation. So I believe we have to do much \nmore. In fact, the majority of the Senate believes that, in supporting \na higher level of $5.1 billion total appropriation level for LIHEAP.\n  The other point I think is disturbing about the approach of the \nSenator is it would pay for this by cutting programs across the board, \ncutting very important programs that are necessary for all of us.\n  As the chairman, Senator Specter, pointed out, this is a barebones \nbill. It does not even have increases for inflation, and we are \nliterally robbing Peter to pay Paul if, in fact, we support the \napproach of the Senator from New Hampshire. This support for across-\nthe-board cuts will leave behind 37,000 needy students who could be \nserved by title I and will reduce IDEA funding for special education by \n$98 million. It would drop the Federal share of excess special \neducation costs from 18.6 percent in fiscal year 2005 to 17.8 percent \nin fiscal year 2006. It would mean a $63 million cut in the level for \nHead Start, $32 million below the level of last year, and here we have \na program that would be serving, as a result, 4,400 fewer children.\n\n[[Page S11859]]\n\n  We face a challenge this year, a particular challenge after Katrina, \nof ensuring that the second surge from that disaster, the surge of high \nenergy prices and cold weather, does not leave families vulnerable. \nThat is why I am so pleased that the majority of the Senate supports \nour approach of $5.1 total appropriation, and we hope, as the votes \ncome, that we will reach the 60-vote margin we need to prevail. I hope \nwe can, in fact, reach that margin.\n  I will join, again, Senator Collins in urging all our colleagues to \nsupport our amendment.\n  Mr. President, I also commend and thank Senator Byrd, first for his \nkindness in yielding to me and second because his title I amendment \nwill increase funding. I thank the Senator for his valiant work in this \nregard and his concern for those who need that type of funding for \ntheir education and their future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2275\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report,\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, \n     Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Dayton, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2275.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for title I of the Elementary \n                  and Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. ADDITIONAL TITLE I FUNDING.\n\n       In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated under this \n     Act, there are appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury \n     not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000,000 for carrying out \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), of which--\n       (1) $2,500,000,000 shall be for targeted grants under \n     section 1125 of such Act; and\n       (2) $2,500,000,000 shall be for education finance incentive \n     grants under section 1125A of such Act.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment on behalf of the \nNation's disadvantaged students and the schools that are struggling to \neducate these disadvantaged students.\n  Hear me, I have offered an amendment on behalf of the Nation's \ndisadvantaged students and the schools that are struggling to educate \nthem. When Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act 4 years ago--\nhow short are our memories--it promised--get this--we promised to give \nschools the funding they would need to help every young person in this \ncountry to succeed in the classroom. I wish I had that when I was \nstarting out in a two-room schoolhouse 80 years ago. That promise has \nnot been kept. We have not even come close, and there is no better \nexample of that broken promise than the title I program.\n  Title I is the most important Federal education program we have. Did \nyou hear, Senators? Title I is the most important Federal education \nprogram we have. It helps the students who need help the most--who need \nhelp.\n  When Caesar was about to drown, Caesar said:\n\n       Help me, Cassius, or I sink!\n\n  Here is a program that is not well. It needs help or it will sink--\nhelp for the millions of children who are being left behind.\n  It is also the program that, under the No Child Left Behind Act, will \nhold schools accountable--yes, hold schools accountable for improving \nstudent performance. They should be held accountable. That is why when \nCongress wrote the No Child Left Behind Act it authorized specific \nfunding levels for title I for every year through fiscal year 2007. But \nevery year--now get this--every year when it is time to appropriate the \nmoney, we have come up short.\n  This chart here beside me tells the story. Focus your eyes on this \nchart. Here is the title to the chart, ``Falling Behind On `No Child \nLeft Behind.' '' How about that? ``Falling Behind On `No Child Left \nBehind.' '' The numbers are in billions, billions of dollars. Take a \ngood look at this chart, I say. This chart tells the story, a pretty \nsordid story. The first year of the law, fiscal year 2002--this bar \nright here--the No Child Left Behind Act authorized $13.5 billion. \nThere it is, the first year: $13.5 billion authorized. How much did \nCongress appropriate? Congress appropriated just $10.3 billion. The \nblue shows $13.5 billion authorized. The red shows we fell short. We \nonly appropriated $10.3 billion.\n  In fiscal year 2003, watch this gap. The gap grew wider. The blue \nline shows that Congress authorized $16 billion, the blue bar, but \nCongress appropriated just $11.7 billion. There was $16 billion \nauthorized, $11.7 billion appropriated.\n  Each year, as one can see on this chart, Congress has fallen further \nand further behind, behind in its promise to America's most needy \nstudents.\n  The authorized amount for fiscal year 2006--that is where we are \nnow--appropriating moneys for fiscal year 2006, the authorized amount \nis $22.75, way over here on the chart, $22.75 billion. But the amount \nin this bill is just $12.8. Look at it. That is $10 billion less than \nthe law promised to these disadvantaged students and to the schools in \nwhich they study. What a shame, $10 billion less--$22.75 was \nauthorized, $12.8 billion was appropriated.\n  What a gap, $10 billion. That is $10 for every minute since Jesus \nChrist was born--$10 billion. That is $10 for every minute since Jesus \nChrist was born. What a gap. What a gap, $10 billion. That is enough to \nprovide the full range of title I services to more than 3 million needy \nstudents who are currently being left behind by our Nation's schools. \nAnd at the current funding level in the Senate bill, they will continue \nto be left behind.\n  We got a hard look at some of those disadvantaged students during \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. Those disasters cast a bright light on a \npart of America that many people would like to pretend does not exist--\na part of America where the school buildings are crumbling, where there \nare not enough good teachers, and students are afraid for their own \nsafety. These are real live people, live students who have a future, \nwho have a horizon out there, who have a vision, and yet we are not \nkeeping our promise to them. They are being left behind.\n\n     I took a piece of plastic clay\n     And idly fashioned it one day\n     And as my fingers pressed it still\n     It moved and yielded to my will.\n\n     I came again when days were past,\n     The bit of clay was hard at last.\n     The form I gave it, it still bore\n     And I could change that form no more.\n\n     I took a piece of living clay\n     And gently formed it day by day\n     And molded with my power and art\n     A young child's soft and yielding heart.\n\n     I came again when years were gone,\n     He was a man I looked upon.\n     He still that early impress wore\n     And I can change him never more.\n\nNever more, never more.\n  That is what we are talking about, a piece of human clay, human clay.\n  We are leaving those children behind.\n  Those are exactly the kinds of students who are being left behind \ntoday and they are exactly the kinds of students who can be helped by \ntitle I.\n  America can do better. I say America can do better for these \nstudents. That is why I am offering this amendment to increase funding \nfor title I. I wish I could increase this program by the entire $10 \nbillion to fulfill this commitment, our commitment, the commitment we \nmade when Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act. However, I know \nI wouldn't get enough votes from the other side of the aisle, I have to \nsay. They are all good people over on the other side. They are all \npatriotic people. They are good citizens and they are dedicated to the \nservice of the people. But I realize I can be wrong sometimes. I think \nthey are wrong. I don't think some of them will vote for this. We will \nsee.\n  I am proposing instead that we get halfway there. We are just going \nhalfway--$10 billion shortage--$10 billion shortage in our promise for \nthe children, the disadvantaged children of this country, $10 billion \nshort. I am going to ask for half of that, at least try to close half \nthe gap, half of it.\n  I am proposing that we get half the way there, that we close the gap \nover 2\n\n[[Page S11860]]\n\nyears: $5 billion now, $5 billion the following year. I am proposing we \nget halfway there, that we close the gap over 2 years by adding $5 \nbillion.\n  That is enough to fully serve more than 1.5 million disadvantaged \nstudents who the administration would leave behind, and we would leave \nbehind. These children will be taught by highly qualified teachers and \nreceive the complete range of instructional services called for under \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. States will benefit from this amendment--\nyour State, Mr. President, your State, my State.\n  In my own State of West Virginia, schools would receive a total \nincrease of just $800,000 for title I if the bill is passed as it is \nnow. Under my amendment, those students in West Virginia would receive \nan additional $39 million above the bill. Tennessee would receive an \nadditional $78 million.\n  Do you hear me? The people of Tennessee--are you listening? Are you \nlistening? Tennessee would receive an additional $78 million.\n  Pennsylvania--are you listening? Pennsylvania is the State of which \nBenjamin Franklin was once president. Yes. Old Ben Franklin. \nPennsylvania would receive an additional $185 million.\n  Louisiana would receive an additional $111 million; Mississippi, an \nadditional $62 million.\n  I offered a similar amendment 2 years ago and those who opposed my \namendment argued then that Congress is under no obligation to fund \ntitle I at the authorizing level because authorizations are only \nguidelines. Title I is not your average authorization program. Most \neducational authorizations don't put requirements on States and local \nschool districts, but the title I program in the No Child Left Behind \nAct puts more requirements on our Nation's schools than any law in the \npast 35 years.\n\n  This law requires every State to develop a plan for helping all \nstudents reach a proficient or advanced level of achievement within 12 \nyears. That is all students. That is all students, not just those in \nthe affluent suburbs. No, not just those in the affluent suburbs, but \npoor students in Appalachia. That is where I come from, you see. When I \nwas a boy I would have been included, Robert Byrd. And the gulf coast \nincludes children with disabilities. Do you hear me? Hear, listen. That \nincludes children with disabilities. And it includes students of all \nraces. How about that? And ethnicity. How about that? All races, all \nethnicities.\n  Schools must leave no child behind--not your child, not my great-\ngrandchild. And if schools that receive title I funds fall short of \nthis goal, they face serious consequences. Schools that fail to make \nadequate yearly progress in raising student performance for 2 \nconsecutive years--listen to this--have to give students the option of \ntransferring to another public school. Yes. That means the school has \nto redirect money it would have spent for instruction and use it--for \nwhat?--for transportation instead.\n  This past school year, almost 11,000 schools and districts in the \ncountry failed to make adequate yearly progress for at least 2 straight \nyears.\n  Did you hear that? Almost 11,000--11,000--schools and districts in \nthis country failed this past year to make adequate yearly progress for \nat least 2 straight years.\n  The penalties get more severe the longer the school fails to make \nadequate yearly progress. Ultimately, if a title I school falls short \nfor 5 years in a row, it can be taken over--get this--the school can be \ntaken over by the State, or the entire staff can be fired.\n\n       Help me, Cassius, or I sink.\n\n  These are serious penalties. The entire staff can be fired. There is \nthe door. There is the door. The entire staff can be fired and \nreplaced. That gets pretty tough. That hits close to home.\n  These are serious penalties, and I support them. I believe it is high \ntime that we hold schools accountable for their performance and getting \ntheir act together. I believe it is high time we hold schools \naccountable for their performance. But--here is the conjunction \n``but''--I also believe that if we in the Congress are going to demand \nthat schools raise student achievement, we, I, you, Senators, all \nSenators, all Members of the other body, if we are going to demand that \nschools raise student achievement, we have a responsibility to provide \nthose schools with the additional resources that they need to improve.\n  That is what we are talking about on this chart. We are falling \nshort. We are falling behind in the No Child Left Behind Act. \nUnfortunately, as I say, we are not keeping our promise. In fact, for \nmost school districts, Federal funds are moving in the opposite \ndirection. In fiscal year 2004, more than half of the Nation's school \ndistricts received less title I funding than they did the year before. \nWhat a shame. How about that. Look at that.\n  Listen. Hear me. I will say that again.\n  In fiscal year 2004, more than half of the Nation's school districts \nreceived less title I funding than they did the year before. In fiscal \n2005, two-thirds of school districts took a cut in title I funding.\n  If Congress passes the Senate bill as it stands now, most districts \nwill receive less title I funding for the third year in a row. That is \nnot what Congress promised. That is not what Congress intended when it \npassed the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The funding level for title I in this bill is a betrayal of the law \nand it is unfair to all people in this country who are working so hard \nto implement the law. Parents and teachers want their schools to be \nheld accountable. They want every child--not just this one or that one \nbut every child--to succeed. They are holding up their end of the \nbargain. Are we? Are we holding up our end of the bargain? It is time \nfor the Congress to do the same.\n\n  I voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. I support the reforms in \nthat law. But schools need more funding if we are truly going to leave \nno child behind. What is more important than our children? What is more \nimportant than the education of our children?\n  I urge my fellow Senators to approve this amendment. We gave our word \nto the people, didn't we? Yes, we gave our word to the people when we \npassed the No Child Left Behind Act. Let us keep our word.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to \nthe comments by the very distinguished Senator from West Virginia. It \nis always a treat to listen to Senator Byrd, hear a little Roman \nhistory, hear a tune from time to time, and hear the lengthy experience \nthat Senator Byrd brings to this august body.\n  He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1952. Before that \nhe had been a legislator for the State of West Virginia. He was elected \nto the Senate in 1958. We were reminiscing the other day about his \nhaving served with President Truman, only for a few days, because \nPresident Truman did not run in 1952. President Eisenhower did. And \nSenator Byrd always very carefully denominates the service ``with'' as \nopposed to ``under.'' That is exactly correct. I share his insistence \non parity.\n  When they wrote the Constitution, Congress was article I, not the \nexecutive branch. It did not come in until article II, and the \njudiciary, not until article III. But the Supreme Court has sort of \nrewritten the Constitution more than once.\n  Now, if we were to rewrite the Constitution, they would be article I. \nI don't know where the Congress would be, they have taken away so much \nof our authority. We have lost our authority under the commerce clause.\n  The Supreme Court wrote an opinion in a case called United States v. \nMorrison involving the legislation on protecting women against \nviolence; notwithstanding a mountain of evidence, a voluminous record, \nthey said it was insufficient, and they disagreed with our ``method of \nreasoning.''\n  It surprised me, in preparation for the hearings from Chief Justice \nRoberts, to know that Congress had a defective method of reasoning. I \ndidn't know that until I read that in the Supreme Court opinion. \nSomehow when you move from the columns of Congress, the Senate, lined \nup directly with the columns of the Supreme Court, you lose some \nreasoning capacity in the interim--which I doubt very much. Then when \nthey interpreted the Americans with Disabilities Act, Justice Scalia \nsaid they were tasking the\n\n[[Page S11861]]\n\nCongress, getting us to do our homework, that we had not made a \nsufficient record.\n  So when I listen to Senator Byrd talk about the Constitution and \nabout our duties, it is with great interest. I recollect a few years \nback when Senator Byrd chaired the Committee on Appropriations and I \nhad the audacity to challenge his mark. It was not done by any Senator. \nI thought I had that standing. I looked at my Commission of Elections, \nand I had that standing. I got 3 votes out of 29: Senator D'Amato, \nSenator Kasten voted with me. Senator Kasten was not here at the 1992 \nelections, so it was a long time ago that Senator Byrd looked across \nthe table in S-128, the appropriations room, and said: Someday you may \nbe chairman, you may set the mark.\n  I am not too far away and have not gotten there yet to be chairman of \nthe Committee on Appropriations.\n  We wrestle with these appropriations budgets. It is really a tough \njob. This subcommittee of the bill we have today for $145 billion has \nto fund education and health, which are our two major capital assets. \nIf you do not have good health, you cannot do anything. If you cannot \nhave a good education, you cannot move ahead in this world. Senator \nByrd and I have both benefited from a good education. I didn't come \nfrom a school quite as small as his. I went to high school in a town of \n5,000, Russell, KS, where Bob Dole had gone to high school. However, \neducation is the key to the future and I know that, and I appreciate \nthat.\n  We have struggled mightily to make the best allocation we can with \nthe priorities ahead. As I listened to Senator Byrd talk about title I \nof No Child Left Behind, I would like to see the funding increased on \nNo Child Left Behind. I would see our priorities on a budget of $2.6 \ntrillion arranged differently if I set the priorities.\n  Maybe someday I will get to be chairman of the Committee on \nAppropriations and can set the priorities. But even as I say that, \nthere is so little of that money in discretionary spending that so much \nof the authority of the Committee on Appropriations is taken away. We \nhave to do the best we can. We labored mightily to craft the best \npriorities we could.\n  There will be a number of amendments. There was an amendment offered \nyesterday by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, on Pell \ngrants. I would like to have had more money for Pell grants. I said if \nSenator Kennedy can show the priorities of what could be cut, I would \nbe glad to consider that.\n  As I listened to Senator Byrd today, I would like to have $5 billion \nmore and accept his amendment and see more money go to title I and No \nChild Left Behind, but the money simply is not there.\n  I have to disagree with my distinguished colleague when he says there \nhas been a betrayal of the promise. I don't think the authorization \nconstitutes a proposition. The authorization is always higher than the \nappropriation. In the dark ages of the past, my colleague--Senator \nHarkin is returning to the Senate--the dark ages of the past when \nSenator Harkin was chairman of this subcommittee, Democrats took \ncontrol in that fateful time, the spring of 2001, and controlled the \nbudget process 2001 and 2002 for about a 17-month period. I took a look \nat what the figures were at that time. I noted the authorization on \ntitle I for fiscal year 2002 was $13.5 billion, and the appropriation \nwas $10.35 billion. I understood that because we crafted that bill \ntogether.\n  When I say the ``dark ages'' I say it only in jest. Senator Harkin \nand I have worked coordinately. With all the bickering that exists in \nthis Senate--and it is a lot--there is a deep trench here that crosses \nthe aisle on many days in the Senate but not when Tom Harkin and Arlen \nSpecter or Bob Byrd and Thad Cochran or Ted Stevens work on a bill. We \ncross the partisan line.\n\n  Senator Harkin and the Democrat-controlled Congress could not fund it \nall the way up to the authorization. And in 2003, again, when Senator \nHarkin was chairman of the subcommittee, the authorization was $16 \nbillion and the appropriation was $11.689 billion.\n  I took a look at the funding for the 5 years of the Bush \nadministration and compared it to funding in the 5 years of President \nClinton's administration. As to title I, under the Bush administration, \nthe budget request for fiscal year 2006 is $13.342 billion; President \nClinton's last year at $8.357 billion. There was an increase during the \nBush years of $4.985 billion.\n  With President Clinton, I compared from 1997 to 2001. In 1997, the \nbudget request by the President was $7.165 billion, and President \nClinton's last year it was $8.357 billion. So there was an increase \nduring President Clinton's watch of $1.192 billion.\n  I cite those figures only to point out President Bush has not done \ntoo badly by comparison to President Clinton. They both struggled as \nwell.\n  When we look at the total funding on education, President Bush's \nbudget for 2006 is $56.219 billion, going back to 2001 as a base, \n$40.088 billion, the education budget request by President Clinton has \nincreased $16.131 billion.\n  If you take a comparable period for President Clinton and use the \nfiscal year 2001 figures of $40.088 billion contrasted with fiscal year \n1997, $25.829 billion, there was an increase of $14.259 billion.\n  Now, these figures are subject to differences of inflation. They are \nnot exact. But it ought to be understood, or at least the point I seek \nto make is that it is not a political matter. When it comes to \neducation there is recognition by both parties that it is a very high \npriority item.\n  On the comparison, I find fault with neither party. Both Presidents \nhave tried to do what they could with a lot of conflicting problems. \nCertainly, when Senator Harkin was the chairman of the subcommittee, he \ndid his best. We worked together. When I had an idea, I would bring it \nto him and we would try to work it out. When he had an idea, he would \nbring it to me and I would try to work it out.\n  We have been talking about the avian flu issue, which we will talk \nabout later. I was in my hideaway--that is a small Senate office for \nsomebody watching on C-SPAN2, where you go to hide to try to get some \nwork done, instead of your office where you are surrounded by many \nassistants who want answers to their specific problems which are the \nmost pressing of the day.\n  The phone rang. It was Senator Harkin trying to prepare an opening \nstatement for the Harriet Miers confirmation hearings. We have other \nwork to do besides this big appropriations bill. It was quiet until the \nphone rang. It was Senator Harkin. Would I take a call from Senator \nHarkin? Of course, I will take a call from Senator Harkin, put him \nthrough.\n  We talked about avian flu and what we are going to do. He had some \ngood ideas on avian flu, and we will discuss that in some detail a \nlittle later today.\n  Wherever he has an idea, and I am the chairman, I am all ears. If I \ncan accommodate Senator Harkin, I am going to do so. He was hard to get \noff the phone this morning. That happens from time to time. He was \ngiving me a very heavy pitch. I tried to interrupt him at one point and \nsaid: Tom, I hate to say this, but I think you are right.\n  It didn't stop him, he kept going, kept going. About 30 seconds after \nI said that, he stopped, and said: Yes, you said I was right.\n  I said: That's right, Tom. Can we finish this conversation and \ncontinue it in the Senate when we have the issue before the Senate?\n  In conclusion--the two most popular words of any speech--while I \nwould like to agree with Senator Byrd and I would like to see $5 \nbillion more, we do not have the money under the allocation. If anybody \nhas any ideas about how to rearrange the priorities, I am willing to \nlisten.\n  It is customary for the allocation, the appropriation, to be under \nthe authorization. That happens whether Democrat or Republican. You do \nnot put on a villain's hat necessarily because you are in one party or \nthe other. We will continue the struggle and continue to try to do our \nbest on education.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his \ncontributions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as always, it is a joy and interesting to \nlisten to my friend and colleague, my chairman, talk about the past and \nwhat we have done together. He is\n\n[[Page S11862]]\n\nright, we have worked together closely. I followed his lead on a lot of \nthings, such as when Arlen Specter, back in the mid-1990s, wanted to do \ndouble funding for NIH. He took the lead on that. I did what I could to \nhelp. And we got the job done under his great leadership.\n  So we have worked together on a lot of different things. And where we \nhave had differences, we have had differences, but we have always been, \nI think, upfront and open about those differences. While I love Arlen \nSpecter dearly, and respect him greatly, he is not my twin, he is not \nmy clone, so we do have different ways of approaching things once in a \nwhile. And that is the way it ought to be around here. There should not \nbe, as he said, this big gulf between us, but there ought to be an \nhonest airing of differences of views on how we ought to approach \nthings.\n  Take the Byrd amendment, for example. I stated earlier, when we first \nbrought the bill to the floor, that Senator Specter had done a superb \njob, and he was always open with my staff and me in crafting and \nputting together this bill. I said when you are dealt a bad hand, you \nhave to do the best you can. And Senator Specter did. So in terms of \nthe bill itself and how it is crafted, I do not have problems.\n  What I have problems with is our allocation. That is where I have \nproblems. Since I did not support the budget, I said at the time we \nlaid the bill down the other day: Look, if people are going to come \nhere with amendments that offset and jiggle things around in the bill, \nI will not support it because we worked very hard, Senator Specter \nworked very hard, to craft a bill that was fair in terms of what we had \nto deal with. So I would not support amendments which jiggle things \naround. But if someone has an amendment they want to offer which would \nnot jiggle things around, but add money--which I understand takes 60 \nvotes to waive the Budget Act--I am going to be for that because I \ndon't agree with the Budget Act. I don't agree with what the budget \ncalls for.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't either.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So I will support the Byrd amendment because he is not \ntrying to take money from one pot and move it to another; he is saying \nthe budget was wrong. We ought to waive it and put the money in.\n  Now, with all due respect, again, to my friend from Pennsylvania, in \ngoing back over the history of this, I wish to point out that the Byrd \namendment only closes 50 percent of the gap between the authorization \nlevel and what is in the Senate bill.\n  I have here a chart that shows the authorization and the \nappropriations levels going back to fiscal year 2002. Senator Specter \nmade mention there was an interim period there when our party was in \ncharge for about a year, so we were in charge of the budget and the \nappropriations at that time.\n  I point out that at that point our appropriations were a little over \n70 percent, maybe about 75 percent of the authorization level. Today, \nwe are less than 40 percent of the authorization level. So what Senator \nByrd has said is the authorization level is going up, our \nappropriations are staying flat. We now have this huge gap. We are \ntrying to close this gap. It is not 100 percent. It is about 50 percent \nof closing that gap, and that would tend to bring us back to about \nwhere we were 3 or 4 years ago, in terms of the difference between the \nauthorization level and the appropriations level.\n  Now, there is one other thing that happened during this period of \ntime. The Congress passed something called No Child Left Behind, a new \nmandate on the States, a new mandate that States had to do in \neducation. Now, I am on the authorizing committee for education. At \nthat time, Senator Kennedy was our chairman. I can remember sitting at \nthe White House, and I can remember sitting up here in meetings \ndiscussing No Child Left Behind, I say to my friend from West Virginia, \nand about what it was going to cost.\n  The White House, through their representatives, agreed on what level \nwe would fund No Child Left Behind. Now, that was only authorization \nbecause it was an authorization bill. But we were told by the White \nHouse that they would meet these authorization levels. One of the \nreasons I voted for the bill, not that I was enamored with it, but I \nfelt the White House had made a commitment they would fund No Child \nLeft Behind at the levels we agreed to. We agreed with the White House: \nThese levels? OK, yes, we agree at these levels.\n  Here they are. This level, right here, $22.75 billion for fiscal year \n2006. That is what we agreed upon. Yet our appropriation for this year \nis $12.8 billion. That is why I said it is about--well, I said 40 \npercent. I made a mistake. It is a little over 50 percent. But in \nfiscal year 2002, we were at about 75 percent of funding, and that was \nat the beginning of No Child Left Behind.\n\n  So what Senator Byrd is trying to do is make us live up to what we \nhad agreed to do, with both the White House and the States. I dare say, \nany Senator here who goes home and talks to their State government, \ntalks to their school districts--go out and talk to your school \ndistricts and find out what they are saying about No Child Left Behind. \nThey are saying: Wait a minute. You put all of these mandates on us. \nYou said you were going to fund it. Now you are not, and now we are \nbeing penalized because we can't meet the goals of No Child Left \nBehind.\n  We have put them in kind of what they call a catch-22 situation: \nDarned if you do; darned if you don't. Either way, you lose.\n  So that is why I am supporting Senator Byrd's amendment. The budget \nneeds to be waived. We need to meet our commitments on this.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to ask a question of my colleague \nfrom Iowa, in support of the amendment being offered by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. It was only a few years ago that I offered an \namendment, during the authorizing bill, to fully fund title I. That \namendment carried with over 70 votes to fully fund title I in this \nChamber. It was only a matter of months ago. That was an authorization \nbill. It was not the appropriations bill. All of us are certainly \nadults, and we know the authorizing levels do not always meet with the \nappropriations. But we have gone on record supporting this.\n  I wish to underscore the point the Senator is making and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia made; and that is, I hear it. My State, in fact, has \nfiled a lawsuit on the No Child Left Behind Act because of restrictions \nbeing required of them.\n  Now, again, similar to the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from \nWest Virginia, I have great respect for this law because it is a civil \nrights bill, in my view. It says we should no longer tolerate social \npromotions of children. We ought to be insisting there ought to be \naccountability at every single level.\n  The essence of the bill Senator Kennedy and others drafted, that we \nwere a part of, I think is sound. I think history will prove it to be \nsuch. The great shortcoming is not the failure of the law. The law is \nsound. It is sensible. It makes sense. The failure is as the Senator \nfrom Iowa and the Senator from West Virginia pointed out; and that is, \nwe have not lived up to the commitment we made.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. DODD. We turned around and voted overwhelmingly for that law. \nPresident Bush wanted it. The Department of Education wanted it. The \nCongress wanted it. We said: This is what we will do. Yet month after \nmonth, since enactment of that legislation, we have failed to meet that \nobligation. That is the great tragedy in all of this, not the No Child \nLeft Behind law, but the failure of the Congress and the President to \nsay to the people of our respective States: This is what you must do. \nAnd by the way, we will be here to see to it the funding is there to \nsupport those efforts. We have gone on record in this body, and we are \nnow denying our own record if we turn down this amendment offered by \nSenator Byrd.\n  I wish to reinforce the point made by the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut. He \nwas also on the education committee and was involved in those \ndiscussions during No Child Left Behind. The Senator from Connecticut \nchaired the education subcommittee there, so he knows full well the \ncommitments that were made at that time by the White\n\n[[Page S11863]]\n\nHouse and the Congress to fund it. Senator Kennedy was absolutely \nright, we are not doing what we agreed to do in this regard.\n  Mr. President, prior to yielding the floor, might I ask, what is the \npending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Byrd amendment is the pending \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2283\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Byrd \namendment be temporarily set aside. I have an amendment I send to the \ndesk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Johnson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2283.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To make available funds for pandemic flu preparedness)\n\n       On page 222, at the appropriate place at the end of Title \n     V, insert the following:\n\n                              TITLE     .\n\n     SECTION 101.\n\n       (a) From the money in the Treasury not otherwise obligated \n     or appropriated, there are appropriated to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention $7,975,000,000 for activities \n     relating to a pandemic influenza epidemic during the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2006, which shall be available \n     until expended.\n       (b) Of the amount appropriated under subsection (a)--\n       (1) $3,680,000,000 shall be for stockpiling of antivirals \n     and necessary medical supplies relating to pandemic influenza \n     and public health infrastructure, of which not less than \n     $600,000,000 shall be for grants to state and local public \n     health agencies for emergency preparedness;\n       (2) $60,000,000 shall be for global surveillance relating \n     to avian flu;\n       (3) $3,300,000 shall be to increase the national investment \n     in domestic vaccine infrastructure including development and \n     research;\n       (4) $750,000,000 shall be for improving hospital \n     preparedness and surge capacity and health information \n     technology systems and networks to improve detection of \n     influenza outbreaks;\n       (5) $75,000,000 shall be for risk communication and \n     outreach to providers, businesses, and to the American \n     public;\n       (6) $100,000,000 shall be for research and CDC lab capacity \n     related to pandemic influenza; and\n       (7) $10,000,000 for surveillance of migratory birds for the \n     occurrence of influenza.\n       (c) This title shall take effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2275\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now return \nto the Byrd amendment and that it be the pending business of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, wishes to speak for 5 minutes. If I may \ntake 5 seconds.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our leaders on education: Senator \nByrd on Title I, Senator Dodd on the Head Start program, and Senator \nClinton on IDEA. As I did yesterday, I pay tribute to the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, Senator Specter, because when education issues have \nbeen before the Senate, he has voted for increases in funding.\n  But the Senator from West Virginia will remember, during the budget \nconsideration, this body asked for $5 billion more in education \nfunding. The budget went to conference. We did not get $5 billion. We \ndid not get $4 billion. We did not get $3 billion. We did not get $2 \nbillion. We did not get $1 billion. We got zero.\n  Now we have the opportunity, with the amendment offered by the \nSenator from West Virginia, to do something for the neediest children \nin this country. Those are Title I children.\n  In the early 1960s, this Nation made a commitment and said: For the \npoorest of the poor children in this Nation, we are going to recognize \na national responsibility. Those were Title I children. We have, over a \nlong period of time, tried to focus on improving opportunities for the \nmost disadvantaged students. But as my friends and colleagues on our \nEducation Committee said, we heard the President of the United States \nsay: We are going to do even more for those children with the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. Instead what we have seen is a failure to meet that \ncommitment.\n  One of the most important reasons for supporting the Senator from \nWest Virginia, the Senator from Connecticut, and the Senator from New \nYork on their amendments is that we find, when we provide this help and \nassistance, it works. You have positive results.\n  I refer you to what has happened in my own State of Massachusetts. \nToday, in my State of Massachusetts, we are No. 1 in the country for \nfourth graders and tied for first for eight graders on the Nation's \nReport Card because we did a real No Child Left Behind, the Education \nReform Act, 8 years before the No Child Left Behind Act was signed into \nlaw. The reforms included smaller class sizes, better trained teachers, \nand supplementary services. Parents were involved in decisionmaking. \nThis is what the Senator from West Virginia wants to do. He wants to \nmake sure the whole country can catch up and make sure we keep the \ncommitment we made when this President signed the No Child Left Behind \nAct and said we were going to have proficiency guaranteed to all the \nchildren in this country. The Senator from West Virginia says: Well, we \nare not going to leave the more than 3 million children behind who will \nbe left behind without his particular amendment. I thank the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for offering the amendment. I hope the Senate will \nadopt it.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of and pay tribute to \nour leader on Head Start, the Senator from Connecticut, who used to be \nthe chairman of our children's caucus. He has been the battler and \nfighter for the program. Every study shows that the money invested in \nchildren at the earliest age is the most productive and useful in \neducation. Head Start children are less likely to repeat a grade, less \nlikely to need special education services, and more likely to complete \nschool. I also applaud the work of the Senator from New York on IDEA. \nWe are far behind in meeting our responsibility to many of the children \nwho have faced some of the most difficult challenges--those who have \nboth physical and mental disabilities. The amendment offered by the \nSenator will go a long way to providing the resources needed to ensure \nthat students with disabilities receive the resources they need to \nsucceed. I applaud her efforts.\n  With these amendments on Title I, Head Start and IDEA, we have an \nopportunity to speak about the future. Education is about opportunity. \nIt is about fairness. It is about competitiveness. And it is about \nnational security. Hopefully, the Senate will go on record and support \nthese three measures. Our children and our schools need our help. They \nneed it now more than ever, and so does the Nation. I urge my \ncolleagues to approve all three of these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the Senate will vote quickly. But \nbefore it does, I thank the Senators who have just spoken, particularly \nthe manager of the bill, Mr. Specter. He is an outstanding Senator. I \nhave seen this Senate turn over more than 3 times, complete turnover of \n100 Senators more than 3 times. I tell you, my friends, I have never \nseen a more eloquent, more dedicated Senator to his State, to his \npeople, to the people of this country, to his work here, than Senator \nSpecter. I admire him. Some day when he runs for reelection, I may make \na little contribution to him. I will leave that for another time.\n  I also thank my colleagues. What splendid colleagues they are. \nSenator Dodd, traveling in the wake of the Senator from Connecticut who \nsigned the Constitution of the United States. What a man, Roger \nSherman. And then\n\n[[Page S11864]]\n\nthe Senator from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy. What a great State that \nwas and is. Read your history on the Revolutionary War, those times. \nSomeone talked recently about the people of my generation who saw World \nWar I, who lived through World War II and the Vietnam War, the other \nwars we have participated in, the Great Depression. My, these are great \nSenators. I can see their pictures out there on the medallions in the \nroom just outside this Chamber. And the chairman and ranking member of \nthis committee, my, what Senators they are. They are right, and they \nare right to oppose it in saying we don't have the money. I know they \nare right. But Congress could shift those priorities.\n  How about the big tax cuts for the wealthy? How about the war in \nIraq? How much are we spending there in treasure, to say nothing of the \nblood that is being spilled? Yes, we could do better, but we are doing \nthe best we can under the circumstances now. I don't fault the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I admire him. If I were in his position, I would \nunderstand his responsibility.\n  My responsibility is to try. We can do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides \nbudget authority and outlays in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation for fiscal year 2006 and, therefore, is not in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, for which I voted, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it would be my preference to stack the \nvotes, unless the Senator from West Virginia would like to have a vote \nnow.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I prefer to have the vote now.\n  Mr. SPECTER. All right. In deference to the Senator from West \nVirginia, we will accede to his request. It would be my hope--I talked \nto Senator Harkin about this--that to the extent we can, while we have \npeople here ready to offer amendments--we have just worked out a time \nagreement with Senator Dodd, 45 minutes equally divided for his \namendment--while we have Senators in the Chamber ready to proceed, we \ndo so to the extent we can, unless there is a circumstance which \nrequires a different outcome.\n  I understand Senator Alexander may have a related issue. I have just \nbeen informed about that. May I suggest to the Chair that we hear from \nSenator Alexander to see how it impacts on the vote before we move \nahead with the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it would be my purpose to introduce an \namendment that would increase funding for title I to the level \nPresident Bush has recommended. I propose that we set aside the pending \namendment so that I may introduce that amendment. Perhaps we could vote \non those two amendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Tennessee if he \nwould be agreeable to a time limit of, say, 30 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I propose that we vote on this amendment. \nThe Senator can still offer an amendment if he wishes to do so after \nthis vote. Let's go. I ask for the vote. I object to any request to set \nthis amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Under the regular order, we will then proceed to a vote, \nobjection having been heard. We will entertain Senator Alexander's \namendment at the earliest time the managers can. May I remind my \ncolleagues that this is going to be a 15-minute rollcall vote, with 5 \nadditional minutes. We had an 18\\1/2\\-minute vote yesterday. Let's see \nif we can beat that record. I know we are going to proceed. I will talk \nto my colleagues, and we will work out the sequence.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope that will be the case. We have been \ntrying to be responsive by being here to offer amendments when we have \nbeen asked to be here. It sort of throws off our schedule for the day. \nBut I am happy to talk to my colleague.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we have worked out a procedure \nwhere there will not be either a side-by-side or second-degree \namendment offered. The Senator from Tennessee would like an opportunity \nto speak for 10 minutes on it, and we will hear Senator Alexander for \n10 minutes and then proceed to a vote on the Byrd amendment. So I ask \nunanimous consent at this time that Senator Alexander be recognized for \n10 minutes, that we then proceed to a vote on the Byrd amendment, and \nthen we proceed to take up the Dodd amendment and seek to proceed with \nthe order we have established.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, may I also \nsuggest the amendment offered by the Senator from New York be able to \nfollow the Dodd amendment? Can we lock these in?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let us hold off on this. There may be some amendment on \nthe Republican side. I doubt there will be, but I don't want to have a \nseries of amendments on both sides.\n  I think that would be agreeable, but I would not want to be bound to \nit at this moment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote on the Byrd amendment, Senator Dodd be recognized to offer his \namendment, after which point there would be a vote on the Dodd \namendment, after which point if there is a Republican amendment that is \nto be brought up and disposed of; if there is not, the Senator from New \nYork be recognized at that point to offer her amendment, followed by a \nvote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot intend to press this issue if we can't get agreement, but I would \nlike to stack the Dodd amendment, say, behind the Clinton amendment so \nwe can save time.\n  Let me restate the understanding. There will be 10 minutes for \nSenator Alexander, and there will be a vote on the Byrd amendment. We \nwill then proceed to a Dodd amendment. If there is no intervening \nRepublican seeking recognition to offer an amendment, we will proceed \nto the Clinton amendment, and we will discuss at a later time the \nsequence of votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and I have no intention to \nobject, Mr. President, as I understand it, 10 minutes will be utilized \nby the Senator from Tennessee for remarks only.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is correct. The Senator from \nTennessee will speak in opposition to the Byrd amendment and in support \nof the budget point of order, but he will just make a statement. \nNothing will be offered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further objection? If not, the \nSenator from Tennessee is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his courtesy \nof allowing me--and the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from \nConnecticut--allowing me 10 minutes to speak.\n  Mr. President, I am here in support of the budget point of order of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania to the Byrd amendment. Let me see if I \ncan say in just a few minutes why I support that.\n  I would like to ask the Chair if he will let me know when I have 1 \nminute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the question is funding for the title I \nprogram, Federal funding for our public\n\n[[Page S11865]]\n\nschools across the country that helps disadvantaged children. It is a \nvery important program. I heard the Senator from West Virginia describe \nthe importance of it. I agree with him about the importance of the \nprogram, but to try to put things into perspective, let me make a few \npoints.\n  First, the Senator from West Virginia, if I am not mistaken, is \nsuggesting we spend $5 billion more, $2.5 billion a year on this \nimportant program. But he has not found some other place in the budget \nto reduce the spending. So this is $5 billion beyond the budget, and \nthis comes at a time when all of the committees of the Senate have been \nworking hard on deficit reduction. In the agriculture committee, in the \neducation committee, in almost every committee, we are working at \ndeficit reduction. Because we are at war, because we have had three \nterrible hurricanes, because we have new homeland security needs, and \nbecause entitlement spending--mandatory spending--is growing out of \ncontrol, we are all trying to do a good job of living better within our \nmeans. So we are working to have a deficit reduction of $35 billion, \nand this would add another $5 billion in the opposite direction.\n  The second point I would like to make to put this into perspective is \nthat, as important as this program is, the Federal Government is not \nthe principal source of funding for K-12 education. We only spend 7 or \n8 percent. States don't spend money for national defense by and large, \nand we don't spend much money for K-12. We spend 7 or 8 percent. The \nState and local governments have the major responsibility for our \nelementary and secondary schools.\n  The third thing I would like to mention to put things in perspective \nis that money isn't everything. The top five State spenders in terms of \ndollars, total dollars for kindergarten through the 12th grade, have \nthe widest achievement gaps between White students and Minority \nstudents, Hispanic students and African-American students. For example, \nin Massachusetts, a State which spends about $9,500 per student, there \nis a 33-percent gap between White and Minority students. In \nConnecticut, which spends even more, more than $10,000 per student, \nthere is also a significant gap between White and Minority students. So \neven the States that spend the most money do not get the best results. \nMoney is not everything.\n  Another point to put this in perspective: we are spending more on \neducation in our country today than at any time in history--more than \nwe did when we had a surplus, more than we did when we were not at war, \nmore than we did when we didn't have big hurricanes and a terrorist \nattack and homeland security concerns. And Federal increases for K-12, \neven though they are a smaller part of the pie, have gone up more \nrapidly than State increases over the last several years.\n  For example, in Tennessee, my home State, there is $50 million a \nyear, $25 million of it new money, for teacher training, to help \nteachers become highly qualified.\n  Now, that is a lot of money. Those are Federal dollars. It would be \nenough money to give every teacher about an $858 pay increase a year. \nSo the State could choose to use that money to help all of those \nteachers go to the community college or some other program to become \nbetter trained teachers, or the State could use those Federal dollars \nto give every Tennessee teacher an $800 pay raise based on some merit \nprogram. So there is a lot of new Federal money.\n  The other argument that I heard a great deal about was that we are \nnot funding up to the level of authorization. Mr. President, that is a \nconvenient political argument, but let us think about what we mean by \nthat. I do not have the figures--I wish I did--of how much money we \nhave authorized to be spent for all the programs of the federal \ngovernment. But if we spent all the way up to that authorization, which \nthankfully we don't, there would not be enough printing presses in \nWashington, DC, to print that much money. We almost never spend up to \nthe authorization for every defense program or for health or for HIV/\nAIDS or for any other part of the Federal budget. We have set an \nauthorization level as sort of a top, a maximum, and then we \nappropriate every year what we can afford to spend based upon the needs \nthat we see.\n  So the idea that we are not appropriating to the authorization level \nis not a valid basis upon which to cast this vote. Also, I think it is \nimportant to note that there is a lot of money already appropriated by \nthe Federal Government that is unspent. The Department of Education has \nsome figures on that. The most conservative estimate is that prior to \nthis year, so not even counting money appropriated in this fiscal year, \nthere is 1.7 billion Federal dollars that we have appropriated to State \nand local governments for schools that is waiting to be spent, which \nraises the question: Shouldn't we be cautious about how much more we \nspend?\n  Now, the budget that we are acting on would add $100 million to title \nI, bringing the number up to 12.8 billion Federal dollars, or a 47-\npercent increase since the last year of President Clinton. That is a \nbig increase, and just to put this in perspective again, I have this \nchart. I think to be fair about it we would have to say President Bush, \nthis President, and the Congress with which he has served in the last 2 \nyears, have been good friends to title I.\n  During President Clinton's time in office, 8 years, the increase was \n$2.4 billion. President Clinton cared about education. I know that; I \nserved with him when he was Governor. We worked together on those \nthings with other Governors, too. And he felt it was important over his \n8 years to increase title I by $2.4 billion. I salute him and those \npast Congresses for having done that. But if we are going to salute him \nand those past Congresses, I think we ought to pat ourselves on the \nback a little bit, and this President, because in this President's \nfirst 4 years he increased funding by $4 billion. And so did the \nCongress. So it is $4 billion for the first 4 years of Bush, $2.4 \nbillion for the 8 years of Clinton.\n  Now, one may say, well, this was after No Child Left Behind was \nenacted; it should have gone up. And that is correct, it should have \ngone up. I was not here when that happened, but the Congress looked at \nthat and said we made a new commitment. We need additional dollars for \ntitle I. We need additional funds for IDEA. We need additional funds \nfor teacher training. We need additional funds for some of the things \nwe have asked the States to do. So we have increased funding for title \nI over 4 years by 47 percent--over 5 years.\n  So including this budget, title I would be up to $12.8 billion, or 47 \npercent since the last year of President Clinton.\n  I am here today agreeing with the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia that title I is an immensely important program. I am proud of \nthe fact that the Congress and President Bush have over the last 4 \nyears increased it by $4 billion. That builds on significant increases \nin title I that have been approved by Congress during the time of \nPresident Clinton and even before that. It may be that as time goes on \nand we see the need, and we are not in the middle of a war and we don't \nhave three hurricanes of Titanic proportion and homeland security \nbecomes less of a risk, we will have more money available. But in these \ntimes I believe the proper thing to do is to devote this amount of \nmoney to title I and support the budget point of order of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senators for giving me this \nopportunity to speak before the vote.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \nByrd amendment. This amendment would increase funding for title I by $5 \nbillion. The No Child Left Behind Act authorized $22.7 billion in \nfiscal year 2006 for title I, which serves low-income, disadvantaged \nstudents and schools across the Nation. Unfortunately, this bill falls \n$9.9 billion short. This modest $5 billion increase is only half of the \ndifference between the authorized amount in NCLB and the Senate bill \nlevel.\n  I strongly believe that one of the Federal Government's primary roles \nis to improve education for disadvantaged students. Without adequate \nfunding, we will put States, school districts, teachers and ultimately, \nstudents, at an even greater disadvantage as many will be unable to \nmeet the requirements in the new law and it will be the students who \nwill suffer. I hope\n\n[[Page S11866]]\n\nmy colleagues will support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the unanimous \nconsent agreement it is now appropriate to have a rollcall vote.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, one more reminder. This is a 20-minute \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. 2275.

Madam President, before we proceed to the Dodd amendment, \nI believe the pending amendment is my amendment. I have a modification \nat the desk. I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify the \namendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2283), as modified, is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To make available funds for pandemic flu preparedness)\n\n       On page 169, line 18, strike ``$183,589,000: Provided, That \n     120,000,000'' and replace with ``$8,158,589,000: Provided, \n     That 8,095,000,000''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I further ask unanimous consent that no second-degree \namendments be in order on the Dodd amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2254\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I understand that we have a 45-minute time \nagreement on this amendment. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, that is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2254 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. \n     Stabenow and Mr. Dayton proposes an amendment numbered 2254.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To increase appropriations for Head Start programs)\n\n       On page 162, line 1, strike ``$9,000,832,000'' and insert \n     ``$9,153,832,000''.\n       On page 162, line 7, strike ``$6,874,314,000'' and insert \n     ``$7,027, 314,000''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, the Head Start Program, which is what this \namendment is about, is, of course, very familiar to all Members. The \nHead Start Program began some 40 years ago. Ed Zigler from the State of \nConnecticut, who hails from Yale University, was the father of the Head \nStart concept and idea. I think it goes without saying that with the \nreforms that have been instituted over the last number of years, Head \nStart has been a very successful program during the past 40 years.\n  There have been modifications to the program that I think have even \nstrengthened it over the years. Literally thousands of American \nchildren, who would otherwise not get a good start in their educational \nprocess, have been benefitting as a result of Head Start.\n  Annually, there are some 900,000 children in the United States who \nare involved in some 18,000 programs across the country. That is \nserving about one in four of the eligible children under Head Start.\n  Over the years, there have been various amendments that have been \noffered to fully fund Head Start or to raise the amounts considerably \nto increase the number of eligible children who could receive a Head \nStart Program. That is not my amendment today.\n  I should have begun these remarks by thanking my colleague from \nPennsylvania. He has been recognized already by the Senator from West \nVirginia and the Senator from Iowa for his support of these programs \nand ideas over the years. In fact, some 24 years ago, when he and I \narrived as newly minted Senators in January of 1981, we formed together \nsomething called the Children's Caucus in the Senate. Senator Specter \nand I were the chair and co-chair of that caucus, to raise the level of \nawareness about issues affecting one in four Americans who are \nchildren. We had a variety of ad hoc hearings. We did not have any \nfunding. We did not have the means to actually go out and solicit \npublic support for our efforts to highlight some of these issues.\n  The very first ad hoc hearing Senator Specter and I ever held dealt \nwith latchkey children, afterschool programs, childcare, the related \nissues for single parents or both parents working. We were trying to \nget those children to have a good start to provide some resources and \nsupport for them. We went on to hold a variety of different hearings \nover the number of years thereafter. He was a great advocate and a \ngreat supporter of those programs. He continues to be today.\n  Today I recognize that in fact the committee has had a modest \nincrease in the Head Start Program of some $31.2 million. I am \nappreciative of that. My amendment merely raises that amount by $153 \nmillion to make sure we do not have a decline or loss in services for \nthe 900,000 children being served. This amendment is designed to \nprotect about 20,000 children who would fall out of the Head Start \nProgram if we were not able to keep pace with the rising costs of \nadministering these programs.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Kennedy, Clinton, Durbin, \nKerry, Murray, Corzine, Lautenberg, Lieberman, Stabenow, and Dayton be \nlisted as cosponsors of this amendment.\n\n[[Page S11867]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I said about $100 million. The idea is \njust, if we can, to get these levels of support and funding up because \nof the rising costs of running these programs.\n\n  Energy costs are going up on the average in Head Start Programs by 15 \npercent. Transportation costs are going up 16 percent. Health insurance \nin some places has gone up as high as 25 percent. Training for staff is \nup 4 percent. Facility maintenance is up 9 percent. Services for \nchildren with special needs, of course, continues to rise.\n  This amendment does not expand the program. It is not going to add \n100,000 children to the Head Start Program. It is just designed to make \nsure that we do not see the program deteriorate, that we do not force \nchildren presently in the program to be dropped because we are unable \nto meet the predictable inflationary costs of about 2.7 percent in Head \nStart Programs across the country. That is the rationale for it. It is \nnot an excessive amendment at all. It is a realistic effort to try to \ndo what we can to see to it that these children are going to get the \nkind of start they deserve.\n  To make my case, I want to point out two studies. One was done a \nnumber of years ago. It was a survey done of kindergarten teachers \nthroughout the United States. These were asked, How ready are children \nwhen they come to kindergarten? How ready are they to learn? Over 50 \npercent of kindergarten teachers in the United States, when surveyed \nand asked that question, responded that the majority of children were \nnot ready to learn when they entered kindergarten.\n  There are a variety of reasons for that. We are not going to solve \nthe problem overnight. But we do know now, after 40 years, that \nchildren who are in a Head Start Program clearly benefit and have a \nmuch higher degree of success than children in similar circumstances \nwho do not participate in programs.\n  We know, for instance, that Head Start children are more likely to \nmaintain grade level performance in elementary schools and on into \nsecondary schools. We know that Head Start children stay out of the \njuvenile justice system to a far higher degree than children who are \nnot in those programs. We know that children in the Head Start Program \nare less likely to become abusers of substances, either alcohol or \ndrugs. We know these children, who are involved in Head Start Programs \nare less likely to become teen mothers.\n  In statistic after statistic, we find these children who get the \nbenefit and advantages of a Head Start Program have a greater \nlikelihood of success. It is not a guarantee of success. There are \nobviously children who do not make it. But we know after 40 years this \nprogram works pretty well.\n  Again, I am not suggesting today we expand the program. I have tried \nthat in the past. All I am asking my colleagues today is to say for the \ncoming fiscal year can we do what is possible to avoid some 20,000 \nchildren who are presently in the program from falling out of it?\n  The second study I want to point out has just come out in the last \nseveral days. I do not know if my colleagues have yet received these in \ntheir offices. My colleagues, Senator Lamar Alexander and Jeff Bingaman \nof New Mexico, went to the National Academy of Sciences a couple of \nmonths ago. If I can paraphrase their request, they said to the \nNational Academy of Sciences: Would you mind telling us, over the next \nnumber of years, what are the 10 things we ought to better prepare to \nhandle the math, the science, and the technology demands of our Nation?\n  I am not going to recite the full study here, which is entitled \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' I will just list some of the \nauthors. The chair is Norman Augustine, the retired chair of Lockheed \nMartin; Craig Barrett, chairman of the board of Intel Corporation; Rick \nLevin, the president of Yale University; the president of MIT, the \npresident of DuPont company, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic \nInstitute--it is just an incredible list of distinguished Americans and \nacademicians who worked over a period of time, I think 3 or 4 months, \nto come out with a series of recommendations.\n  I will not go through all of their report. You will get it and it is \nworth looking at. There were some very dramatic recommendations and \nones we should take very seriously.\n  Their findings come in this smaller pamphlet entitled ``Rising Above \nthe Gathering Storm.'' In the first paragraph, these distinguished \nAmericans say:\n\n       We are worried about the future prosperity of the United \n     States. Although many people assume the United States will \n     always be a world leader in science and technology, this may \n     not continue to be the case inasmuch as great minds and ideas \n     exist throughout the world. We fear the abruptness with which \n     a lead in science and technology can be lost, and the \n     difficulty of recovering a lead once lost if, indeed, it can \n     be regained at all. This Nation must prepare with great \n     urgency to preserve its strategic and economic security.\n\n  It continues, but I think that language directly bears on the \namendment I am offering today. The No. 1 suggestion they make--I don't \nthink they necessarily prioritize it, but the first suggestion is to \ntrain and put into the field 10,000 teachers a year in math and the \nsciences. The goal is that each one of these teachers might educate \n1,000 students over a career, so that over time a million students in \nour country would benefit from a tremendous education in science and \nmath and engineering.\n  If America is going to avoid exactly what these distinguished \nAmericans have warned us against we must prepare teachers and children. \nLet me go back to the statistic I mentioned a moment ago, that if the \nkindergarten teachers of America are right, half of children entering \nkindergarten today are not ready to learn. It is one thing to have \nteachers, but what if you don't have the students who are ready to \nlearn? If we know that Head Start kids are more likely to be prepared \nfor school, stay in school, stay out of trouble, avoid substance abuse, \ndon't become teen parents, then we ought to be doing what we can to \nkeep those 900,000 kids in the program. We know full well that Head \nStart, after 40 years, does make a difference.\n\n  We can do a lot better. We can do so much better if we start making \nthese modest investments. We know the modest investments in these \nprograms pay huge dividends. Should we not try to stop some erosion in \nthis program? That is all I am offering today, a modest 2.7-percent \nincrease, a little more than $150 million to just keep the number of \nchildren in the program there for the coming fiscal year. Then, I hope, \nin the coming years when our fiscal condition is much stronger and \nbetter certainly than it is today, we can do more to see that these \nchildren have a chance to go on.\n  Someday I want to come back and offer an amendment again, as I did \nyears ago, to make sure every eligible child can get in a good program \nlike Head Start and Early Head Start. I wouldn't try that today. I know \nmy colleagues cannot accept that. I understand the budget realities. \nBut can we not find $153 million? We are spending $6 billion a month in \nIraq. That doesn't include Afghanistan. My colleague from Tennessee and \nI and Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy recently worked on a package for \n1 year to help out some 400,000 students who have lost their schools as \na result of Katrina and Rita--mostly Katrina. It was a great idea. \nLet's put aside our differences. Let's make sure these kids can get \ngoing so they do not miss a year because the schools have been washed \naway or destroyed.\n  But there are not hurricanes and natural disasters all over our \ncountry, thank the Lord. But these children in Head Start, in many \nways, live in a disastrous situation every day. They live in chaos, \nmany of them. They live in families and neighborhoods where it is \namazing that anyone can come out of them intact. Head Start has reached \ninto these communities and provided a safe place, a harbor for children \nwith talents and abilities. If you go to a Head Start Program you see \nthe children are bright and they want to learn and they overcome \nobstacles, as their parents do every day, to give them a chance to get \ngoing. I don't want some kid in a Head Start Program to be dropped out \nthis year who could have become that engineer or that scientist who \nbecomes that CEO of Intel or who becomes the head of Lockheed Martin or \nbecomes the president of RPI or Yale University. And they are there. \nThese kids are not just in the private\n\n[[Page S11868]]\n\nschools. They are not just in the affluent neighborhoods. Talented \nAmericans are in every neighborhood in America, and we ought to be able \nto do better for these children. We ought to be able to say: This year \nthings are tough, we can't expand the program. But we are not going to \nlose any kids. We are not going to leave any child behind in a Head \nStart Program.\n  Listen to the warnings of this report. It can happen with abruptness, \nand once lost, very difficult to regain. So while we expand the pool of \nteachers, while we do everything we can to give kids a chance to learn, \nwe have to make sure these kids are ready to learn. Head Start, for 40 \nyears has done that.\n  It has made it possible for kids to become ready to learn. Not that \nthey make it in every case, again, but we know without any question \ntoday that the difference between a child who is in an Early Head Start \nor Head Start Program and a child who is not is the likelihood the Head \nStart participant will avoid the obvious pitfalls that can happen so \nquickly in a young person's life. There is a greater likelihood they \nwill go through it.\n  I am offering this amendment today, pleading with my colleagues, \nlet's not lose 20,000 kids. We have not yet even begun to discuss this \n``Rising Storm'' report. I like big ideas, and one of the reasons I am \nso fond of my colleague from Tennessee is because he likes big ideas. \nHe wanted to come to the Senate to grapple with a big idea, and this is \na big idea. I am sure he has not, nor am I, endorsing every dotted I or \ncrossed t here. But it is a very big idea. Head Start is a big idea \nthat Ed Zigler had 40 years ago, and today there are some 900,000 \nchildren in this country who benefit from it, less than 50% of those \nwho are eligible. It is a big idea that needs to be protected. We need \nto be thinking about both parts of the equation--we need teachers and \nwe need students. We can do a lot better, in my view, if we try to do \nboth. We are not going to deal with this report this year. But it seems \nto me we know Head Start works and the success we have had with it, and \nknowing the costs that the nearly 19,000 programs across the country \nare facing--energy, transportation, health insurance, training for \nstaff; all of these increases ranging from 15 percent to 25 percent in \nthe next year. Just to try to keep these programs whole, to hold them \nharmless, is something I think is worth doing.\n  Therefore, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues with the hopes that there will be enough votes maybe to \novercome the budget considerations. Again, I say to my colleague from \nPennsylvania and my colleague from Iowa, you have a thankless job. I \nknow it is not easy to have Members like myself coming over, making \nthese cases to you. But my hope would be in some instances, \nparticularly this one, that we would undertake the responsibility of \ntrying to at least keep the program alive.\n  Barbara Tuchman wrote a wonderful book years ago. She is no longer \nwith us. She wrote a number, but one of them is called ``The March of \nFolly,'' and it mostly dealt with strategic military questions, going \nthroughout past history. Her point was that nations commit folly when \nthey engage in behavior they know is unwise yet they pursue it anyway. \nThis is a different kind of problem than a mistake you make when you \ndidn't know it was a mistake until later. But the follies, according to \nBarbara Tuchman, were when you knew you were making a mistake and you \nwent ahead and did it anyway.\n  In a sense, for us not to keep these programs whole is the ``March of \nFolly'' when it comes to America's future. We know, we know it as well \nas we know anything in this body, that the key to America's success has \nbeen based, throughout its 220-year history on an educated population. \nI have said this maybe 1,000 times; 201 years ago, Thomas Jefferson \nsaid:\n\n       Any nation that ever expects to be ignorant and free\n\n       Expects what never was and never possibly can be.\n\n  If that was true in the beginning of the 19th century, here we are in \nthe beginning of the 21st century with all the explosions of advances \naround the globe. If we don't make these investments, if we don't do \neverything possible to educate our children, knowing that the failure \nto do so puts this Nation at risk on every level, is in fact the \n``March of Folly.''\n  It could be a new chapter for Barbara Tuchman were she alive today \nand writing the sequel to her own book. To not support these efforts, I \nthink, leads us on a path that these distinguished academicians and \nothers have strongly identified in their report.\n  Again, read their words on the opening page, if you will, of ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm.''\n\n       We are worried about the future prosperity of the United \n     States. Although many people assume the United States will \n     always be a world leader in science and technology, this may \n     not continue to be the case. Inasmuch as great minds and \n     ideas exist throughout the world, we fear the abruptness with \n     which the lead in science and technology can be lost and the \n     difficulty of recovering a lead once lost, if indeed it can \n     be regained at all. This Nation must prepare with great \n     urgency to preserve the strategic and economic security.\n\n  Those words are about as clear as they could be. Head Start is an \nintegral part of that, in my view. There is a sense of urgency that \nought to be about it.\n  My hope is again that my colleagues will see their way through to \nsupporting this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, listening to the passionate \npresentation by the Senator from Connecticut, I agree with virtually \neverything he said but nothing more than when he said that Senator \nHarkin and I have thankless tasks.\n  It is very hard to reply to what the Senator from Connecticut has had \nto say about the importance of Head Start without agreeing with him, \nand his reminiscences back to January following the 1980 election when \n18 new Senators came to the Senate--16 Republicans and 2 Democrats. I \nwas one of 16, and Senator Dodd was one of 2. His class has maintained \n50 percent representation. Our class is down to one-eighth, 12\\1/2\\ \npercent. Senator Dodd and I formed the Children's Caucus. He wasn't a \nchairman anywhere because he was in the minority. He wanted to have a \ngavel--at least half a gavel. I chaired the Juvenile Justice \nSubcommittee. We talked and formed a caucus. I think we did very good \nwork. I think some of the work we did has followed its way into Head \nStart and very important juvenile programs.\n  As Senator Dodd has said, it is a thankless job to manage this bill, \nto make allocations of $145 billion among education, health care, and \nlabor and work safety. We have done the very best we could in our \nallocations. It has been crafted, as I said, jointly by Senator Harkin \nand myself.\n  Over the years, I have been and still am a steadfast supporter of \nHead Start. We have in this budget almost $7 billion for Head Start, a \nvery substantial sum of money. Between fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year \n2004, we have doubled Head Start.\n  Nothing would please me more than to be able to accede to the request \nby the Senator from Connecticut, which is, as he accurately stated, a \nmoderate request. Yesterday, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, offered an amendment on Pell grants which I thought was a good \namendment. We had Senator Byrd's amendment this morning for increased \nfunding on education title I, which is a good amendment. It is \ndifficult not to be able to support these amendments. But in my job, it \nis necessary to take the allocation which the budget resolution gives \nus and make the allocations as best we can.\n  If Senator Dodd had some suggestion as to an offset--that is, where \nwe could move some money from one account to another on the basis of \npriority--I would be glad to consider whatever he had to say. But I am \nconstrained to stay within the limits which the budget resolution has \nprovided. That requires, much as I dislike to, raising a budget point \nof order.\n  Much as I dislike doing so, I raise a point of order under 302(f) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act that the amendment would put the authority \nand outlays in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation and, \ntherefore, is out of order.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, much as I regret, I move to waive the \nappropriate sections of the Congressional\n\n[[Page S11869]]\n\nBudget Act, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, may I inquire how much time remains on \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor's time has expired, and 17 minutes \n20 seconds remains on the other side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom New York is going to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, we are going to move to the amendment \nby the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside temporarily and the vote in relation to \nthis amendment be determined by the majority leader after consultation \nwith the Democratic leader and that we move ahead to the amendment to \nbe offered by the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I appreciate the chairman's kindness \nin arranging this. As I understand, we have by unanimous consent set \naside the pending amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2292\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton], for herself, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Dayton, \n     Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reid, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n     Corzine, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2292.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for part B of the Individuals \n                    with Disabilities Education Act)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $3,958,901,143 for \n     carrying out part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.).\n       \n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I come to the Chamber today to offer \nan amendment to provide much-needed resources to help educate the most \nneedy of our students in New York and across America.\n  At the outset, I would like to recognize some of my colleagues who \nhave been extraordinary leaders on behalf of children with special \nneeds, starting with my colleague from Connecticut who is still here on \nthe floor, Senator Dodd. He has been a longtime leader in the fight to \nincrease Federal funding for special education. In that fight for years \nhave also been Senators Harkin, Kennedy, Jeffords, Hagel, and others \nwho have come to this Chamber repeatedly championing the right of those \nwith special needs and reminding us that the noble effort we undertook \nas a nation to require that children with disabilities and special \nneeds be given the education they deserve, to have as a mandate that \nhas been placed upon our local school districts. It is a noble and \nworthy undertaking to require that no child literally be left behind, \nbut it is a burden that we should recognize that our local districts \nstruggle with every school year.\n  I began working on special education issues as a very young lawyer \nliterally just out of law school many years ago working for the \nChildren's Defense Fund. I worked on a project where I walked door to \ndoor in communities, knocking on doors and asking people if they had \nschool-age children. We had realized when looking at census data \ncompared to school enrollment data that we were missing hundreds and \nthousands and on a national basis millions of children. They were not \nin our schools. What I found as I went from home to home was alarming: \nChildren with disabilities back in 1973 and 1974 were not being sent to \nschool. They were being kept at home because the schools were unable to \ncare for them, to meet their needs. Many of them were thought to be \nuneducable.\n  I remember going into an apartment on the second floor of a wooden \nhouse in New Bedford, MA, to meet a lovely young girl of about 12 in a \nwheelchair, just as bright and smart and curious as you could imagine \nany child could be, who had never been to school. There were no \naccommodations in those days for children or adults in wheelchairs. She \nwas at home day after day. I remember meeting another child who was \nblind, and her parents didn't want to send her over to the State school \nfor blind children which was some distance away, so she was at home.\n  We recorded all of these children with their needs, and we presented \na report by the Children's Defense Fund which was used by leaders in \nthis body to argue for and eventually pass the 1975 Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act. That is today known as IDEA, Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  This watershed act--no country had ever tried to open the doors of \nits education system to children with special needs--was an \nextraordinary accomplishment for our Nation. It promised every child \nthe right to a free, appropriate public education. Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Kennedy actually helped to author that bill, and Senators Dodd, \nHarkin, and others have been fighting to make sure it lives up to its \npromise ever since.\n  Today, Senator Dodd and I are seeking to honor that original promise, \nthe pledge to provide up to 40 percent of the per-pupil expenditure for \nstudents with disabilities. Today, the Federal Government provides less \nthan 25 percent, which makes it very difficult for schools to provide a \nhigh-quality education to students with disabilities.\n  In short, after 30 years, the Federal Government still fails to live \nup to the promise we made in 1975 to every child, to that child's \nfamily, and to the school districts of America.\n  This amendment will provide close to $4 billion. That is the \ndifference between the amount appropriated in the Senate bill and the \namount promised in IDEA. For New York, that would mean $243 million \nextra.\n  Lack of funding for this mandated program, as important as it is, has \nserious implications for local communities. School districts do not \nhave a choice about whether they comply. They are legally required to \ndo so, and they should be. They have to provide the necessary services \nthat ensure every child with special needs receives that free, \nappropriate public education.\n  Throughout New York, I have spoken with many educators, teachers, \nprincipals, and superintendents who work hard every single day to make \nIDEA a reality for the children in their care. But the other reality in \ntoday's difficult budget times is that it is increasingly difficult for \nour schools to meet the mandate of IDEA without cutting other \neducational services for all the other children in the school district. \nI am talking about essential services such as teachers' salaries, \nprograms that enrich the curriculum, and afterschool \nprograms. Oftentimes the cost of special education is the driving force \nas to why school districts seek increases in property taxes.\n\n  I will give an example from my own home county. In Westchester County \nwe just learned the Children's Rehabilitation Center, a wonderful \nprogram that serves children with disabilities such as cerebral palsy, \nspina bifida, Down's syndrome, is closing. That leaves parents \nscrambling to find other arrangements. The parents are understandably \nconcerned about the impact of this closure on their children.\n  Our local newspaper, the Journal News, in a recent op-ed about the \nsituation, said the following:\n\n       Hearts of compassionate people, of course, go out to the \n     [parents]. But there are public-policy implications also at \n     play here that many, if not most, taxpayers may not realize.\n\n  The paper went on:\n\n       The reality is this. All children have a right to an \n     education, one that is in the home district or as close as \n     possible. Public\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\n     education, and transportation to it, are paid for by a \n     combination of local, state, and federal funding. When a \n     desperately needed program like Children's Rehabilitation \n     Center scales down, and even if accommodations are made for \n     those affected, the impact is well beyond an individual \n     family and employees--it affects the entire community and, \n     quickly, local school districts. And, yes, that means higher \n     property taxes.\n\n  A similar situation is occurring in Bethlehem, NY, where property \nowners are facing a 7.9-percent increase in their tax rate for the \ncoming school year, in part, to pay for increased special education \ncosts. Under the new rate, a homeowner whose property is assessed at \n$100,000 will be charged $203 more this year than last year.\n  According to a recent article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \nPennsylvania is considering a proposal for additional funding for \nspecial education that would enable property taxes to be cut in half.\n  I know many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will come \nto the Senate and argue this amendment breaks the budget, raises the \ndeficit, and could increase Federal expenditures. The truth is, quite \nsimply, this amendment would lower taxes for New Yorkers and for all \nAmericans who pay property taxes because it will relieve some of the \npressure on local communities. The choice before the Senate today is \nnot between this amendment and lower taxes for Americans. The choice, \nas it impacts many communities, is between this amendment and higher \nlocal property taxes. The total tax burden for American families will \nstay roughly the same. We will succeed only in shifting the \nresponsibility for raising revenue to overburdened localities and \nhomeowners, struggling to meet the mandates of No Child Left Behind and \nthe 30-year-old mandate of IDEA.\n  This amendment is particularly critical today because the cost of \nspecial education has increased substantially in both absolute and \nrelative terms. Today, 15.3 structures in New York public schools have \nspecial needs. The National Center for Education Statistics reports New \nYork's demand for IDEA has consistently increased over the last decade \nand a half. Since 1991, the percentage of children between ages 3 and \n21 served by IDEA has increased by over 43 percent. We have, at the \nsame time, increased by 61 percent the number of children receiving \nthese services. Nationwide, the upward trajectory has been even more \ndramatic. Our country has experienced a 73-percent increase in the \nnumber of students in IDEA between 1976 and 2002. According to CRS, the \nCongressional Research Service, the cost of ``regular'' education has \nincreased 4 percent in constant dollars since 1985, while the cost of \nspecial education has increased 10 percent.\n  Part of the reason is because we have also witnessed dramatic \nincreases in the rates of diagnoses of particular types of \ndisabilities. Before 1985, for instance, only 4 to 6 of every 10,000 \nchildren were diagnosed with autism. Today, 1 in 1,000 is considered a \nconservative estimate. We should not be discouraged by this increasing \nneed for services. Part of the reason more children are being \nidentified is as a result of our paying more attention to children with \ndisabilities. One of the programs we have turned to over the last \nseveral years, the Preschool Grants and Infants and Toddlers With \nDisabilities Program, helps identify children earlier, which in turn \nhelps them get better educated and learn how to deal with their \nparticular disability. It goes hand in hand. It is a good news and \nchallenging news story. The good news is we are reaching out and \nfinding out about what disabilities children suffer from. But the \nchallenge is, how we are going to take care of their needs?\n  We still have a lot of work to do on student assessments. We know \nfrom State assessments there is a large gap between the performance of \nstudents receiving special education services and their nondisabled \npeers. Wide gaps also exist in the performance of students with \ndisabilities who attend high-need school districts compared to school \ndistricts with greater resources. And a great percentage of minority \nstudents are identified as having disabilities. Once identified, a \ngreater percentage are placed in more restrictive special education \nsettings.\n  We must remain accountable for the promises we made these children. \nUnder No Child Left Behind, we are testing these children. We are \npublishing the results. We are telling school districts, you cannot \ncome to us and say you have to discard the scores of our children with \nDown's syndrome or cerebral palsy. We are saying, we expect you to \neducate all of your children. I am very supportive of that. However, in \norder to do that, we have to be fair to the school districts and give \nthem the resources they need to fulfill this mandate.\n  We are in the year 2005. We cannot blame the economy. We cannot blame \nthe war in Iraq. We cannot blame Katrina and Rita in failing to make \ngood on our promise for special education funding. This has been going \non for 30 years, through good times and challenging times. Now more \nthan ever we need to invest in the education of children with special \nneeds. I hope we will do just that. It is time we step up and put the \nFederal Government on record to fulfill its promise and provide the \nresources, help districts keep down property taxes, help them meet the \nneeds of these children.\n  I hope if there is a budget point of order, which I fully expect \nthere to be, that my colleagues will vote in favor of fulfilling the \npromise of IDEA and opposing the budget point of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I concur with the Senator from New York \nabout the tremendous importance of special education. That has been a \npriority of mine since becoming chairman of the subcommittee.\n  In the 1996 fiscal year, the Federal contribution was 7.3 percent. \nSince that time, through fiscal year 2005, we have raised it to 18.5 \npercent. We are still a good bit shy of approximating a 40-percent \nfigure, but when we look at the funding for IDEA, there have been very \nmarked increases as we have moved along, with an increase one year of \n$1.3 billion, another year $1.1 billion. We are now at a position where \nthe total funding for IDEA has come up very dramatically but candidly \nis not as far as I would like to see it. We now stand in a range of \nfunding of $10.7 billion.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from New York increases funding \nby $3.959 billion, almost $4 billion. Like the amendment offered by \nSenator Dodd for Head Start, I would like to see the money for IDEA. \nLast year, Senator Dayton offered an amendment for $11 billion which--\neven that draws a smile from my colleague from Connecticut. Or the \namendment offered by Senator Byrd for $5 billion, or the one yesterday \nfor Head Start.\n  A few years ago, after managing this bill for some time, I made a \ndetermined effort to become chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign \nOperations. It seems to me a good place to be so when these votes came \nup I would be free to cast a vote to exceed the budget limitations, \nsince it takes 60 votes. That means if you take 44 Democrats and \nSenator Jeffords and 14 votes possible, you can be with the good guys \nand still not bust the budget. That luxury is not enjoyed by the \nmanager, however. It is one of the footnotes in the manager's book, you \ncannot raise a point of order and vote against a point of order. It \npresents a very difficult voting record for reelection to vote against \nHead Start, against education funding, against Pell grants, and against \nspecial education.\n  I have stayed with this Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Education \nbecause it is important. Senator Harkin and I have led the way on \nfunding for NIH. We have some very important funding for the Centers \nfor Disease Control. But I think we have done a great deal with this \nbudget, to the maximum extent possible. Each year it becomes much more \ndifficult. The increase of $100 million for special education this year \nis insufficient. I wish there were more money that could be advanced. I \nam well aware that the education for special education, disabled, and \nhandicapped puts people in the mainstream of American life and improves \nthe quality of their life. It is important.\n  But when we have a budget resolution that is thought out--and I voted \nfor the $5 billion Senator Kennedy wanted to add to education which \nwould have given money. It was a 51-\n\n[[Page S11871]]\n\nto-49 vote. I was importuned by the Republican cloakroom with great \npressure to change my vote and make it 50 to 50 so that amendment would \ngo down. I stayed with Senator Kennedy's amendment. If we had had $5 \nbillion more, we could have accommodated what Senator Clinton wants and \nwhat Senator Dodd wants and some of Senator Byrd's request, but we do \nnot have the money.\n  My duties require me to raise a point of order, which I now do \nformally, but I will desist because I see Senator Dodd on his feet for \na short speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I will wait until you make the point of order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides \nbudget authority and outlays in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation under fiscal year 2006 concurrent resolution and therefore \nis not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will, if I may, take a few minutes in \nsupport of the amendment by my colleague from New York. I am a \ncosponsor of this amendment. As she very graciously pointed out, over a \nnumber of years, a number of us have worked on this issue. But my \ncolleague is much too humble. The fact that she has only been in this \nChamber a little short of her first term belies her interest in this \nsubject matter, which goes back years.\n  As she pointed out, she was a lawyer working with the Children's \nDefense Fund. I know our mutual friend, Marion Wright Edelman, has had \nthis issue on the agenda for years and years and years. While the \nSenator from New York is a relatively new Member of this Chamber, she \nis not a newcomer to this issue. I am delighted she is taking the lead \non this issue this year to highlight the importance of this issue.\n  She made all the important arguments. Again, I think the Senator from \nNew York and I both agree, saying to our friend from Pennsylvania: We \ndon't want you to go anywhere. We like the fact you are the chair. You \nwon't mind if the Senator from New York and I might prefer that Senator \nHarkin were the chairman of the committee and you were the ranking \nmember of that committee. You will appreciate our desire to be in the \nmajority, not in the minority, on these issues. But we appreciate \nimmensely the deep commitment of the Senator from Pennsylvania on these \nissues, not just intellectually but passionately as well. And that is \nunderstood.\n  But, certainly, as you understand and we understand the situation you \nare in, you must understand, as well, the position we feel so strongly \nabout; and that is, the people who rely and count on us to come up here \nand raise these issues to try to see if we can't do a bit better.\n  I know within the Budget Act the restraints are there. But we all \nknow as well that we can make choices here in this Chamber. We can make \nchoices about revenue raising, about different priorities within our \noverall budget. I don't want to leave anyone with the impression that \nit is impossible for us to do this. It is not impossible for us to do \nthis. If the will of a majority here exists--or in this case a \nsupermajority to overcome the Budget Act--we can do this.\n  It is a matter of choices we all get asked to make every single day. \nThey are not easy choices--I understand that--from time to time, \nalthough I think the case for special education is so profoundly clear \nthat it ought not be that difficult. We all appreciate the position the \nmanager of the bill is in when he offers, as he must, a point of order \nbecause what we are suggesting does break the ceiling. But that should \nnot be a restraint on anyone else who has the opportunity to make a \nchoice about whether they think this issue has merit.\n  The Senator from New York has pointed out there has been a number of \npeople over the years--Republicans and Democrats--who have supported \nincreasing funds for special education. The Senator from New York \nrightly goes back and talks about a not too distant history--this is \nnot ancient history--when millions of our fellow citizens, merely \nbecause they were confined to a wheelchair, because they had a physical \ndisability, had a learning disability, were deprived the opportunity to \nreceive an education in our country.\n  It was only 30 years ago we decided it was important we provide an \nopportunity for every child--every child--to reach his or her potential \nand that our educational system ought to be able to accommodate those \nchildren, and to see to it they have the opportunity to become as \nindependent and as successful as their God-given talents would provide \nthem. That has been a great success in our country.\n  Back not that many years ago, only 20 percent of children with \ndisabilities ever got an education. Imagine that. It is not that long \nago. The Senator from New York has pointed out how she met children, \nwhen she was doing her work early on, who were in wheelchairs, children \nwho were blind.\n  My oldest sister Carolyn--whom many of my colleagues have met; I know \nmy colleague from New York has met--was born legally blind. She just \nretired after 41 years of teaching. She holds two masters degrees in \nearly childhood development. She ran and taught in Montessori schools, \nand taught, in the late 1950s, in the Whitby School in Greenwich, CT, \nwith Nancy Rambusch, for those who follow Montessori and educational \nissues.\n  But for the financial situation of my family and my parents, who \ncould go out and provide an opportunity for my sister Carolyn who was \nborn in the 1930s, I would hate to think what might have happened to my \nsister under different economic circumstances. What I also regret, as \nwell, is what those children over those 41 years would have lost from a \nremarkable human being who taught them.\n  Today, many of these children across our country who have a physical \ndisability, a learning disability, can go out and achieve great \nsuccess. I know, for instance, a great new airline in the country--\nJetBlue, I think it is called--the man who started that company lives \nin my State of Connecticut. He has nine children. He is dyslexic. \nNelson Rockefeller, who presided over this Chamber as Vice President of \nthe United States, who was a former Governor of the State of New York, \nwhich my colleague who has offered this amendment represents, was \ndyslexic. He had a difficult time reading a speech. Yet think of the \nachievements he reached. Again, economic circumstances gave him \nopportunities.\n  What we are saying today is we do not want to deprive these families, \nthese individuals, of the opportunity to achieve their potential and to \nserve our country, not just themselves because we have all benefited as \na result of the last 30 years of educational opportunities.\n  My colleague from New York makes a very good point. I have often said \nif you go back to any community, any county in the United States today \nand ask them: What could we possibly do to be of help to you?--now, \nthere are unique circumstances. There may be a road or a bridge or a \ndam or some special project. But I promise you, I don't care whether \nyou go from New Hampshire to Pennsylvania to South Dakota to New York, \nwalk into a county or small town and ask, What are the things we can \nhelp out with, and you will hear about No Child Left Behind. That may \ncome first. But I will tell you what is either first or second, unless \nthere is some special need that exists in that community. It is special \neducation, and particularly if you go to rural communities, small \ntowns.\n  I know in my own State, if you go to meet with the first selectman or \nselectwoman and ask, What is the cost, you may find that you have one \nor two special needs children whose educational costs distort the local \nbudget. And it can throw their budget all out of whack. What it does, \nunfortunately, as well, is it sort of singles out these families and \nchildren as if somehow they are culpable for creating financial \ndifficulty to their community or their county.\n\n[[Page S11872]]\n\n  We made a promise 30 years ago. We made a promise that we would pick \nup the cost of 40 percent of the special educational costs. We are now \nat about 18 percent. What the Senator from New York offers us would get \nus to a little more than 24 percent, for 1 year, by the way. This is \nnot an amendment that provides the funding in the succeeding years. It \nwould result, without any question, I can tell you, in rural \ncommunities in my State, in lowering property taxes, without any \nquestion whatsoever. I suspect that would be true in larger communities \nas well, but certainly in smaller communities, in rural areas in the \ncountry, if we could begin to meet our obligation.\n  We are not creating an obligation here. We are merely fulfilling one. \nWe could actually make a huge difference in a tax that is very onerous \nto most people in the country--rising property taxes. That occurs \nbecause of, primarily, education costs, in most areas. It is the \neducation budget that drives the property tax increases more than \nanything else.\n\n  So if you are interested in reducing some of the taxes on our people, \nparticularly on one that affects middle-income and lower income people, \nwho could really use the break, then you ought to be supporting the \namendment offered by the Senator from New York; not to mention, of \ncourse, the advantage and the benefit that our country receives because \nwe are providing an opportunity for children who can make such a \ndifference in our society.\n  The other day I was talking with my colleague, Senator Isakson. I \nthink Senator Isakson made this point. If he didn't then I stand \ncorrected. But I believe it was Senator Isakson. We were talking about \nspecial education and the importance of these programs, and I was \nrecalling that not that long ago I went to a program in Connecticut \nwhere there is an effort to integrate special needs children with \nmainstream children. Part of the day these children are also in special \nclasses. Seeing special needs children interacting with their peers was \na wonderful thing to see.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S11872, October 26, 2005, the following sentence \nappeared: The other day I was talking with my colleague, Senator \nBurr. I think Senator Burr made this point. If he didn't then I \nstand corrected. But I believe it was Senator Burr.\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: The other day I \nwas talking with my colleague, Senator Isakson. I think Senator \nIsakson made this point. If he didn't then I stand corrected. But \nI believe it was Senator Isakson.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  I wish all of my colleagues could have been with me that morning to \nsee the children who are not special needs children and what an \neducation they are getting sitting in a classroom with children who \nhave learning disabilities or other special needs. You can see these \nchildren defend, understand, help, reach out, and recognize the talents \nof their fellow classmates--in a wheelchair or having a learning \ndisability because of some mental retardation--and see how proud they \nare to be in a classroom with these kids, how proud they are of their \naccomplishments and what they can do, even under limited circumstances.\n  I cannot put a line item in the budget for you on that one. There is \nno way I can calculate the cost of what it means for a child to \nunderstand that a fellow classmate of theirs--in an elementary school, \nby the way--is learning and doing their best. What a better citizen, \nwhat a better person that child without those needs is because of that \nexperience. It is an incredible thing to see, to watch children caring \nfor each other. What better adults they are going to be when they are \ngrown up in society, understanding that not everyone who is a part of \nthis country--with all the great success we attribute to our own \nNation--are without problems.\n  This amendment is designed to do what we can to see to it that we \nprovide more help to these communities and to these families and these \nchildren whom we all agree and understand deserve our support. We don't \nwant to go back, obviously, to the days when we excluded as many as 80 \npercent of the children in this country with disabilities from \nreceiving an education. We are not doing that, but we have a choice \nnow, in the next few hours.\n  We have a choice to make on Head Start. We have a choice to make on \nspecial education. It can be done. Don't go home to constituents and \nsay it was impossible for us to do it. It is not impossible. It is \npossible. It is a question of whether you want to make the choice to \nmake it possible. That is the difference. That is what we are asking \nhere to do.\n  Again, I commend my colleague from New York and thank her immensely \nfor offering this amendment. I look forward to someday getting some \nreal success in all of this. But this is a major step forward, and I \ncommend her for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, who has been such \na great leader on this issue, for his eloquent, passionate explanation \nas to why this amendment is so important.

We rely on \nscientists and medical experts serving the National Institutes of \nHealth to make wise decisions based on real science, not politics, to \nensure that our investments in medical research will improve the health \nof Americans for generations to come.\n  The amendment I offer seeks to ensure that the American people will \ncontinue to benefit from the best possible scientific advice and \ninformation from the Government's scientific advisers and from the \nFederal agencies themselves. First, the amendment prohibits the use of \nFederal funds to ask candidates for appointment to scientific advisory \ncommittees to disclose their voting history, their political \naffiliation, or their opinions on unrelated political topics. When the \nFederal Government seeks expert medical and technical advice, it should \nlook for the very best experts. It should not limit itself to only \nthose experts who voted for a particular political candidate or who \nagree with any President's policies or who support the death penalty. \nThat is not how we, in our personal lives, would go about choosing a \ndoctor. It should not be the way our Government seeks out expert \nscientific advice.\n  It appears this is exactly what has happened in a number of \ninstances. In the year 2002, Dr. William Miller, professor of \npsychology and psychiatry at the University of New Mexico, was denied a \nposition on the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse after he \nadmitted that he had not voted for the President. Dr. Miller was also \nasked for his views on abortion rights and the death penalty. This was \nfor an appointment to the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse.\n  In March 2004, the White House screened a nominee to the Arctic \nResearch Commission, an advisory panel on issues that include Arctic \ndrilling. According to the candidate, Dr. Sharon Smith, a professor of \nmarine ecology at the University of Miami:\n\n       The first and only question was, ``do you support the \n     President?''\n\n  Following incidents such as these, the National Academies of Science \nconvened a committee to study how the Government should select its \nscience advisers. Earlier this year it issued a report that said \ncandidates for scientific advisory positions should find it \ninappropriate to be asked to provide nonrelevant information such as \ntheir voting record, political party affiliation, or their position on \nparticular policies. The report goes on to compare these types of \nquestions to asking candidates about their hair color or their height.\n  My amendment would prohibit the use of Federal funds to ask these \ninappropriate political questions of medical and scientific experts. My \namendment also prohibits the use of funds to disseminate scientific \ninformation that is false or misleading. This ensures that Americans \ncan continue to have full confidence and trust that scientific \ninformation provided by the Federal Government is honest, accurate, and \nobjective.\n  There is reason to be concerned. In one notorious incident, the key \nfindings section of a 2003 report on health care disparities was \nrewritten and edited to leave out conclusions about the seriousness and \npervasiveness of racial and ethnic disparities in health care. In fact, \nthe word ``disparity'' itself was edited out. The word appears 30 times \nin the original draft, only twice in the edited version.\n  Joseph Betancourt, a Harvard professor who served on two Institute of \nMedicine panels on inequity in health care, said:\n\n       I admire the Administration's ability to look at the \n     positive, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the truth.\n\n  Eventually, the Department of Health and Human Services admitted it \nmade a mistake and agreed to release the original, more honest version. \nThis kind of incident should not happen again. My amendment prohibits \nthe use of funds to disseminate scientific information that is \ndeliberately false or misleading. This amendment makes sure that all of \nus can continue to have full faith and confidence in the scientific \ninformation that is being provided by our Federal Government.\n  I urge my colleagues to support scientific integrity in Federal \nagencies by voting for the amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That authority has already been granted.\n  Mr. DeMINT. If I may, I ask the Chair to notify me when I have 1 \nminute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified when he has a \nminute remaining.\n\n\n                            Fiscal Concerns\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke on the floor about the \nneed for fiscal responsibility and the need to pass a deficit reduction \nbill to get our fiscal house in order. These are serious times, \ndifficult for our country and for many of our citizens. Americans are \ndemanding bold and immediate action.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, made some important remarks on \nthe floor last week. I want to associate myself with them. Senator\n\n[[Page S11874]]\n\nCoburn talked about a distant rumble, a rumble at the grassroots level, \nthe sound of hard-working Americans who are getting increasingly angry \nwith out-of-control Government spending, waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  This rumble is becoming a roar, and it is the sound of the growing \nfrustration of the American people. It is a sense of increasing disgust \nabout blatant overspending, our inability to make the tough budget \nchoices the American people make every day, and our unwillingness to \nmake priorities rather than spending our children and grandchildren's \nfuture.\n  I am very pleased the Senate Republicans are developing a deficit \nreduction package that will cut Government waste and reduce Federal \nspending. The fiscal discipline comes at a critical time. There are \nmany wasteful practices of Government, and I will look at one of them \ntoday in Medicaid.\n  In New York, there was a dentist who overbilled Medicaid, claiming to \nperform as many as 991 procedures in a single day. It was also reported \nthat school officials in New York have enrolled tens of thousands of \nlow-income students in speech therapy without the required evaluation. \nThis created more than $1 billion in questionable Medicaid payments for \ntheir districts. In fact, one Buffalo school sent over 4,000 students \ninto speech therapy in a single day without talking to them or \nreviewing their records.\n  In Illinois, another dentist cheated Medicaid out of more than \n$200,000 in bogus payments. This man falsely claimed to treat abused \nchildren in the care of the State's child welfare agency for 7 years.\n  In California, a Medicaid fraud scheme involved more than 15 clinical \nlaboratories that illegally billed over $20 million for tests that were \nnever authorized by physicians.\n  In Florida, an ophthalmologist wrote prescriptions for a single drug \nworth over $2 million over a 2-year period.\n  The list goes on and on. We are talking about Medicaid fraud and \nabuse, not medical care for the poor. The Government Accountability \nOffice reports that perhaps 10 percent of all Medicaid spending is \nquestionable or fraudulent.\n  We must stop this waste. The Republican deficit reduction package \nwill create some needed accountability to this program.\n  I have heard objections to these savings from those who believe that \nthese savings will fall on the poor. This is absurd. We are trying to \ncatch a thief, not hurt the poor. If we let billions and billions \ncontinue to be wasted, stolen, or embezzled, that will hurt the poor. \nThis is a small amount compared to the overall budget. This plan, this \ntotal deficit reduction plan we are talking about, which includes the \nchanges in Medicaid, will reduce mandatory spending by only $35 billion \nover 5 years, which is less than one-half of 1 percent of total \nspending this year.\n  These spending reductions represent only about one-third of the \nreductions Congress passed in 1993 and 1997. In 1993, Congress passed a \nreduction package that trimmed about $78 billion. That is 2.6 times \ngreater than what we are talking about today. Unfortunately and \ncuriously, many Democrats who supported this larger effort in 1993 are \nopposing our modest downpayment today.\n  In 1997, Congress passed a reduction package that trimmed about $89 \nbillion. That is over three times greater than what we are talking \nabout today. Unfortunately and curiously, many Democrats who supported \nthis larger effort in 1997 are opposing our modest downpayment today.\n  This plan, this $35 billion reduction, is a small amount to ask in \nthe context of our total budget, and it is only a downpayment on our \nfuture deficit. We need to do much more.\n  I cannot understand why some of my Democratic colleagues will not \nsupport this modest effort, given all the waste, fraud, and abuse we \nhave in Government today. I find this opposition intriguing because \nmany of these same Senators supported similar measures that were far \nmore substantial. In fact, in 1993, they thought $78 billion in savings \nwas not big enough. Here is a quote from Senator Kerry from \nMassachusetts:\n\n       My own personal view is we have not cut enough where we \n     could have and should have cut more.\n\n  And Senator Dorgan from North Dakota:\n\n       I favored a more robust deficit reduction by cutting \n     another $100 billion in wasteful or low-priority spending.\n\n  Senator Biden from Delaware:\n\n       Specifically I want more spending cuts.\n\n  In 1997, when Congress cut $114 billion, my Democratic colleagues \napplauded it and some wanted more. Senator Byrd of West Virginia said:\n\n       If the budget resolution included only the aforementioned \n     spending reductions, I would likely be standing on the floor \n     today declaring my unequivocal support for its passage.\n\n  Senator Conrad from North Dakota:\n\n       I rise to support the budget agreement. I believe it is a \n     modest step--I want to emphasize ``modest''--in the right \n     direction.\n\n  And Senator Durbin from Illinois:\n\n       This budget package cuts 115 billion over 5 years, without \n     excessive new burdens on seniors . . . This budget cuts only \n     $13 billion from Medicaid over 5 years . . . On balance . \n     . . the spending package . . . [is] worthy of support.\n\n  I think it is important to note that 33 of my current Democratic \ncolleagues were in the Senate at the time and supported the deficit \nreduction package. I am deeply troubled by the apparent flip-flopping \naround here. We hear a lot of talk from my Democratic friends about the \nneed to keep our fiscal house in order, but then they offer amendment \nafter amendment to increase spending.\n  Mr. President, I know this is difficult to read from where you sit, \nbut these are the amendments to add to the budget this year by \nDemocrats which totaled $460 billion.\n  During the debate on the budget resolution, they tried to increase \nspending by $192 billion--here on our Democratic ``spendometer.'' \nDuring debate on the emergency supplemental, they offered amendments to \nincrease spending by another $10 billion. During the debate on the \nvarious appropriations bills, they tried to increase spending by \nanother $253 billion. I think all of this shows us something, something \nthe American people understand very well: Democrats are not for keeping \nour fiscal house in order. They are for higher spending and higher \ntaxes. Rather than making modest reductions today, they prefer to \nspend, spend, spend. This new spending sets them up to tax, tax, tax. \nWe need to wake up. We cannot keep spending and taxing, taxing and \nspending.\n  There is no problem too big for America to solve if we have the \ncommitment and the strength to do it. The time for excuses and \nobstruction is over. I am here today to appeal to every Senator to \nsupport our deficit reduction package that will help cut the cost of \nGovernment so we have all of our strength to secure America's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came here to speak on another subject, but \nI have to comment on the statements made by my distinguished colleague.\n  The American people are smart enough to understand what is going on \nin this country. The House of Representatives and the Senate are \ncontrolled by Republicans. The White House is controlled by a \nRepublican. All the agencies of Government are headed by individuals \nappointed by this President. For someone to come and lecture us on \nspending when both Houses of Congress are controlled by Republicans and \nthe President is a Republican takes a lot of nerve.\n  Of course, we are all opposed to Medicaid fraud and abuse. Of course, \nthere are programs that need to be implemented. But I say to my \ndistinguished friend from South Carolina, the President has the tools \nto do that right now, without any new laws. The tools are there. Have \nhis Justice Department do something about it. In fact, some time could \nbe spent on that, for sure.\n  My friend spoke about some of the things going wrong in the State of \nNew York. I would suggest that my friend look at this White House as to \nwhat is going wrong. The person who was in charge of procurement at the \nOffice of Management and Budget was led away in handcuffs because of \nalleged corruption. When this President took office 5 years ago, the \n10-year surplus was expected to be about $5 to $6 trillion. This has \nbeen squandered in 5 years; squandered. In 5 years of this President we \nhave a debt now--not over 10 years but right now--of $8 trillion. So \ndon't lecture us on a spendometer.\n  This Government is controlled by Republicans. What happened when we \nhad\n\n[[Page S11875]]\n\na Democrat in the White House? Some of the time we had a Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate, 2 years during President Clinton's administration we \nhad Democratic control of the House of Representatives. What happened? \nIn 1993 his Budget Deficit Reduction Act passed. How did it pass? \nWithout a single vote by the Republicans in the House and without a \nsingle vote by the Republicans in the Senate. A tie had to be broken by \nAl Gore, Vice President of the United States. What happened after that, \nthis country went on the most prolonged economic boom in the history of \nthe country. In the last 3 years of the Clinton administration the debt \nwas being paid down by some half a trillion dollars. We were spending \nless money than we were taking in.\n  So don't lecture us on how money is to be spent. This White House has \nsquandered trillions of taxpayers' dollars.\n  I did not come up with the verbiage describing the budget that is now \ngoing to be reconciled in the next couple weeks. I didn't come up with \nthe verbiage. The leading Protestant churches in America came up with \nthe verbiage that the budget is immoral. And that was before Katrina \nhit us. If this budget was immoral then, it is really immoral now.\n  What are we going to do? What do the Republicans want to do? I say to \nthe American public, they want to cut more. What do they want to cut it \nfrom? Not the elite of America, but the poorest of the poor, starting \nwith Medicaid, programs for the poorest of the poor. The people \nsuffering the most from Katrina are still suffering. I was with some of \nthem in the House of Representatives yesterday. They came and met with \nus. One woman lost her job. She was a janitor. The school is gone. She \nhas applied for Medicaid. They turned her down because we can't get our \nbill out of this Senate. In the House, they apparently want to cut \nstudent aid as part of reconciliation. And to top it off, Republicans \nin the House and Senate want to give more tax cuts to the rich. If they \nwant to have a better looking program around here, wash out some of \nthat.\n  So I want everyone to know that when someone comes to the floor and \nmakes statements that are basically without foundation, we are going to \nrespond to them. We don't have to stand and be lectured to about the \nWhite House, the House, and the Senate squandering the legacy of this \nlast administration--namely, the Clinton administration--without our \nability to respond. Don't give me a spendometer. Give me the ability to \nget the spending of this country in order. For 5 years, we have seen it \ngo out of whack.\n  I want to say one other thing about the statement made by my friend \nfrom South Carolina. He talks about amendments offered by Democratic \ncolleagues on different pieces of legislation. With rare exception, \nthose all had offsets. So what that means to the American public is it \nwold not have cost the American public any more because it was offset \nby spending cuts in other places.\n  Again, I want everyone to understand, when statements are made that I \nthink are without foundation, keeping in mind we have a Republican \nPresident, a Republican House of Representatives, and a Republican \nSenate, either this Senator or someone on this side will be available \nto answer those statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will be calling up a series of \namendments. Before I do that, I visited with the chairman of this \nsubcommittee. I have four amendments to offer. I ask unanimous consent \nthat we not exceed 45 minutes on them, equally divided between myself \nand those opposing this amendment. I think a couple of these amendments \nwill probably be accepted. One of them will have some significant \ndebate; the other one probably will not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, what was the request? Mr. \nPresident, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2231\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2231.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2231.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require that any limitation, directive, or earmarking \n   contained in either the House of Representatives or Senate report \n accompanying this bill be included in the conference report or joint \n  statement accompanying the bill in order to be considered as having \n               been approved by both Houses of Congress)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Any limitation, directive, or earmarking contained \n     in either the House of Representatives or Senate report \n     accompanying H.R. 3010 shall also be included in the \n     conference report or joint statement accompanying H.R. 3010 \n     in order to be considered as having been approved by both \n     Houses of Congress.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been \naccepted on four appropriations bills thus far. When it was last voted \non, it was accepted 55 to 39 by the Senate.\n  It simply is an amendment that says we ought to know what we are \nvoting on. We call it the sunshine amendment. The procedure is \noftentimes on conference reports that come back to the Senate, we know \nwhat we have in there, we know what is in the conference report, but we \nare not aware of what the House earmarks are in those appropriations \nconference reports.\n  This is simply an amendment that says those conference earmarks ought \nto be made available to Members of the Senate so they can, in fact, \nknow what they are voting on in an appropriations conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think the idea offered by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, that all of the earmarks be specified in the conference \nreport, is a very sound idea. The earmarks from this bill have \ntraditionally and always have been properly identified.\n  I am very pleased to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 2231.\n  The amendment (No. 2231) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2233\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for HIV Vaccine Awareness Day \n                              activities)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2233.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2233.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds appropriated in this Act may be used for \n     any activities associated with HIV Vaccine Awareness Day.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, all this amendment does is say that money \nspent for HIV vaccine research ought to be spent on HIV vaccine \nresearch. There has been $5.2 million spent in the last 4 years to \ncreate an HIV Vaccine Awareness Day. It is not used for recruitment of \ncandidates. It is not used for recruitment for anything other than to \ncelebrate the fact that we are working on an HIV vaccine.\n  I believe it is very important that dollars for research on HIV go to \nresearch on HIV and a vaccine, in particular. The hope is that sometime \nin the next 5 to 10 years, we will have a vaccine. We do not have a \ncure for HIV, no matter how hard we work, how many hundreds of millions \nof dollars we are putting into that. And for us to have spent $5.2 \nmillion over the last 4 years and another million dollars over the next \nyear in promotional activity to make Americans aware that we are \nworking on an HIV vaccine is an improper placement of the dollars being \nspent.\n\n[[Page S11876]]\n\n  I believe the dollars will be better spent toward HIV vaccine efforts \nrather than an effort to make people aware of that fact.\n  I hope the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Pennsylvania will \naccept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the purpose of the advertisements, I have \none in my hand, is to set the stage for recruiting people, as \nrepresented to me, to use the vaccine when it is developed. This ad, \nfor example, pictures a man which says:\n\n       I'm fighting to stop a killer. HIV is a killer. I'm a \n     witness. I have buried babies, I have buried old people and \n     young people, people like me, people like you. HIV is \n     serious. So my life's work is helping others learn about it \n     and prevent it. Today, thousands of research, medical \n     professionals, and volunteers are committed to discovering a \n     vaccine that prevents HIV and stopping this epidemic. To them \n     I say, I'm with you.\n\n  This ad tries to stimulate awareness of what is being done, an \nultimate tool in finding people who will be volunteers.\n  NIH has run this ad. What I suggest to the Senator from Oklahoma is \nthat we set the amendment aside and take a closer look at the purposes \nNIH has in mind in using it. Then we can revisit it and decide whether \nto accept it or whether to contest it and have a vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will be happy to set the amendment \naside, but I have to let you know we have looked at all the ads. There \nhas never been recruitment of anybody for vaccine trials in any of the \nads they have ever run. The American people ought to be asking, why \nwould we be spending $1 million a year? Everybody in this country knows \nHIV is deadly. There is no lack of knowledge on that issue. To spend $1 \nmillion on HIV Vaccine Awareness Day is $1 million to help people with \nHIV through the ADAP program, $1 million to fund an extra research \nmodel or it is $1 million to fund three researchers on an HIV vaccine a \nyear.\n  I believe we would be well advised to prioritize the money that is \ngoing there. I would be happy to set this amendment aside, as per the \nchairman's request.\n  I am adamant that I think that we are not spending the money \nproperly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask to set it aside and move on to the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2230\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I call up amendment No. 2230.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2230.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To limit funding for conferences)\n\n       On page 222, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 517. LIMITATION ON FUNDING FOR CONFERENCES.\n\n       (a) Department of Labor.--Of the funds made available for \n     the Department of Labor under the heading ``Departmental \n     Management, Salaries and Expenses'' in title I, not to exceed \n     $2,000,000 shall be available for expenses related to \n     conferences, including for conference programs, staff time, \n     travel costs, and related expenses.\n       (b) Department of Health and Human Services.--Of the funds \n     made available for the Department of Health and Human \n     Services under the heading ``Office of the Secretary, General \n     Departmental Management'' in title II, not to exceed \n     $25,000,000 shall be available for expenses related to \n     conferences, including for conference programs, staff time, \n     travel costs, and related expenses.\n       (c) Department of Education.--Of the funds made available \n     for the Department of Education under the heading \n     ``Departmental Management, Program Administration'' in title \n     III, not to exceed $2,000,000 shall be available for expenses \n     related to conferences, including for conference programs, \n     staff time, travel costs, and related expenses.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a very straightforward amendment. Growth in \nconferences in the Federal Government has exploded in the last 6 years \nin this country. Over the past 5 years, the Department of HHS has spent \n$300 million on conferences.\n  The idea of conferences and using communication to put forward ideas, \nto promote health, to promote programs is a good idea, but the expanded \ngrowth of these programs through each of these departments, Labor and \nHealth and Human Services, has grown exponentially at the same time \nthat technology has grown even greater. There is a lack of utilization \nof those technologies in a time of budget duress, in a time of \ntremendous debt, in a time where last year we added $546 billion to our \nchildren's debt, and we are struggling with Katrina.\n  This amendment caps the conference costs for each of these \ndepartments so that the other moneys can be used in more productive \nways. It forces creativity through conferences. It promotes \nvideoconferencing. It saves millions of dollars in travel and hotel \ncosts and still allows the flexibility of the Departments for \nconferences, but does it with the technology we have today, a smarter, \nmore current, and more effective means of accomplishing communication \nwith which each of these agencies is charged.\n  I will limit my comments to that and respond should the chairman and \nranking member have questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Department of Health and Human \nServices opposes this amendment saying that they are important for \ntheir work and best practices. I note that a similar amendment was \noffered on the Transportation, Treasury, and HUD appropriations bill \nand that it was agreed upon by a voice vote.\n  Before taking a definitive position, I would like to conduct a \nfurther inquiry with HHS. In preparation for this bill being on the \nfloor, we have an idea of the amendments which are going to be offered, \nand we have information provided by the administrative agency. I \nunderstand the logic of the position of the Senator from Oklahoma. I do \nnot want to abandon the agency without giving them an opportunity to \npresent in a fuller way their ideas. We will consult with them and come \nback to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. COBURN. My only request is that the Senator would allow my staff \nto be there as they make this presentation. We have done significant \nresearch on their expenditures on these conferences, and we would love \nto have the opportunity, if the Senator so allowed it, for us to \nparticipate as they make their presentation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would think it mandatory that the Senator's staff be \npresent.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Of course. The Senator and his staff are welcome to \nwhatever information we have. We want the Senator to know what it is \nevery step of the way. I believe in full disclosure. Let us find out \nwhat the facts are. It has always been a point of mine that if one \ncomes to an agreement on the facts, they can almost always come to an \nagreement on policy that flows from the facts. We will set up a meeting \njointly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2232\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I call up amendment No. 2232.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2232.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for the AIDS drug assistance program)\n\n       On page 139, line 16, insert after the colon the following: \n     ``Provided further, That in addition to amounts otherwise \n     made available for State AIDS Drug Assistance Programs\n\n[[Page S11877]]\n\n     authorized by such section 2616, the Secretary shall transfer \n     $60,000,000 from the amount appropriated under this Act for \n     the construction and renovation of the facilities of the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to carry out such \n     Drug Assistance Programs:''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment does not save us any money \nbut saves hundreds of lives. Some 5 years ago, we embarked on making \nmajor changes at the CDC through a construction program, through \nadvancing the facilities there by increasing the capabilities of the \nCDC. At the end of this fiscal year, September 30, they had unspent \nmoneys in excess of $240 million going toward this construction budget. \nThis year, the President asked for $30 million to be in that \nconstruction budget. The House passed $30 million in the construction \nbudget. I believe we have in this bill $225 million for additional \nconstruction moneys, making available almost $500 million for \nexpenditure in the next 12 months.\n  This amendment is a simple amendment. It is backed by thousands of \ngroups in the country, and it says while people are dying from HIV, \nthey cannot get medicines under the ADAP program because we cannot fund \nit significantly. We have multiple States with people on waiting lists. \nWe have multiple States that cap the available benefits. It is a death \nsentence to those people with HIV today. This moves $60 million from \nthat account into the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, a vital program to \nkeep people working, to keep people active, and to make the lifesaving \ndrugs available to those people with an infection of HIV who have no \nother access to lifesaving drugs.\n  I believe priorities ought to be directed toward the emerging disease \nprogram at the CDC. As a matter of fact, that building is complete. It \nis in the works. We are working to finalize all of that. This $60 \nmillion, which still brings us down to $165 million plus the $240 \nmillion that is in the account, will put us at $400 million still for \nCDC to move forward, and we will do something that has never yet been \ndone since ADAP started: We will have enough funding to make sure \neverybody with HIV in this country has the medicine they need to stay \nalive.\n  I know it is a controversial question for my fellow Senators from \nGeorgia. The CDC happens to be there. This puts no risk to the CDC \nexpansion in Colorado, as it is directed in the budget. It puts no risk \nto that whatsoever. I believe we ought to be thinking about people, not \nbuildings.\n  We have moved on the emerging diseases portion of this. This will not \nslow down any of that construction. It will, however, maybe slow down \nthe Japanese gardens and the tremendous waterfalls and all of the \ngardens that are going to be there.\n  One other thing, the CDC has just completed a $62 million visitors \ncenter. I am asking for $60 million for people who have HIV, who are \nnever going to get to visit the visitors center. I do not know how we \nspent $62 million on a visitors center for the CDC, but I believe that \npriority is wrong when people are dying from HIV and do not have the \navailable medicines.\n  I yield until a further time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, would the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \njust for an announcement?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Oklahoma \nis recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I have been trying for some time to get an amendment in, and it is at \nthe desk. I am not going to ask that it be brought up right now, but I \nam going to announce that regardless of the procedure that is used, I \nam going to get a vote on it between now and the passage of this bill. \nIt is a one-sentence amendment that says: Beginning with fiscal year \n2007 and thereafter, all nondefense, nontrust fund discretionary \nspending shall not exceed the previous fiscal years without a two-\nthirds vote of the Members.\n  It is very simple and straightforward. I am not going to do it right \nnow, but I will do it before final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We would be glad to accommodate the senior Senator from \nOklahoma. We can handle that amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate that. The reason I cannot stay, I chair the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. We have a very large hearing. I \nwill be there for the rest of the afternoon.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we will find a time which is convenient \nto the senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  On to the pending amendment, it is always difficult in the floor \ndebate when we talk about facts to know what the facts are. My training \nis that we want to find out the facts, so we have a trial and present \nwitnesses, the witnesses testify, and then we find out what the facts \nare.\n  I do know this about CDC because I visited the facility about 5 years \nago and found it in shambles. I have seen a lot of Federal \ninstallations. I have never seen one as ramshackle as the Centers for \nDisease Control. We saw premier scientists with their desks in the \ncorridors. We were advised that there were many toxic substances which \nwere not properly secured. It was a mess. I then consulted with the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services--this goes back a few years, as \nI say--and no attention had been paid to it.\n  Senator Harkin later made a similar visit, and that year, on an \nimmediate basis, my recollection is we appropriated $175 million. Then \nwe took a look at their plans for very extensive renovation when we had \nappropriated seriatim substantial sums of money.\n  When the Senator from Oklahoma says that monies have not been spent, \nit is represented to me that contractors will not contract with the \nFederal Government unless they know the money is in hand. \nUnderstandably, unless there is authorization and appropriation, nobody \nwants to do business with some Federal employee who makes \nrepresentations without having the cash in hand. That is the advice \nwhich is coming to me.\n  The landscaping is said to be very modest, which would not include a \nJapanese garden. I would like to inquire more to find out about it. \nFrom what I have seen of the officials at the Centers for Disease \nControl, Dr. Julie Gerberding is an extraordinary public servant. I \nknow that when I have wanted some information on the problems of \npandemic flu, I had to find her in Bangkok, where she was making an \ninternational survey. I know when we had a deadly botulism in western \nPennsylvania a couple of years ago, I called her up and she came on a \nweekend to Beaver County, Pennsylvania. I do not think it was just \nbecause the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee was calling; \nthat is the kind of service they perform.\n  They wrestle with HIV, SARS, and hurricanes, and now they are \nwrestling with pandemic flu. Among the many people in the Federal \nGovernment whom I have dealt with--and there have been quite a few in \nthe course of my time--I would rate Dr. Gerberding, who is the head of \nit, very highly.\n  Having mentioned Japanese gardens, I have just been handed a note \nfrom my staff that says it does have a Japanese garden. Well, I wish to \ninquire further. Maybe there could be a less expensive exotic garden \nthan a Japanese garden.\n  I do, at my risk, commend the Senator from Oklahoma for his tenacity \nand for his sharpness in digging up wasteful spending. I do believe \nthat on this one, he is on the wrong track, but the Senators from \nGeorgia are present, and I know they want to be heard. I think the \ndistinguished ranking member wants to be heard. So I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join my chairman and support his views \non this amendment. He correctly stated a lot of the history of how this \nhas come about. Between the two of us, as we have alternated as \nchairmen of this subcommittee, it has been a strong bipartisan effort, \nnot just between the two of us but on both sides of the aisle for a \nlong time, to bring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in \nAtlanta's facilities up to the 21st century.\n  I remember having gone down in the 1990s. I had seen this movie \n``Outbreak'' starring Dustin Hoffman. It supposedly had taken place at \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. I was quite \ntaken by all of the containment facilities and how\n\n[[Page S11878]]\n\nmodern it was in this movie, and I wanted to go down and see all this. \nImagine my surprise when I went down to the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention and I asked to see these wonderful facilities that were \nin this movie and I was told the movie producers had come down to film \nthe movie there, saw the facilities, and said no one would ever believe \nthese ramshackle buildings are our Centers for Disease Control, so they \nwent out and built their own movie set to make the movie.\n  I went around and looked at their buildings, some predating World War \nII, in which the most virulent specimens of viruses and other things \nwere being dealt with. There was a tremendous concern about safety. We \nperhaps didn't think about it in terms we are thinking about it now, \nbut in terms of terrorist activity, about someone being able to abscond \nwith some of those very lethal strains, plus the environment for \nscientists to be able to work down there.\n  After looking at this and consulting with one another, and others, \nand with probably three administrations, Republican and Democratic, it \nwas decided we needed to bring these buildings up to the 21st century. \nWe embarked on that and we are about through bringing them up. They are \nstate of the art, as they should be.\n  We have always prided ourselves in America of being on the leading \nedge--not on the edge, being way out in front of everyone in our \nmedical research, but also in terms of the Centers for Disease Control. \nI don't know that there is any institution in America dealing with \nhealth and safety that is called upon more around the globe to do \nsomething than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Whether \nit was SARS a few years ago--think about it. We prevented SARS from \ncoming to America. We did. The Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention did. They are called upon all over the globe, whether it is \nfor Ebola, swine flu, of course now the avian flu, a pandemic that may \nbe confronting us shortly.\n  These buildings need to be finished. We have the plan. We have gone \nthrough. We have had our oversight hearings and we found they came \nthrough on time and under budget, so I think we ought to finish it.\n  I would say the AIDS Drug Assistance Program the Senator is talking \nabout is a good program. I have no problems putting money into those \nprograms if they are good programs. But to take it from the Centers for \nDisease Control for that is--talk about robbing Peter to pay Paul, you \nare invading one entity that goes to control and prevent diseases and \nillnesses in America and putting it into another one. It doesn't make \nmuch sense. I think we ought to finish our projects, be proud of the \nbuildings that are built there, be proud of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention and what they do for America and for the world.\n  I am opposed to this amendment. We ought to finish the job we started \non. I don't know about Japanese gardens. I don't know that much about \ngardens and stuff such as that. But, you know, if I might make a minor \nobservation, I remember traveling through the Soviet Union years ago \nand looking at all the government buildings built in Moscow and places \nsuch as that, East Germany. They were stark, sterile, concrete block \nbuildings. Who would ever want to work there? They were ugly; \ndepressing. Is that what we want to build here?\n  As I said, I don't know much about Japanese gardens, but this is the \npremier facility in the world regarding health and disease prevention.\n  I understand that the building in question where this garden is--in \nfact, I went down and saw it. It is designed to emphasize healthy \nliving. The stairs are located on exterior walls to increase daylight \nand to encourage daily physical activity. We talked about that with Dr. \nGerberding. The green space around the building includes a stream fed \nby water runoff collected from the building to make the area inviting \nfor exercise. I remember seeing that. I didn't think it was a Japanese \ngarden; I thought it was a green space. But it is to get people out, \nexercise, walk more. As far as I am concerned, the more green space and \nthe more daylight and the more exercise people get there, the better \noff we are. That is what they are preaching, right? They are preaching \nto us to do more exercise to stay healthy. I guess they are going to \nstart doing that more on their own at the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention.\n  I understand what the Senator from Oklahoma wants to do here. If he \nwants to increase money for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, that is \nall well and good, but not at the expense of taking it away from the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have to leave the floor to chair a \nsubcommittee hearing. I want to spend 2 or 3 minutes.\n  No. 1, the head of the CDC, Dr. Gerberding, I know very well as the \nformer head of the President's Commission on HIV/AIDS in this country.\n  No. 2, her submission to Congress for building funds this year was \n$30 million.\n  No. 3, the total budget for CDC is $4.5 billion. We are asking that \nwe take $60 million in construction money and slow it down and save the \nlives of thousands of people in this country by making available drugs \nto them.\n  We need the facilities at CDC; I am not debating that. This is about \nsaving lives and the priorities of putting that money in a place where \nit will save lives.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the chairman and the Senator from \nGeorgia for their collegiality in working on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nof my good friend from Oklahoma. He and I were elected to the House \ntogether and we fought many battles over there, not unlike what he has \nbrought to the Senate, and I wound up voting with him a number of \ntimes. But in this case I must oppose him, mainly because I think he \nhas the facts wrong.\n  I want to say to the chairman and ranking member, since my days on \nthe House side when I had to go to the then-chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee over there, who has jurisdiction of CDC, after \nI would talk with him I would come over here and visit with Senators \nbecause this has been such an important project that we have embarked \non. Both Senator Specter and Senator Harkin have been very supportive \nof the work down at CDC, not just the construction program, which I \nwant to talk a little bit about but also of the ongoing work down \nthere.\n  Nobody, even my friend from Oklahoma, would disagree that the work \nbeing done at CDC is unparalleled anywhere else in the world. Were it \nnot for the great support of Senator Harkin and Senator Specter, I am \nnot sure we would be in this position today. I can only emphasize how \nimportant that work is by telling the American people, as we talk about \nthis issue and talk about CDC, that on September 11, after the \nterrorists struck New York City, there were two planes that were \nauthorized to be in the air. One was Air Force One. The other was an \nairplane commissioned by the CDC to carry CDC medical workers to New \nYork City. That is how important a priority it is in our country. That \nis why it is important that we make sure the employees at CDC have the \navailability of working in first-class facilities.\n  Most of the laboratory facilities at the Chamblee, GA location of CDC \nare in a state of extreme disrepair and require immediate repair or \nmodernization. Perhaps the laboratories in the worst condition are 60-\nyear-old wooden former temporary military barracks from the World War \nII era and previous to that, that are on the verge of collapse and \ncould be repaired only at an expense greater than the value of the \nfacilities. I want to show you a couple of examples of what it looks \nlike at the CDC if we take money away from the CDC building program to \nput it towards the ADAP program, as this amendment calls for. These are \nsome of the facilities that will go lacking and the construction \nproject will be delayed for the buildings which will house these \nfacilities.\n  Here is a main environmental health lab at Chamblee, in a World War \nII barrack. If you will notice, there appears to be a shield of some \nsort here. This shows the roof above this shield that extends all the \nway up to the roof. The reason it is there is because there is a leak \nin the roof. When the water comes through, it leaks into this funnel,\n\n[[Page S11879]]\n\nwhich is this shield, and you will see a pipe connected to that shield \nand it takes the water to the outside.\n  Here is a typical infectious disease lab at the Roybal Campus \nadjacent to Emory University. This shows not just the crowded \nconditions in which the most sophisticated scientists in the world \noperate, but it also shows you it is not adequate for the type of work \nthat needs to be carried out to prevent every kind of infectious \ndisease that exists in the world today. That is because the CDC is not \ncalled on by simply other States in America; it is called on by every \ncountry around the world when illness occurs.\n  This is a pretty typical facility. These are not facilities that have \nbeen replaced. These are facilities that exist today.\n  A quick personal anecdote. I will never forget the first time I went \nto the Chamblee campus a few years before we embarked on this building \nprogram. I walked into what then was a World War II barrack. It now has \nbeen replaced. There was a shower curtain, and it wasn't one of those \n$540 shower curtains. This had been purchased by the individual \nscientist working in that building. That shower curtain was put over a \npiece of equipment and it was about 5 feet, I guess, above the \nequipment itself. When I asked what that was for, they pointed to a \nhole in the roof and said, The roof leaks and there is nothing we can \ndo about it. Here we have a piece of equipment worth about $1.5 million \nthat sits right under there. It has to be there because of the design \nof the lab inside the building. That shower curtain was purchased by \nthe individual scientist to make sure that not only the equipment was \nnot damaged but, obviously, that the working papers on that scientist's \ndesk were not destroyed by water coming in and leaking on it. But we \nhave since torn that building down and we have replaced it.\n\n  Expensive and sensitive equipment has literally fallen through the \nfloors at some of these facilities. In addition, most of the remainder \nof the CDC's laboratories are more than 40 years old and are incapable \nof handling the dangerous viruses encountered over the last 25 years, \nsuch as Ebola virus, hantavirus, and Dengue fever. This raises concerns \nthat these facilities will be severely outmatched in the future by \nundiscovered biological threats, which we have most recently \nexperienced with the threat of anthrax in the past years, and the \ndisasters that occurred on September 11. The Asian bird flu or any \nother highly pathogenic avian influenza is currently an issue for \nagricultural health and animal disease experts, but should this virus \nmutate to allow for human-to-human transfer, the control and efforts to \nlimit its spread will fall squarely under the purview of the very \nentity that this amendment would seek to cut, the CDC.\n  The three prongs critical to managing an animal-borne pandemic--DHS, \nCDC, and USDA--must all be equipped with the necessary resources to \neffectively address potential outbreaks in a timely and efficient \nmanner. This amendment will jeopardize a critical element in this \neffort.\n  During the 1997 Hong Kong avian flu outbreak, CDC was forced to \ncreate emergency laboratory space by displacing researchers working on \nother diseases. With additional funding, CDC will be much better \nprepared to respond to such emergencies as a terrorist attack using \nsmallpox virus, anthrax, a worldwide flu pandemic or a large-scale \nexposure to deadly toxic chemicals. A delayed or slow response from CDC \nmay increase public panic or anxiety in an emergency situation and cost \nhuman lives.\n  One of today's most serious potential threats to our national \nsecurity is bioterrorism. The CDC is an integral part of the homeland \ndefense because of its ability to identify, classify, and recommend \ncourses of action in dealing with biological and chemical threats. The \nCDC master plan will address the current and future needs for surge \ncapacity for responding to large public health emergencies.\n  In addition to working in asbestos-laden facilities, many highly \ntrained scientists perform their research in facilities that lack \nsafety features, such as sprinkler systems and adequate electric and \nairflow systems. The poor conditions of the facilities have damaged the \nAgency's ability to recruit and retain the world-class scientists upon \nwhich CDC relies to serve the American public.\n  The multiyear master plan has received wide bipartisan support in the \nHouse and Senate. In the past, addressing these deficiencies has \ngreatly benefited all Americans by enhancing CDC's ability to respond \nto emergencies as well as providing the desperately needed facilities \nrequired for the day-to-day public health and research activities.\n  The fiscal year 2006 funding will continue to substantially enhance \nthe CDC's ability to build the new infectious disease laboratory, which \nwill include greatly needed biosafety level 4 ``hot lab'' construction \nof a new environmental toxicology lab and greatly needed security \nupdates.\n  Let me tell you about the master plan to which I referred a couple of \ntimes.\n  Back in 2001, probably at about the time Senator Specter said he went \nto CDC--and I am sure Senator Harkin was there about that time--they \nobserved the condition of the facilities at CDC, both at the Chamblee \nCampus, as well as the Roybal Campus. Those buildings were in total \ndisrepair, and in bad need of replacement.\n  Again, the examples which I alluded to, the personal anecdote as well \nas what I have shown in pictures, still exist, particularly throughout \nthe Chamblee Campus.\n  Under the leadership then of Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, and subsequently \nunder Dr. Gerberding, the CDC developed a master building plan. What \nthey did was unique to any governmental agency that I have ever engaged \nwith since I have been in Congress for 11 years now; that is, they went \nout and had an architect draw a master plan for a specific set of \nbuildings. It involves a number of buildings where we are going to \nconsolidate laboratories as we tear down these World War II barracks. \nThat master plan not only had the buildings drawn, but they also went \nfurther than this and had the plans and specifications themselves sent \nout for bid. And they now have a contract on each one of these \nbuildings. That is the master plan.\n  Originally, we were scheduled to complete that $15 billion master \nplan over 10 years.\n  Senator Isakson, who was then a Member of the House, and myself, \nalong with our entire delegation, in a bipartisan fashion, came to our \nleadership in the House and to the leadership in the Senate and said, \nrather than doing this over 10 years following September 11, we need to \nconsolidate this to five years and let our scientists have the ability \nto do a better job in a first-class facility.\n  So we decided to go with a 5-year plan as opposed to a 10-year plan.\n\n  Each year, we have asked for $300 million to try to complete that \nplan. We have been successful for a number of years in getting $250 \nmillion.\n  I have to say that every year--the Senator from Oklahoma is right--\nthe budget that comes over from the President is very low because they \nknow we are going to plus-up that amount of money; we have done it \nevery year because we need the facilities. Every year we have had $250 \nmillion, beginning with fiscal year 2002. In 2002, 2003, 2004, and \n2005, we funded $250 million for CDC in Atlanta, to speed up this \nmaster plan. This year, because of the tight budget conditions that we \nare in, Senator Specter and Senator Harkin allocated $200 million \ninstead of $250 million for this master plan.\n  Let me respond very quickly to this Japanese garden issue. I will \ntell you what the Japanese garden is. In parts of Georgia, if you drill \na hole in the ground when building, you sometimes hit granite rock. In \nthis case, part of the area on the Roybal Campus where we are carrying \nout the master plan, there is rock under the surface. It was necessary \nto blast that rock out. When they blasted the rock out, instead of \nhauling that rock off, Dr. Gerberding said, Let's take that and develop \nan area for our employees to utilize during the day, to exercise, as \nSenator Harkin referred to, and go out and eat lunch. I guess what we \nhave out there is a gardedn of some sort that must have a Japanese \n``tinge'' to it, and that is why it is referred to as ``the Japanese \ngarden.'' It looked to me like a nice place where employees could go \nout in the open air and have lunch. I have seen them out there doing \nthis.\n\n[[Page S11880]]\n\n  I am going to let Senator Isakson address a couple of other specific \nitems that have been suggested as being somewhat wasteful spending. \nThey are hard-working, dedicated employees. If we are going to continue \nto recruit the very finest that the world has to offer, we ought to at \nleast be able to spend a little bit of money and take advantage of the \ncontours of the land to give them a nice place to go out and sit on \ntheir break and at lunchtime.\n  I sympathize with the Senator from Oklahoma when he says that we need \nto continue spending money on the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. We have \nresponded to that in the Congress. We have maintained a level amount of \nspending for CDC in Atlanta, for the completion of our master plan over \nthe last 5 years. The ADAP appropriations for 2001 was $589 million. In \n2002, that rose to $639 million; then $714 million; then $748 million; \nand in the 2005 appropriations, it was $793 million. In 2006, we expect \n$797.5 million.\n  It is not like we haven't been increasing the funding for ADAP. We \nhave, and we need to continue to do so, but not at the expense of \nproviding the most premier medical scientists and researchers in the \nworld with a facility within which to work.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Again, I say to Senator Specter and Senator Harkin that under their \nleadership, we do have the most premier medical research facility in \nthe world located in Atlanta, GA, today, and we need to continue to \nprovide the funding for this master plan, which we will now complete in \nanother couple of years. We should be able to continue to attract the \nvery finest and best that the world has to offer. We also need to \nensure that Americans are safe, when the avian flu presents a threat, \nthat our scientists are able to respond, as they are doing today, and \nthat they have the habitat within which to work, allowing them to do \nthe very best job they can do to protect Americans and to protect the \nworld from the health hazards that exist.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I associate myself entirely with the \nremarks of my colleague, the senior Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nChambliss.\n  I rise for two specific reasons. The first is to correct some \nstatements that have been made to be factual that are not and, second, \nto take issue with the contention that the amendment before us places \npeople before buildings.\n  Before I do either, however, I want to pay particular praise and \nattention to Senator Harkin and Senator Specter. My first visit ever to \nthe Senate was as a Member of Congress, shortly after my election, when \nI came to the offices of both these Senators, accompanied by Bernie \nMarcus, Oz Nelson, and other executives who led a private sector focus \non what we are discussing and debating today; that is, the fact that \nthe world's premier health care and disease prevention facility was \ncrumbling and in shambles.\n  These corporate leaders came to these two Senators and came to us, \nalong with Dr. Jeffrey Copeland, with a plan to remake and rebuild the \nCDC so that it could carry out the jobs of the 21st century in health \ncare.\n  Ironically, that visit was a year and half before September 11, 2001. \nBut fortunately, it was a year and half before that tragic day because \nall of the research that was done that helped us in the identification \nof the anthrax problem that we had was done right there in CDC, to deal \nwith monkeypox, to deal with avian flu, to deal with the West Nile \nvirus--all of these diseases we have, in part, been able to deal with, \nwith the new facilities built in this 5-year building program.\n  I commend Senators Harkin and Specter for their leadership and for \ntheir support.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment based entirely on the facts \nwhich have been presented which are not correct. I will deal with the \nfacts first.\n  The statement has been made on this floor that $200 million in \nconstruction money is sitting idle at the CDC. There is $200 million \nfor construction at CDC, which is absolutely essential to complete \nBuilding 23 and start Building 24, in addition to the $171 million that \nis included in this appropriation.\n  As Senator Specter said early on, contractors don't contract until \nall compensation for construction can be made. We did the seed-planting \nmoney in the previous appropriations bills in this Congress. Now it is \ntime build Building 23, which is the Infectious Disease Building.\n  It is incorrect to characterize money that is there today as being \nexcess funds. It is part of the cash flow that we have appropriated \nover a 5-year plan to complete this project.\n  Second, and most importantly, the statement was made that CDC had \nspent $60 million of the money on a welcome center.\n  I happen to know where that came from. That came from a newspaper \narticle in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, which was, on its face, \nabsolutely incorrect. The $60 million building is the Global \nCommunications Center, which was Building 19, which was the first thing \nwe completed to allow the United States of America and the CDC to be \nable to meet a pandemic, a terrorist attack, and communicate \nsimultaneously and seamlessly throughout the world to stop the death \nand destruction of Americans, as well the lives of human beings \nthroughout the world. It was an absolutely incorrect statement made in \nthe media. There is no welcome center, but there is a state-of-the-art \ncommunications center that allows us to instantly respond to the \nthreats we know only too well--whether it be threats of human beings \nlike those on September 11 who attacked us, or threats that lie await \nin poultry and birds in Asia that may materialize into an avian flu \nhuman-to-human transfer.\n\n  Both the statements of $200 million being on deposit or $60 million \nbeing spent on a welcome center are incorrect in the way they were \npresented. The money in this bill of $200 million for this 2006 budget \nis to provide $171 million to complete Building 23, which is the \ninfectious disease laboratory, another $21 million for Building No. 24, \nwhich will be one of the last buildings to go into place--this is the \nplanning and design money--and $7.5 million for maintenance of these \nfacilities.\n  Last, the characterization that this amendment is about putting \nbuildings before people's lives, with all due respect, there is a fact \nthat should be shared today. All decry AIDS, and I commend the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma for wanting to put $60 million in AIDS drugs for those \nwho cannot afford them, but to do so and claim that CDC spend this on a \nbuilding when they could be spending it on AIDS patients is a travesty.\n  This year, the CDC, on its own, will deploy, of its money and that of \nother governments and other resources around the world, over $1 billion \nin its prevention efforts for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or \nAIDS. There is no organization in the world that is more on the leading \nedge of the prevention of AIDS and its treatment than the Centers for \nDisease Control. In fact, to take this $60 million away from the \nbuilding laboratory that is designed for infectious disease study would \ndo more harm to patients with AIDS than would help to move it to drug \nprograms for patients with AIDS. It is an improper characterization and \nit is an improper prioritization of money that is appropriated.\n  As the Senator said in the beginning presentation of his amendment, \nthis does not save a dime of expenditure. It just moves some money \naround. There are some places we ought to do it. The distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma is right many times in his criticism and the \ncharacterizations he presents, but he is 100 percent dead wrong in \nterms of this amendment.\n  I respectfully submit the facts to the Senate, and I ask my \ncolleagues to reject the Coburn amendment on the CDC and continue our \ncommitment to the health care of the people around the world and the \nsafety and security of American citizens by continuing to fund the \nworld's premier health care, health prevention, and health resource \nfacility, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \nCoburn amendment be set aside and we proceed with another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The pending amendment is set aside.\n\n[[Page S11881]]\n\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2244\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and the distinguished ranking member for ceding me this time. \nI call up amendment No. 2244.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2244.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the production and mailing of a corrected \n                       Medicare and You handbook)\n\n       On page 156, line 2, strike ``Funds.'' and insert ``Funds: \n     Provided further, That the Secretary, by not later than \n     January 1, 2006, shall produce and mail a corrected version \n     of the annual notice required under section 1804(a) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395b-2(a)) to each \n     beneficiary described in the second sentence of such section, \n     together with an explanation of the error in the previous \n     annual notice that was mailed to such beneficiaries.''.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, recently the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services sent to 42 million Medicare beneficiaries this \nhandbook, ``Medicare & You,'' to describe a myriad of plans providing \nprescription drug coverage. There are an enormous number of plans in \nMinnesota--over 40 plans. I have tried to go through the book myself. I \nhave had my staff try to explain it to me. I think I am a reasonably \nintelligent American, but this is extremely complicated and it will be \nvery challenging to many Medicare beneficiaries. That is going to be \ncompounded by the fact that there is a very serious error in the tables \nthat will apply to 17 million Americans whose incomes are low enough \nthat they qualify for partial subsidy for their premiums.\n  The question in the column heading is ``If I qualify for extra help, \nwill my full premium be covered?''\n  Under every single plan, the answer is listed as ``yes.'' That is \nincorrect. Only about 40 percent of the plan offerings--those with \npremiums below the regional average--will be covered. The other 60 \npercent will be only covered up to that amount, and anything above that \nthe beneficiary has to pay, but that is incorrectly described here. Yet \nCMS refuses to correct the error by a subsequent mailing.\n  My amendment requires them to do so and would transfer such funds as \nnecessary from their administrative accounts so it is offset. It is \nessential to all beneficiaries and the integrity of the plan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2245\n\n  I ask that amendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 2245.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2245.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To fully fund the Federal Government's share of the costs \n    under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __. In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there is appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an additional \n     $12,375,000,000 for carrying out part B of the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.), in \n     order to fully fund the Federal Government's share of the \n     costs under such part.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. This amendment increases the Federal funding for IDEA, \nspecial education, to what was promised 28 years ago, 40 percent of the \ncost of State and local governments.\n  I can only speak for my State, but that money would be desperately \nneeded and very well used. It would amount to about $250 million in \nadditional Federal funding for K-12 education for my State to keep the \npromise that has been broken. It has cost about $12 billion above what \nhas been committed so far.\n  I recognize the distinguished chairman and ranking member have made \nthis a priority and have increased funding, and we have made some \nprogress in the last few years. But we are still less than 20 percent--\nless than half--of the commitment for special education made almost \nthree decades ago.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2289\n\n  Finally, I ask that amendment be set aside, and I call up amendment \nNo. 2289.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. DAYTON] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2289.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for disabled voter access services under \n                   the Help America Vote Act of 2002)\n\n       On page 178, after line 25, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___. (a) In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $15,121,000 for \n     activities authorized by the Help America Vote Act of 2002, \n     of which $10,000,000 shall be for payments to States to \n     promote access for voters with disabilities, and of which \n     $5,121,000 shall be for payments to States for protection and \n     advocacy systems for voters with disabilities.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     amounts made available under this title for the \n     administration and related expenses shall be reduced by \n     $15,121,000 from other services.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. This amendment provides additional funding to State \ngovernments and agencies involved with Americans with disabilities to \nallow them access to vote. The Help America Vote Act of 2003--landmark \nlegislation, bipartisan legislation--unfortunately, has not been funded \nto the level necessary to help States and local governments comply with \nthis requirement. This is a modest amount, $15 million, offset by the \nincrease in the administrative costs, so it would result in a reduction \nfor administration but would be money we committed that has not been \nforthcoming.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2239\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2239.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2239.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for the purchase of rapid oral HIV tests)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     use amounts appropriated under title II for the purchase of \n     not less than 1,000,000 rapid oral HIV tests.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is an amendment that is to instruct the Department \nof Health and Human Services to purchase of no less than 1 million \nrapid oral HIV tests.\n  As we all know, the problem of HIV and the spread of HIV continues to \nbe a problem. Experts tell us that over half of all new HIV cases are \nas a result of someone who was unaware of their HIV status. The idea is \nhaving better testing out there, along with oral testing where it does \nnot require any drawing of blood or needles--obviously, for a lot of \nfolks that is a concern. This provides a safe effective way to be able \nto get these results in a timely fashion to give people the notice they \nneed before they engage in an activity that might cause the further \nspread of the HIV virus.\n  I understand from my colleague from Pennsylvania, this is an \namendment he is willing to accept. If there is no discussion, I urge \nagreement of the amendment.\n\n[[Page S11882]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment as outlined by my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania provides for 1 million HIV oral rapid tests. The \nfunds are provided for within the amounts already in the bill. These \ntests are essential. He correctly states my agreement and acquiescence. \nI join my colleague in urging agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2239) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2241\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a commission, a bipartisan \nbicameral commission, that will be set up as a result of this amendment \nthat would undertake a comprehensive and thoughtful review of Federal \nsocial service programs and make recommendations that would be \nappropriate to provide beneficiaries more choice in how they receive \ntheir social services that are paid for from the Federal Government.\n  One of the things I hear as I work in communities that heavily rely \non social services, a lot of places where they would like to get social \nservices--community-based organizations, in some cases faith-based \norganizations--are not able. They either do not qualify for Federal \nfunds or do not have the technical expertise to get Federal funds. The \nPresident has put forward a faith-based initiative. The Congress has \npassed charitable choice legislation. We have done a lot to try to get \nmore providers in social services involved, and even in some areas \nprovide more flexibility--such as vouchers for certain services that \nare out there so people can take that voucher and get the services from \nqualified places.\n  There is still a level of frustration out in the community. I think \nwe need to do a more comprehensive job in\n\n[[Page S11883]]\n\nlooking at how we address the issue of giving people choices as to how \nthey get their social services. I think this is a way to bring some of \nthe best minds that we have into the social service delivery area, \nfolks from both the House and the Senate and the White House, \nappointees, to sit down and look to see, is there a better mousetrap \nthan the current system of social service delivery? Is there a better \nway for us to restructure some of these programs to give more efficient \nand effective services at less cost and with more consumer buy-in and \nchoice?\n  One of the reasons some of our social services plans do not work very \nwell is people do not interface well with the delivery systems in place \nright now. This commission would be tasked to determine how we can, in \nfact, remove some of these barriers to folks who do not access the \nsocial services systems.\n  One of the big problems we have continually with a lot of our \nprograms--whether it is health programs, housing programs, \nrehabilitation programs, or other programs--is we have large segments \nof the community that simply do not participate. They may be eligible \nfor services, but they do not participate in the services. So we have \nto figure out: How do we better reach these people? How do we better \nmake these services available in such a way that we can actually start \nreaching people in how they live their lives and in a way that meets \ntheir needs?\n  As far as the money for this commission, I have asked that it be such \nsums as may be determined by the committee. Hopefully, they will \nallocate such resources they have available to stand up this \ncommission. But, to me, it is important we get better utilization. For \nmy mind, just giving more money to the different Departments to figure \nout ways to advertise or to do things to bump up their enrollment in \nsome of these programs has been tried in the past, and it basically \ndoes not work very well. I think we need to at least have some of our \nbest minds look at this together, as to how we could redesign this \nsystem and get recommendations given to the Congress as to how we can \ndo a better job providing services.\n  With that, Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my colleague and I were just discussing \nthe amendment. I believe it is acceptable.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is the first time I have seen this \namendment. This is setting up a congressional commission on expanding \nsocial service delivery options. I have no problem with that.\n  But the way it is spelled out and everything, I would ask the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, the author of the amendment, has this been brought \nup before the authorizing committee? Has there been any hearing on \nthis? Has there ever been a hearing on this, or has the authorizing \ncommittee acted on this at all? This is authorization on an \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we have discussed it with the members of the Finance \nCommittee which, as you know, I am a member of. To my knowledge, I am \nnot aware of any objection on the part of the Finance Committee as to \nthis particular provision. I will be offering a couple other amendments \npromptly which are under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee \nwhich they do object to, which I will just offer and withdraw. But to \nmy knowledge, they have not objected to this particular amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I thank the Senator. I personally do not have any \nproblem with it, but this is something I think--I always have a little \nquestion when any Senator, on this side of the aisle or that side, \nanywhere, has a pretty thick amendment that involves commissions and \nhow you select commissions and what they do.\n  I have not even had a chance to read this amendment. I don't even \nknow what is in it.\n  Again, I ask my friend from Pennsylvania, has this amendment, in its \npresent form, been submitted to either the Finance Committee or the \nHELP Committee? They probably share jurisdiction there. Have they \nlooked at it to see if there are any objections to this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, to my knowledge, we filed the amendment. \nMy staff has discussed it, I know, with the Finance Committee. I do not \nknow about any other committees. This is not a bill I introduced and \nhas gone to committee. This is something I have brought up on this \nbill.\n  So to answer your question, I think, as directly as I can, no, we \nhave not filed this with the Finance Committee as a bill to have them \nreview it as a bill in committee, if that is your question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from \nPennsylvania--well, you have offered the amendment. That is fine. The \namendment is at the desk. I wonder if we might put off voting on this \namendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to have the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, and perhaps the HELP Committee because it \nperhaps crosses both--to have them at least take a look at it. If it is \nfine, then I do not care.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, am I correct, has the Senator from \nPennsylvania laid down the amendment? Is the amendment at the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, if \nthis can be given to the chairs and ranking members of those \ncommittees, to have them look at it, and if it is fine, then I have no \nobjection. As I said, I have not had a chance to look at it, and it is \nnot in my jurisdiction at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I perfectly understand what the concerns \nare of the Senator from Iowa and would be happy to work with him over \nthe next several hours to get that amendment cleared.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2237\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 2237 be called up and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments have been set aside. \nThe clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2237.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, October 25, 2005, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. The next two amendments I am \ngoing to be talking about are amendments that I have offered and on \nwhich I want to have a discussion. They are in the subject area of this \nappropriations bill, but they are provisions that, as my colleague from \nPennsylvania advised me, rightfully belong as amendments to a welfare \nbill.\n  But as Members of this Chamber know, we have not had the privilege in \nthe Senate of having a welfare bill come across this floor, even though \nthe welfare bill of 1996 expired a couple of years ago. We have passed \nextension after extension. As a result of that, the work requirements \nin the welfare reform bill of 1996--which have been so effective in \ntransforming the lives of millions of Americans who were trapped in the \nwelfare system--those work requirements in most States have gone away \nbecause the requirements only required that 50 percent of the caseload, \nat the time of the passage of the bill, had to be working.\n  Well, we reduced the caseload more than 50 percent, therefore the \nwork requirements went away for the caseload\n\n[[Page S11884]]\n\nthat is remaining. So many States have begun to sort of go back to the \npre-1996 provision of welfare. It is easier for States to do that. Work \nprograms cost money to the States. Other initiatives to try to help \npeople get out of poverty, they cost money. So if you do not have to \nspend that money as a State, if you can just simply continue to pay out \nthe money and not have to provide all these other services, it is a lot \ncheaper for States to do. In fact, that is what States did for years \nupon years upon years, as the welfare rolls grew.\n  There is still a time limit, so that is a good thing. That causes a \nlot of people, in spite of the lack of effort in many cases by States, \nto move themselves off of welfare because of the limits on the ability \nto get relief. But I believe we can do better. So I have many times \ncome to the floor of the Senate and asked for consideration of the \nbill, asked for a specific number of amendments, and, candidly, we have \nhad objections from both sides of the aisle. I think that is \nunfortunate.\n  So as a result, I have brought forward amendments to this bill on two \nprograms that I think are vitally important in the next step on \nwelfare. We did a great job in the welfare reform bill of 1996 in \nproviding an economic path to recovery for millions of Americans, in \nproviding incentives to work. We made work pay more than staying on \nwelfare. In many cases prior to that, that was not the case.\n  We also did a lot in providing strict time limits and giving States \nvery tough provisions to require work as a way of getting people out of \npoverty, instead of simply just allowing them to be maintained in \npoverty. It gave them a requirement that a certain percentage of the \ncaseload had to be at work. That is all for the good. We saw the rate \nof poverty from 1996 to the year 2001--until we had, unfortunately, a \nrecession in this country--we saw the rate of poverty go down, and go \ndown dramatically.\n  One of the greatest indicators is poverty among African-American \nchildren. Poverty among African-American children, in the year 2001, \nwas the lowest ever recorded--lowest ever recorded--and was a dramatic \ndecline from one of the highest rates ever recorded, which was in the \nmid-1990s. So you can point directly to this act as a way of helping to \nalleviate poverty.\n  But I think what we have found since 1996, yes, we have had economic \nsuccesses, but still there are people struggling at the margins of \nsociety. One of the reasons that is the case is, even though we now \nhave moms who have gotten jobs--and it was predominantly moms who were \non welfare--what they have not gotten is families brought back \ntogether. What we have not seen is an increase in the amount of family \nunification, moms and dads coming together and marrying and raising \nchildren in poor communities.\n  In fact, the rate of out-of-wedlock births has not changed \nsubstantially at all in most of these communities. The amount of \nfatherlessness in these communities continues to be of epidemic \nproportions. And we now have folks on the left and the right writing \nabout this. This is no longer just a conservative cabal when we talk \nabout family unification; families, mothers and fathers raising \nchildren. Now even those on the left have said there is no longer an \nargument. Children raised in healthy, stable, two-parent married \nfamilies do better.\n  It should be a social policy to encourage those kinds of \nrelationships for the benefit of children, for the benefit of mothers, \nfor the benefit of fathers, for the benefit of neighborhoods, for the \nbenefit of the country. Yet when it comes to that here in Washington, \nDC, when it comes to public policy that helps build those strong \nrelationships, that helps nurture and foster those relationships of \nmarriage and fathers taking responsibility for their children, the \nGovernment stands in absolute neutrality.\n  We do nothing to promote stable marriages. We do nothing, other than \nattach fathers' wages and get child support and establish paternity. We \ndo nothing to help nurture and bring fathers back into the lives of \ntheir children and into productive and healthy relationships with the \nmother of their children.\n  What I have suggested, in both amendment No. 2237 and No. 2238, are \ntwo initiatives that are better placed and will be placed and will be \ndebated in full on the welfare bill. One is a healthy marriage \ninitiative. The second is a fatherhood initiative. Both would provide \nfunding.\n  Let's review some of the statistics of the impact of marriage. This \nwas done by the Brookings Institution. Those on the other side of the \naisle will know that the Brookings Institution is not often cited on \nthe Republican side of the aisle. It shows you that the debate is over. \nThere is no debate anymore about the impact of marriage and the impact \nof having fathers involved in their children's lives. I talked about \nthe effectiveness of five factors in reducing poverty rates. We hear a \nlot of talk on both sides of the aisle--unfortunately, more on the \nother side of the aisle--about reducing poverty. Hopefully, that will \nchange soon.\n  In 1992, we did what was, in fact, the most effective thing in \nreducing poverty, this study found. The most effective thing was not to \ndouble cash welfare payments. Some on the other side of the aisle have \nsuggested that all we need to do is pay people more from the \nGovernment. If we give them more, they will get out of poverty. Wrong. \nThat doesn't work. In fact, the percentage reduction in poverty rates, \nif we doubled cash welfare, would only decrease the poverty rate by 8 \npercent.\n  What did work? Full-time work. Full-time work decreases the poverty \nrate by 42 percent. We have done that. We have required work, not full-\ntime work, but we require 20 hours. The bill that is being proposed, \nthat we have yet to bring to the floor, requires 24 hours. But we have \nrequired work, and it is working to take people out of poverty.\n  What is the next biggest factor in reducing poverty? Again, according \nto the Brookings Institution report, an increase in marriage. We did \nsomething to require work. Many States have more generous welfare \nbenefits than what is prescribed by the Federal Government. In fact, I \nknow there is some money out there for healthy marriages, but very few \nStates and very little Federal money goes to do anything about helping \nto improve the health of marriage among the poor. It is vitally \nimportant that we recognize that there is a direct social-policy, \nsocial-service-community, child-mother-father benefit for encouraging \nhealthy marriages. The Federal Government doesn't spend a penny. This \nCongress has not spent a penny on something we know could reduce \npoverty by 27 percent and, more importantly, provide more stability in \nthe lives of children, reduce domestic violence, and improve the lives \nof millions in communities across America. We will not spend a penny \nthis year. That is why I offered the amendment, because I want to spend \nmore than a few pennies, because we know it has an impact.\n  What impact does it have? Let's look at the benefits of marriage for \nchildren: better school performance and less dropouts; fewer emotional \nand behavioral problems; less substance abuse; less abuse or neglect; \nless criminal activity; less early sexual activity and fewer out-of-\nwedlock births. I am not too sure I know anybody who doesn't think all \nof those things are good. The Federal Government doesn't spend a penny.\n  Think of all the things we spend money on in Washington. One of the \nthings you hear most when you go back home is all the waste, fraud, all \nthe money we throw at projects for which people have no rhyme or reason \nas to why we spend the money. Yet here is something that we know will \nhelp children, mothers, fathers, neighborhoods, will build on a \nstronger America, and we don't spend one red cent.\n  You might ask the question: Why is that, Senator? Why don't we spend \nany money on this? Let me tell you what some of my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee have said. The response was: Well, who are we to \nimpose our values on other folks; who are we to suggest that marriage \nis something the Federal Government should be concerned with; that is a \nprivate matter.\n  Is this a private matter? Is less substance abuse a private matter? \nIs less abuse and neglect a private matter? Is less criminal activity a \nprivate matter? This isn't a private matter. We are talking about \npolicies that have a direct impact on the health and safety of \nchildren. It is not a private matter. Supporting healthy marriages is a \npublic good. If you think about all the\n\n[[Page S11885]]\n\nother things we spend money on, I can't imagine anything that would be \na more valuable expenditure than to provide more stable families for \nchildren growing up in poor neighborhoods.\n  The second amendment is an offshoot of the first. That is to try to \nbring fathers who have children out of wedlock back and get them \ninvolved in their children's lives--not necessarily to marry, but to \nhave them involved. I was at a conference within the last year where \nJason DeParle, a writer from the New York Times, was giving a talk. He \nwas talking about a book he had written, following three women in \nMilwaukee, WI, post welfare reform of 1996. He wrote about many things, \nabout how welfare reform is working in some ways and not in others. One \nway he talked about where it wasn't working was with regard to fathers. \nThere was a question from the crowd about who these dads are. We are \nnot talking about the best neighborhoods in America when it comes to \ncrime, wealth. We are talking about a lot of dads who, yes, were or \neven are incarcerated, were or still are dealing with addiction, \ndealing with unemployment, dealing with a whole host of other maladies \nthat affect large segments of our population.\n\n  The question was: Do we want these dads involved in the lives of \nthese children? I thought that was a bold question. Jason's answer was, \nin a word--I won't quote him, because I didn't write it down--well, \nthey may not be the best role models of dads, but they are still their \ndads. These children, like all of us children, want to be loved by \ntheir dads. They need that love, as imperfect as it is. As a dad, I \nknow how imperfect it can be. We all do. But it is still your dad.\n  These programs are not perfect. We are not bringing ``Father Knows \nBest'' Robert Young dads back into the home. We understand that. But \nthese children still long for their dad. Do we have a Federal program \nthat helps bring dads back into the home? Do we spend any Federal \ndollars to help reunite fathers with their children, in spite of all \nthe benefits that we know about two parents? No, we don't. We will \nspend more money on daycare, billions more on daycare. We will spend \nmore money on afterschool programs, Head Start Programs, early \nprograms, late programs, noon programs. We will spend all sorts of \nmoney on Government programs. But will we spend a penny to help reunite \na father with his children? No. Who are we to impose our values, is the \nline I hear.\n  Did anyone ever ask a kid whether he wants his dad back? What kind of \nvalue is that? We need to start thinking about how important it is for \nyoung children growing up in a hostile world in poor neighborhoods in \nAmerica to have a shot to be with their dad and to start funding those \ngroups who are out there--and there are hundreds across America who are \nworking hard every day on a shoestring--to help dads be a dad.\n  I can't offer this amendment because it is authorizing on an \nappropriations bill. We aren't going to get a welfare bill, so kids \nacross America are going to have to wait a little longer while Congress \ndecides whether we want to take the time to help find their dad. \nHopefully we can find the time sometime soon. The kids are waiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2291\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

It has been cleared by Senator \nHarkin. I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2291.\n  The amendment (No. 2291) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2260\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2260.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this deals \nwith immigration. On that immigration committee, I am sure others have \nhad an opportunity to see it. I wonder if the Senator could just let me \nhave a few minutes to look at it prior to making that request.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have been advised by staff that this \nhas been signed off by the Senator from Massachusetts as well as \nothers. But of course, if he would like a chance to review it--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am sure I will not object, but just the way it was \ndescribed, I didn't understand it the way it had been explained to me. \nIf the chairman would extend that opportunity, I would appreciate it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2268\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is my intention now that I would speak for 15 minutes, \nat which time I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield the floor \nand Senator Kennedy be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, earlier today, on behalf of myself, \nSenators Kennedy, Reid, Durbin, Obama, Bayh, Kohl, Mikulski, Clinton, \nJohnson, Dayton, and Byrd, I laid down an amendment dealing with \npreparing this country for an avian flu pandemic. The amendment that we \nlaid down today and that we will be voting on tomorrow will allow the \nUnited States to dramatically step up preparation for an avian flu \npandemic.\n  Last month, I offered and the Senate approved an amendment to the \nDefense appropriations bill that provided $3.9 billion for preparation \nfor such a pandemic. At that time, there was some discussion as to why \nwe were putting it on the Defense bill; it should go on the Labor-\nHealth and Human Services bill. At that time, we didn't even know if we \nwould have this bill up.\n  Well, the bill is in the Chamber, and this amendment appropriately \nbelongs on this legislative vehicle in our jurisdiction. So the \namendment that was laid down that I offered earlier today is \nessentially a more robust version of that earlier amendment again based \non more and better information we have obtained since that time.\n  There is a broad consensus in the scientific community as to the \nsteps we need to take to get ready for a potential pandemic. Reflecting \nthat scientific consensus, the amendment we have laid down will do four \nbroad things.\n  First, as our first line of defense, it will dramatically step up \ninternational surveillance of avian flu outbreaks overseas.\n  Second, it will ramp up our vaccine production infrastructure here in \nthe United States.\n  Third, it will give us the resources to build up stockpiles of \nvaccines that are currently believed to be effective against the flu as \nwell as building up stockpiles of antiviral medications.\n  Fourth, it will strengthen our public health infrastructure at the \nFederal, State, and local level, which today is simply not equipped to \ncope with a major pandemic.\n  Some have suggested that we be patient, that we wait for the \nadministration to put forward a plan to fight avian flu, but we have \nalready waited\n\n[[Page S11887]]\n\ntoo long as a nation. We have been warned now for almost 8 years to get \nready.\n  We had been warned about a lot of other things. We were warned for \nyears that the levees in New Orleans would fail in the case of a major \nhurricane. Yet the Federal Government did not do anything. And the \nFederal Government has not come forward with any action plan now \nregarding the avian flu pandemic possibility. Even within the last \nyear, as the threat of this pandemic becomes more urgent and immediate, \nthere still is no plan.\n  So today, with the alarm bells ringing at full volume, we in Congress \ncannot in good conscience wait any longer. We need to act. If the \nadministration offers a plan at a later date, that is fine. We will \nalmost certainly include the basic elements encompassed here. We are \nall talking to the same people, whether it is the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention or NIH or the major drug companies. We \nknow what we have to do. So if we take action now in this \nappropriations bill with the amendment we have offered, then we will \nhave already passed an appropriation, we will not have lost any time, \nand we will be able to go forward as rapidly as possible.\n\n  There is no question the United States right now is woefully \nunprepared for a major outbreak of human-to-human transmitted avian \nflu. We have already had two disasters. We had 9/11, we had Katrina, we \nwere unprepared for both despite clear warnings that we had.\n  Similarly, we have been warned in no uncertain terms about avian flu, \nbut our preparations are inadequate. As many of my colleagues know, \navian flu, or H5N1 as it is called in the scientific community, has \npassed from bird to bird. What started in a small area of Southeast \nAsia has now extended we know to as far away as Greece, Turkey, and \nRomania. Recently, one bird in Great Britain died and was examined and \nfound to have H5N1. We know that the avian flu has been detected in \nIndonesia and in Japan and in the Philippines, in China, in Russia. It \nis only a matter of time before these migratory birds cross paths and \nthe avian flu is now in Canada and the United States and South and \nCentral America.\n  This is a virulent form of flu. One hundred percent of the birds, the \nchickens and the birds that have gotten this have died, 100 percent. \nFifty percent of the humans who have come down with avian flu have \ndied. Now, thus far we only know of one case, one certified case where \nthe flu virus has gone from a human to a human. Only one case. But that \nhas warned us that it is capable of doing so.\n  Now, it is not sustained, it is not widespread, but scientists tell \nus it is only a matter of time. And we do not know how much time we \nhave. We know as we say it has killed 50 percent of the individuals it \ninfected. A nightmare scenario, a kind of 21st century Black Death is \nnot difficult to picture. Indeed, most experts say it is not a matter \nof if but when. So we have to ask some tough questions now: Where do \nour preparedness efforts stand? Can we do better?\n  First, look at global surveillance. The Centers for Disease Control \nis doing a great job working in concert with the World Health \nOrganization and governments in affected regions to detect the disease \nand help stop its spread. This is our first line of defense--\nsurveillance and quarantine in the area in which it occurs. The sooner \nwe can identify it and quarantine it, the better off we will be. To put \nit in other terms, better to find H5N1 over there than home.\n  The good news is we have experience. The Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention kept SARS from coming to the United States with this \nprocedure. But we do not have adequate personnel, we do not have the \nresources in place in other countries to make sure that we detect as \nrapidly as possible an outbreak of avian flu. We can and we must do \nbetter to protect our people.\n  Second, the status of our capacity to produce vaccines in the United \nStates, unfortunately, is all bad news. It is astonishing when we tell \npeople we only have one plant in America capable of producing flu \nvaccines. And that plant uses an egg-based technology. Right now, in \nthe event of a worldwide pandemic, the United States would have to rely \non imported vaccines, vaccines that other countries might not be \nwilling to send to us. After all, the first responsibility of any \ngovernment is to protect its own people, and if this pandemic starts, \nevery government is going to want to protect its own people first. So \nwe are vulnerable. We are playing catchup ball. We need to help private \nindustry develop more vaccine manufacturing capacity, and we need to do \nit in a way in which we can produce enough vaccine rapidly to deal with \na major outbreak.\n  Some say it would take many years to produce a non-egg-based, cell-\nbased production capacity. I don't accept that. This is a matter of \nincredible urgency. We have to do better, and we can do better. Our \ngoal should be to have research and production capacity to isolate a \nvirus, convert it to a vaccine, produce enough vaccine for nearly 300 \nmillion Americans, and do it within 6 to 9 months. Right now we are a \nlong way from reaching that goal. This amendment we have offered will \nput the money forward to get that process moving rapidly to develop \ncell-based technology for the production--the rapid production--of \nvaccines in this country.\n\n  Third, as I mentioned, we need an aggressive program of purchasing \nand stockpiling vaccines and antivirals. Unfortunately, the United \nStates is way behind. I am indebted to Senator Kennedy for producing \nthis chart. I want to show it here. The World Health Organization a few \nyears ago suggested that countries stockpile at least 25 percent \nantivirals to cover their population. Look what some other countries \ndid: Australia, 20 percent; Britain, 25 percent; France, 25 percent; \nJapan, 17 percent; the United States, 1 percent. We only have enough \nantivirals to cover 1 percent of our people. It is unconscionable. So \nwe need to play catchup ball here also. We need to stockpile--and that \nis what this amendment will do--to provide the funds to begin to ramp \nup the production of these antivirals.\n  Roche is a drug company. I met with them. They publicly announced--\nthey hold the patent; they produce most of it overseas--they are \nwilling now to let other generic companies produce this under license \nto them.\n  We need to get the money out there right now to buy them from those \ncompanies so they can start producing the antivirals now. Not next \nyear; now. That is what this amendment provides.\n  Fourth, and last, public health infrastructure. Right now our public \nhealth infrastructure is simply not capable of dealing with either a \nbird flu pandemic or even an act of bioterrorism. Even if we had an \nadequate stock of vaccines or antivirals, what good does it do if we \ndon't have the public health infrastructure to identify, isolate, and \ndeliver the antivirals and the vaccines?\n  Again, the President's budget this year cut $120 million from State \npublic health agencies. This amendment does not just restore that. We \nneed to do a lot more than that. We need to make major new investments. \nWe need to hire more public health professionals--epidemiologists, \nphysicians, lab technicians, and others.\n  We also need to dramatically increase the surge capacity of \nhospitals. As Dr. Rick Blum, the president of the American College of \nEmergency Room Physicians, recently said:\n\n       We've pumped billions of dollars into preparedness since 9/\n     11, but virtually none of that has gone to the one place \n     where we know 80 percent of patients go first.\n\n  The emergency room--if we have an avian flu pandemic, that is where \npeople will go. And most victims of avian flu might need ventilators to \nhelp them breathe. Right now there are only 105,000 ventilators in the \nentire United States, and three-quarters of them are in use on any \ngiven day.\n  We have our work cut out for us. We face enormous technical and \nlogistical challenges, and there is no time to waste. The time for \nplanning and planning and planning and planning is over. It is now time \nto act. This amendment would provide, as I said, nearly $8 billion for \na comprehensive national effort to prepare our people for an avian flu \npandemic. I know that sounds like a lot of money, but keep in mind, it \nis less than 2 months of our expenditures on the war in Iraq. When this \navian flu pandemic--I don't say if; when. Scientists tell us it is not \na question of if, it is a question of when. When it hits, we have to be \nready to protect our people. That is what this amendment does.\n\n[[Page S11888]]\n\n  Again, I hope as we move forward we can get this amendment adopted \nand get the money out there. It does not have to be spent now. It is at \nthe Secretary's discretion, but at least it is there and they can move \non it rapidly to do what we all know is necessary to protect our people \nin this country.\n  I have used my 15 minutes. I want to reserve 15 minutes for Senator \nKennedy.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may be recognized very briefly. I \nknow the remainder of the time is reserved for Senator Kennedy. We are \n16 minutes away from 4:05 p.m.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to make a comment or two. I \ncommend the Senator from Iowa for his foresight on moving ahead on the \npandemic issue. He and I have been discussing it for several days. I \nthink it is difficult to proceed without knowing what the \nadministration's plans are.\n  As the Senator from Iowa correctly notes, action has to be taken. \nWhen the administration decides on a plan and picks a figure, there is \ngoing to have to be congressional action, and we are nearing the end of \nthis session. A supplemental or an emergency appropriations bill is \nalways difficult to structure. So there are sound reasons to take a \nlook at it now and make some judgment.\n  We have been in touch with the White House on a number of occasions \nto try to find out what the position is of the administration. So far \nthey are unprepared to give us an answer. We are working to see if it \nis possible to structure an appropriation, subject to the Secretary's \ndiscretion, and how it will be in consultation and would be an \nemergency. There is no doubt there ought to be planning now for this \nemergency.\n  What the proper figure is I don't know. That is a figure that would \nbe more within the scope of understanding, knowledge, and projection of \nthe administration, and the experts at CDC and NIH.\n  I wanted to make those few comments. We are going to carry this over \nuntil tomorrow. I know the administration will be aware of what is \nhappening on the floor today, and perhaps that will motivate them or \nenable them to come forward to help us grapple with this issue and find \nsome realistic and practical solution at this time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate my chairman's remarks. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask if the Chair will be good enough to let me know \nwhen I have 3 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n\n\n                            Wage Protections\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President a few moments ago, as I understand, the \nPresident of the United States reversed his course on the incredibly \ndamaging decision to suspend wage protections for workers rebuilding \nthe Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, known as the Davis-Bacon \nprovisions. These are the prevailing wage provisions, the age-old \npolicy that the Government should not drive wages below the prevailing \nwage in a particular community.\n  The prevailing wage for construction is $8 in Mississippi, $9 in \nAlabama, and $10 in Louisiana. That would work out to $16,000, $18,000, \n$21,000 a year as the prevailing wage. That's not too much for workers \nwho are trying to rebuild their homes and rebuild their lives.\n  I applaud the decision the President has made on that issue.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2283, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before speaking on the current Harkin \namendment, which I strongly support for the reasons I will outline, I \nwant the Senate to know that our HELP Committee, under the chairmanship \nof Senator Enzi, and the subcommittee, under the chairmanship of \nSenator Burr, has been working on this issue, but from a different \nangle.\n  Right now we need appropriations, which are included in the Harkin \namendment. And we will also consider--hopefully favorably--the Burr-\nEnzi legislation, which deals with a range of issues involving patent, \ncompensation, and liability issues that are all related to encouraging \ncompanies to enter the market.\n  These are different approaches, and each is enormously important in \nits own way. I thank the chairman of my committee, Senator Enzi, who \nalways is tireless in his courtesies and his outreach to the members of \nthe committee on his side as well as ours, and to Senator Burr for \nworking with us. I am very hopeful that if we can schedule and pass \nthat legislation, and get this appropriation included today, we will, I \nbelieve, have the best of all worlds.\n  Looking at this issue globally, there are various components. We have \nthe resource aspect of it, we have the public health aspect of it, and \nthen the aspect that is related to providing incentives for the private \nsector. Hopefully, we will deal with all of those before the end of the \nterm.\n  I believe strongly, as Senator Harkin pointed out, that we must take \naction now on this legislation, to ensure that we'll have sufficient \nresources to deal with the purchasing aspects and also the limited, but \nextremely important, public health provisions which are included in \nthis legislation.\n  One provision provides for the global detection of this pandemic, as \nwell as domestic detection, should it come to the United States. It \nalso provides the resources to contain and respond to the danger by \nimproving surge capacity, and developing an overall plan so we are able \nto effectively deal with this issue.\n  We have been on notice for years. This chart is going to be difficult \nto read for those viewing: ``The U.S. missed the warning signs of the \nflu pandemic.'' In 1992, the Institute of Medicine pointed out:\n\n       Policymakers must realize and understand the potential \n     magnitude of an influenza pandemic.\n\n  This is when we began to detect the dangerous indicators of this \npandemic:\n  In 1997, there was an outbreak in Hong Kong.\n  In November 2000:\n\n       Federal and State influenza plans do not address the key \n     issues surrounding the purchase and distribution of vaccines \n     and antivirals.\n\n  This comes from a GAO report which found that very few States have \nmade the kind of downpayment that is required to protect individuals \nfrom this pandemic.\n  Again, in May 2002, according to the World Health:\n\n       Authorities must understand the potential impact and threat \n     of pandemic influenza.\n\n  Then in December of 2003, there was an outbreak in South Korea.\n  In January 2004, there was an outbreak in Vietnam.\n  The reason the World Health Organization and the European Union have \nbeen so concerned about this is because of the danger of this \nparticular flu strain.\n  This chart indicates the death rate from this flu strain. In \nCambodia, it has been 100 percent; in Thailand, 71 percent; in Vietnam, \n44 percent; an overall average of 50 percent. We are talking about \ndozens of cases, not hundreds, not thousands, not millions. But if this \nstrain mutates and easily spreads human-to-human, we are talking about \npotentially a great threat.\n  I know the Senator from Iowa, myself, Senator Reid, our leader, \nSenator Obama, and Senator Durbin are frustrated about this issue.\n  This is a General Accounting Office report that was published in \nOctober 2000, ``Influenza Pandemic. Plan needed for Federal and State \nresponse.''\n  The General Accounting Office reviewed what the needs were and \nsuggested to Congress and the Administration that we respond. Five \nyears later, we are finally getting some action on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  In this chart, we can see what has happened in other countries. In \ncomparison, the U.S. stockpile of antiviral medicine is inadequate. \nSenator Harkin pointed out what other nations have done. This is a \nsample: Australia has antiviral medicine for 20 percent of its \npopulation; Britain, 25 percent; France, 25 percent; Japan, 17 percent; \nand the United States, we only cover 1 percent of our population.\n  We are faced with whether we should take action or not take action.\n  This is a list of the various countries that have developed \nnationwide plans: Japan, October 1997; Canada, February 2004; Czech \nRepublic, 2004; Hong Kong, 2005; Britain in March of 2005.\n  I point out the British plan, I am not going to include it in the \nRecord, but\n\n[[Page S11889]]\n\nI will include it by reference. It is some 95 pages long. It sets the \nscene and provides the overall framework for the UK's response to an \ninfluenza pandemic. It is based on the current advice for national \npandemic plans from the World Health Organization. The response is \ndivided into phases, starting with work to be done before a potential \npandemic emerges, followed by a step-by-step escalating response to the \npandemic.\n  The plan goes on:\n\n       Advanced planning is essential to establish and rehearse \n     contingency arrangements and identify and address gaps in our \n     preparedness so we are in the best possible position to \n     manage the emergency and to ameliorate its impact.\n\n  On page 5, it talks about the various aspects of the plans: \ncommunication, surveillance, information gathering, the public health \nresponse, measures to reduce the health impact, vaccination, health \nservice response, civil contingency, workforce education and training, \nessential preparatory work. All of this outlined in the UK, in Great \nBritain.\n  Here is Canada's plan. It is 87 pages long. What does this plan \naddress? This is what they have: Who is responsible for the pandemic \nplanning? It lists those in charge. Why is this an important health \nissue? It outlines why it is a health issue. What preparations are \nbeing made? It outlines all of the preparations that are being made. \nWhat needs to happen in a comprehensive response? It outlines all of \nthose. What will be involved in a recovery from a pandemic? It has an \nentire section, all outlined here.\n  Where is the United States? Where is our response? The USA is the big \nquestion mark, and that is what we find unacceptable. That is why the \nHarkin amendment is important to adopt. It has provisions dealing with \nantivirals and vaccines; it has the needed global interventions; and it \nhas the detection needed here in the United States. It has the surge \ncapacity and public health provisions that need to be expanded. Senator \nBurr indicated that hearings on public health provisions will take \nplace after we pass this legislation, which is all well and good. But \nwe need to act now.\n  Each country with a national plan includes important public health \ncomponents. We would not be meeting our responsibilities unless we did \nlikewise.\n  This proposal recognizes that we have a responsibility to move \nforward on this and provides the resources necessary to get started. \nThis particular proposal works to fulfill the recommendations of the \nWorld Health Organization, with $3 billion for antivirals and $3 \nbillion in vaccines. There is flexibility in these allocations and in \nthe allocations for the public health provisions.\n  So I would hope very much that the Senate would accept this. It is a \nmodest downpayment. As I mentioned, there are several aspects of the \nbattle. One certainly is the stockpiling of the vaccines and \nantivirals. It is enormously important that the resources are there. A \ndownpayment in terms of the public health is also very important. And \nwe must provide incentives for industry to encourage vaccine \ndevelopment and production. That is following along with the Enzi-Burr \nproposal, and all of us owe a debt of gratitude to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. We are all working together to have a \nbipartisan proposal that we will be able to act on.\n  If we have positive action on the Harkin amendment, and a positive \nresult on the Enzi-Burr proposal, at the end of this session, the \nSenate will have made a very strong downpayment in preparing this \nNation. We eagerly await the administration's proposal, but quite \nfrankly, I do not think we can delay any longer.\n  Other countries have moved ahead. At this time, we have only \nstockpiled 1 percent of the total amount of antivirals that we will \nneed. This is the issue. Now is the time for action. I am very hopeful \nthat this amendment will be accepted.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that \nmy amendment, which is the second amendment to be ordered, be called up \nand that the other amendments be set aside so I can modify my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2253, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2253), as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase appropriations for the Low-Income Home Energy \n    Assistance Program by $1,276,000,000, with an across-the-board \n                               reduction)\n\n       On page 158, strike lines 12 through 21 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     bus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, $3,159,000,000.\n       For making payments under title XXVI of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1981, $300,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended: Provided, That these funds are for the \n     unanticipated home energy assistance needs of one or more \n     States, as authorized by section 2604(e) of the Act: Provided \n     further, That the entire amount is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2006.\n\n\n              general provision--reduction and rescission\n\n       Sec. __. (a) Amounts made available in this Act, not \n     otherwise required by law, are reduced by 0.982 percent.\n       (b) The reduction described in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply to amounts made available under this Act--\n       (1) for the account under the heading ``low-income home \n     energy assistance''; or\n       (2) for the account under the heading ``Refugee and Entrant \n     Assistance'' (with respect to amounts designated as emergency \n     requirements).\n       Sec. __. (a) There is rescinded an amount equal to 0.981 \n     percent of the budget authority provided in any prior \n     appropriation Act for fiscal year 2006, for any discretionary \n     account described in this Act.\n       (b) Any rescission made by subsection (a) shall be applied \n     proportionately--\n       (1) to each discretionary account described in subsection \n     (a) to the extent that it relates to budget authority \n     described in subsection (a), and to each item of budget \n     authority described in subsection (a); and\n       (2) within each such account or item, to each program, \n     project, and activity (as delineated in the appropriation Act \n     or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering \n     such account or item).\n       (c) The rescission described in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply to budget authority provided as described in subsection \n     (a)--\n       (1) for the account under the heading ``low-income home \n     energy assistance''; or\n       (2) for the account under the heading ``Refugee and Entrant \n     Assistance (with respect to amounts designated as emergency \n     requirements)''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that we return to regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  There is now 10 minutes of debate equally divided on the LIHEAP \namendment. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, Senator Collins and I have proposed an \namendment that would raise LIHEAP funding to a total of $5.1 billion. \nThat is absolutely necessary as we approach the winter with rising fuel \nprices, rising natural gas prices. Our amendment will help all States. \nI want to make it very clear all of our funding goes into the State \nblock grant program, so no State will be disadvantaged.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire has introduced a complementary \namendment that does not provide, in my view, sufficient funding. At his \nlevel of funding, States such as Minnesota, Washington, and Wisconsin \nwill receive no new money. I think that is unfortunate because those \nStates and the citizens of those States deserve the kind of support \nthat will be necessary this winter.\n  Fifty-three Senators have already joined us to support the increase \nin LIHEAP spending to the $5.1 billion total mark. I hope they will \ncontinue to support us. There is a second storm surge coming from \nKatrina, and that is rising energy prices that have overwhelmed \nvulnerable families throughout this country.\n  In addition, my colleague from New Hampshire is proposing to fund \nthis with an across-the-board cut. That across-the-board cut will \ndisappear in conference. As Chairman Specter has pointed out, this bill \nis bare bones. When the conferees arrive and look at the funding for \nHead Start and look at\n\n[[Page S11890]]\n\nfunding for other critical programs, I do not think they are going to \nallow this supposed increase in LIHEAP funding. Also, we are paying for \nthis LIHEAP increase by taking away valuable programs: 37,000 students \nin title I will be denied services because of these cuts. We are going \nto reduce IDEA spending. We are going to reduce Head Start spending. We \nare essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul, taking from some who need to \ngive to others who need. That is not fair. It is not appropriate and it \nis unnecessary.\n  This is an emergency. Just as the storm damage in the gulf was an \nemergency, this is an emergency. I urge support of the Reed-Collins \namendment and opposition to the Gregg amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. First off, I would note that the amount that is in my \namendment is the exact amount which the Senator from Rhode Island asked \nof the Appropriations Committee less than a month ago. It is the exact \namount that the Senator from Maine asked of the Appropriations \nCommittee less than a month ago. It is the exact amount that 41 other \nSenators sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee and asked for \nrelative to LIHEAP costs, low-income energy costs.\n  Why was that amount chosen? It was not picked out of the air. It was \nchosen because that is the amount necessary in order to hold harmless \nthe various low-income energy programs across this country, in order to \ncover the costs of the increase of fuel oil estimated in September, \nwhich was actually at a higher cost level than today. So this actually \nwill represent more money than is necessary in order to keep these \nprograms whole. It will actually represent additional money. It \nrepresents over a 48-percent increase in funding. That is a rather \ndramatic increase.\n  In addition, this amendment that I have proposed is paid for. Our job \nshould be to set priorities in this Congress. We should say, what is \nthe priority? Well, I happen to think one of the priorities is making \nsure that senior citizens, people who live on fixed incomes, low-income \nindividuals who are trying to heat their homes in this very difficult \nwinter, with prices being high and with the winter already upon us--at \nleast in New Hampshire we had some significant snow yesterday--that \nthey will have the ability to have a program which covers those costs. \nBut we should pay for it.\n  What have I suggested? I have suggested a less than 1 percent cut \nacross the board in all the other programs in this bill. That is the \nlogical and appropriate way to pay for this increase in funding which \nis needed, an increase which is the exact amount of money that was \nasked for by the Senator from Rhode Island, the Senator from Maine, and \nother Senators who felt the need, as I do, for a commitment in this \naccount.\n  So it is a reasonable step. My bill is a reasonable action. I would \nalso note one other thing. The Senator from Rhode Island and the \nSenator from Maine have offered an amendment which because it is so \nover the top from a budget standpoint, so outside the budget structure \nwhich we have, is subject to a budget point of order. As Budget \nchairman, I am fairly familiar with these.\n  Those budget points of order are put in place to discipline \nourselves, and of course it is to set priorities. My amendment is not \nsubject to a budget point of order, an emergency point of order.\n  So let us remember that when we are voting on this, if my colleagues \nwant to have a realistic chance of getting a significant increase in \nfunding for the low-income energy program, they should vote for my \namendment because it is only going to take 51 votes to pass it; \nwhereas, the amendment from the other side will take 60 votes.\n  Remember that the number I have put into this amendment is the number \nwhich was actually requested by the sponsors of the first amendment, \nand therefore it is a reasonable number. It is not an arbitrary number. \nIt is a number that makes sense.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  There is 2 minutes 49 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nyielding a couple of minutes.\n  Here they go again. Every year, Senators on that side of the aisle \nsay they want to increase funding for LIHEAP and other things, but they \nwant to take it out of other programs. These amendments are phony. \nThese across-the-board cuts will never get passed into law.\n  My good friend from New Hampshire says: Well, it is just 1 percent or \njust 2 percent or whatever it might be. Let's take a look at what the \nSenator from New Hampshire's cuts really mean. He said it will not \naffect anybody. Well, it is a .98-percent cut. That does not sound like \nmuch, but in terms of No Child Left Behind, it means that 39,400 kids \nwill not be served by title I. I guess they do not count. It means that \nwe will cut special education by $105 million. It means that 9,300 Head \nStart kids will not get Head Start programs. That is why this amendment \nis phony. That is why we have to adopt the Reed amendment.\n  Again, the Senator from New Hampshire always said he wanted to \nincrease funding for special education. Right now the Federal \nGovernment is paying 18.6 percent of the excess costs of special \neducation. We are supposed to go to 40 percent. Under Senator Gregg's \namendment, the share will drop to 17.8 percent. We will go in the wrong \ndirection. So we will never reach the goal of full funding for special \neducation if we adopt the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire. \nSo do not be fooled by these across-the-board cuts. It hurts people. It \nhurts poor kids. It hurts special education. And it hurts title I kids. \nWe do not want to hurt them in order to give money for low-income \nelderly so they can buy heating oil and pay their gas bills this \nwinter. That is unfair. It is unconscionable. The best way to go is to \nadopt the Reed amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. REED. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 38 seconds remaining.\n  Who seeks time? There is 1 minute 31 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is in order to raise a point of order \nas to the Reed amendment. Since I have spoken in favor of it, I ask my \ncolleague, Senator Crapo, to raise the technical point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, pursuant to section 402 of H. Con Res. 95 \nof the 109th Congress--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will cease. A budget point of \norder has to be raised at the conclusion of debate. It cannot be raised \nat this time.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the time status?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 5 seconds left to the \nSenator from New Hampshire, 38 seconds left to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will respond briefly--because I only have \na minute, I will have to do it briefly--to the point of the Senator \nfrom Iowa. What is happening is that we are suggesting that we should \nput approximately a $3 billion hole in the budget to pay for heating \ncosts. Who is going to pay for that? Who is going to pay for it if we \ndo not set the priorities here and offset the costs? I will tell you \nwho is going to pay for it--our children are, because we have to go out \nand borrow that $3 billion. So what we are essentially saying is we are \ngoing to take $3 billion from our children to pay for heating costs \nthis winter for seniors and other people who are on fixed incomes. We \nshould be responsible for that here this year, not be passing it on to \nthe next generation to pay that cost through a debt, financing it \nthrough debt.\n  Clearly, offsetting this spending makes sense, and my amendment does \nexactly that. It offsets it in a reasonable way, less than a 1-percent \nacross-the-board cut, less than 1 percent in order to fund a very \nimportant program, increase funding for a very important program to \nassist seniors and other folks who are on fixed incomes and low \nincomes.\n\n[[Page S11891]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, quickly, Senator Collins and Senator Gregg \nand I are trying to put more money in the State block grant program. \nMr. President, $1 billion will not provide assistance in many States \nthat need it now, Wisconsin and other States that are going to see a \nvery difficult winter. Only by supporting our amendment will we reach \nall the States, all the people who need it. These cuts, as Senator \nHarkin suggested, are illusory; they will not be made. Frankly, I don't \nthink it is appropriate, when we are trying to help poor people in the \nwintertime to heat their homes, we think about offsets; we think about \nthat when we are providing tax cuts for very wealthy Americans.\n  I urge passage of Reed-Collins and the rejection of the Gregg \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 \nof the 109th Congress, I make a point of order against the emergency \ndesignation contained in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I move to waive the applicable section of that act for the \npurposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I remind all our colleagues, under the unanimous consent \nagreement, we are now going to proceed to have five rollcall votes. The \nfirst will be 15 minutes and 5, the other four will be 10 and 5. \nPursuant to our arrangements, the time limits will be enforced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. \nSessions).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Alaska (Ms. \nMurkowski) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the emergency designation is removed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2194, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides \nbudget authority outlays in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation for fiscal year 2006, and it is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we were 3 minutes over on that vote. We \nwill try to hold this next vote in line with 15 minutes, as the \nunanimous consent agreement provided a 10-minute vote with an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2253\n\n  We are now proceeding to vote on Gregg amendment No. 2253.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I simply note that this amendment increases \nthe funding for the low-income assistance program by $1.27 billion, \nwhich is the number 41 Senators asked for the amount of increase. That \nmeans the program will effectively have been increased by about 48 \npercent. It will allow for the program to be held harmless, and, in \nfact, it will probably put extra money into the program beyond holding \nit harmless.\n  In addition, this is paid for, so we are setting priorities. We are \nnot passing this additional spending on to our children through debt, \nwhich means it is not subject to a point of order.\n  In addition, it is the responsible way to approach this. As a \npractical matter, if you expect to increase the funding for low-income \nassistance programs, this will be your best vote to do it because this \nwill only take 51 votes; the other votes took 60.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Gregg amendment would appropriate $1.2 \nbillion into the State block grant program for LIHEAP. That would mean, \nbecause of the arcane nature of the formula, States such as Minnesota, \nWashington, and Wisconsin will see no increase, Iowa will have under a \n3-percent increase, and Oregon has less than a 7.5-percent increase.\n  In sum, the States that need this help right away, the cold-weather \nStates, will see little help from the amendment.\n  Moreover, his amendment is funded by cutting valuable programs--Head \nStart, education for disabled Americans, a host of programs--that \ncannot be made up.\n  As our chairman and ranking member said, this amendment probably will \nbe disregarded in conference because they will not fund but be taking \naway what very little exists already--title I, Head Start, and a host \nof other programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. We will try again for \na real LIHEAP amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be, by previous consent, 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Dodd amendment.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we discussed this amendment sometime ago. In \nthe past, I have offered amendments to fully fund Head Start. This \namendment does not do that. This amendment adds $153 million \nspecifically to deal with the inflation that will affect the cost of \nthe 19,000 Head Start Programs across the country.\n  There are 900,000 children in Head Start. If this amendment is not \nadopted, the estimates are that 20,000 to 25,000 children will be \ndropped from the Head Start Program across our country.\n  We all know that a Head Start child is more likely to finish school, \nless likely to end up in the juvenile justice system, less likely to be \na substance abuser, less likely to become a teenage parent. We know it \nis not perfect, but after 40 years, Head Start works. This is not to \nexpand the program, but let us not lose the children today who are part \nof that program.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Head Start Program is very valuable. \nIt has received priority attention from our subcommittee. We more than \ndoubled Head Start between fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 2004. \nRegrettably, there are no funds to stretch further.\n  If the Senator from Connecticut had an offset, wanted to discuss \npriorities, I would have been glad to do that. But we have to stay \nwithin the budget. Therefore, with great reluctance, I have raised the \npoint of order.\n  Mr. President, it should be noted that the last vote was less than 13 \nminutes. I would ask all of my colleagues to stay in the Chamber. We \nnow have another 10-minute vote, with a 5-minute extension.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                      Rosa Parks Federal Building\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 260, S. 1285, a \nbill to designate the Federal building located at 333 Mt. Elliott \nStreet in Detroit, MI, as the ``Rosa Parks Federal Building.'' Rosa \nParks passed away this past Monday at the age of 92, one of the giants \nin American history. It is very fitting that we pass this bill naming \nthis building. I ask that the bill be read three times, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I never \nthought I would see the day that I would stand to object to such a \nmeritorious proposal as my distinguished colleague has offered.\n  Mrs. Parks has been dead but 3 or 4 days. For 3 years, I have been \ntrying to get the new courthouse annex here in Washington, DC named for \nJudge William B. Bryant. Judge Bryant is an African American. He is 94 \nyears old. Let me tell you about this distinguished individual. Born in \nAlabama----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, regular order. I hate to interrupt my \ncolleague from Virginia, but we have a unanimous consent request to \nproceed with----\n  Mr. WARNER. I reserved the right to object, and I ask the respect of \nthe manager to allow me to state my case.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  He graduated from Howard University in 1936, classmate of Thurgood \nMarshall and Appellate Judge Spotswood Robinson. He graduated from \nHoward Law School first in his class and then, with no real \nopportunities for African-American attorneys in the District of \nColumbia, served as chief research assistant to Ralph Bunche, who later \nwon the Nobel Prize. From 1943 to 1947, he was in the Army and rose to \nthe rank of lieutenant colonel during World War II. He was a criminal \ndefense attorney, Assistant U.S. Attorney, the first African American \never to be an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Nation's Capital. I was \nprivileged to be in the U.S. Attorney's Office during some of his \ntenure there and worked with him. He was a teacher to me and many \nothers. He was appointed to the U.S. District Court in 1965. In 1977, \nhe was appointed the first African American to be chief judge of the \nU.S. District Court.\n  Now at the age of 94, Judge Bryant is serving as a Senior Judge on \nthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia. This \nman, like Rosa Parks, suffered from discriminatory practices and \npersevered, therefore breaking new ground for African-Americans to \ncome. When he first began trying cases as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in \n1951 the Bar Association of D.C. did not allow African-American \nmembers. William Bryant, while trying cases in District Court was \nunable to access the law library at the Courthouse like his white \ncolleagues. Despite the obstacles, William Bryant succeeded.\n  Over the years this man has been a fixture at that courthouse, first \ntrying cases, and for the past 40 years, hearing them as a judge. The \nD.C. Bar and his colleagues have unanimously endorsed the legislation I \noffer today as a tribute to this man's truly extraordinary life, \nlegendary career, and service to this nation's judicial system.\n  However, there are rules in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee which do not permit courthouses to be named for living or \nsitting judges. But it is interesting, before the current Chairman of \nthe Committee took over, the rule was waived in certain cases. I am \naware of more than 20 instances when this discretion was used to name \nCourthouses for living and sitting judges. As a matter of fact, I know \nof some instances where Members of this Chamber have gotten around the \nrule by attaching naming resolutions to bills in other committees of \nthe Senate. We can all agree that Rosa Parks is deserving of the \nrecognition to have a building named after her. Today I ask\n\n[[Page S11893]]\n\nthis body the simple question, why is she more deserving today than she \nwas last week?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have been \ninformed by the chairman of the committee, he has no objection to this. \nSenator Stabenow would agree to your amendment, that your judge be \nincluded in the resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I send to the desk an \namendment and ask if it would be included in the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to modify \nmy request to include the Warner amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nstate the position we have on the committee. I have chaired this \ncommittee for 3 years. As the distinguished Senator from Virginia \nknows--he used to chair the same committee, as did the minority \nleader--we have a rule that we don't name courthouses after anyone who \nis living. I am going to object to this. However, if you want to have a \nvote on this, I will record myself as opposing it because I am not \ngoing to break the record. I think it is a good rule to keep. That is \nmy position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the Rosa \nParks naming and the Bryant naming are very important measures. I would \nsupport both of them. But I believe as long as we have this rule in the \ncommittee, unless the committee will change the rule, I would be happy \nto join with my colleague from Virginia in suggesting a change in the \nrule to permit----\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could ask my distinguished colleague, were you not \nfaced with the same dilemma several years ago and managed to get a \ncourthouse named for a sitting judge in your State by action of the \nAppropriations Committee?\n  Mr. BOND. What was the judge's name?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have talked to the Administraive Office of the Courts, \nand I will get that answer to the Senator.\n  Mr. BOND. I must renew my objection. I look forward to a discussion \nwith the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I renew my request to pass the Rosa \nParks Building designation. I renew my request to pass that. Rosa Parks \nis one of the great civil rights leaders of our time, a great heroine \nwho has now passed away at the age of 92. She deserves this \nrecognition. I very much hoped that we could have a unanimous vote in \nsupport of honoring this very important woman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is an easy way out of this. Let's \ndon't make it complicated. Let's go ahead. He will have an amendment to \nthis bill, have a vote on that. I will record myself as voting no. It \nwill pass. I am sure it will pass. Everybody agrees, as far as Judge \nBryant and Rosa Parks are concerned, that we want this to happen today. \nBut I will object to that in terms of UCing it. I want to have a vote, \nand I will be recorded no. That solves the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. If we had a voice vote, the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee could still be recorded as voting no; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I understand, has the Senator amended her request to \naccept my amendment?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, I did do that. There was an objection to that. So \nI renewed my unanimous consent request for the Rosa Parks Federal \nBuilding.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have to object if the Warner amendment is not included \nin the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to include a revised unanimous consent \nfor Senator Warner.\n  Mr. REID. She has included yours.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I \nwant to say, this debate has everybody on this floor thinking about \nwhat is going on with reference to other things being held up by this \nSenate on holds that we don't even know the name of the person holding \nthem. This is not this issue, but there are many of them. I have the \nDeputy Secretary of Interior for 7 months waiting to be confirmed, and \nthere is some hold somewhere. I think we ought to all begin to \nunderstand that that has to stop. Today reminds me that I am going to \nbe looking at it, and perhaps I will stop every bill until we get some \nof these that are being held up for no reason to be released. I hope \nthis one succeeds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, are we considering the appropriations \nbill for Labor-Health and Human Services-Education?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. We are. We have a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Are we under a unanimous consent agreement binding this \nSenate to proceed with five consecutive votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I was prepared to listen for a while. But this has gone \non, and we are having more collateral issues. I press my request for \nregular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request for regular \norder?\n  Mr. REID. There is a unanimous consent request pending before the \nSenate at this time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have already objected to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Does a call for regular order \nrequire unanimous consent? Regular order means the order has been \ndecided to proceed. I insist on the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  There are now 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the Clinton \namendment No. 2292.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Clinton amendment? The \nminority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Calendar No. \n260, the Rosa Parks Federal Building, be read three times, passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table, with the amendment to it \naffixing the William B. Bryant Annex to that. It is my understanding \nthat this will be done by voice vote. Those who don't like it can tell \nthe Chair that, and it will be a no vote. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis matter be called now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for a voice vote, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, what I would like to do is urge the \nadoption of the Warner amendment to the underlying bill.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I tried to do. That is what I did do.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. Let's do it by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the bill, as \namended.\n  The amendment (No. 2330) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To designate the annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal \n   Bui1ding and United States Courthouse located at 333 Constitution \n                    Avenue Northwest in the District\n\n[[Page S11894]]\n\n            of Columbia as the ``William B.

(a) The annex, located on the 200 block of 3rd \n     Street Northwest in the District of Columbia, to the E. \n     Barrett Prettyman Federal Building and United States \n     Courthouse located at Constitution Avenue Northwest in the \n     District of Columbia shall be known and designated as the \n     ``William B.

DESIGNATION OF ROSA PARKS FEDERAL BUILDING.\n\n       The Federal building located at 333 Mt. Elliott Street in \n     Detroit, Michigan, shall be known and designated as the \n     ``Rosa Parks Federal Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the ``Rosa Parks Federal Building''.\n\n     SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF WILLIAM B. BRYANT ANNEX.\n\n       The annex, located on the 200 block of 3rd Street Northwest \n     in the District of Columbia, to the E. Barrett Prettyman \n     Federal Building and United States Courthouse located at \n     Constitution Avenue Northwest in the District of Columbia \n     shall be known and designated as the ``William B. Bryant \n     Annex''.\n\n     SEC. 4. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the annex referred to \n     in section 3 shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``William B. Bryant Annex''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Rosa Parks and Judge William B. Bryant are \ntwo venerable figures in our Nation's movement toward equality for all \nAmericans. I am proud that the Senate has taken the opportunity today \nto recognize and celebrate these two extraordinary individuals. I \ncommend Senator Stabenow for introducing this bill to name a Federal \nbuilding in Michigan after Rosa Parks, a cherished civil rights leader. \nI also commend the efforts of Senator Warner, who has worked with me \nfor the past 3 years to name the new annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman \nUnited States Courthouse in Washington, DC, the ``William B. Bryant \nAnnex.''\n  Judge Bryant's service to the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia is truly historic. He continues to perform duties \nas a senior Federal judge at the age of 93. He began his legal career \nwith the belief that lawyers could make a difference in eliminating the \nwidespread racial segregation in the United States. He became a \ncriminal defense lawyer in 1948, taking on many pro bono cases and was \nsoon recognized by the U.S. Attorney's office for his skills as a \ndefense attorney. The U.S. Attorney's office hired him in 1951 and he \nbecame the first African American to practice in Federal court here in \nthe District. Judge Bryant was nominated by President Johnson to the \nFederal bench in 1965 and became the first African American Chief Judge \nfor the United States District Court in DC.\n  Naming the new annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse after \nJudge Bryant is a fitting tribute to this distinguished jurist. Much \nlike Judge Prettyman, Judge Bryant has had an illustrious career in \npublic service and on the bench. I thank my colleagues for honoring \nJudge Bryant's service.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2292\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time on the Clinton amendment?\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this next vote is to add $4 billion to \nthe IDEA account. This amendment moves us closer to that mandate \nimposed upon school districts in 1975, a worthy and noble undertaking \nto ensure that every child be given an appropriate public school \neducation. This amendment moves us closer to fulfilling what Congress \nsaid it would do: provide 40 percent of the funding for special \neducation. This will help school districts lower property taxes. It is \nthe kind of commitment we owe to children and their parents and to \nrelieve the burdens of taxpayers.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate is not in \norder.\n  The Senator from New York may continue.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. So, Mr. President, now that the Senate is in order, let \nme just request that we pass this amendment to add money to IDEA, which \nis something we all hear about everywhere we travel in our States to \nprovide necessary tax relief to property tax owners and provide the \nresources that are needed for the special needs of special education \nstudents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nClinton amendment. This amendment would fully fund IDEA for this year \nby adding $4 billion, the difference between the amount appropriated in \nthe Senate bill and this year's authorization level. As a proud co-\nsponsor, I am hopeful the Senate will act today to set IDEA on a path \ntoward full funding.\n  Despite substantial increases in IDEA funding over the past several \nyears, the Federal Government has not lived up to its commitment to pay \nfor 40 percent of the costs of special education. This is one of the \ntop concerns of educators in Wisconsin. As a result of this funding \nshortfall, local school districts continue to devote a large part of \ntheir budgets toward special education, which makes it more difficult \nfor them to adequately fund other vital education programs. This \nproblem has only gotten worse as financially strapped States and local \ngovernments are cutting funding for education in order to balance their \nbudgets. This amendment would provide much needed relief. My home State \nof Wisconsin would benefit from an additional $70 million in special \neducation funds. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, \nsubsequently making good on our commitment to special education \nstudents and their teachers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I concur with what the Senator from New \nYork has said about the importance of special education, and I only \nwish our allocation were larger so we could provide for more money for \nspecial education. Special education has received priority attention by \nthe subcommittee. In 1996, it was less than $3 billion; now it is more \nthan $11 billion. We have to live within the budget as enacted by the \nCongress, and that means, regrettably, the point of order has been \nfiled that it exceeds the budget limit, and I must therefore oppose the \namendment and ask my colleagues to sustain the point of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. Yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 273 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\n\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Corzine\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 46, the nays are \n53. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2232\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes equally divided before \na vote on the Coburn amendment No. 2232.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have an amendment that will transfer $60 \nmillion to save the lives of people who are infected with HIV. There is \nno question where I get this money. It is a good goal. Enhancing the \nCDC, the buildings, the development of that, is all good. We have been \non a fast track to do that in 5 years. That ought to continue.\n  What I am saying with this amendment is, since this amount is eight \ntimes what the President requested, we ought to put saving lives right \nnow in this country at this time ahead of speeding up buildings. If my \ncolleagues agree with that, then they ought to be supporting this \namendment. If they do not, do not support it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will vote against the Coburn amendment \nthat would have increased funding for the State AIDS Drug Assistance \nProgram by cutting needed funding for the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, CDC.\n  I have long supported, and will continue to support, increased \nfunding for the State AIDS Drug Assistance Program to assist those \nsuffering from HIV/AIDS in West Virginia and across the Nation. \nHowever, I could not support the Coburn amendment that would have \nreduced funding to upgrade and modernize the public health facilities \nat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA.\n  The current facilities at the CDC are in a state of extreme \ndisrepair. This is unacceptable at a moment when we face a possible \navian flu pandemic which could threaten millions of American lives. The \nCDC serves on the frontlines of our Nation's defense and preparations \nfor such a flu outbreak.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nfrom Senator Coburn. For five years now, this President and this \nRepublican Congress have prioritized tax cuts for the rich at the \nexpense of urgent national priorities. It has left us with so many \nunmet needs.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Coburn asks us to choose between two \nvitally important national priorities--protecting our national security \nor providing increased assistance to people living with HIV and AIDS. \nWe shouldn't have to do that, and a responsible Congress wouldn't force \nour hand.\n  An epidemic of HIV and AIDS continues to ravage communities--\nespecially communities of color--across the country. Approximately 1 \nmillion individuals live with the disease and they struggle every day \nto make ends meet and to afford the medical care, medicines, and other \nsupports they need to live healthy and productive lives.\n  The Federal AIDS Drug Assistance Program gives needy individuals the \nhelp they need. It is a vital part of our safety net for people living \nwith HIV and AIDS, and it deserves more Federal support.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Coburn soon on the \nreauthorization of the ADAP program as well as reauthorization of the \nother vital programs in the Ryan White CARE Act. We need to expand our \ncommitment to the whole of the CARE Act programs so we can improve \nlives of people living with HIV and AIDS.\n  But this amendment isn't the right approach. It is irresponsible and \ndangerous. It proposes to increase funding for the ADAP program by \ncutting our investment in the Centers for Disease Control--the \nfrontline Federal agency in the battle against bioterrorist threats and \navian flu that threaten the health and safety of all Americans. In the \npast they fought and protected us from the SARS virus and their \nexpertise is often called upon to protect others across the world from \nEbola and other deadly viruses.\n  Senator Harkin has outlined the need for modern facilities for the \nCDC. They cannot fight 21st century threats in 20th century buildings.\n  It is wrong to cut $60 million from CDC construction appropriations \nat this time when so many public health threats are converging on us \nand I urge all my colleagues to vote against the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Time is yielded to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nWhile I agree with the need to continue to fight AIDS, the program to \nwhich this money is transferred----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Georgia has the time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the fund to which Senator Coburn seeks \nto transfer this money is already funded in this bill to the tune of \nalmost $800 million. It is not as if we are ignoring the very noble \nissue he is seeking to improve, but the fact is that we embarked on a \nmultiyear plan at the CDC to improve the quality of the buildings where \nour most sophisticated and important researchers and scientists work on \ncritical issues. It is imperative that we continue with this plan.\n  I yield to my friend from Georgia for the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, with all due respect, this is not a \nchoice of putting buildings ahead of people or people ahead of \nbuildings. This is a choice of maintaining the commitment to save the \nlives of our children and grandchildren in the future against pandemics \nand terrorist threats in the future.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, well intended, is wrong. I urge a ``no'' \nvote on the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, if you have HIV today and you don't have \nhealth insurance and you are standing in line to get HIV retrovirus \ntherapy and heart therapy and they tell you they don't have enough \nmoney, you are out of luck. In this country, where we have invested so \nmuch in this disease, to put anybody out of luck--we have invested a \nlot of money in the ADAP program, but it is not enough, and people are \ndying every year in this country because we are not doing it. It is \ntime we should do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for 5 seconds.\n  To my colleague, we will be calling up amendment No. 2259 later on to \nadd $74 million to the ADAP program, but we will not take it out of \nCDC. That is the amendment we ought to vote for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 2232.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 14, nays 85, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11896]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 274 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--14\n\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Coburn\n     Cornyn\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Grassley\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Smith\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--85\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Corzine\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2232) was rejected.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, this is an amendment I am offering with \nSenator Hutchison and also with cosponsors Kennedy, Clinton, Dodd, \nMurray, and Salazar. I ask unanimous consent that all those Senators be \nlisted as cosponsors on amendment No. 2218.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me briefly describe the amendment. \nIt increases funding for the advanced placement programs to the level \nthe President requested in his budget, submitted to the Congress \nearlier this year.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask that amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  According to a recent report issued by the National Academy of \nSciences, NAS, the scientific and technical building blocks of this \nNation's economic strength are eroding at a time when many other \nNations are gathering strength. In no uncertain terms, the NAS \nCommittee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century \nexpressed ``fear'' that our ability to lead in science and technology \ncan be lost abruptly, and that once lost, it may be very difficult to \nregain, if at all.\n  The NAS report issued a number of recommendations to strengthen the \neconomic security of this country. Among the highest priorities, the \nNAS urged that we increase America's talent pool by vastly improving K-\n12 mathematics and science education. My amendment seeks to do that by \nincreasing funding available for advanced placement programs.\n  According to the NAS report, the vast majority of students in this \ncountry will never take an advanced math or science course while in \nhigh school. Evidence shows, however, that the intensity and rigor of a \nstudent's high school coursework is directly related to the student's \nsuccess in college and beyond. Students who take a solid college prep \ncurriculum are less likely to need remedial classes, and are more \nlikely to earn a college degree.\n  In fact, evidence shows that the intensity and quality of a high \nschool curriculum is the greatest measure of completion of a bachelor's \ndegree. Importantly, studies also show that not only do college-bound \nstudents benefit from rigorous courses, but that all students benefit \nfrom more rigorous coursework.\n  Accordingly, it is critical that all of our young people have access \nto rigorous coursework in secondary school in order to meet the demands \nof post secondary education and a competitive workforce.\n  NAS urges us to expand the pipeline--increase the number of students\n\n[[Page S11897]]\n\ntaking advanced science and math courses, such as AP-IB. Accordingly, \nwe must create additional opportunities and incentives for middle-\nschool and high-school students to pursue advanced work in math and \nscience. NAS recommends quadrupling the number of students in AP or IB \nmath or science courses to 4.5 million by 2010.\n  Moreover, I believe we all know that the quality of the teaching \nforce is paramount to improving student achievement. A great teacher \ncan not only help a student develop critical, analytical, and problem-\nsolving skills, or mastery of a particular subject, but can motivate a \nstudent to pursue a career in the field.\n  Unfortunately, this country is facing a shortage of highly qualified \nmath and science teachers.\n  According to the NAS report, the vast majority of high school \nstudents in this country are being taught science and math by teachers \nwithout certification or a degree in the subject being taught. In fact, \na U.S. high school student has a 70 percent chance of being taught \nEnglish by a teacher with a degree in English while the same student \nhas about a 40 percent chance of being taught chemistry by a teacher \nwith a degree in chemistry.\n  The NAS report recommended that we strengthen the skills of 250,000 \nteachers through training and educational programs. One of the critical \nsteps in reaching that goal is through increased training for \ninstructors in the Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate--\nAP-IB--Programs. NAS recommended that we train an additional 150,000 \nAP-IB and pre AP-IB instructors to teach advanced courses in math and \nscience.\n  The FY 06 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill presents a critical \nopportunity to begin implementing some of the recommendations. We must \ninvest in the economic security of this great country.\n  This amendment seeks to increase funding for advanced placement \nprograms in the underlying bill by $18.5 million, to a total of $51.5 \nmillion. This level of funding, which is the same as the level \nrequested by the administration, would help train additional AP-IB \nteachers, and help more low-income students take AP-IB courses.\n  NAS recommends we invest in excess of $400 million to achieve these \ngoals. Therefore, this amendment only resents a down payment, however, \ntoward meeting the committee's recommendation, but would demonstrate \nour commitment to our children and grandchildren that we do not take \ntheir prosperity and security for granted.\n  The NAS advises us to prepare with great urgency to preserve this \nNation's strategic and economic security. By investing in AP, we can \nprovide the foundation for students to be internationally competitive. \nThis amendment is a step in that direction, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2219\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2219.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2219.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To increase funding for school dropout prevention)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there is appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an additional \n     $4,900,000 to carry out part H of title I of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6551 et seq.).\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amounts made available for administrative expenses and \n     salaries for the Department of Education under this Act shall \n     be reduced by $4,900,000.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nReid, Kennedy, Clinton, Dodd, and Salazar be added as cosponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. This is an amendment to maintain current funding for \nthe school dropout prevention program that is authorized under No Child \nLeft Behind. The underlying bill would completely eliminate funding for \ndropout prevention, which I think would be a terrible mistake. This \namendment is essential in order that that not occur. Nationally, only \ntwo-thirds of our 9th graders will graduate from high school with a \ndiploma after completing the 12th grade. And, only about 50 percent of \nour Nation's African American, Hispanic, and Native American students \nwill graduate with a high school diploma alongside their classmates.\n\n  Sadly, a recent report by Educational Testing Services, ETS, makes it \nclear that the dropout crisis is actually getting worse; the high \nschool completion rate has been steadily declining in 43 States. Even \nmore alarming, the report concludes that students are dropping out at a \nyounger age, meaning dropouts are even less educated now than in \nprevious years.\n  Yet, while dropout rates continue to rise, the Federal Government's \nresponse has unfortunately diminished. According to a recent GAO \nreport, the Department of Education has done very little to help States \nincrease graduation rates, and in fact, has failed to disseminate \ninformation about effective dropout prevention strategies.\n  GAO found that the Department of Education had failed to rigorously \nevaluate the effectiveness of various State and local interventions \ndesigned to increase high school graduation rates. As a result, schools \nand districts may not be using the most effective approaches to help \ntheir students stay in school and graduate.\n  In addition, Congress has significantly cut funding for the school \ndropout prevention program in recent years. The underlying bill, \nhowever, completely eliminates funding for dropout \nprevention, ostensibly because local school districts can use part of \ntheir Title I funds for dropout prevention.\n\n  It is clear, however, that an allowable use of Title I funds is \ninsufficient to stem the tide, as dropout rates continue to rise. The \nETS report concludes that our failure to provide adequate resources for \nschool dropout prevention is ``social dynamite.''\n  The response of the Federal Government to this crisis is wholly \ninadequate, and in fact, is moving in the wrong direction. Dropout \nrates continue to climb, and the economic consequences are devastating \nfor our younger and less educated population of dropouts. The reality \nis that in 2002, a high school dropout earned less than $23,000 per \nyear, not enough for a family to be self-sufficient and pay for the \nbasic necessities of life, such as food, housing, and health care.\n  Moreover, I believe this dropout crisis places our economic security \nin peril. How will this country continue to compete in a global economy \nwhen only two-thirds of our high school students graduate high school. \nAn educated workforce is the foundation for our future economic \nstrength.\n  I am offering this amendment to the FY 06 Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations bill to add $4.9 million to maintain funding for dropout \nprevention, representing the current funding level. This amount is \noffset by amounts made available to the Department of Education for \nadministrative expenses and salaries.\n  I believe this offset is reasonable, given that in the past few years \nalone, the Department of Education has spent millions of dollars on \npublic relations contracts and grants to promote certain Department \npolicies and priorities, some of which violated Federal law. I believe, \nhowever, reducing the dropout rate is a higher priority than promoting \nthe Department's own agenda. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Again, I ask to have that amendment laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2262\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2262.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2262.\n\n\n[[Page S11898]]\n\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for education programs serving Hispanic \n                               students)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INCREASED FUNDING FOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS SERVING \n                   HISPANIC STUDENTS.\n\n       (a) Migrant Education.--In addition to amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an \n     additional $9,600,000 for the education of migratory children \n     under part C of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6391 et seq.).\n       (b) English Language Acquisition.--In addition to amounts \n     otherwise appropriated under this Act, there are \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, an additional $10,300,000 for English language \n     acquisition programs under part A of title III of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6811 et seq.).\n       (c) HEP/CAMP.--In addition to amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an \n     additional $5,700,000 for the High School Equivalency Program \n     and the College Assistance Migrant Program under section 418A \n     of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070d-2).\n       (d) School Dropout Prevention.--In addition to amounts \n     otherwise appropriated under this Act, there are \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, an additional $5,000,000 for school dropout \n     prevention programs under part H of title I of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6551 et seq.).\n       (e) ESL/CIVICS Programs.--In addition to amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an \n     additional $6,500,000 for English as a second language \n     programs and civics education programs under the Adult \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 9201 et seq.).\n       (f) Parent Assistance and Local Family Information \n     Centers.--In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated under \n     this Act, there are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an additional \n     $13,000,000 for the Parent Assistance and Local Family \n     Information Centers under subpart 16 of part D of title V of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7273 et seq.).\n       (g) Hispanic-Serving Institutions.--In addition to amounts \n     otherwise appropriated under this Act, there are \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, $9,900,000 for Hispanic-serving institutions \n     under title V of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     1101 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSalazar be added as a cosponsor of this amendment, No. 2262.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak for just a very few minutes \non this amendment. Then I see there are other Senators seeking \nrecognition. I will not delay them long.\n  This is a very important amendment on which I will request we \nactually have a rollcall vote tomorrow. It is an amendment to invest an \nadditional $60 million in eight different programs, in a combination of \neight different programs. They are very important to the Hispanic \ncommunity in this country. The eight programs are migrant education, \nEnglish language acquisition programs, the High School Equivalency \nProgram, the College Assistance Migrant Program, Dropout Prevention, \nEnglish as a Second Language Programs, local family information \ncenters, and the Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program.\n  The amendment is strongly supported by the Hispanic Education \nCoalition, which is an ad hoc coalition of national organizations \ndedicated to improving educational opportunities for more than 40 \nmillion Hispanics living in the United States, including groups such as \nthe National Council of La Raza, HACU, and MALDEF. The National PTA is \nalso a very strong supporter of the amendment.\n  The Title I Migrant Education Program was established to provide a \ncompensatory education program designed to deal with the difficulties \nencountered by children of migrant workers as a consequence of their \nmobility. Some of these children attend three or four schools in a \nsingle school year.\n  They have a great need for coordination of educational services among \nthe States and local districts where they live, often for short periods \nof time. The MEP builds the support structures for migrant students so \nthat they can achieve high levels of success both in and outside of \nschool.\n  The U.S. Department of Education reports that more than 750,000 \nstudents were identified as eligible for the program in fiscal year \n2001. Additional funds are necessary to ensure that these children are \nable to meet the challenges mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act. \nThis amendment will provide an additional $9.6 million in needed \nfunding.\n  This amendment would also increase funding to States and local school \ndistricts in order to ensure that as many of the 5.5 million children \nwith limited English skills as possible learn English, develop high \nlevels of academic attainment, and meet the same challenging State \nacademic standards as all children.\n  Title III is a formula grant program that distributes funding to all \n50 States based on the number of limited English proficient, LEP, and \nrecent immigrant students. The funds are used for developing effective \nlanguage acquisition programs; training for bilingual/ESL teachers and \nregular teachers and educational personnel; parent involvement; and \nproviding services for recently arrived immigrant students. This \namendment requests an additional $10.3 million for Language Acquisition \nGrants, which restores the program's funding to its fiscal year 2003 \nlevel.\n  This amendment would provide modest increases for the High School \nEquivalency Program, HEP, and the College Assistance Migrant Program, \nCAMP. The HEP helps migrant students who have dropped out of high \nschool earn a GED. The CAMP assists migrant students in their first \nyear of college with both counseling and stipends. These programs \nprovide farmworker migrant students with education opportunities and \nsupport that will help them to become productive members of society.\n  Migrant students are among the most disadvantaged youth in this \nNation. Current estimates place the dropout rate for migrant youth at \nbetween 50 and 60 percent. Before CAMP, there was no record of a child \nof migrant farm workers ever having attended college. Both programs \nhave been very successful in helping migrant students become productive \nmembers of society.\n  According to the Department of Education, in 2003-2004, almost 10,000 \nstudents were served by HEP CAMP, and 63 percent of the HEP \nparticipants received a GED, and 84 percent of CAMP students completed \ntheir first year of college in good standing. This amendment provides \nan additional $5.7 million for these programs.\n  The Dropout Prevention program helps States and school districts to \nimplement research-based, sustainable, and coordinated school dropout \nprevention and re-entry programs in order to raise student achievement. \nAt a time when schools are focused on narrowing achievement gaps \nbetween differing subgroups of students, it seems that Congress would \nwant to retain Dropout Prevention, a program specifically aimed at \nproviding schools with the tools to help students achieve a high school \ndegree.\n  Support for Dropout Prevention is even more significant when \nconsidering that the primary source of Federal funding for public \nschools, authorized through the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, focuses \nmainly on elementary schools. More than 90 percent of Tit1e I funds--\nthe principal NCLB program--are directed to elementary schools. Such an \nemphasis on elementary education is necessary and appropriate, but \nequally important is continuing an investment of resources throughout \nthe education continuum in order to meet the needs of middle level and \nhigh school students.\n  The Dropout Prevention program is the only Federal program actively \nworking to reduce the Nation's dropout rates, and, as recent headlines \ntell us, it is a problem that is far more severe than previous data \nindicated.\n  A report by the Urban Institute finds that only 68 percent of all \nstudents in the public high school class of 2001 graduated. \nFurthermore, it states that only 50 percent of all black students and \n53 percent of Hispanic students graduate. Nearly half of all black and \nHispanic students do not graduate from high school. This is a problem \nthat has reached enormous proportions. The Dropout Prevention program \nwas\n\n[[Page S11899]]\n\neliminated in this legislation. This amendment restores $5 million to \nthis program.\n  The Local Family Information Centers program was authorized under the \nNo Child Left Behind Act to provide parents of Title I students, \nincluding English language learners, with information about their \nchildren's schools so that they can help their children to meet the \nhigh standards we have set under NCLB.\n  The Local Family Information Centers also help parents to hold their \nlocal and State school officials accountable and become more involved \nin their children's education. This amendment would increase funding \nfor these centers by $13 million.\n  The need for increased funding for English as a Second Language, ESL, \nis evident by the growing demand for services and the lack of resources \nto meet that need.\n  Enrollment in Adult ESL has increased 105 percent over the past 10 \nyears, yet there is a lack of programs and funding to ensure that all \nwho desire to learn English have access to appropriate services.\n  Currently, community-based organizations must piece programs together \nwith volunteer labor and facilities. The need for more targeted \nservices is overwhelming. Demand for English-language instruction far \noutweighs supply, waiting lists for classes typically range from \nseveral months to years, and many States do not have the capacity to \nmeet the demand.\n  The current $70 million in funding is insufficient to meet the \nenormous demand for ESL services. As the labor market continues to \nrequire English-proficient labor, investing in ESL programs will \nstrengthen the labor pool and return a more versatile productive \nworkforce. This amendment provides an additional $6.5 million for ESL \nprograms.\n  Currently, 35 percent of Hispanics are under the age of 18. The \nEducational Testing Service has projected the U.S. higher education \nsystem will grow by 3.5 million additional students by 2015 and that \nnearly 40 percent of these new students will be Hispanic. HSIs serve \nthe largest concentrations of the Nation' s youngest and largest ethnic \npopulation.\n  The impending emergence of more than 100 new HSIs, mostly in \nCalifornia, Texas, Florida, New Mexico and Illinois, in the next few \nyears and the rapid growth of the Hispanic college-age population \nunderscore the urgency for immediate, major, and sustained increases in \nTitle V funding.\n  At a time when the current labor force is reaching retirement age in \nsubstantial numbers, Hispanics already represent one of every three new \nworkers joining the U.S. labor force, according to the U.S. Bureau of \nLabor Statistics. By 2025, the Bureau projects that one of two new \nworkers joining the U.S. labor force will be Hispanic. This amendment \nwould provide an additional $9.9 million in assistance to these great \ninstitutions.\n  We must do everything possible to provide every child with the best \neducation we can. This amendment would provide small, but much-needed \nincreases to programs that can make a difference in the lives of \nmillions of children. I urge my fellow Senators to support these \ngreatly needed programs by providing them with the proper resources. I \nwill seek some additional time tomorrow before we actually have a vote \non this amendment in order to further explain to my colleagues the \nreasons this amendment needs to be adopted.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes regarding the hurricane in Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                         HURRICANE WILMA DAMAGE\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that \nunfortunately has become all too familiar to us, particularly us \nFloridians, which is the devastating ravages of yet another storm that \nhas hit our coastal zone and particularly the State of Florida.\n  I have just returned from the State of Florida, from south Florida, \nhaving traveled there today, with Senator Nelson. I also traveled \naround with Members of the Congress, with Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, \nCongressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, and \nCongressman Clay Shaw.\n  We went first to Miami, Dade County, where we visited the emergency \noperations center. There we were able to get a briefing and an update \nfrom people on the ground about the situation there. Unfortunately, \nthere, and then again in Broward County and Fort Lauderdale where we \nfurther visited, the situation seems to be somewhat the same.\n  There is widespread damage to people's homes and places of business, \nbut the most important and most pervasive problem seems to be the very \nsevere loss of electrical power.\n  In addition to the electrical power, there is a combination in some \nof the places which also has to do with problems of potable water.\n  As I stand here, there are still 2.8 million people in Florida \nwithout electricity. Nearly 6 million people were without power Tuesday \nmorning. We are making some progress, thanks in part to the \ncontributions of other States that have responded to this emergency. \nMore than 5,000 people from neighboring States are actively working to \nrestore power in the lower peninsula.\n  Damage in Florida not only began in the area of Naples and Marco \nIsland on the west coast, but then it traveled across the rural area of \nour State, across the Everglades and slammed in an angling way, \ncovering the Florida Keys before it ever reached the mainland, and then \nMiami, Dade County, Broward County, Palm Beach County, exiting out in \nthe area of Palm Beach.\n  Regarding those 2.8 million people without power, I am hopeful that \nfigure will be dropping substantially in the next several days. That \nwill be good news if it happens. In the meantime, there is an area of \ngreat concern.\n  We are being told by the power companies it will be at least a week, \nmaybe 10 days, maybe 2 weeks before a substantial number of these \ncustomers will be restored to power. In fact, the date of November 22 \nis now being given as to when all customers will be back on line. That \nis almost a month from now. No power, for many Floridians, means there \nis no way to prepare meals, no hot water in which to bathe or wash \nclothes or dishes, no traffic lights, no way to pump gas, no access to \ncash machines so people might access resources necessary to restock and \nobtain water and food supplies.\n  Banks are closed. The schools in many ways would be ready to reopen \nin a matter of a couple of days, but they cannot open until there is \npower. Hospitals are working on generators; however, there is concern \nthat these generators will begin to start running low on fuel and there \nis also the ``boil water'' order given to the people of south Florida, \nin counties that are, frankly, having problems with water pressure \nissues.\n  There are substantial relief efforts in progress. There have been a \nfew glitches along the way. Yesterday, there were long lines of \nexasperated people, which is understandable in the first 48 hours \nfollowing a category 3 hurricane that hit with well over 100-mile-an-\nhour winds in some of the most populated areas of the State of Florida.\n  I commend our Governor, Jeb Bush, for his preparation before the \nstorm ever reached our shores and for the good cooperation that local \ngovernment has been given throughout the State. Even though we have all \nheard reports of long lines at these distribution points and that we \nhave run out of supplies too soon, the system is working and will be \nworking even better in the coming hours. Improvements have been made \nover the last 24 hours, and we believe more improvements will be made \nin a very short period of time.\n  I also commend our Florida National Guard. The Florida National \nGuard, time and again, has answered the call as we have faced storm \nafter storm in the State of Florida. Right now we have over 4,000 \nmembers of the Guard who have been activated, helping to distribute \nfood and material and assisting local law enforcement and patrolling \nareas, assisting local law enforcement. More troops are being called \nup, I understand.\n  There are curfews in effect throughout south Florida, and it is a big \ntask to enforce these curfews. Floridians are\n\n[[Page S11900]]\n\nfollowing the instructions and local government officials were pleased \nto report to us how well Floridians were responding to the call for \ncurfew. We hope this will continue because the curfews will need to be \nin effect for ongoing days, and we hope the same level of cooperation \nwill be seen.\n  FEMA is on the ground in Florida. In addition to helping to provide \nfor immediate needs, the administrators have approved individual \nassistance for 10 Florida counties covering an estimated 6.5 million \npeople in the State of Florida. That was welcome news to the people in \nMiami, Dade and Broward Counties, that I visited today.\n\n  As far as the overall picture, the extent of the damage, and the \neconomic impact, it is hard to get an accurate dollar figure just yet \nbecause the estimates are still coming in. Just to give my colleagues \nan idea, the preliminary figures, according to the Florida Insurance \nCouncil, puts the cost of Hurricane Wilma to somewhere close to $10 \nbillion.\n  If that figure holds, it makes Wilma the most damaging storm to hit \nthe State this year and perhaps Florida's most damaging hurricane in \nover a decade.\n  I also want to underscore that Florida is a State that went into this \nparticular storm with a lot on its shoulders already. Before Wilma, \nover 10 percent of Florida's homes were damaged from four previous \nhurricanes last year. Even today, we still had over 20,000 Floridians \nliving in some sort of transitional housing. Most of that is a backlog \nof structural repair. Now that number is going to dramatically \nescalate.\n  Before Wilma was even a squall, Florida's agricultural damages from \nthe last year stood at $665 million. Whole sectors of our agricultural \nindustry are devastated. Frankly, it will take years to replant and \nreestablish some of the crops. It is highly likely that this hurricane \nis going to make yet another agricultural season a total loss for \nFloridians.\n  I also want to mention S. 939, the Disaster Recovery Act. This bill, \nwhich has been introduced by myself and several others, is pending \nbefore this body. It seeks to expedite Federal assistance and assist \ncommunities in debris removal. This is straightforward legislation. \nWithout it, people in communities can be kept waiting for months for \nany assistance. In the case of debris removal, it is an issue of public \nsafety that has gone unaddressed for far too long. With the help of my \ngood friends from Maine and Mississippi, this bill is now moving \nforward, and I will ask my colleagues to lend their support. This is \ncritical legislation, and it will make a difference to millions of \nFloridians and others affected by the recent storms. This bill is \ncurrently hotlined, and I am hopeful that first thing tomorrow morning \nwe will be able to move this bill along.\n  Beyond that, I know there is still an appropriate time and place for \na larger Federal role in this disaster. I ask my colleagues to keep in \nmind that Florida has been hit by eight hurricanes and two tropical \nstorms in the last 14 months. Going into this storm, we have had a lot \nof damage from Wilma, and it has only been compounded by existing \nproblems and new ones have been created.\n  So let me conclude on a brighter note and express appreciation for \nthose of my colleagues who have indicated their concern for Florida. It \nis times like these that makes me proud to be a Floridian. We are \nresilient people. What we saw today was folks pulling together. We will \nrepair the damage and we will move on. The communities of Florida are \npulling together, helping one another and reaching out to one another \nin a spirit of cooperation and neighborliness, which I think is \ncommendable.\n  I think we need to continue to pull together because these are \ndifficult days. We are not going to get over this in a matter of 24 \nhours or 48 hours. It is going to take some time.\n  In the first 48 hours after a category 3 hurricane, it is \nunderstandable that people's nerves are fraying and impatience is \nsetting in.\n  However, we are ready for this, and I know we will pull together and \nget through it in the best way possible.\n  I believe it is most important to point out that in spite of all of \nthis, the Orlando International Airport has reopened for business. The \ncruise ships are coming in and out of Miami Harbor. The fact is that \nthe attractions--all in central Florida--were completely unaffected by \nany of this and are open for business. Florida, in fact, is open for \nbusiness. The convention facilities are working. Florida will be back \nto normal in short order. I do hope that people recognize Florida is \nstill a wonderful place to visit.\n  I thank my colleagues for all of the expressions of support, and I \nlook forward to working with them as we try to seek an appropriate \nFederal response to Florida's problem.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, this amendment supports the \nadministration's request for second-year funding for the Community-\nBased Job Training Grant Initiative.\n  Although that is a mouthful, this goes to one of the most basic needs \nof our country, and particularly our growing economy.\n  For those who are concerned about offshoring and outsourcing of jobs \nto other countries, for those who are concerned about American citizens \nwho have not yet attained a living wage in their jobs, this is the \nanswer to all of those challenges, and more.\n  The primary purpose of the grants that are included in this program \nis to strengthen the role of community and technical colleges and train \nworkers for the skills required to succeed in high-growth, high-demand \nindustries.\n  The amendment covers publicly funded institutions of higher education \nthat grant associate degrees. Community-based job training grants are \nawarded to community and technical colleges that demonstrate they are \nengaged in a strategic partnership with business and industry. In other \nwords, this is not just the teaching of academic subjects but, rather, \nworking with industry to determine what sort of job skills they need \nfor the good jobs they can provide, if they can find a sufficient \nnumber of trained employees to do them.\n  Applicants for these grants are required to identify workforce \nchallenges and their ability to implement workforce solutions for \nlocally identified high-growth, high-demand occupations.\n  This amendment will help increase the capacity of community colleges \nto provide innovative job training strategies in local demand \nindustries. They will be able to develop training criteria with local \nindustry, hire qualified faculty, arrange on-the-job experiences with \nindustry, and use up-to-date equipment.\n  Community colleges are one of the best kept educational secrets in \nthis country. They are adaptable, flexible, affordable, and accessible \nby all segments of the community.\n  This amendment will help community colleges train 100,000 new and \nexperienced workers in demand industries and then increase the \nretention and earnings of trained workers.\n  The Labor Department is committed to making all curricula and \ntraining techniques developed through the grants available to community \ncolleges nationwide so these grants help more than just the direct \nrecipient of the grant.\n  This amendment will help millions more workers access education and \ntraining for exciting career opportunities and a brighter future. The \nfirst grant competition for $125 million was appropriated in fiscal \nyear 2005 and was issued in May. Nearly 400 community colleges \nsubmitted proposals and 70 community colleges in 40 States were awarded \ngrants on October 19.\n  I am particularly proud that 7 of the community colleges in Texas \nwere awarded grants through the first $125 million competition.\n  I have long been an advocate of these kind of workforce partnerships \nand initiatives formed with community colleges and local business \ncommunities because I have actually seen them succeed.\n  While in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to visit a number of \nthese initiatives across the State of Texas, in Austin, in Houston, \nPasadena, Laredo, Beaumont, Sherman, El Paso, Lubbock, and Victoria.\n  I remember in particular a young Hispanic woman, a single mom who had \nbeen a prison guard in Amarillo, TX who, as a result of a program that \nshe trained in in an Amarillo community college, was able to increase \nher earnings and brighten her future, as well as get out of her \nsomewhat dangerous job as a prison guard to begin working on the \nproduction line for the V-22 tilt rotor being made at Bell Helicopter \nin Amarillo, TX.\n  This is only one example of how we can provide the resources to \nindividuals so they can improve their future, improve their skills, and \nsatisfy the needs of employers who search, often in vain, for qualified \nworkers to take these good and very well paying jobs.\n  I know, in consultation with the distinguished floor manager of this \nbill, that this contains an offset that causes some concerns. What I \nwould like to do is continue our discussions with Senator Specter, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, the distinguished manager of this bill, as \nwe proceed through this process to try to find some way to maximize the \nfunds available to this particular program in the conference and \nhopefully restore some of the money that would otherwise be cut. I \nrealize the subcommittee is working within allocation caps and we don't \nwant to cause any unnecessary concern. But this is an initiative that I \nfeel so strongly about, and I think the more our colleagues learn about \nthis, the more our colleagues will be supportive of this restoration of \nthese funds for this important initiative.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I look forward to working with the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa as we try to work in the conference to try to accommodate and \nindeed try to maximize the funds for this important initiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2278\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent on behalf of \nSenator Kennedy to send a modification to the amendment to the desk. It \nchanges the date, it looks like, from August to June.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2246), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 131, line 18, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided, That the Current Employment Survey \n     shall maintain the content of the survey issued prior to June \n     2005 with respect to the collection of data for the women \n     worker series''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in June 2005, the Department of Labor's \nBureau of Labor Statistics eliminated the most reliable source of \nemployment data on women workers by removing the Women Worker Series \nfrom its Current Employment Statistics survey. This move--opposed by a \nbipartisan coalition of Senators--blocks collection of key data about \nthe status and progress of women in the workplace. I offer an amendment \ntoday to reverse that decision.\n  Comprehensive and accurate information on gender employment is vital \nto ending long-standing economic discrimination against women in our \nsociety. The facts are painfully clear. Women today earn 76 cents for \nevery dollar earned by men. They work disproportionately in lower-\npaying occupations, and have far lower lifetime earnings than men. \nCongress, researchers, and policymakers across the country need the \ndata collected by the Women Worker Series to understand the true \ndimensions of gender inequality in the workforce, and guide us in our \neffort to eliminate it.\n  The Women Worker Series has the best available data on women in the \nworkforce. It's been part of a broad-based survey of nearly 400,000 \nbusiness establishments that examines the most accurate data \navailable--employers' own records. The data are the most reliable way \nto assess monthly changes in employment, and they contain valuable \ninsights on women's employment and unemployment in the business cycle.\n  The information collected in the survey is indispensable to \npolicymakers and researchers. During the comment period conducted by \nthe Department of Labor, the comments received were more than 9-to-1 \nagainst discontinuing the series. Every business group that commented \non the proposed elimination of the data, including the Women's Chamber \nof Commerce and Business and Professional Women, supported continuing \nthe collection of the data. Janet Norwood, Commissioner of the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics in both the Carter and Reagan administrations, \ncriticized the recent decision to discontinue this collection.\n  Many of the comments cited studies that used the data to uncover \nimportant conclusions about the position of women in the workforce. A \nstudy by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for example, used the \ndata to find that men and women have historically been affected \ndifferently by recessions, with jobs often shifting from women to men \nduring these periods. This study would have been impossible without the \nWomen Worker Series.\n  The department claims that it has eliminated the series in order to \nreduce the burden on employers responding in the survey. But continuing \nto collect this information would not be unduly burdensome. The gender \nseries is only one question in a larger survey that the department \ncontinues to conduct. According to BLS estimates, the entire survey \ntakes only seven minutes to fill out, so the burden imposed by a single \nquestion is virtually nonexistent. Indeed, most employers are required \nto track the gender of their employees for other purposes, so the \nrequested information is almost always readily available.\n  The decision to eliminate the Women Worker Series is an insult to \nworking women across the country, and can only strengthen the \ndiscrimination they face in the workplace. At a time when women's \nemployment may be changing in fundamental ways, we should be \nexpanding--not reducing--our ability to understand the evolving role of \nwomen in the Nation's labor force. I urge my colleagues to accept this \namendment and avoid taking an unfair step backward on this very \nimportant issue for working women across America.\n  I ask, unanimous consent that letters in support of the amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   U.S. Senate\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2005.\n     Kathleen P. Utgoff,\n     Commissioner, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Commissioner Utgoff: We are writing to express our \n     concern about the Bureau's plans to discontinue the gender \n     series in the Current Employment Statistics (CES) program, We \n     strongly urge you to continue to collect these data.\n       Comprehensive and accurate gender employment information is \n     vital to end the longstanding economic discrimination against \n     women in our society. Women today earn 76 cents for every \n     dollar earned by men. They work disproportionately in lower-\n     paying occupations, and have far lower lifetime earnings than \n     men. Congress, researchers, and policymakers across the \n     country need the CBS data to understand gender inequality in \n     the workforce, and guide us in our efforts to eliminate it.\n       The recent recession marked the start of the only period of \n     sustained job loss for women in the last forty years. At a \n     time when women's employment may be changing in fundamental \n     ways, we should be expanding--not limiting--our ability to \n     understand the evolving role of women in the nation's labor-\n     force.\n       The CES data are the best available data on employment \n     trends, and are indispensable\n\n[[Page S11903]]\n\n     to po1icymakers and researchers on the issue, The Current \n     Population Survey is not an adequate substitute, Economists \n     widely agree that the Bureau's Payroll Survey provides a far \n     more accurate view of general employment trends than the \n     Population Survey. As you yourself testified to the \n     Congressional Joint Economic Committee in 2003, ``the payroll \n     survey provides more reliable information on the current \n     trend in wage and salary employment'' than the household \n     survey, because the payroll survey has a larger sample and is \n     linked to the total employment count based on records of the \n     unemployment insurance tax.\n       You have indicated that eliminating the gender series is \n     necessary so that the Bureau can reduce the burden of the \n     survey on employers. But that benefit is miniscule compared \n     to the significant loss caused by the elimination of the data \n     series. The gender series is only a small portion of a survey \n     that, by your own estimate, takes only seven minutes to fill \n     out. Companies with 100 or more employees already have to \n     submit EEO-1 forms detailing the gender breakdown of their \n     workforce. In smaller companies, it is little burden to see \n     the number of male and female employees.\n       In light of the special importance of the gender series, we \n     urge you to continue to collect and provide these needed \n     data.\n           Sincerely,\n         Edward M.

Frank Lautenberg\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: We are writing to inform you that \n     the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced on August 5, \n     2005 that it would no longer collect the data on women \n     workers in the Current Employment Statistics Survey (CES). \n     These critical data are not collected by any other survey and \n     without it researchers cannot obtain a complete and accurate \n     picture of women's employment. We the 137 undersigned \n     organizations ask that Congress require BLS to continue \n     collecting these data in the Appropriations bill for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \n     for FY2006 that is currently being finalized.\n       The CES survey is a monthly nationwide survey of payroll \n     records that covers more than 300,000 businesses and provides \n     important industry data. The ``Women Worker Series'' consists \n     of one question in the CES survey: ``Enter the number of \n     employees from Column 1 who are women.'' This one question, \n     however, provides the only accurate picture of whether (and \n     in which industries) women are gaining or losing jobs in \n     response to economic restructuring, changes in the business \n     cycle, variation in labor supply and other factors. Because \n     men and women generally work in different parts of the labor \n     market, data that specifically track how women workers are \n     faring compared to men is essential. Combined data may mask \n     important differences in the experience of women and men \n     workers.\n       The reasons that BLS has given for terminating the \n     collection of these data do not hold up under scrutiny:\n       There Is No Substitute for the CES Survey: BLS has claimed \n     that ending the Women Workers Series does no harm, because \n     the Current Population Survey (``CPS'') collects extensive \n     data on women's employment status and is thereby an adequate \n     substitute. This is simply not true. The CPS data are \n     collected from households and individuals, whereas the CES is \n     collected from businesses, and thus, according to a former \n     BLS Commissioner, ``provides more reliable information on the \n     current trend of wage and salary employment.''\n       There is a High Response Rate for the CES Survey and It Is \n     Not Burdensome for Businesses: BLS claimed that discontinuing \n     the data collection from the single question about women \n     workers would reduce the burden on employers. As evidence of \n     this problem, they misleadingly stated that there was a low \n     response rate to this inquiry. In fact, the response rate to \n     this query is 86%--the second highest of any question on the \n     CES Survey. Further, the only organizations representing \n     businesses that submitted comments to BLS about the \n     discontinuation of this data collection all supported \n     continuing the data collection. Not only are businesses able \n     to respond to these queries easily, but the record shows that \n     they want the data collection to continue.\n       Researchers Use This Important Data: In announcing the \n     discontinuation of this data collection, BLS stated that it \n     was not widely used. This is not accurate either. Just this \n     past month, the Center for Economic and Policy Research \n     issued a report, ``Gender Bias in the Current Economic \n     Recovery? Declining Employment Rates for Women in the 21st \n     Century,'' based on the Women Worker Series in the CES. \n     Further, many of the thousands of comments submitted to BLS \n     in support of this data collection came from researchers at \n     such organizations as the New York Federal Reserve Bank and \n     the Consortium of Social Science Associations (including \n     sociologists, political scientists, and others).\n       Perhaps the greatest evidence for the importance of this \n     data is the outcry that arose after BLS announced it was \n     going to stop collecting it. News services around the country \n     ran the story. A bipartisan group of U.S. Representatives and \n     Senators opposed the decision. Researchers and women's \n     employment advocates pressed BLS to continue collecting the \n     data.\n       In fact, during the original comment period, five thousand \n     comments were submitted--running at least 9 to 1 in support \n     of continuing the data collection. The only comments \n     submitted by employers were in support of the continued \n     collection of the Women Workers Series.\n       Despite the overwhelming case in support of continuing the \n     Women Workers Series, and the underwhelming case for dropping \n     it, BLS announced that it would terminate the data collection \n     anyway.\n       Congress can, and should, require BLS to continue \n     collecting the Women Workers Series.\n       Please support a provision in the Labor-HHS-Education \n     Appropriations bill for FY 2006 to require BLS to continue \n     collecting the Women Workers Series on the CES Survey. This \n     information is critical to understanding the employment \n     status of women in America.

As you know, women today earn \n     76 cents for every dol1ar earned by men. They work \n     disproportionately in lower-paying occupations, and have far \n     lower lifetime earnings than men. By eliminating the CES \n     data, the Department will make it more difficult for \n     Congress, researchers, and policymakers to understand the \n     true nature of gender inequality in the workforce, and harm \n     our efforts to eliminate it.\n       I understand that the Department has received nearly 5,000 \n     comments about these proposed changes, and 90 percent of them \n     urged you to continue collecting the data on women workers. \n     The CES data are obviously the best sources of information on \n     employment trends, and are indispensable to any analysis of \n     job discrimination against women.\n       The Current Population Survey is not an adequate \n     substitute, since it provides a far less accurate view of \n     general employment trends than the payroll survey. The \n     benefit of reducing the burden of the CES survey on employers \n     is miniscule compared to the significant damage caused by \n     eliminating the data series.\n       In light of the importance of the series and the broad \n     support for its continuation, I urge you to continue to \n     collect and provide these essential data.\n       With respect and admiration,\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 16, 2005.\n     Ms. Amy A. Hobby,\n     Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Hobby: On behalf of the 505,000 women business \n     Women Impacting Public Policy (WIPP), in accordance with the \n     advisory authority granted us in Public Law 100-553, and on \n     behalf of Chair Marilyn Carlson Nelson and the other members \n     of the National Women's Business Council, I am writing you \n     today to comment upon proposed changes to the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics' Current Employment Statistics survey--in \n     particular the proposal that the information from this survey \n     no longer be made available by gender of worker.\n       As you may know, the mission of the National Women's \n     Business Council is to provide advice and counsel to the \n     President and his Administration and to the U.S. Congress on \n     issues of importance to women business owners and their \n     enterprises. In this capacity, we conduct research on issues \n     of importance to the women's community, communicate those \n     findings widely, connect the women's business community to \n     one another and to federal policy makers, and--in so doing--\n     create positive change for an estimated 15.6 million women \n     who are engaged in the sole or shared ownership of \n     approximately 10.6 million businesses in the United States.\n       Research has shown that among the greatest challenges faced \n     by women in business--in addition to access to capital, \n     training and technical assistance, markets and networks--is \n     being taken seriously as contributors to our economy. One of \n     the most significant ways in which women have achieved \n     visibility, and thus recognition, for their economic \n     contributions has been through the collection and \n     dissemination of statistics monitoring their participation in \n     the workforce, and their progression from non-supervisory to \n     managerial positions, and from there to self-employment and \n     business ownership. The gender-disaggregated information \n     currently available through the BLS' Current Employment \n     Statistics is a vital thread in the fabric of federal \n     government data on the economic contributions of women. \n     Regular, detailed information by industry and location is \n     critical to understanding women's employment patterns as well \n     as their progress (or lack thereof) over time.\n       The National Women's Business Council strongly opposes the \n     proposed elimination of the collection of gender-based \n     information from the CES. The elimination of gender as an \n     item in the survey would not save a significant amount of \n     money nor significantly reduce respondent burden, but--on the \n     other hand--it would seriously impede analysis and monitoring \n     of women's progress in the workforce and their contributions \n     to our economy.\n       We are supportive of proposed efforts to pursue optical \n     character recognition (OCR) and Web-based technologies to \n     enhance survey response rates, increase efficiency, and save \n     time and money.\n       We agree that such technologies have advanced to such a \n     point that they can be reasonably incorporated into the \n     survey methodology.\n       The Council welcomes the opportunity to provide the Bureau \n     of Labor Standards our thoughts and comments on these \n     important issues. We look forward to reading the comments of \n     other organizations and interested parties, and you can be \n     assured that the Council will closely monitor this most \n     important issue. Knowledge fuels action, and one cannot \n     responsibly react to and manage that which is not measured. \n     The BLS has played an important role in women's economic \n     development through the information published from the CES, \n     CPS and other surveys. Again, it is vitally important that \n     gender-disaggregated information continue to be made \n     available to federal policy makers, to advisory bodies like \n     the National Women's Business Council, and to the women's \n     business community at large.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Julie R. Weeks,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Women Impacting Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Federal Reserve Bank of New York,\n\n                                  New York, NY, February 22, 2005.\n     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n     Division of Current Employment Statistics, Washington, DC.\n       To the Bureau of Labor Statistics: This letter is in \n     response to the request for public comment on the proposed \n     discontinuation of the Women Workers Series (WWS) from the \n     Current Employment Series. Economists in the Research and \n     Statistics Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \n     recently learned of the existence of the WWS and are \n     currently engaged in research using it to study the gender \n     differences that underlie the unusual recent cyclical pattern \n     of employment.\n       The attached is a synopsis of preliminary findings that \n     suggest that time series patterns of employment for men and \n     women are different, vary among recessions, and show no \n     evidence of recent convergence. The approach follows recent \n     work by Erica Groshen and Simon Potter (published in the \n     August 2003 edition of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's \n     Current Issues in Economics and Finance) that finds it likely \n     that the recent recession had a stronger cyclical component \n     than previous recessions.\n       Gender disparities are of particular interest at the moment \n     because the labor force participation rate for women during \n     the past recession has fallen more than usual and as yet \n     shows no sign of recovery. These results have interesting \n     policy implications if they allow us insight into whether the \n     decline in participation indicates enhanced cyclicality or a \n     secular drop in women's labor force participation.\n       Our previous understanding of sectoral reallocations and \n     heterogeneity is based largely on analysis of industry-level \n     CES aggregate data. Household-based data series have too much \n     sampling error to allow analysis by industry much beyond the \n     1-digit level and are not seasonally adjusted. The technique \n     used here relies on seasonally adjusted data with more \n     disaggregation than is available from the Current Population \n     Survey (CPS)--particularly on a timely basis (that is, before \n     the CPS microdata are released). It also requires a long time \n     series, since recessions are rare events. CPS data are sparse \n     before the 1980s.\n       The lack of prior use of the WWS may reflect the lack of \n     visibility of the series on the BLS website and in news \n     releases. Indeed, Groshen and Potter learned of its existence \n     only this fall, when they discovered it in the Haver \n     Analytics DLX database. Despite their many years of research \n     in labor\n\n[[Page S11905]]\n\n     economics, neither had encountered it before.\n       In light of our experience and intriguing recent findings, \n     we do not support elimination of the WWS. Rather than \n     discontinue an informative series with such a long history, \n     we suggest that the BLS consider highlighting its existence \n     among the community of data users and issuing a periodic \n     release. Use might rise substantially. Such an effort would \n     be the best way to judge the advisability of taking the \n     drastic step of eliminating the WWS at a time when it may be \n     particularly useful for understanding current macroeconomic \n     phenomena.\n       Thank you for your consideration on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Joseph S. Tracy,\n\n                                      Executive Vice President and\n                                             Director of Research.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and we call up amendment 2244.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is currently pending.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment requires the Secretary to \nissue a new ``Medicare & You'' handbook. There are many errors in the \nhandbook. The book should be reissued and mailed out again. This has \nbeen cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2244) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I ask consent that at a time determined by \nthe majority leader, with concurrence of the Democratic leader, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1042, the Defense authorization \nbill, and it be considered under the following limitations: All of the \npending amendments be withdrawn and the bill be considered as follows: \nthe only first-degree amendments in order be up to 12 amendments to be \noffered by each of the two leaders or their designees; provided further \nthat the amendments be within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nArmed Services or relevant to the underlying bill; further, that these \namendments be subject to second degrees which are to be relevant to the \namendment to which they are offered; provided further that first-degree \namendments be limited to 1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual \nform, with any second degrees limited to 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided; provided further that the only other amendments in order other \nthan the above-listed amendments be those managers' amendments which \nhave been cleared by both managers of the bill.\n  I further ask that there be 2 hours of general debate on the bill \ndivided between the two managers. Finally, I ask consent that at the \nexpiration of that time and the disposition of the above amendments, \nthe bill be read the third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill as amended, if amended, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased we were finally able to reach \na consent agreement on this very important bill that we have attempted \nto address more fully twice in the past, the Defense authorization \nbill. This will allow the Senate to return to the bill and complete it \nin a timely manner, in an orderly manner, with the amendments that are \nrelevant to the issue at hand; that is,the issue of providing for our \narmed services. We will look for an appropriate window of time to \nresume the bill. I believe, under the guidance of the experienced \nchairman and ranking member, we should be able to complete that bill \nwithin 2 or possibly 3 days.\n  I thank everyone for working so hard to bring us to this point, for \ntheir patience and cooperation, and allowing us to go forward with this \nagreement, and I look forward to completion of that Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is not the time for protracted debate \non why we are here, why we are not here. We are here. One of the most \nimportant bills this Congress must decide every year is this Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The majority leader and the two managers of the bill, Senator Warner \nand Senator Levin, know--because I have sent them every letter I have \nsent to my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Tennessee--I \nstrongly support the Senate consideration of the Defense authorization \nbill since it was unanimously passed by the Committee on Armed Services \nlast May. We have a lot to do around here. I suggest there is nothing \nmore important than taking care of the U.S. military. This is not the \nway to handle the bill, I recognize that, but it is the only way left \nwe can handle this bill.\n  I hope the two managers can help work through these amendments. I \nknow they are ready to accept scores of amendments once we get to this \nbill. I hope the 12 on each side are amendments that will be good for \nthe Senate, good for this institution, and, of course, very good for \nthe armed services of our country. If that is the case, it will be good \nfor our country.\n  As I have said, this is not a time for pointing fingers. I am glad we \nare here even though that is not how I wanted to get here.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank our distinguished two \nleaders. On behalf of Senator Levin and myself, we assure our two \nleaders we will deal with this expeditiously, with the cooperation of \nthe Senate. I am certain we can have an armed services bill this year. \nThis is a nation at war. We have no alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 2248, 2250, and 2249, en bloc\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we have several amendments to consider \nthis evening. I will be very brief.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up three amendments, to talk about \nthem in 5 minutes, and then to set a vote whenever it is within the \npurview of the managers: amendment Nos. 2248, 2250, and 2249.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes \n     amendments en bloc numbered 2248, 2250, and 2249.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, first of all, all three of these \namendments are small in number but important in scope. Each seeks to \ntake money that is already appropriated in the underlying bill and \ndirect and target it, if you will, to the gulf coast area for some \nextraordinary needs. We have been struggling to find a way to provide \nfor the unprecedented natural disaster that has occurred in the Rita-\nKatrina areas of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  There are many important programs in this bill that seek to send \nimportant aid around the Nation. There are three programs I have chosen \nto bring to the attention of the Senate tonight in very small amounts \nthat could provide great help to the people of our region.\n  One is the TRIO Program, which has been extremely successful in \nhelping first-generation college students to pursue a degree. Of \ncourse, we know 80 percent of all jobs in the future will require some \ncollege. This TRIO Program is federally funded but locally led and has \nbeen extremely effective, with great support from Republicans and \nDemocrats, the House and the Senate.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to target $5 million of the money in \nhere toward Katrina-related areas--Katrina-Rita--to make sure our \nuniversities and the thousands of students who have been displaced can \nhave a little extra funding to help them at this time.\n  The second amendment has to do with community health centers that are \ngoing to see, because of the good work of the ranking member and the \nchairman, an increase of $105 million in a competitive grant--\nadditional money for community health centers. One of these amendments \ntakes just 10 percent of the increase of $105 million and directs it to \nKatrina-Rita areas, as we have to stand up a new health care system for \nthe region. It would be given out by the Department. Again, it is \nanother way to not add money but to just direct and target money that \nwe are already spending--not taking it away from anyone but targeting \nsome of the increase to our region.\n  Finally, the third amendment would do the same thing for mosquito \nabatement. We are hopeful we will not get the avian flu that seems \nheaded our way. For those in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, we \nworry about the disease that can be spread--West Nile--by mosquitos. \nOur health officials say the mosquito populations, because of the \nextraordinary flooding, have increased by 800 percent. Since October \n18, there have been 81 cases and 6 fatalities. Again, my amendment \ntakes money that is already designated and sends $5 million of the $40 \nmillion to the Katrina-Rita areas.\n  I ask my colleagues to look favorably on these three amendments. \nAgain, they are small amounts of money, but they could go a long way. \nThey do not add money to the deficit. They do not take money away from \nanyone else because we are taking a portion of the increase. That \nportion is based on our population in the region.\n  It is quite reasonable. I hope the managers will accept them. If not, \nwe can have a vote sometime tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2265, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I call up amendment 2265, and I send a modification to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] and Mr. Feingold, \n     propose an amendment numbered 2265, as modified.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To fund grants for innovative programs to address dental \n                            workforce needs)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. From amounts appropriated to the Health Resources \n     and Services Administration, $5,000,000 shall be available to \n     fund grants for innovative programs to address dental \n     workforce needs under section 340G of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 246g).\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, 3 years ago, the Senate enacted and the \nPresident signed into law the Dental Health Improvement Act as part of \nthe health care safety net amendments of 2002. This was legislation \nauthored by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, and myself which \nauthorized grants to States to help them develop innovative dental \nworkforce development programs tailored to their specific needs.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment with my colleague from Wisconsin \nto provide $5 million for this important program next year to help \nStates improve access to oral health care by strengthening the dental \nworkforce in our Nation's rural and underserved communities.\n  While oral health in America has improved dramatically over the last \n50 years, these improvements have not occurred evenly across all \nsectors of our population. Particularly, our low-income families have \nbeen left out. An estimated 25 million Americans live in areas lacking \nin adequate dental services. Astoundingly, as many as 11 percent of our \nNation's rural population has never been to a dentist.\n  The situation is exacerbated by the fact that our dental workforce is \ngrowing older. More than 20 percent of dentists nationwide will retire \nin the next decade. The number of dental graduates by 2015 will not be \nenough to replace these retirees. As a consequence, many States, \nparticularly rural States like mine, are facing a serious shortage of \ndentists. In Maine, there is one general practice dentist for every \n2,300 people in the Portland area. But the numbers drop off \ndramatically in other parts of our State. In Aroostook County, for \nexample, which is where I am from, there is only 1 dentist for every \n5,500 people. And of the 23 practicing dentists in Aroostook County, \nonly 6 are taking on new patients. Moreover, at a time when tooth decay \nis the most prevalent childhood disease in America, Maine has fewer \nthan 10 specialists in pediatric dentistry, and virtually all of them \nare located in the southern part of the State.\n\n[[Page S11907]]\n\n  The Collins-Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act authorized a new \nState grant program administered by the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration that is designed to improve access to oral health \nservices in rural or underserved areas.\n  Now, States could use these grants for a variety of programs. For \nexample, they might use the grant for loan forgiveness or repayment \nprograms for dentists practicing in underserved areas. They could also \nuse the grant funds to establish or expand community- or school-based \ndental clinics or to set up mobile or portable dental facilities.\n  To assist in their recruitment and retention efforts, States could \nuse the funds for placement and support of dental students, residents, \nand advanced dentistry trainees. Or they could use the grants for \ncontinuing education, for distance-based education, and practice \nsupport through teledentistry.\n  Our amendment is supported by the American Dental Association, the \nAmerican Dental Education Association, the American Dental Hygienists \nAssociation, and other members of the Dental Access Coalition. It is \nalso fully offset.\n  There is clearly a need to make our oral health care services more \naccessible in our Nation's rural and underserved communities.\n  Again, I end my remarks with what I think is a troubling and \nastonishing statistic; and that is, that 11 percent of rural Americans \nhave never been to the dentist. This is a serious public health \nchallenge, and this modest investment could make a real difference.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join Senator Feingold and me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  I thank the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for working so \nclosely with us to identify an appropriate offset.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2285\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 2285 be called up and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2285.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To insert provisions related to an investigation by the \n                           Inspector General)\n\n       At the end of title II (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) There are appropriated $3,000,000 to the \n     Office of Inspector General to conduct a investigation of the \n     management of the Food and Drug Administration to pursue \n     examples of mismanagement and promote economy and efficiency \n     in the Department.\n       (b) The investigation under subsection (a) shall not \n     include any investigation of a former Commissioner of Food \n     and Drugs, but shall include investigation of the actions by \n     the Food and Drug Administration with respect to the over-\n     the-counter application for the drug Plan B.\n       (c) Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Inspector General shall complete the \n     investigation under this section and submit a report to the \n     Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education \n     and Related Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate on the findings of such investigation.\n       (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, \n     amounts made available under this Act for the Office of the \n     Secretary shall be reduced by $3,000,000 and transferred to \n     the Office of Inspector General to conduct the investigation \n     under this section.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to offer an amendment \nthat really need not be offered. In fact, each time I come to the floor \nof the Senate to talk about Plan B and the FDA, I hope it will be the \nlast time. I continue to hope that the FDA or Health and Human Services \nwill do the right thing and finally put science and safety and efficacy \nover politics. Unfortunately, over the course of the past several \nyears, as you can see by the timeline shown behind me, I, along with \nmillions of Americans, have been disappointed time and time again.\n  I have always supported a strong and independent Food and Drug \nAdministration. It is the only way in which the FDA can truly operate \neffectively and with the confidence of American consumers and health \ncare providers. Americans have to have faith that when they walk into \ntheir local grocery store or their local pharmacy, the products they \npurchase are safe, effective, and that their approval has been based on \nsound science.\n  They have to be assured that those decisions were not based on \npolitical pressure or pandering to interest groups. That is why the \napplication process for Plan B emergency contraceptives has been so \ntroubling to me and many others.\n  Back in December of 2003, almost 2 years ago, the FDA's own \nscientific advisory board overwhelmingly recommended approval of Plan \nB's over-the-counter application by a vote of 23 to 4. But the FDA has \nnot adhered to its own guidelines for drug approval and continues to \nthis day, after all of these actions, to drag its feet.\n  In fact, Alastair Wood, who is a member of the advisory panel, said:\n\n       What's disturbing is that the science was overwhelming \n     here, and the FDA is supposed to make decisions based on \n     science.\n\n  It is obvious to me and to many of my colleagues--and to millions of \nAmerican women and men--that something other than science is going on \nat the FDA. It is far past time to get to the bottom of it. That is why \ntonight I am offering this amendment which will shift $3 million from \nthe Office of the Secretary to the Office of the Inspector General at \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. This funding will help the \ninspector general's office to investigate potential mismanagement at \nthe FDA. This investigation will be separate from ongoing \ninvestigations of the former Commissioner, Lester Crawford, and it will \ninclude, but not be limited to, over-the-counter application for Plan \nB.\n  Let me be clear: The men and women of the FDA work very hard. They \nadhere to the principles of science. They do a job that all Americans \ncan be proud of. But their hard work is being undermined and it is \novershadowed by the Agency's own leadership. If the leadership at the \nFDA and HHS don't take steps to restore the confidence of American \nconsumers in the FDA's ability to promote safe and effective \ntreatments, then Congress has a duty to step in. The health and well-\nbeing of the American people should not blow with the political winds. \nCaring for the people we represent is an American issue, and part of \nthat goal is reassuring that Americans have access to safe, effective \nmedicines in a timely fashion.\n  Time and time again, I, along with my colleague, Senator Clinton of \nNew York, and others, have asked for a decision on Plan B. We have not \ndictated that we want a yes. We have not dictated that we want a no. We \nhave simply said: We want a decision. This continued foot dragging--day \nafter day, month after month, year after year--is unusual, unwarranted, \nand unprofessional. This continued delay goes against everything the \nFDA's own advisory panel found nearly 2 years ago: that Plan B is safe \nand it is effective and should be available over the counter. There is \nno credible scientific reason to continue to deny increased access to \nthis safe health care option, but there is even less reason to deny an \nanswer.\n  This is not the last word on this issue. The problem with politics \nsubverting the FDA's adherence to science and its integrity is so \nprofound and so urgent, I intend to use every tool available to me as a \nSenator to make sure that this discussion about our priorities and our \nfuture is not lost.\n  I ask my colleagues to do what we tell the FDA to do, which is to \nmake decisions based on science and safety and efficacy true, and we \ndon't turn the gold standard we have at the FDA into a mockery. It \nwould be a disservice to every citizen, every American who walks into a \ndrugstore and counts on the fact that when they buy a drug over the \ncounter or a prescription, they know it is safe and effective.\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\n  This is an urgent matter. That is why I am on the floor to offer my \namendment, which will simply shift money from the Office of the \nSecretary to the Office of the Inspector General, so we can get to the \nbottom of it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, is there an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2193, as Modified\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I call for the regular order on my \namendment No. 2193 and would like to speak in support of that.\n  I rise today, along with my colleagues, Senators Conrad, Crapo, \nBrownback, Talent, Chafee, and Burns, in support of an amendment that \nis pending at the desk that would provide funding to the Office for \nAdvancement of Telehealth, located under the Health Resources and \nServices Administration.\n  Telehealth is not only an important component of health care in rural \nStates like South Dakota; it is important to patients and health care \nproviders throughout the United States.\n  Telehealth is an innovation that promises greater access and higher \nquality health care with reduced costs. Telehealth uses \ntelecommunications and information technologies to provide health care \nservices at a distance. These communications and information \ntechnologies provide people access to quality health care in \nunderserved areas.\n  Three years ago, Congress enacted a bill called the Health Care \nSafety Net Amendments Act of 2002. This legislation was approved \nunanimously in the Senate and passed the House with only five \ndissenting votes. Section 211 of the bill provided the authority for \nCongress to fund at least $60 million for certain telehealth \nactivities.\n  Sadly, 3 years have passed and Congress has yet to appropriate a dime \nfor these important provisions. My amendment provides $10 million for \nthe telehealth activities authorized by the 2002 Health Care Safety Net \nAmendments. This is one-sixth of the authorized amount and less than \none percent--one-seventh of one percent--of the budget for HRSA.\n  Specifically, my amendment would appropriate $2.5 million for the \ndevelopment of 10 telehealth resource centers. These centers, two of \nwhich are required to be located in a State with less than 1.5 million \npeople, would help assist the telehealth community in breaking down \nbarriers to the adoption of telehealth.\n  My amendment also provides $5 million for network grants and grants \nfor telehomecare pilot projects. In order to be efficient and \neffective, telemedicine must have strong telecommunication networks.\n  In addition to these grants, my amendment provides $2.5 million for \ngrants to State health licensing boards to develop and implement \ncooperative policies that reduce statutory and regulatory barriers to \ntelehealth.\n  S. 1418, the Wired for Health Care Quality Act, introduced by Senator \nEnzi on July 18, specifically reauthorizes Section 330L(b) of the \nPublic Health Service Act, which allows the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to make grants to State professional licensing boards to \nreduce statutory and regulatory barriers to telemedicine. My amendment \nsimply appropriates funds for this authorization.\n  Last year, the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth within HRSA \nwas funded at only $3.9 million. OAT was only able to make 14 \ncompetitive grant awards. The budget for this lead agency for \ntelehealth has been cut by \\1/3\\ over the past 5 years.\n  Congress spoke when it passed with broad bipartisan support the \nHealth Care Safety Net Amendments Act of 2002. It is time to put our \nmoney where our mouth is and start to put some real resources in this \narea.\n  Last year, we provided absolutely no funds for the telehealth safety \nnet provisions. Surely we can find a way to provide $10 million in the \nentire budget for one of the most promising opportunities to help \ncontrol the rising cost of health care.\n  My amendment does not break the budget caps. It merely reallocates \n$10 million for telehealth services from the billions in administrative \ncosts in this budget. On July 8, 2005 a letter was sent to Chairman \nSpecter and Ranking Member Harkin on behalf of over 200 individuals and \ntelehealth organizations across the country, supporting an increase in \nfunding for telehealth.\n  My amendment answers their call for funding and wider adoption of \ntelehealth.\n  Telehealth has the promise of delivering quality, efficient health \ncare to individuals in remote, isolated or even devastated areas. \nTelehealth applications have been proven effective in extending \nmedicine's reach to underserved areas across the Nation.\n  The $10 million provided by my amendment, while modest, will have an \nimpact on almost every health activity in this giant bill.\n  Additionally, my amendment is fully offset by reducing the \ndepartmental management accounts of the Department of Labor, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the Department of \nEducation pro rata by .0065 percent. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas declared this amendment as budget neutral.\n  This is a very small investment in the future of our Nation's health \ncare system. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Of all the things we will debate in this particular bill about how to \nlower health care costs, how to make quality health care more available \nto more people, the promise of telehealth can do more to meet that \ncritical objection than almost anything else. This is taking state-of-\nthe-art technology and thinking, state-of-the-art information systems \nand applying them in a way that can meet health care needs across the \ncountry, not just in rural areas, but also in urban ones. It is high \ntime we took advantage of this incredible asset and put it to work for \nhealth care needs of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter from the American Hospital Association in support of my \namendment. Some examples of the organizations that support my amendment \nare the following: Home Care Technology Association of America; Center \nfor Telemedicine Law; Federation of State Medical Boards, Consumer \nHealth Access Through Technology Coalition; American Telemedicine \nAssociation; National Rural Health Association; Northland Healthcare \nAlliance; University of Missouri Health Care; Northcentral Montana \nHealthcare Alliance; Avera McKennan Telehealth Network; Avera St. \nLuke's; Rapid City Regional Hospital Home Care Department; Horizon \nHealth Care, Inc.; Sioux Valley Telehealth; Sioux Valley Visiting \nNurses; South Dakota Board of Nursing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                                 October 25, 2005.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thune: The American Hospital Association, on \n     behalf of our 4,800 member hospitals, health systems and \n     other health care organizations, and our 33,000 individual \n     members, is pleased to support your amendment to the fiscal \n     year (FY) 2006 Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education appropriations bill adding $10 million for \n     telehealth activities authorized by the Health Care Safety \n     Net Amendments of 2002. We applaud your effort to fund these \n     activities, which can play a vital role in increasing access \n     to health care services for underserved rural and urban \n     populations.\n       Congress overwhelmingly passed the Health Care Safety Net \n     Amendments, and in doing so authorized more than $80 million \n     in grants to help providers overcome technical, legal, \n     regulatory, and service delivery barriers to implementing \n     telehealth programs. Several urban and rural hospitals would \n     be among those who would benefit from these grant programs, \n     which, unfortunately, have never received funding.\n       Your amendment will provide a vital downpayment toward the \n     resources needed to implement telehealth programs. These \n     programs have the potential to expand access to health care \n     services, improve training of health care providers, and \n     expand the quality of available health information. As a \n     result, hospitals will be better able to overcome many of the \n     barriers to telehealth technology adoption and work to \n     further improve the safety net for underserved populations, \n     as envisioned by the Health Care Safety Net Amendments.\n\n[[Page S11909]]\n\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues to \n     ensure passage of this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Rick Pollack,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2193, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit funding for the support, development, or \n   distribution of the Department of Education's e-Language Learning \n                             System (ELLS))\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION REGARDING THE E-LANGUAGE LEARNING \n                   SYSTEM.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none of \n     the funds made available under this Act shall be used to \n     support, develop, or distribute the Department of Education's \n     e-Language Learning System (ELLS).\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2213\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nin the failure of this body to approve an amendment offered yesterday \nby Senator Kennedy to increase the financial support provided to \nstudents though the Pell Grant program.\n  Pell Grants represent by far the largest source Federal grant aid for \npostsecondary education and provide necessary financial support for \nmany students. My support of this amendment echoes the first piece of \nlegislation I introduced in the Senate and a promise I made during my \nSenate campaign. That promise, and that legislation, was the Higher \nEducation Opportunity through Pell Grant Expansion Act of 2005, S.697--\nthe HOPE Act. My statement today expresses my continuing efforts on \nbehalf of students who need our support to continue their education.\n  Many students know that realizing their dreams depends on a college \ndiploma, and, for many, the chance to earn that diploma is dependent on \nthe Pell Grant program. As students dream of that diploma, they also \nworry about how to pay for it. The statistics confirm their worries. \nCollege tuition is rising almost 1 percent a year, and over the last 25 \nyears, it's gone up more than fivefold. Because of these rising prices, \nover 200,000 students were priced out of college altogether just last \nyear.\n  Today, need-based Pell Grants are used by 5.3 million undergraduate \nstudents, and 85 percent of these grants go to families earning less \nthan $40,000. Over too long of a period, the amount of these awards has \nnot kept up with the spiraling price of tuition or even with the rate \nof inflation. As a result, the current $4,050 Pell Grant maximum is \ninsufficient.\n  This amendment would have raised that amount to $4,250, and \nrepresented one step toward making college more affordable for those \nstudents who have worked hard to keep alive their hope of earning a \ncollege diploma. Even in this time of shared sacrifice, I believe we \nmust continue to support those hopes and the students who deserve a \nchance to turn them into reality. This remains a priority for me. \nDespite yesterday's vote, I will continue to work to increase support \nfor our students though the Pell Grant Program.\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, due to skyrocketing home \nenergy prices, millions of low-income households are facing an imminent \nheating emergency this winter. The Department of Energy projects the \naverage family to incur heating costs of $1,099 or more this winter; an \nincrease of 30-48 percent over last year's heating bills.\n  This is a concern, as volatile and record-high energy costs will \ninevitably lead to an increase in the number of missed mortgage \npayments and foreclosures.\n  LIHEAP is a very positive, effective partnership between the Federal \nGovernment, State governments and the private sector.\n  Leveraging private dollars to supplement Federal dollars, LIHEAP has \nproven that successful relationships can exist between the government, \nbusinesses, gas and electric utilities and community-based social \nservice organizations.\n  While States, local governments and the private sector have \ndemonstrated their capacity to develop programs to address some energy \nassistance needs, collectively these programs cannot meet the demand \nfor LIHEAP assistance. The need for energy assistance continues. \nHowever, we must ensure that we are addressing this assistance in a \nfiscally responsible way.\n  That is why, along with Senator Carper, I have filed an amendment to \nprovide an offset for funding for LIHEAP.\n  Specifically, my amendment increases the amount in the LIHEAP program \nby $1.6 billion.\n  Because of the severe budget deficits this country is facing today, I \nfeel like wherever practical, we need to consider offsets.\n  That is why my amendment offsets this increase by using 3 changes in \ntax policy that have passed the Senate on numerous occasions--most \nrecently as part of the Highway bill this past May. Unfortunately, \nthese offsets were stripped in conference, which is why they are once \nagain available for our use here to pay for additional funding for \nLIHEAP.\n  I am very hopeful my amendment will clear all necessary procedural \nhurdles to be considered on the Labor HHS appropriations bill. I will \ncontinue to encourage my colleagues to support a responsible offset for \nLIHEAP funding now and in the future. This is a critical program, but \nwe are also facing a critical time with our budget and increased \ndeficit spending--both are serious issues that require serious \nsolutions.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2212\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I would like to speak on an amendment to \nH.R. 3010 that I was proud to introduce with the support of Senator \nDurbin. This amendment increases funding for a program in the \nDepartment of Education that has proven success in improving student \nbehavior and school climate in thousands of schools across the country: \nPositive Behavioral Interventions and Support.\n  A problem I hear about from teachers all the time is that disruptive \nstudents slow down the rest of the class, and can turn our schools into \nplaces unworthy of our most precious resource--our children. To help \nteachers in doing their important work of educating our children, I \npropose that we expand an\n\n[[Page S11910]]\n\ninnovative program, already being used in states such as Illinois, that \nteaches students about positive behavior and expects the adults in our \nschools to set the same high standards for behavior as they do for \nachievement.\n  This system is called Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports. \nPBIS is designed to deal with discipline problems in a research-based, \nexperimentally-verified way, based on one simple premise: stop problem \nbehavior before it starts. The problem might be a general lack of \ndiscipline, increasing school violence, or a loss of instructional time \nbecause of behavioral issues. PBIS has shown that schools benefit from \nunified and efficient interventions that specifically teach, model, and \nreward good behavior, while providing consequences for problem \nbehavior.\n  Kids are smart. When a school has clear and effective expectations, \nagreed to by the adults in the school, they respond positively. When \nthe expectations are disputed and ineffective, kids exploit the \nsituation.\n  PBIS shows positive results. At one school in Illinois, when PBIS was \nimplemented, suspensions decreased 85 percent, there was more time for \nteaching, and student test scores increased. It makes sense: with fewer \ndisruptions, students can stay on task more, and so learn more. \nSuccesses such as these have been replicated in thousands of schools \nacross the country.\n  Today, I am proposing that we expand our support for this technical \nassistance program in the Office of Special Education Programs at the \nDepartment of Education. PBIS has proven itself, and has already been \nadopted by many schools. Let's give all our children the benefit of \nhigh expectations and supports for good behavior. Let's give all our \nschools the opportunity to adopt this system. Let's support our kids by \nsupporting PBIS.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ROYBAL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it was a great privilege for me to serve in \nthe House of Representatives. I loved my job in the House for a lot of \nreasons, one of which is I got to know a man by the name of Ed Roybal \nreal well. Congressman Ed Roybal died Monday. I will sure miss him. My \nthoughts and my prayers are with his wonderful family.\n  For those of us who knew him, it is a time to reflect and really be \nsad. I remember Congressman Roybal as a very quiet man, with an \nunwavering commitment to justice and compassion. He was not much for \ngiving speeches, but he was much for getting work done. He worked \ntirelessly over the past four decades on behalf of the poor, the \nelderly, those who are disenfranchised.\n  To get a glimpse of the kind of man he was, here he is, a senior \nMember of the House of Representatives, chairman of the Aging \nCommittee, and one of the leaders on the Appropriations Committee. My \ndear wife became extremely ill, and she spent more than a month at UCLA \nMedical Center. I had just been elected to the Senate. I would fly from \nhere to L.A. Ed Roybal would meet me at the airport and drive me to the \nhospital. That is the kind of guy he was.\n  He was always there for the people of California, just like he was \nthere for his friend from Nevada. For the people of California and this \ncountry, he fought to increase educational, political, and economic \nopportunities.\n  As an advocate for Hispanics, he had no peer. He was a pioneer and a \nrelentless leader. When he was young, Ed Roybal created an organization \ncalled Community Service Organization. This group began a crusade \nagainst discrimination in housing, employment, and education and also \nconducted voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives within the \nLatino community.\n  It is my understanding that he was the first Hispanic elected to the \nLos Angeles City Council--if not, he was one of the first. He was \nelected to Congress in 1963, the first Hispanic from California to \nserve since 1879. When he came to Washington, Ed Roybal was one of the \nfew people fighting for the progress of Latinos. There was no \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus when he arrived, so he created one. It \nwas founded by Ed Roybal. Later in 1976, he helped create the National \nAssociation of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.\n  Getting more Hispanics involved in the political process was a \npassion of his, and he was a mentor of many Latinos. As part of this \neffort, he cofounded the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. To \nthis day, this organization is bringing a new generation of talented \nLatinos into the political system and supporting them as they follow in \nEd's footsteps.\n  I served on his Aging Committee. His fingerprints are all over the \nlast major immigration bill we had here. I went to Ed Roybal to find \nout how I should vote. I had great confidence in his integrity.\n  I wish we could all have known Ed as I felt I knew him. Everyone in \nGovernment should have known Ed Roybal. He, to me, was a shining \nexample of what Government is all about: selfless, compassionate, \ncommitted to equality. He lent his voice and his life to making the \nAmerican dream a reality for everyone.\n  On a more personal level, he loved to come to Las Vegas. He loved Las \nVegas. I talked with his daughter, Lucille, yesterday and reminded her \nof that. She said: Yes, but he always left his credit cards at home. He \nonly took enough money so he could have a good time. He would be there \nfor me. He did Hispanic conferences for me. He did Aging Committee \nhearings. He was always there for me.\n  I know how proud he was of his daughter, Congresswoman Lucille \nRoybal-Allard. She has taken up his cause, so his legacy lives on in \nher work. But the burden does not fall only on her; it falls on us all.\n  When he died, opportunity lost one of its greatest champions. It is \nup to all of us to pick up on his absence and continue opening doors \nand building an America that works for everyone.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nAmerican, former Congressman Edward Roybal, who passed away on October \n24, 2005, at the age of 89.\n  My heartfelt sympathy goes out to his family, especially to his \ndaughter, my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard.\n  As his friends and family gather to pay tribute and celebrate Ed's \nremarkable life, I ask all of my colleagues to join with me in paying \ntribute to the memory of this outstanding public servant.\n  Ed Roybal devoted over 50 years of his life to public service, 30 of \nthose years as a Member of the House of Representatives from 1962 to \n1992. During that time, Ed was a steadfast advocate on behalf of those \nwithout a voice.\n  His long and distinguished career in public service began in 1942. \nHaving returned to Los Angeles, upon completion of military service, he \nbecame a director of health education for the Los Angeles County \nTuberculosis and Health Association.\n  In 1949, he established the Community Service Organization to \nadvocate for the rights of minorities in the areas of housing, \nemployment, and education. That same year, he was elected to the Los \nAngeles City Council where he served until 1962.\n  When Ed was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1962, he \nwas the first Hispanic from California to serve in Congress since the \n1879 election of Romualdo Pacheco.\n  During his three decades of service in the House, Ed worked \ntirelessly to protect the rights of minorities, the elderly, and the \nphysically challenged.\n  Together with Senator Ralph Yarborough of Texas, he championed the \n1968 Bilingual Education Act to assist the Nation's schools in meeting \nthe educational needs of children who come from non-English speaking \nhomes. Later, he worked to establish a Cabinet Committee on \nOpportunities for Spanish- speaking people.\n  Ed Roybal was a national leader for the Latino Community. In 1976, he \nbecame one of the founding members of\n\n[[Page S11911]]\n\nthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus and served as its first chairman.\n  Ed also played an important role in the passing of legislation to \noutlaw age discrimination, and he worked for numerous benefits and \nopportunities for those with handicaps.\n  Ed also continued to champion healthcare issues throughout his career \nin Congress. He led efforts to fund America's first AIDS research and \ntreatment programs and was instrumental in renewing legislation to \nprovide medical service to people with Alzheimer's disease. In \nrecognition of his leadership on health care issues, the county of Los \nAngeles opened the Edward R. Roybal Clinic in East Los Angeles in 1976.\n  Over the course of his life, Ed cofounded several other organizations \nto increase civic participation of Hispanics, including the National \nAssociation of Latino Elected Officials and the Mexican American \nPolitical Association.\n  Ed Roybal was a true leader and pioneer for the City of Los Angeles, \nthe State of California, and for the national Latino community. I feel \nvery lucky to have known him. I know my colleagues join me in extending \nto his family our deepest sympathy and condolences. He will be greatly \nmissed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, California and the Nation have lost a \nunique leader with the passing of former Congressman Ed Roybal.\n  In 1922, Ed Roybal moved to Los Angeles from New Mexico with his \nparents. He graduated from Roosevelt High School and attended UCLA \nbefore going off to fight in World War II. When he returned from the \nwar, he returned to Los Angeles and joined the County's Department of \nHealth Education in its County Tuberculosis and Health Association.\n  In 1947, Ed Roybal decided to run for a seat on the Los Angeles City \nCouncil in a district that was remarkably diverse and included Boyle \nHeights, Bunker Hill, Civic Center, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, and the \nCentral Avenue District. Though he lost this race, he returned in 1949, \nwinning in the same district. In part, his victory was based on a well \norganized effort to register Latino voters in the district. With this \nvictory, he became the first Latino to serve on the Los Angeles City \nCouncil since 1881. He would serve on the council until 1962, when he \nwas elected to the U.S. Congress.\n  When he took his seat in the House of Representatives in Washington, \nDC, Ed Roybal remembered his constituents and his roots. He worked \ntirelessly to ensure that Latinos were represented and that their \ninterests were not diluted by redistricting changes. He often stood \nalone in these efforts.\n  Ed Roybal was also a tireless advocate for the elderly, and the \nworking poor. He served as chairman of both the Select Committee on \nAging and the Subcommittee on Health and Long Term Care, guiding \nlegislation on health care, Social Security, housing and human \nservices. He also helped to establish important programs in southern \nCalifornia, including scholarship programs at local colleges and \nuniversities.\n  In 1992, Ed Roybal was fourth in seniority in the House of \nRepresentatives and known as a legislator's legislator, crafting and \npassing landmark legislation. It was then that he opted for retirement, \nwith his daughter, Lucille Roybal-Allard, running for and winning his \nseat. A generation of Latino leaders have followed in Ed Roybal's \nsteps, including his daughter. It is very fitting that Congresswoman \nRoybal-Allard's office can be found in the Edward R. Roybal Federal \nBuilding in downtown Los Angeles. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsending my deepest condolences to Congresswoman Roybal-Allard and her \nfamily on their personal loss.\n  California and its leadership have undergone remarkable changes since \nEd Roybal first ran and won a seat on the Los Angeles City Council in \n1949 and was later elected to Congress in 1962. Following his \nleadership and example, Latinos are represented in the Congress, in the \nstate legislature and lead our most populous cities. And people across \nour Nation who depend on Social Security, who need medical care and who \nwork for fair and representative elections can be grateful today for Ed \nRoybal's vital service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11911-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11911-S11913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF ROSA L. PARKS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \npassing of a great American, Mrs. Rosa L. Parks. Mrs. Parks was a woman \nof dignity, spirit and conviction, and throughout her life, she \ndemonstrated immense courage in her quest to achieve equality for all \nAmericans.\n  On December 1, 1955, Mrs. Parks made a decision that altered the \ncourse of American history. When asked by the driver of a Montgomery, \nAL, bus to give up her seat to a white man, Mrs. Parks refused. She \nwas, she later stated, ``tired of giving in.'' By refusing to give in \nany longer, Mrs. Parks took a stance that required uncommon levels of \ncourage and principle. With this single act, Mrs. Parks effectively \nkicked-off the modern civil rights movement and changed America \nforever.\n  In response to Mrs. Parks' refusal to leave her seat and her \nsubsequent arrest, the African-American community in Montgomery, led by \nthe Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., organized the Montgomery Bus \nBoycott. For 381 days, members of the African-American community stood \nin solidarity with Mrs. Parks, refusing to utilize the bus system until \nthe law legalizing segregation in public buses was lifted. Ultimately, \nMrs. Parks took her case to the U.S. Supreme Court, where laws \npermitting segregated bus service were deemed unconstitutional. Because \nof Mrs. Parks, no African-American would ever be forced to move to the \nback of the bus again.\n  In addition to the Supreme Court decision, Mrs. Parks' actions, and \nthe boycott that followed her arrest, injected a tremendous amount of \nenergy into the Civil Rights Movement. Her actions helped make \nAmericans all over the country aware of the extensive injustices \nAfrican Americans were forced to endure. A catalyst for similar \nprotests throughout our Nation, Rosa Parks and the Montgomery bus \nboycott served as a model for the non-violent protests that were \ncentral to the civil rights movement and contributed heavily to its \nultimate success.\n  Mrs. Parks' commitment to equality for all Americans did not begin, \nor end, on the bus that day in 1955. After marrying Mr. Raymond Parks, \nwho was also active in civil rights causes, she became a member of the \nVoters' League. In December 1943, Mrs. Parks became a secretary for the \nMontgomery branch of the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People. Later in life, Mrs. Parks founded the Rosa and Raymond \nParks Institute for Self Development. Created in honor of her husband, \nthis institute informs younger Americans of their history, running \n``Pathway to Freedom'' bus tours that travel to important civil rights \nand Underground Railroad sites across the country.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has lost a great daughter and an American \nicon with the passing of Mrs. Rosa Parks. My deepest sympathies go out \nto her family, friends, and all who were fortunate enough to know and \nlove this wonderful woman. While America will surely miss her, the \nlegacy of Rosa Parks, who changed the face of our Nation and inspired \ngenerations of activism, will live on for years to come.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the inspired life \nof an American icon, Rosa Parks, who died on Monday, October 24, 2005 \nin Detroit, MI, at the age of 92.\n  Rosa Parks is often called the ``Mother of the Civil Rights \nMovement'' because of her courage in refusing to give up her seat in \nthe black section of a Montgomery, AL, bus to a white man. Her refusal \nto tolerate racial prejudice paved the way for the civil rights gains \nthat followed.\n  On December 1, 1955, Parks was a tired seamstress on her way home \nfrom work, sitting at the front of the section reserved for black bus \nriders. When the bus started to fill up, Parks refused to give up her \nseat after the bus driver demanded she move despite the fact that three \nfellow black people moved from their seats.\n  Parks was arrested and fined $14.00 for disorderly conduct and \nviolating a city ordinance. Parks' family was harassed after the bus \nincident and she was fired from her job as a seamstress.\n  To protest Parks' arrest and bus segregation, the African American \ncommunity formed the Montgomery Improvement Association, headed by the\n\n[[Page S11912]]\n\nyoung minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. The group organized a successful 381-day boycott of the bus \nsystem during which time African Americans in Montgomery walked, took \ntaxicabs and formed carpools. The boycott took quite a toll on the \nfinances of the bus system and provided a model for successful \nnonviolent resistance against racism in the U.S.\n  The boycott ended on November 13, 1956, after the U.S. Supreme Court \nupheld a lower court ruling that Montgomery's segregated bus system was \nunconstitutional. However, it wasn't until the 1964 Civil Rights Act \nthat all public places in the U.S. were desegregated.\n  Of her refusal to move, Parks said, ``I only knew that, as I was \nbeing arrested, that it was the very last time that I would ever ride \nin humiliation of this kind.''\n  Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley in Tuskegee, AL, on February \n4, 1913, to James McCauley, a carpenter, and Leona Edwards McCauley, a \nteacher. In 1932, at the age of 20, she married Raymond Parks, a \nbarber, and they remained married until his death in 1977. She attended \nAlabama State College, worked as a seamstress and housekeeper, and was \nactive in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, NAACP, and the Montgomery Voters League to register and empower \nblack voters. In 1943 she was elected Secretary of the Montgomery \nChapter of the NAACP.\n  In 1957 she and her husband moved to Detroit, MI, where they remained \nactive in the NAACP and the Southern Christian, Leadership Conference, \nSCLC. In 1965, she went to work for Congressman John Conyers, Jr., a \ncivil rights leader, managing his Detroit office.\n  In 1987, in honor of her husband, she founded the Rosa and Raymond \nParks Institute for Self-Development in order to motivate youth to \nreach their full potential through the philosophy of ``Quiet \nStrength.''\n  Parks remained active into her 80s, speaking to civil rights groups \nand accepting awards, including the Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent \nPeace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional \nGold Medal.\n  I had the honor and privilege of meeting this incredible woman in the \n1990s. She was dignified, brave and an inspiration to me and \ngenerations of Americans who care about equality, freedom and human \ndignity. Parks said it best in the following statement: ``To this day I \nbelieve we are here on the planet Earth to live, grow up and do what we \ncan to make this world a better place for all people to enjoy \nfreedom.''\n  Rosa Parks showed us that one person can change history and make a \ndifference by taking a principled stand against injustice. Her legacy \nalso teaches us that we must fight against continued inequality in \nAmerica and around the world. We must never give up.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the passing of Rosa Parks is an important \noccasion for us to remember her life and understand in a deeper way how \nhistory changes America. While we grieve the loss for her family, every \nAmerican should be grateful that someone like her lived among us.\n  As we look at the challenges and injustices of the world around us, \nwe often ask the question: how can we change the world? I think we \noften look in the wrong place for change. We look to big government, \nbig business, big entertainment or big publishing to bring about \nchange. But when we look at history, almost every big change started \nsmall.\n  The arrival of a few dozen Pilgrims on the North American continent \nwas not newsworthy in 1620. I doubt that the battles of Lexington and \nConcord made the London Times in April of 1775. The arrival of Dred \nScott at Ft. Snelling in the free territory of Minnesota was not a big \nlocal event. But all three were part of something historically big that \nchanged the world and our lives dramatically.\n  The Pilgrims created a fabulously idealistic vision of a new form of \nsociety which attempted to rise above corruption and create a ``shining \ncity on a hill.'' The farmers and townspeople of eastern Massachusetts \nchallenged the world's great superpower from behind stone walls and \ngroves of oak trees. Dred Scott would stand before the United States \nSupreme Court, just down the hall from where we stand today and assert \nthat because he had lived in free territory he was not property, but a \nperson entitled under God--with unalienable rights. Though he lost his \ncase, he galvanized the Northern states to fight a civil war for a \nUnion based on freedom.\n  On December 1, 1955 Rosa Parks ``sat down'' for her principles in \nMontgomery, AL. She was arrested, tried, convicted, and assessed a fine \nof $14 and $3 in court costs. Her actions precipitated the Montgomery \nbus boycott that lasted more than a year. That event brought young Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. to national prominence. As someone has said, if \nit were not for Rosa Parks, we might never have heard of Dr. King.\n  She stood as an example then and she does today. Perhaps we are too \nquick to see an injustice and run to the Courthouse or the Statehouse \nor the TV station. The wisdom of our Founders was that a single person \narmed with the truth is a majority.\n  Legislation we passed in the Congress has been crucial: the Civil \nRights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and a series of more measures right \ninto our own decade. Obviously, vigorous enforcement of those statutes \nis essential. But if citizens push their own responsibility for social \njustice off on government, we will not have the change we seek.\n  We need to speak up for equality when we hear a racially oriented \njoke. We need to challenge the status quo and bring up the subtle forms \nof racism that stereotype or demean or set low expectations for people. \nWe need to open our mouths to challenge the phobias, misconceptions and \nprejudices that block the progress of people based on race, gender, \nage, creed or disability.\n  The Rosa Parks history reminds me of President Lincoln's reported \nremark when he met Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of Uncle Tom's Cabin: \n``So this is the little woman who started this big war.''\n  In America, there are no ``ordinary people.'' Every one of us has the \npower to bend history in the little circle of people around us, and we \nnever know when one act of principle will commence a movement of \nhistorical significance.\n  On the steps of the Alabama State Capitol building, not far from Rosa \nParks' bus stop, Dr. King gave a speech in 1965. It summed up what Rosa \nParks was all about, and what we each one of us ``ordinary Americans'' \nshould be about. He said:\n\n       Let us therefore continue our triumphal march to the \n     realization of the American dream . . . for all of us today, \n     the battle is in our hands. The road ahead is not altogether \n     a smooth one. There are no broad highways that lead us easily \n     and inevitably to quick solutions. We are still in for a \n     season of suffering How long? Not long. Because no lie can \n     live forever . . . our God is marching on.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of Rosa Parks, a \ntrue American hero.\n  I was proud to be a cosponsor of S. Res. 287, introduced by my \ncolleagues, Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow and passed unanimously \nlast night, which pays tribute to Mrs. Parks' accomplishments and \nexpresses the Senate's condolences on the occasion of her passing.\n  When I heard of Mrs. Parks' death late Monday night, I was reminded \nthat each of us has the ability to change the course of this country, \nto shape our shared destiny, and to bring us closer to being the Nation \nwe aspire to be. Rosa Parks' role in our America in progress can not be \noverstated.\n  Her single act of defiance drew international attention. More \nimportantly, her action set in motion the modern civil rights movement \nand eventually led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  Almost 50 years ago, in Montgomery, AL, Mrs. Parks directly \nconfronted Jim Crow, when she refused to give up her seat to a white \npassenger riding on the city's bus.\n  At the time, Mrs. Parks was working as a seamstress for the \nMontgomery Fair Department Store. And she had been working to help \nbuild a better America long before her famous act of courage on that \nbus.\n\n[[Page S11913]]\n\n  She had been actively involved in the local chapter of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, serving as an \nofficer.\n  She had assisted the NAACP in voter registration drives and attended \norganizing trainings at the Higlander Folk Center, an educational \ncenter for workers' rights and racial equality in Tennessee.\n  Years later, when recalling her actions and her subsequent arrest, \nMrs. Park had this to say:\n\n       At the time I was arrested I had no idea it would turn into \n     this. It was just a day like any other day. The only thing \n     that made it significant was that the masses of the people \n     joined in.\n\n  However, that one day catapulted her to a leadership role in the \ncivil rights movement and began the great 381 day Montgomery boycott of \nthe bus system by African Americans and others dedicated to equal \nrights.\n  A young 26-year old Baptist minister, Reverend Martin Luther King \nJr., organized the boycott.\n  Throughout her life, Rosa Parks remained a committed civil rights \nactivist.\n  In the 1980s she worked in the anti-apartheid movement, and opened a \ncareer counseling center for black youth in Detroit with her husband.\n  She served the United States as an aide to U.S. Congressman John \nConyers, a great civil rights leader in his own right, for many years.\n  In the last years of her life, Mrs. Parks was recognized for her role \nin our country's history.\n  She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded to civilians \nmaking an outstanding contribution to American life in 1996. In \naddition, President Clinton presented Mrs. Parks with the Congressional \nGold Medal, the Nation's highest civilian honor, in 1999.\n  Despite the international attention and acclaim she received and the \nmany lectures and addresses she gave as a public figure, Mrs. Parks has \nbeen described as quiet and reserved by her friends, co-workers and \nthose who knew her best.\n  When she spoke, she spoke with a purpose.\n  She was indeed the mother of the civil rights movement, and her \npassing marks the end of an era that changed the landscape of America.\n  Today, I honor the courage and wisdom of Mrs. Parks.\n  I thank her for inspiring countless generations to dream of an \nAmerica, and a world, that respects and includes all of its citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11913-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SAFETEA-LU\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on August 10 of this year the President \nsigned into law the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, known as SAFETEA-LU. \nThis new multi-year reauthorization of our Nation's surface \ntransportation programs represents a carefully balanced package \nintended to address the needs of our roadways and transit systems. The \nChairman of the Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee, in his role as Chairman of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, was instrumental in striking that balance. As the Chairman \nhas recognized, the Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2006 was reported by the Appropriations Committee prior to \npassage of SAFETEA-LU, and therefore does not fully reflect the \nagreements reached in that piece of legislation. To take one specific \nexample, it does not fund the Federal transit program at the level \nauthorized by SAFETEA-LU for fiscal year 2006, falling $400 million \nshort. The funding levels in SAFETEA-LU were the product of a great \ndeal of negotiation, and I greatly appreciate the contributions my \ncolleague from Alabama and my colleague from Missouri made to that \ndiscussion. I hope that in this, the first year of SAFETEA-LU's \nauthorization, the agreements reached in SAFETEA-LU will be honored for \nall modes of transportation.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I agree with what my colleague from \nMaryland has said. SAFETEA is the culmination of many years of work by \nthe committees of jurisdiction, who held dozens of hearings with \ntransportation stakeholders to share ideas on how to respond to our \nnation's transportation needs. I believe that SAFETEA made some very \nimportant improvements to our previous transportation law and struck a \ngood balance between the various modes, and I hope to see those changes \nreflected in this appropriations legislation when it emerges from the \nconference committee.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues that SAFETEA-LU \nis a carefully crafted approach to meeting our surface transportation \nneeds, and will have a historic impact on transportation programs in my \nState of Missouri and across the country. I will make every effort to \nsee that the final conference report on this legislation will honor the \nagreements reached in SAFETEA-LU between the various modes of \ntransportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11913-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On February, 25, 2005, Thomas Stockwell was on the campus of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill, when six men attacked him. Before chasing \nStockwell down the street and beating him up, the men were heard \nyelling sexually derogatory slurs at him. According to reports, the \nmotivation for the attack was Stockwell's sexual orientation.\n  I believe that our Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nin all circumstances, from threats to them at home. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a major step forward in achieving that \ngoal. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current \nlaw, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11913-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11913-S11914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ELECTIONS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong concern \nregarding the political and economic situation in Haiti and the effect \nthis will have on the upcoming elections in that country. The events of \nthe last few months in Haiti have been dispiriting for those who have \nlong sought stability and progress in that country. Due to the \nprecarious political and security situation in Haiti, the question must \nbe raised; can free and fair elections be carried out in Haiti on \nschedule? Or should they be postponed until we can guarantee a more \nfavorable environment for legitimate elect to take place?\n  Nearly a year and a half has passed since President Aristide was \nremoved from power and since then the country has continued to spiral \ndownward into worsening poverty and political violence. The interim \ngovernment of Prime Minister Gerard Latortue has failed to deliver \nstability and economic progress and for the fourth time this year, has \npostponed the date of the elections. Presently, elections are planned \nfor December 15 and there is widespread concern that, if held, these \nelections will be anything but open, inclusive or fair.\n  Currently, the political and social climate in Haiti is not conducive \nfor credible elections to take place. The Haitian people are largely \nignorant about the electoral system and detached from the process. Out \nof a total of 4.5 million eligible voters approximately 870,000 people \nhave actually registered, with supporters of the Lavalas Party--a large \nportion of the electorate--threatening to boycott. According to \nreports, voter registration stations have been placed in less than 500 \nlocations in contrast with the 5,000 stations available under the \nAristide administration.\n  Citizens are disenchanted over the lack of jobs, miserable government \nservices, and rampant violence. As the poorest country in the Western \nHemisphere, four out of five Haitians live on less than $2 a day and \nnearly half of the children in the country are malnourished. In the \nlast year, there have been almost 800 killings and criminal and \npolitical kidnappings by urban armed gangs have reached historic \nlevels. Only recently, after a shaky start, the\n\n[[Page S11914]]\n\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission, MINUSTAH, has been making modest \nprogress in preventing even greater levels of violence. But the \nsecurity situation in Haiti remains volatile.\n  Equally as troubling is our own government's seeming indifference to \nthe deteriorating situation in Haiti. Several weeks ago, Secretary of \nState Rice flew into Port-au-Prince for a 5 hour visit that amounted to \nlittle more than a photo op. The situation there is fragile and demands \nimmediate action and will require a long-term international commitment.\n  Haiti's capacity to hold credible elections needs to be given serious \nconsideration by the interim government, Bush administration and United \nNations. While the Haitian constitution grants a new administration to \nbe sworn in to office by February 7, 2006, the stakes are too great to \npush forward an election simply to adhere to an arbitrary date. If the \nconsensus is that political and social conditions could be improved in \nthe next 3 to 6 months, and there are serious problems that threaten \nthe legitimacy of this election, we owe it to the people of Haiti to \ntake the time necessary to work to address these problems so that the \nelection is as fair as possible.\n  The next few weeks present a seminal period for the Haitian people \nand the future of Haiti. Enormous logistical, political, and security \nobstacles need to be overcome if Haiti is to have elections with any \nsemblance of credibility. There are very few options left for a country \nthat is already teetering on the brink of state failure and cannot \nafford to lose much more. We must keep the best interests of the \nHaitian people in mind and do everything in our power to create the \nconditions necessary for Haiti to take the next step in transitioning \ntoward democratic stability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11914-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING AMERICA'S VETERANS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

I have also been privileged to welcome home members of our \narmed services and the Michigan National Guard and reserves serving in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. These men and \nwomen are a credit to our great State, their communities, and their \nfamilies.\n  America's men and women in the military give their time, and in many \ncases life and limb, to serve our country. Today's soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines are tomorrow's veterans and we owe them our \ngratitude for their service.\n  One of the most fitting ways we can honor the service and sacrifice \nof America's veterans is to ensure that we honor the commitments we \nhave made to them and their families. I am proud to be working with my \ncolleagues from both political parties and with veterans' organizations \nfrom across the country, including the American Legion and VFW, in \nleading the fight to pass legislation guaranteeing that health care \nservices for our veterans are funded. This law would eliminate the \nyear-to-year uncertainty about funding for veterans health care by \nmaking this funding mandatory in the annual budget. As we reflect on \nthis Veterans Day, I urge my colleagues to keep our promise to our \nNation's veterans by supporting this important amendment.\n  I stand today in honor of all the men and women from Michigan and \nacross our country who have given their lives while serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We are all grateful for their sacrifice and offer our \ncondolences to their families.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate \nyesterday passed the Antitrust Criminal Investigative Improvements Act \nof 2005, which represents a significant addition to the Antitrust \nDivision's arsenal for prosecuting criminal violations of the antitrust \nlaws.\n  In criminal antitrust investigations, it is critical that prosecutors \ngain access to evidence on the inner workings of the alleged \nconspiracy. To meet their burden of proof, prosecutors must marshal \nstrong evidence of the participants in the conspiracy, the nature of \ntheir participation, and the terms of the illegal agreement. This type \nof evidence is very difficult to gain without penetrating the inner \nworkings of a conspiracy in action. Currently, the Antitrust Division \noften has no option but to rely on the cooperation of members of a \nconspiracy, who are frequently reluctant to come forward to assist the \nDivision in uncovering illegal activities in which they, themselves, \nhave taken part. Without the ability to obtain wiretaps, the Antitrust \nDivision unnecessarily faces a much heavier burden in detecting and \npreventing these conspiracies.\n  There is no principled reason for excluding criminal antitrust \nviolations from the list of over 150 predicate offenses for obtaining a \nwiretap. Offenses, such as wire fraud, mail fraud, and bank fraud are \npredicate offenses, but up to now, criminal antitrust offenses have not \nbeen on the list, despite the fact that their penalties are similar. \nCriminal antitrust offenses are basically white-collar fraud offenses, \nand often do much more harm to consumers than other types of fraud \noffenses. Given the gravity of these crimes, it is time that antitrust \nviolations are added as a predicate offense.\n  Of course, antitrust prosecutors still will need to meet the ordinary \nrequirements for obtaining wiretap authority to receive court \npermission to utilize this tool, but it is important that they have \nthat ability. Accordingly, I am very pleased that we have passed this \nlegislation, and hope that the House will act soon to move it, as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11914-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11914-S11915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THANKING THOSE WHO HAVE HELPED SUPPORT THE DINOSAUR DISCOVERY SITE AT \n                              JOHNSON FARM\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

These dedicated volunteers are helping to protect and display \nan asset of great value not only to Utah but to the Nation.\n  The history of this discovery is fascinating. A few years ago, \nretired optometrist Dr. Sheldon Johnson was preparing his farm site for \ndevelopment and as he turned over the earth, he discovered tracks of \nearly residents of Washington County--very early residents, in fact. \nDinosaur tracks dating back to the Jurassic period of history were \nuncovered. They are being preserved and are bringing economic and \nhistoric benefit to St. George, Washington County, UT, and the Nation. \nTo date, visitors from 68 nations and all 50 States have visited the \nsite.\n  I want to recognize and thank Dr. Sheldon and LaVerna Johnson who \ndiscovered the tracks and then donated the land to preserve this \nheritage. The Johnsons have made it all possible. Linda Sappington, \nWashington County volunteer coordinator, aided by volunteer supervisors \nKae Crabtree and Carole Chadwick began in February 2000 to bring \ntogether individuals who cared about the tracks and who were willing to \ngive of themselves to help preserve the find.\n  I also want to recognize and thank Mayor Dan McArthur, the city of \nSt. George, Washington County, and the Utah State legislature for their \nefforts to enhance, preserve, and share this heritage area with the \ncommunity now and for generations to come.\n  In addition to the Johnsons, I recognize, Suzanne Allen; Dr. Andrew \nBarnum; Herb Basso; Dr. David Borris; Alan Crooks; Lyle Drake; Kenneth \nHinton; Sharon Isom; unfortunately, now deceased; LaRee Jones; Dr. \nJames Kirkland; Dr. Martin Lockley; Dan Matheson; Layton Ott, also \ndeceased, Kathy Smith; Darcy Stewart; Marshall Topham; Gary Watts; John \nWillie.

The Studebaker National Museum \nis home to more than 114 years of automobile history, including four \npresidential carriages and several vehicles from the original \nStudebaker collection.\n  The Studebaker name has been a significant part of the South Bend \ncommunity since 1852 when the Studebaker brothers founded their \nblacksmith business. For more than a century, the Studebaker \nCorporation helped form the economic and social fabric of the area, \nemploying tens of thousands of Hoosiers and providing classic \naffordable cars to thousands more.\n  In 1966, the Studebaker Corporation donated its collection of rare \nand antique vehicles, beginning the automobile collection at the \nStudebaker National Museum. The collection has continued to grow since \nthen, demonstrating both Studebaker's famous craftsmanship and \ninnovative design, as well as the evolution of the automobile industry. \nThe collection now tells the story of America's Industrial Age, \nbringing the era to life for Hoosiers and Americans from across the \ncountry.\n  In addition to the educational and historical services it provides, \nthe Studebaker National Museum is a committed leader in the development \nand growth of South Bend's vibrant economy and the revitalization of \nthe Historic West Washington District.\n  Soon, the Museum will be relocating into the Historic West Washington \nDistrict. On the occasion of this move, I commend the Studebaker \nNational Museum on their impressive service to the community thus far \nand wish them well in their new location.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11915-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11915-S11916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DETROIT-WINDSOR TUNNEL'S 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, November 3 marks the 75th \nanniversary of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel. Since it first opened to \nvehicle traffic in 1930, the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel has made a \ntremendous contribution not only to my home State of Michigan, but to \nour Nation as a whole. On the occasion of this historic milestone, I \nknow my colleagues join me in recognition of the Detroit-Windsor \nTunnel, the hard-working men and women who keep it operating, the \nthousands of Americans and Canadians who pass through it each day, and \nthe critical role it plays in our economic relationship with Canada.\n  The Detroit-Windsor Tunnel serves as much more than a conduit for \ntravel, it is a critical socioeconomic link between the United States \nand Canada. The idea for a tunnel to connect the cities of Detroit and \nWindsor was first conceived in the 1870s. After a number of failed \nattempts, Windsor Mayor Edward Blake Winter proposed a new tunnel \nproject in 1919. Mayor Winter believed a tunnel would foster greater \nunity between the two countries and would serve as a memorial to the \nsoldiers who were killed in World War I. After 11 years of planning and \nconstruction, this vision finally became a reality on November 1, 1930. \nOn that day, President Herbert Hoover pressed a golden button in the \nU.S. Capitol officially opening the mile-long tunnel and forever \nchanging and strengthening the relationship between the United States \nand Canada.\n  Today, the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel remains the only underwater \ninternational tunnel open to vehicular traffic in the world. Its \nconstruction in the late 1920s was unparalleled by any other tunnel in \nthe world and took only 26 months to complete, nearly a year ahead of \nschedule. Amazingly, the tunnel allows four full lanes of traffic to \ncross the U.S.-Canadian border at a depth of 75 feet below the surface \nof the water.\n  However, it is not simply the marvel of the tunnel's engineering that \nwe celebrate on its 75th anniversary. We must also recognize its \ncontinuing contributions to trade and travel between the United States \nand Canada. Approximately 29,000 vehicles pass through the tunnel each \nday, making the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel one of the 15 most heavily \ntraveled border crossings in the United States.\n\n[[Page S11916]]\n\n  Everyday, untold numbers of workers, manufacturers, and suppliers on \nboth sides of the border depend on the Detroit Windsor Tunnel to get to \njobs and transport products. Thousands of families also use the tunnel. \nThis movement of people and goods has an immeasurable impact on the \neconomic health of Detroit and Windsor alike. In addition, the cross-\nborder transit reinforces U.S.-Canadian relations.\n  It is with great pride that I honor the 75 years of valuable \ncontributions made by the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel. I would like to \nextend my sincerest wishes of thanks and good luck to the people of \nDetroit and Windsor and the people who keep the tunnel operating as \nthey work to make its future as productive and beneficial as its \npast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11916-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11916-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11916-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:54 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2419) \nentitled ``An Act making appropriations for energy and water \ndevelopment for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for \nother purposes'', and agreed to the conference asked by the Senate on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon; and appoints the \nfollowing Members as the managers of the conference on the part of the \nHouse: Mr. Hobson, Mr. Frelinghuysen, Mr. Latham, Mr. Wamp, Mrs. \nEmerson, Mr. Doolittle, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Rehberg, Mr. Lewis of \nCalifornia, Mr. Visclosky, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Pastor, Mr. Clyburn, Mr. \nBerry, and Mr. Obey.\n  The message also announced that the House passed the following bills, \nin which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 758.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Talent, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1923. A bill to address small business investment companies \nlicensed to issue participating debentures, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to support the ``Small Business \nInvestment and Growth Act of 2005,'' which I have introduced today to \nfacilitate increased investments in small businesses throughout this \ncountry. I am pleased to be joined by my esteemed colleagues from \nMissouri, Senator Jim Talent and Senator Kit Bond, in sponsoring this \nbill.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am committed to supporting our Nation's small \nbusinesses by increasing their access to capital. Small businesses \ncomprise 99.7 percent of all businesses in the United States. Moreover, \nsmall businesses employ more than half, 57 percent, of the total \nprivate-sector workforce, and are responsible for the creation of more \nthan two-thirds of all new jobs. Clearly, increasing investments in \nsmall businesses is crucial to our on-going economic success.\n  This bill will reform and enhance the Small Business Administration's \nSBIC program, a program that is vital to fostering innovation, growth, \nand job creation in small businesses throughout our country. Small \nBusiness Investment Companies (SBICs) are privately-owned and managed \nventure capital investment companies that are licensed and regulated by \nthe SBA. SBICs use their own capital, combined with funds borrowed from \nother private investors and supported by an SBA guarantee, to make \nequity and debt investments in qualifying small businesses. The SBA \nshares in the profits of SBICs. The structure of the program is unique \nand has been a model for similar public-private partnerships around the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S11920]]\n\n  The program has been successful in mobilizing private venture capital \ninvestment, and leveraging that private investment with additional \nfunds supported by SBA guarantees. According to the SBA's annual \nreports to Congress, the SBIC program has provided over $17.2 billion \nin financing to small businesses since the beginning of Fiscal Year \n1999. Each year, this financing allows small businesses to create or \nretain tens of thousands of jobs. For instance, according to the SBA's \nOffice of Advocacy, in 2004 alone SBIC investments helped small \nbusinesses create or retain approximately 81,042 jobs.\n  There are currently two types of SBIC Programs, the Participating \nSecurities Program and the Debenture Program. Unfortunately, the \nParticipating Securities Program stopped issuing new financing to SBICs \nat the beginning of FY 2005 because the program had ceased to be a \nzero-subsidy program, and there were no Federal appropriations to \nsupport the program. The Debenture Program has not suffered similar \nlosses, and is unaffected by this bill.\n  This bill would create a third type of SBIC program, the \n``Participating Debenture'' SBIC Program, that would replace the \nParticipating Securities program. This new program would be a ``zero-\nsubsidy'' program, with no Federal appropriations necessary, that would \nprovide financing with equity characteristics to small businesses. In \nresponse to two major problems suffered by the Participating Securities \nProgram, the new Participating Debenture program would seek to a, \nensure that a participating debenture is considered a debt instrument \nfor Federal budgetary purposes, and b, prevent financial losses by the \nSBA by increasing the SBA's share of SBICs' profits.\n  Together with Senator Talent and Senator Bond, I plan to foster a \ndebate in the Small Business Committee about this bill and move toward \na successful rejuvenation of the equity portion of the SBIC program. I \nbelieve that a full discussion about the proposal by the SBA, the \nSBICs, and experts in the venture capital industry will be necessary to \nachieve this progress.\n  In July 2005 a bill, H.R. 3429, was introduced in the House that \nwould also create a new program to replace the Participating Securities \nprogram. The bill we are introducing has some elements in common with \nthat House bill, but goes further to clarify the manner in which the \nSBIC program would operate, and to bring the program into greater \ncompliance with budgetary guidelines.\n  This bill will allow the SBA to guarantee the repayment of the \nredemption price, principal, and interest for a new type of security, a \n``participating debenture,'' issued by a SBIC. This type of guarantee \n(of principal and interest for a security issued by an SBIC) existed in \nthe two other SBIC programs, and for those other two programs it was \nexplicitly authorized in the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (the \nSBIA). This bill will also authorize the SBA to guarantee the repayment \nto an ``interim funding provider'' (an IFP) of any funds lost by the \nIFP because of the default of an SBIC during the period after the IFP \nhas advanced monies to the SBIC, and before the IFP has been repaid for \nthose funds. This type of guarantee existed in practice in the two \nother SBIC programs, but was not authorized by the SBIA Thus, this \nprovision rectifies that problem and brings the new program into \ncompliance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (the FCRA).\n  Another section of the bill authorizes the SBA to guarantee the \npayment of the redemption price and interest for a trust certificate \nissued by a trustee of a pool of PDs. This type of guarantee existed in \nthe two prior SBIC programs, but was not authorized by the SBIA. \nSimilar to the current Participating Securities and Debenture SBIC \nprograms, the Participating Debenture (PD) program will raise funds by \npooling the securities issued by SBICs into a pool and selling trust \ncertificates that represent interests in that pool. Thus, this \nprovision rectifies that problem and brings the new program more into \ncompliance with the FCRA.\n  Our bill includes all of the provisions of H.R. 3429 that address \nredemption and interest, and also includes several additional \nprovisions. First, the bill includes repayment in default. It \nauthorizes the SBA to guarantee repayment to IFPs for funds lost due to \nthe default of an SBIC. The bill also authorizes the SBA to guarantee \nthe payment of the redemption price and interest for trust certificates \nissued by a trustee of a pool of PDs. For each of the guarantees \nauthorized here, the SBA is empowered to charge a fee.\n  The fee authorized above will be sufficient to reduce to zero the net \ncost to the SBA of each guarantee. For the other two SBIC programs, the \nSBIA only explicitly authorized such a fee for the first guarantee, \nmentioned above, and did not authorize such a fee for the other two \ntypes of guarantees. Thus, this provision rectifies that problem and \nbrings the new program into compliance with the FCRA. This section is \nnot found in H.R. 3429.\n  The obligations that each SBIC hold to repay the SBA will be \nidentical, or ``matched'', in both size and timing to the obligations \nthat the SBA holds to repay to the trust certificate holders that have \npurchased trust certificates in the pool that holds that particular \nSBICs' PDs. For advancing funds to an SBIC in accordance with the \nSBIC's license agreement with the SBA, an IFP shall have the right to \nreceive interest from the SBIC. The manner of calculating and \ncollecting this interest is specified. These sections is not found in \nH.R. 3429. The aggregate unpaid principal balance of the PDs issued by \na SBIC must not exceed 200 percent of that company's private capital. \nIn other words, the maximum ratio of the SBA's outstanding investment \nin the SBIC, when compared to the private investors' investment, is \n2:1. This method would be identical to the two current SBIC programs.\n  The bill permits the SBA may authorize a trust or pool acting on \nbehalf of the SBA to purchase PDs from an SBIC. This practice occurs in \nthe other two SBIC programs, but is not explicitly authorized by the \nSBIA. The principal balance of each PD will be payable in full not \nlater than the tenth anniversary of the date of issuance of that PD. If \na SBIC fails to make this payment they default immediately and are \nliquidated. This was not the case in the other two SBIC programs. Thus, \nboth of these provisions bring this new program more into compliance \nwith the FCRA.\n  Our bill, unlike the House bill, adds that if an SBIC fails to repay \nthe required principle and interest by a date no later than the tenth \nanniversary of the original issuance, the SBIC defaults immediately and \nmust be liquidated. Beginning on the date of issuance, interest on the \nprincipal balance outstanding of a PD shall accrue on a daily basis, \nand unpaid accrued interest shall compound every six months. There are \nno interest payments during the first five years of a PD. All unpaid \ninterest on a PD accruing during the first five years will be due and \npayable in full out of gross receipts on the fifth anniversary. \nInterest accruing on a PD after the fifth anniversary will be due and \npayable semi-annually. Interest payments used to be contingent on a \nSBIC's profitability. In this proposal, the payments are due regardless \nof a SBIC's financial situation and if a payment is missed the SBA has \nthe right to liquidate the SBIC. Thus, this provision brings this new \nprogram more into compliance with the FCRA.\n  In addition, the SBA is authorized to charge an additional fee, as \nnecessary to reduce the cost of the program to zero, as that term is \ndefined in the FCRA, but the fee is capped at 1.5 percent, this may \nneed to be adjusted. This type of fee existed in the other two SBIC \nprograms. If a SBIC fails to pay any principal or interest on a PD when \ndue, the Administration, in addition to any other remedies that it may \nhave, can demand immediate repayment of the principal balance and all \naccrued interest on all outstanding PDs of that SBIC. This was not the \ncase in the other two programs; thus, this provision brings the new \nprogram more into compliance with the FCRA. If a default occurs, the \nSBA has the right to charge a default rate of interest. Again, this is \nan improvement on the existing program. Finally, if a default occurs, \nthe SBA may apply the SBIC's private collateral, its private \ninvestments, to pay any interest or principal that the SBIC owes the \nSBA. Again, this is an improvement (a crucial improvement) on the \nexisting program.\n\n[[Page S11921]]\n\n  The bill offers several additions, in this regard, to the House bill. \nIf default occurs, the SBA can charge a default rate of interest. The \nSBA can also make use of private investments to pay any interest or \nprinciple owed to the SBA by the SBIC. In the event of a SBIC's \nliquidation, a PD will be senior in priority for all purposes to any \nequity interests, in other words, the SBA will have first priority to \nreimbursement. Also, the SBIC's private collateral may, at the option \nof the SBA, be applied to pay accrued interest and principal of \noutstanding PDs.\n  In the event of a default by an SBIC, a PD will be senior in priority \nfor all purposes to any equity interests, in other words, the SBA will \nhave first priority to reimbursement. Also, the SBIC's private \ncollateral may, at the option of the SBA, be applied to pay accrued \ninterest and principal of outstanding PDs. The bill has an additional \nsection for the defaults of the SBIC. The section creates rights for \nthe SBA, in case of default, that are the same as the SBA's rights in \nliquidation. An SBIC also commits to invest private equity in small \nbusinesses, to match the capital raised by its PDs. An SBIC in this \nprogram shall have no other debt other than financing obtained pursuant \nto this program.\n  Unless otherwise allowed by the SBA, an SBIC may used the proceeds of \na PD issued by the company to pay the principal and interest due on \noutstanding Pds issued by that company, if the SBIC has outstanding \nprivate equity capital invested in an amount equal to that being \nrefinanced. This section of the Senate bill adds that an SBIC may use \nproceeds of a PD if it has outstanding private equity capital invested \nin an amount equal to that be refinanced.\n  Unless otherwise provided, an SBIC's gross receipts shall be used \nfirst for the payment of accrued interest on PDs, and then for \nrepayment of PD principal and private investments into the SBIC, and \nthen for profit distributions. Gross Receipts means all cash received \nby a SBIC, including proceeds of the sale of securities, management or \nother fees, and cash representing return of invested capital, other \nthan capital contributed by partners, the proceeds of the issuance of \nPDs, and money borrowed from other sources, if any. Marketable \nSecurities that the company distributes in kind will be distributed as \nif they were Gross Receipts.\n  When an SBIC misses a payment, the SBA may choose not to liquidate \nthe SBIC and the SBIC may continue to operate. In such a case, a SBIC \nmust use Gross Receipts within 10 days after receipt to repay any \noutstanding past due interest and past due principal. If a SBIC has no \noutstanding past due interest or principal, it must use Gross Receipts \nto prepay accrued interest. Such prepayment will be due not later than \nthe end of the calendar quarter during which such Gross Receipts were \nreceived. Failure to prepay accrued interest will be deemed a Payment \nDefault. At such time as there is no unpaid, accrued interest or past \ndue principal outstanding on a SBIC's PDs, the SBIC may use Gross \nReceipts to prepay PD principal that is not past due. If any Gross \nReceipts remain, they may be paid to private investors to repay their \ninvestments. As long as there are any outstanding PDs, a SBIC may \ndistribute Gross Receipts to its limited partners but only if they \ndistribute at least a pro-rata share simultaneously to the \nadministration.\n  If Gross Receipts remain after the payment of all required payments, \nremaining funds can be used for profit distributions. When all PD \nprincipal and all private capital has been repaid in full, post-\namortization payments may made be made to the administration. The \npayments are 25 precent of their pro-rata share until private investors \nhave received 100 percent of their principal; and thereafter, 50 \npercent of their pro-rata share. The order of payments are: interest \npayments, principal payments, pre-payments, pre-amortization payments, \nand post-amortization payments. This provision provides for tax \ndistributions that are required by law, as necessary. No distribution \nmay violate liquidity requirements or other restrictions imposed by the \nSBA's regulations or any State's law.\n  At any time a SBIC is in restricted operation or liquidation by \nreason of capital impairment or regulatory violation, the maturity date \nof the SBIC's PDs, including principal and accrued interest, is subject \nto acceleration at the option of the administration, and whether or not \nthere has been such an acceleration, up to 100 percent of all Gross \nReceipts and unfunded private investor commitments may, at the option \nof the administration, be required to be distributed to the \nadministration until all accrued interest and principal on the SBIC's \nPDs have been paid in full. No distributions will be made to limited \npartners when a SBIC is in restricted operations or liquidation due to \ncapital impairment or regulatory violation. This section of the bill \ndetails the procedures and requirements that would apply if an SBIC \nprovided a partial repayment to the SBA in the form of securities, \nrather than cash.\n  Another section details the schedule under which payments will be \nmade to the SBA by an SBIC. Subject to SBA regulations and the \npermission of private investors, an SBIC may reinvest Gross Receipts \nback into small businesses. In addition, the bill provides that after \nre-payments have occurred in this program, the SBA's share of such re-\npayments shall not be reduced or recalculated. This section does not \ncreate any ownership interest for the SBA in any SBICs. Rather, the \nrelationship is one of lender-borrower.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Too much is at stake for \nsmall businesses, and the economy as a whole, to allow this critical \nlegislation to languish. Congress must find essential agreement and \nfulfill its obligation to America's small businesses. Failing to \nadvance this bill would diminish our chances for innovation, and stifle \nthe entrepreneurial opportunities this program will produce. Instead, \nwe have an opportunity to support these key attributes of American \nsmall businesses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1924. A bill to strengthen civil-military relationships by \npermitting State and local governments to enter into lease purchase \nagreements with the United States Armed Forces; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have often said here on the floor of the \nSenate that by working together, we in America can build a better \nfuture for all of us. Rather than limit our potential with an every-\nman-for-himself philosophy, we should find ways to work together. \nAnyone who has ever played sports can recall their coach's \nencouragement to use teamwork. That was good advice for athletics and \nit's a good idea in public policy too. America could use a little bit \nmore of a teamwork society.\n  Today I rise to introduce the Base and Community Lease-Purchase \nExpansion Act. The purpose of this bill is to provide more opportunity \nfor military bases to enter into cooperative agreements with the \ngovernments of the communities in which they are located.\n  One of the options available to the military for obtaining the \nfacilities and office space it needs is the lease-purchase agreement. \nIn this sort of arrangement, the military service contracts with an \nentity that agrees to construct a building on military land. The \nmilitary then makes lease payments over a term of several years. At the \nend of that term the building becomes the property of the government. \nCurrent law says that the military services may enter into an agreement \nsuch as this only with a ``private contractor.''\n  The bill I offer today expands the range of entities with which the \nmilitary can enter into these agreements so that the door can be opened \nto cooperative lease-purchase arrangements between the military and \ngovernments at the local and State level.\n  We know from the recent round of base closures and realignments that \ncommunities across the Nation are closely connected to the military \ninstallations situated nearby. The health and prosperity of one has a \ndirect effect on the health and prosperity of the other. It is only \nprudent to allow the two to work together when it will benefit both the \nbase and the community to do so. And what more stable partner could a \nmilitary base have than the local government that welcomes its presence \nand role in the local community?\n  In my own State of Illinois, for example, we are very proud to be \nhost to\n\n[[Page S11922]]\n\nScott Air Force Base, home to the United States Transportation Command, \nthe Air Force's Air Mobility Command, and some tireless flying units \nthat move troops and materials all over the world in defense of our \nNation. St. Clair County, where Scott Air Force Base is located, has \nfor some time been willing to discuss with the Air Force the idea of \nworking together on a lease-purchase agreement. That idea cannot get \noff the ground; much less take flight, however, so long as the current \nlaw strictly limits such agreements to private contractors.\n  This is just one example from my own State of Illinois. I expect \nthere may be other military installations and their neighboring \njurisdictions that also might like to work together in a similar \nfashion. The Base and Community Lease-Purchase Expansion Act which I \nintroduce today will help open the door to that sort of teamwork.\n  America is strongest when the military and civilian parts of our \nsociety work together in partnership on projects of mutual benefit. To \nthat end we must work to reduce barriers and seize opportunities to \nfoster cooperation between military installations and the states and \nlocal jurisdictions in which they are located. In so doing, we lay the \nfoundation for mutual understanding, a strong military and enduring \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11922-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS--OCTOBER 25, 2005\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 286--COMMENDING THE GRAND OLE OPRY ON THE OCCASION OF \n ITS 80TH ANNIVERSARY FOR ITS IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE POPULARIZATION OF \nCOUNTRY MUSIC AND FOR ITS 8 DECADES OF MUSICAL AND BROADCAST EXCELLENCE\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Hurricane Katrina has had a devastating and \n     unprecedented impact on students who attended schools in the \n     disaster areas.\n       (2) Due to the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina, a \n     significant number of students have enrolled in schools \n     outside of the area in which they resided on August 22, 2005, \n     including a significant number of students who enrolled in \n     non-public schools because their parents chose to enroll them \n     in such schools.\n       (3) 372,000 students were displaced by Hurricane Katrina. \n     Approximately 700 schools have been damaged or destroyed. \n     Nine States each have more than 1,000 of such displaced \n     students enrolled in their schools. In Texas alone, over \n     45,000 displaced students have enrolled in schools.\n       (4) In response to these extraordinary conditions, this \n     title creates a one-time only emergency grant for the 2005-\n     2006 school year tailored to the needs and particular \n     circumstances of students displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n       (5) The level and type of assistance provided under this \n     title, both for students attending public schools and \n     students attending non-public schools, is being authorized \n     solely because of the unprecedented nature of the crisis, the \n     massive dislocation of students, and the short duration of \n     assistance.\n\n     SEC. __.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Hurricane Katrina \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Recovery Act''.\n\n     SEC. __. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Hurricane Katrina has had a devastating and \n     unprecedented impact on students who attended schools in the \n     disaster areas.\n       (2) Due to the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina, a \n     significant number of students have enrolled in schools \n     outside of the area in which they resided on August 22, 2005, \n     including a significant number of students who enrolled in \n     non-public schools because their parents chose to enroll them \n     in such schools.\n       (3) 372,000 students were displaced by Hurricane Katrina. \n     Approximately 700 schools have been damaged or destroyed. \n     Nine States each have more than 1,000 of such displaced \n     students enrolled in their schools. In Texas alone, over \n     45,000 displaced students have enrolled in schools.\n       (4) In response to these extraordinary conditions, this \n     title creates a one-time only emergency grant for the 2005-\n     2006 school year tailored to the needs and particular \n     circumstances of students displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n       (5) The level and type of assistance provided under this \n     title, both for students attending public schools and \n     students attending non-public schools, is being authorized \n     solely because of the unprecedented nature of the crisis, the \n     massive dislocation of students, and the short duration of \n     assistance.\n\n     SEC. __.

Res. 288\n\n       Whereas Tim Wellington Mara was born on August 14, 1916 in \n     New York City;\n       Whereas Wellington Mara became a ball boy for the New York \n     Giants at the age of 9;\n       Whereas Wellington Mara was made co-owner of the New York \n     Giants in 1930 at the age of 14;\n       Whereas Wellington Mara graduated from Loyola High School, \n     a Jesuit institution in Manhattan, and then attended Fordham \n     University;\n       Whereas the only interruption in Wellington Mara's 81 years \n     with the New York Giants organization occurred during World \n     War II, when he served with distinction for more than 3 years \n     in the Navy, seeing action in both the Atlantic and Pacific \n     theaters aboard aircraft carriers;\n       Whereas Wellington Mara was instrumental in crafting an \n     agreement in which larger market teams shared television \n     revenue with smaller market teams, thereby allowing football \n     to thrive throughout the United States;\n       Whereas under nearly 80 years of Wellington Mara's \n     leadership, the New York Giants made 26 postseason \n     appearances, the second highest in league history, including \n     18 National Football League Divisional championships, and 6 \n     National Football League championships;\n       Whereas Wellington Mara displayed an unwavering commitment \n     to his players and coaches by finding doctors for former \n     players, paying for medical expenses, and arranging help for \n     their families;\n       Whereas Wellington Mara was an invaluable contributor to \n     the National Football League as a member of many ownership \n     committees and has been recognized for always putting the \n     interests of the game ahead of what was best for the New York \n     Giants;\n       Whereas, in 1997, Wellington Mara was elected to the \n     Professional Football Hall of Fame, joining his father, Tim \n     Mara, who was a charter member of the Hall of Fame; and\n       Whereas, at the end of a life dedicated to the great game \n     of football, its fans, and players, Wellington Mara passed \n     away on October 25, 2005, at the age of 89: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its most sincere condolences to the family of \n     Wellington Mara, the former Ann Mumm, whom he married in \n     1954, their 11 children, and 40 grandchildren; and\n       (2) recognizes the life and accomplishments of Wellington \n     Mara, who, for more than 8 decades, dedicated his life to the \n     New York Giants and their millions of fans and supporters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11950-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11950-S11951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS \n                                 MONTH\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 282) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 282\n\n       Whereas 2005 marks the 11th anniversary of the enactment of \n     the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322, \n     108 Stat. 1902);\n       Whereas since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act \n     of 1994, communities have made significant progress in \n     reducing domestic violence such that between 1993 and 2001, \n     the incidents of nonfatal domestic violence fell 49 percent;\n       Whereas the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 cost $15.50 \n     per woman to implement, and has been estimated to save $159 \n     per woman, totaling a savings of nearly $14,800,000,000 since \n     its creation in averted costs of victimization;\n       Whereas since it was created by the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has been \n     used to answer over 1,000,000 calls;\n       Whereas States have passed over 660 State laws pertaining \n     to domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault;\n       Whereas the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 has helped \n     make strides toward breaking the cycle of violence, but there \n     remains much work to be done;\n       Whereas the Senate recently passed the Violence Against \n     Women Act of 2005 which reauthorized critical components of \n     the original Act and established additional protections for \n     battered immigrants and victims of human trafficking in order \n     to further combat domestic violence and sexual assault;\n       Whereas domestic violence affects women, men, and children \n     of all racial, social, religious, ethnic, and economic groups \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas protecting the economic security of victims can \n     help break the cycle of domestic violence;\n       Whereas abusers frequently seek to control their partners \n     by actively interfering with the ability of their partners to \n     work, including by preventing their partners from going to \n     work and harassing their partners at work;\n       Whereas only 28 States and the District of Columbia have \n     laws that explicitly provide unemployment insurance to \n     victims of domestic violence under certain circumstances;\n       Whereas, on average, more than 3 women are murdered by \n     their husbands or boyfriends in the United States every day;\n       Whereas women who have been abused are much more likely to \n     suffer from chronic pain, diabetes, depression, unintended \n     pregnancies, substance abuse, and sexually transmitted \n     infections, including HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas only about 10 percent of primary care physicians \n     routinely screen for domestic violence during new patient \n     visits, and 9 percent routinely screen during periodic \n     checkups;\n       Whereas each year, about 324,000 pregnant women in the \n     United States are battered by the men in their lives, leading \n     to pregnancy complications, such as low-weight gain, anemia, \n     infections, and first and second trimester bleeding;\n       Whereas every 2 minutes, someone in the United States is \n     sexually assaulted;\n       Whereas almost 25 percent of women surveyed had been raped \n     or physically assaulted by a spouse or boyfriend at some \n     point in their lives;\n       Whereas in 2002 alone, 250,000 women and girls older than \n     the age of 12 were raped or sexually assaulted;\n       Whereas 64 percent of women have reported being raped, \n     physically assaulted, or stalked since age 18 by their \n     current or former intimate partner;\n       Whereas 1 out of every 12 women has been stalked in her \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas approximately 503,000 women are stalked by an \n     intimate partner annually in the United States;\n       Whereas the influence of cultural norms, economics, \n     language barriers, and limited access to legal services and \n     information may render some immigrant women particularly \n     vulnerable to abuse;\n       Whereas 1 in 5 adolescent girls in the United States \n     becomes a victim of physical or sexual abuse, or both, in a \n     dating relationship;\n       Whereas 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing \n     someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend;\n       Whereas approximately 8,800,000 children in the United \n     States witness domestic violence each year;\n       Whereas witnessing domestic violence increases the risk of \n     developing long-term physical and mental health problems, \n     future struggles with substance abuse, and experiencing \n     domestic abuse as a victim;\n\n[[Page S11951]]\n\n       Whereas a boy who witnesses his father's domestic violence \n     is 10 times more likely to engage in domestic violence than a \n     boy from a nonviolent home;\n       Whereas almost 37 percent of all women who sought care in \n     hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were \n     injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or \n     girlfriend;\n       Whereas the cost of domestic violence, including rape, \n     physical assault, and stalking, exceeds $5,800,000,000 each \n     year, of which $4,100,000,000 is spent on direct medical and \n     mental health care services;\n       Whereas 44 percent of the mayors of the United States have \n     identified domestic violence as a primary cause of \n     homelessness;\n       Whereas over 50 percent of abused women lose at least 3 \n     days of work per month due to domestic violence, 60 percent \n     of battered women endure reprimands for arriving late to work \n     and displaying other work-related problems associated with \n     abuse, and 70 percent report difficulties in performing their \n     work due to the effects of domestic violence;\n       Whereas existing statistical data suggests that forced \n     prostitution, trafficking for sex, and sex tourism has \n     increased throughout the world;\n       Whereas the need to increase the public awareness and \n     understanding of domestic violence and the needs of battered \n     women and their children continues to exist;\n       Whereas the month of October 2005 has been recognized as \n     National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a month for \n     activities furthering awareness of domestic violence; and\n       Whereas the dedication and successes of those working \n     tirelessly to end domestic violence and the strength of the \n     survivors of domestic violence should be recognized: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Domestic \n     Violence Awareness Month; and\n       (2) expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n     continue to raise awareness of domestic violence in the \n     United States and its devastating impact on families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/26/senate-section/article/S11951-1", "month":
