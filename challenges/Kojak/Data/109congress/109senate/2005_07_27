Under the previous order, the time from 10 \nto 2 p.m. shall be equally divided, with the majority in control of the \nfirst hour and the Democrats in control of the second hour, rotating in \nthat fashion until 2 p.m.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning we are returning to the motion \nto proceed to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, otherwise \nknown as the gun manufacturers liability legislation. Yesterday we \ninvoked cloture on the motion to proceed. We now have an order to begin \nthe bill at 2 p.m. today. The debate will be equally divided until 2 \no'clock today. I understand a rollcall vote will not be necessary, and \nwe will have a voice vote at 2 p.m. and then be on the bill.\n  Senators can expect a cloture vote on the underlying bill to occur on \nFriday, unless we change that time by consent. As I stated repeatedly \nover the last several days, we are going to have a very busy session as \nwe address a range of issues, including energy and highways and the \nInterior funding bill, the gun manufacturers liability bill, veterans \nfunding, nominations, and other issues.\n  Just a quick update on several of these. In terms of the Energy bill, \nafter 5 years of hard work, the energy conferees are now done. I expect \nthat that legislation will be filed shortly. This is a major \naccomplishment that will cause serious and dramatic changes in how we \nproduce, deliver, and consume energy. We simply would not be at this \npoint without the hard work, the perseverance, and the patience of \nSenator Domenici and his partner, Senator Bingaman, as well as \nCongressman Barton. We will pass that conference report this week. Our \ncountry will be all the better for it.\n  I was talking to the Secretary of Energy earlier this morning. We \nwere discussing the absolute importance of passing this bill to \nestablish a framework of policy from this legislative body. He again \nreferred to the great good this bill will do.\n\n  On highways, it has taken this Congress 3 tough years of work to come \nto this point, but with just a little more work, we will have a bill \nthat the President will sign. Our conferees are working and should \ncomplete the writing of it today. I spent time with several of the \nconferees yesterday and with the Speaker, as we coordinate completion \nof this highway bill.\n  The good news for the American people is, as they see what is \nsometimes confusing on the floor of the Senate as these bills come in, \nthis particular highway bill will make our streets and our highways \nsafer. It will make our economy more productive. It will create many \nnew jobs.\n  I mentioned veterans funding. Yesterday, the House and Senate \nmajority agreed to ensure that $1.5 billion of needed funding will be \ngiven to the Department of Veterans Affairs this fiscal year. Veterans \ncan be assured that their health care will remain funded. I know it is \nconfusing what you hear on the floor, but that action is being taken.\n  I mentioned Interior funding. Yesterday both Houses agreed to fund \nmany of the programs that affect many of our public lands held in trust \nfor Americans throughout the country. We intend to complete action on \nthis conference report this week as well.\n  Late last night, the conferees completed work on the Legislative \nBranch appropriations bill, and we will be attempting to clear that \nlegislation as well this week.\n\n[[Page S9060]]\n\n  I mentioned all these to give my colleagues an update because there \nis so much activity going on right now, in addition to the very \nimportant legislation that is on the floor.\n  After several months of aggressive work, we can now look back and say \nthat we have brought the Cabinet full strength for the President's \nsecond term in effect. We have accomplished very important class action \nlegislation, after years and years and years of delay. We finished \nbankruptcy reform, which we have worked on in the Congress, both \nHouses, since the late 1990s. We completed writing one of the fastest \nbudgets in congressional history with the goal, which we are \naccomplishing, of pushing down the deficit, keeping our economy \ngrowing, and creating jobs, funding our efforts to confront the \nterrorist challenge overseas, confirming, after what was tough for us \nall, many of the judicial nominees that have been held up for years. \nAll of that is what we have done.\n  Now we have the opportunity over the next 3 to 4 days of completing \naction on the very necessary, very important bills which I have \nmentioned--bills that will make a real difference in the everyday lives \nof Americans. We are talking about funding for health care, veterans, \nhighways, and energy. We are demonstrating governing with meaningful \nsolutions to everyday problems of Americans.\n  These bills will affect people's lives directly, will create \nopportunities for new jobs, help people to fulfill the American dreams \nthey might have, as well as address critical national needs. By the \ntime we get to the recess--I mention that because we have a long \nrecess. A recess is the time that we can use to go back and be with our \nconstituencies. We do have a long recess in August. I say that to \npreface how important it is that we complete all of our work this week. \nThe American people expect us to complete action on the items I have \nmentioned. There is a tendency to think the recess is going to start \nmaybe a day early. It certainly looks like, because we are going to be \nso busy, that we will be working through Friday of this week. I will be \nin constant consultation with the Democratic leader. We will have the \nopportunity to talk several times throughout the day.\n  At this point, we cannot rule out a Saturday session, if it is \nabsolutely necessary. I think we can finish our work earlier, but we \nsimply can't rule out a Saturday session at this point.\n  I do ask for Members to keep their schedules flexible until we get \nthrough this legislative calendar. We will in a bipartisan way have a \nlot to be proud of once we leave for our August recess.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. President, most of what I have said has to do with \naccomplishments, challenges, and schedule. I want to turn to an issue \nthat I care passionately about, an issue that most, if not all \nAmericans, care about, and that is health care.\n  As I travel around the country, in part because I am a physician but \nin larger part because of the reality of the problem, the cost of \nhealth care, as well as the safety and quality of health care, is among \nthe first and foremost issues on the minds of the American people. They \nwant us to lower the cost. You do that by improving quality and getting \nrid of waste, and we are doing just that.\n  I am pleased to report that after years of challenging work, \ndifficult work, and a lot of negotiation among ourselves on both sides \nof the aisle, the House is expected to join the Senate in passing a \nbill called the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. I am \nhopeful they will pass that bill today. We passed it not too long ago. \nI mention it because it focuses on getting waste out of the system, and \nit does so by putting the emphasis on patients.\n  A patient-centered system is what I strongly believe we need to move \nto in the future. This does just that. Patient safety is something that \nconcerns me. We have an obligation, as physicians, as nurses, as the \nhealth care sector, but also as a public policy body, to make sure that \npatient safety is maximized. People say: Of course, you do. But if you \nlook back at the Institute of Medicine's report not too long ago that \nreally started a lot of this debate, they estimated that up to 98,000 \ndeaths are caused each year by medical errors. That would make medical \nerrors, that are occurring every day in hospitals and clinics, and even \nat home when people are taking medicines, the eighth leading cause of \ndeath each year. That is more than car accidents, HIV/AIDS, or breast \ncancer. People dispute the number. Is it 98,000? Is it 125,000? Is it \n75,000? The exact number doesn't matter. The fact that there are \nthousands and thousands of needless deaths being caused is inexcusable. \nThis body has acted. The House will act. And I am hopeful the President \nwill be able to sign that important legislation in the next several \ndays.\n  What is so obvious to me as a physician, having spent 20 years in the \nmedical arena, every day in the healing profession, is that the tragedy \nof all these deaths is compounded by the fact that these deaths and the \nmany errors that result in prolonged hospitalization, more misery, \ngreater cost, can be prevented, can absolutely be prevented. Simple \nreporting procedures, sharing of information, improved technology, a \nsystems approach--all can reduce these preventable errors, and thereby \nimprove hundreds of thousands of lives and actually save tens of \nthousands of lives.\n\n  So people ask, What is the problem? The fear of litigation has kept \nmany health care providers--doctors, nurses, and lab technicians in the \nhospitals--from sharing information if a mistake is inadvertently made. \nEverybody makes mistakes, but if you have a mistake that is made, you \nneed to be able to share it with people so you can develop a system to \nkeep it from happening in the future. We all do that in our everyday \nlives.\n  For example, in hospitals, there is a tendency not to do that because \nif you share your mistake, there is a predatory trial lawyer who will \nswoop in and find that error and take you to court and destroy you and \nthe system. It is human nature to say, if that is the case, Yes, I made \na mistake, I will improve, but I am not going to share it because it \nwill destroy my future. People are afraid of sharing their internal \ndata, such as their collection of reporting of infections that could \nhave been prevented with preventable techniques or a medical error that \nmight expose them to a ruinous lawsuit. That drives the reporting of \nthese medical errors underground.\n  The bill will change all of that, and it will lift this threat of \nlitigation and allow health care providers, doctors, nurses, and other \nhealth care professionals to share information and to develop effective \nsolutions and to develop effective systems whereby those mistakes will \nnever occur again. That is the way this patient safety bill will \nimprove lives but also save lives of tens of thousands of people.\n  This type of nonpunitive reporting isn't new. I began flying small \nplanes fairly young, when I was a teenager. Over the years, I have \nwatched how self-reporting in that field has revolutionized safety in \ngeneral aviation, private aviation, and in the airline industry as \nwell. In 1975, I had been flying for about 7 years. I remember it \nbecause it was a big deal at the time. Similar to what we are doing now \nwith the patient safety bill, the FAA established a system called the \nAviation Safety Reporting System. It encouraged everyone in the \naviation system--mechanics, pilots, air traffic controllers, flight \nattendants, and the general public--to voluntarily report--I remember \nthe blue cards you reported on--potential or actual safety problems, \nand you could do so without fear of recrimination.\n  That is why this voluntary aspect is so important. Because that \ninformation in the aviation field was shared internally and with \nothers, accidents went down and overall safety went up dramatically. \nEveryone improved. Quality improved and safety improved by learning \nfrom others.\n  The patients safety bill that is before the House of Representatives \ntoday--the same bill that passed in this body last Thursday--promises \nexactly the same kind of benefits, in parallel, that were passed in \n1975, and this is 2005, 30 years later than it should have been. Under \nthe provisions of this act, hospitals and physicians and other health \nprofessionals will be able to share this information about their \npractices with independent PSOs, or patient safety organizations, \nwithout the fear of lawsuits, and this transparency will improve \nquality.\n  America has the absolute best health care in the world. I have seen \nit by\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\ndoing heart transplants, using the best of lasers to resect tumors out \nof the trachea or windpipe, and with developing ventricular assist \ndevices. I was in Tanzania some weeks ago working at a small clinic out \nin the bush, and when you look back at America, we have the most \nadvanced health care in the world, with new treatments and techniques, \nimproving millions of lives every day.\n  Through this bill, we are putting that same sort of American \ningenuity to work in improving patient safety in hospitals and clinics \nand thus getting rid of waste and improving the overall quality of \ncare. This bill is a major step forward to making health care safer and \nless costly, driving up the quality, driving down costs, and getting \nout the waste.\n  I can tell you, this is the first major health bill in this Congress. \nBut I hope in the very near future we will pass other important \nlegislation we are working on in a similarly bipartisan way--namely, \ninformation technology to have privacy-protected, electronic medical \nrecords available to everybody who wants it. It is a bipartisan effort. \nWe have come a long way, and I am hopeful that we can do that in the \nnear future.\n  We are establishing interoperability standards--working with the \nprivate sector to establish interoperability standards which will allow \nthe 6,000 hospitals and 900,000 physicians out there to be able to \ncommunicate in a seamless way, with privacy-protected information. \nAgain, it is another bill that would get rid of waste, drive down the \ncost of health care, and improve quality.\n  I am excited about these health initiatives. I thank my colleagues \nwho have specifically been involved in this bill, including Chairman \nMike Enzi, Senator Judd Gregg, Senator Jim Jeffords, who has been at it \nas long as anybody--this particular bill on patient safety--and, of \ncourse, Senator Ted Kennedy. On the House side, Chairman Joe Barton and \nranking member John Dingell have done a tremendous job as well \nshepherding through, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. We \nare saving lives and moving American medicine forward.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand that the Republican side has \nfrom 10 until 11, is that correct, under the unanimous consent \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. The first hour is under \nthe control of the majority, the second hour is under the control of \nthe minority, and it reverts back to the majority and then the \nminority.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send to the desk a list of 61 cosponsors \nof S. 397, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that is \ncurrently pending before the Senate, and I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                          Cosponsors, By Date\n\n       Sen.

Mr. President, the reason I sent that list of cosponsors \nto the desk is to demonstrate to all of our colleagues that 61 \nSenators--60 plus myself--are now in support of the legislation that is \npending before the Senate that we will move to active consideration of \nthis afternoon at 2 o'clock. I think it demonstrates to all of us the \nbroad, bipartisan support this legislation has and a clear recognition \nthat the time for S. 397 has arrived.\n  This legislation prohibits one narrow category of lawsuits: suits \nagainst the firearms industry for damages resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a firearm or ammunition by a third party.\n  It is very important for everybody to understand that it is that and \nnothing more. These predatory lawsuits are aimed at bankrupting the \nfirearms industry. The courts of our Nation are supposed to be a forum \nfor resolving controversies between citizens and providing relief where \nit is warranted, not a mechanism for achieving political ends that are \nrejected by the people's representatives, the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Time and time again down through history, that rejection has occurred \non this floor and the floor of the other body.\n  Interest groups, knowing that clear well, have now chosen the court \nroute to attempt to destroy this very valuable industry in our country.\n  Over two dozen suits have been filed on a variety of theories, but \nall seek the same goal of forcing law-abiding businesses selling a \nlegal product to pay for damages from the criminal misuse of that \nproduct. I must say, if the trial bar wins here, the next step could be \nanother industry and another product.\n  While half of these lawsuits have already been fully and finally \ndismissed, other cases are still on appeal and pending. Hundreds of \nmillions of dollars are still being spent. The bill would require the \ndismissal of existing suits, as well as future suits that fit this very \nnarrow category of description. It is not a gun industry immunity bill \nbecause it does not protect firearms or ammunition manufacturers, \nsellers, or trade associations from any other lawsuits based on their \nown negligence or criminal conduct.\n  This bill gives specific examples of lawsuits not prohibited--product \nliability, negligence or negligent entrustment, breach of contract, \nlawsuits based on violations of States and Federal law. And yet, we \nalready heard the arguments on the floor yesterday, and I am quite \nconfident we will hear them again and tomorrow, that this is a sweeping \napproach toward creating immunity for the firearms industry.\n  I repeat for those who question it, read the bill and read it \nthoroughly. It is not a long bill. It is very clear and very specific.\n  The trend of abusive litigation targeting the firearms industry not \nonly defies common sense and concepts of fundamental fairness, but it \nwould do nothing to curb criminal gun violence. Furthermore, it \nthreatens a domestic industry that is critical to our national defense, \njeopardizes hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and puts at risk \naccess Americans have to a legal product used for hundreds of years \nacross this Nation for lawful purposes, such as recreation and self-\ndefense.\n  Thirty-three States enacted similar gun lawsuit bans or civil \nliability protection. In other words, already 33\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\nStates, because of our silence, have felt it necessary to speak up to \nprotect law-abiding citizens from this misuse of our courts.\n  Yesterday, opponents repeatedly charged that negligent businesses and \npeople would be let off the hook by this bill. It was even stated that \nthis bill would bar virtually all negligence and product liability \ncases in States and Federal courts. I repeat, nothing can be further \nfrom the truth. For those who come to this floor to make that charge, \nmy challenge to them is to read the bill. Obviously they have not. They \nare simply following the script of the anti-gun community of this \nNation. That is not fair to Senators on this floor to be allowed to \nbelieve what this legislation simply does not do nor does it say.\n  The bill affirmatively allows lawsuits brought against the gun \nindustry when they have been negligent. The bill affirmatively allows \nproduct liability action. Any manufacturer, distributor, or dealer who \nknowingly violates any State or Federal law can be held civilly liable \nunder the bill. This bill does not shut the courthouse door.\n  Under S. 397, plaintiffs will have the opportunity to argue that \ntheir case falls under the exception, such as violations of Federal and \nState law, negligent entrustment, knowingly transferring to a dangerous \nperson. That is what that all means, that you have knowingly sold a \nfirearm to a person who cannot legally have it or who you have reason \nto believe could use it for a purpose other than intended. That all \ncomes under the current definition of Federal law.\n  Breach of contract or the warranty or the manufacture or sale of a \ndefective product--these are all well-accepted legal principles, and \nthey are protected by this bill. Current cases where a manufacturer, \ndistributor, or dealer knowingly violates a State or Federal law will \nnot be thrown out.\n  Opponents have complained about the Senate considering this bill at \nthe same time and even have impugned the motives of the Senators who \nsupport it. The votes yesterday speak for themselves. Sixty-six \nSenators said it is time we got this bill before the Senate, and that \nis where we are today. When a supermajority of the Senate speaks, there \nis no question that the Senate moves, as it should, in that direction. \nThe Senate could not muster the votes needed to invoke cloture on the \nDefense authorization bill which would have moved us to a final vote on \nthat measure possibly by tonight. But the Senate, as I have said, by a \nwide margin spoke yesterday to the importance of dealing with this \nissue. Sixty-six Senators said let's deal with it now, and I have just \nsent to the desk 61 signatures of the cosponsors of this bill that \ndemonstrate broad bipartisan support.\n  I think it is appropriate to consider all of this in the context of \nthe Defense authorization bill because the reckless lawsuits we are \nseeking to stop are aimed at businesses that supply our soldiers, our \nsailors, and our airmen with their firepower. Stop and think about it. \nWould there ever be a day when all of our military would be armed with \nweapons manufactured in a foreign nation? There are many in this \ncountry, in driving or attempting to drive our firearm manufacturers \nfrom this country, who would have it that way.\n\n  Clearly, it is within the appropriate context as we deal with Defense \nauthorization that we ought to be talking about the credibility and the \nassurance we are able to sustain the firearm manufacturing industry in \nthis country. In fact, the United States is the only major world power \nthat does not have a firearm factory of its own. That is something that \nsimply ought not be tolerated. Thirty-eight of our colleagues of both \nparties signed on to a letter to Majority Leader Frist making this very \npoint: the importance of protecting America's small firearms industries \nagainst reckless lawsuits.\n  I would read from that letter, but I see that my colleague from \nOklahoma is now on the floor wishing to discuss this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor in recognition of Senator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Idaho for \nhis unwavering faithfulness to the Constitution and upholding his oath \nas a Senator, as a Member of this body.\n  The Bill of Rights is important to us, and I rise today in support of \nthat Bill of Rights and, in particular, the second amendment. Not only \ndo I believe the right to bear arms is guaranteed by the U.S. \nConstitution, I exercise that right personally as a gun owner. I stand \non behalf of the people of Oklahoma who adamantly believe in the second \namendment and the right to carry arms and against the attack on that \nright by the frivolous lawsuits that have come about of late.\n  We have seen many attempts to curtail the second amendment. Nearly a \ndecade ago anti-gun activists tried to limit the right of law-abiding \ncitizens under the banner of ``terrorism'' legislation by slipping in \nanti-gun provisions.\n  In another line of attack, the anti-gun lobby responded to decreasing \nenthusiasm for limiting handguns by promoting a new form of gun \ncontrol--a cosmetic ban on guns labeled with the inflammatory title \n``assault weapons.'' While that ban expired in 2004, we will likely see \nMembers of this body attempt to add a renewal and expansion of that ban \non this bill today.\n  Now anti-gun activists have found another way to constrict the right \nto bear arms and attack the Bill of Rights and attack the Constitution, \nand that is through frivolous litigation. They have not succeeded in \njailing thousands of law-abiding Americans for having guns, or making \nthe registration and purchase process so onerous that nobody bothers to \nbuy a gun. They have failed to get their cosmetic weapons ban renewed. \nSo now they must attack the arms industry financially through \nlawsuits--frivolous lawsuits, I might say.\n  This is why we are here today--to put a stop to the unmeritorious \nlitigation that threatens to bankrupt a vital industry in this country.\n  As an important aside, I strongly believe it is important that we not \nwrite legislation that provides immunity for an industry that knowingly \nharms consumers.\n  It is also important that those who commit crimes, with or without \nthe use of firearms, should be punished for their actions. I have \nalways been a strong supporter of tough crime legislation. However, \nmake no mistake, the lawsuits that will be prohibited under this \nlegislation are intended to drive the gun industry out of business. \nWith no gun industry, there is no second amendment right because there \nis no supply.\n  These lawsuits against gun manufacturers and sellers are not directed \nat perpetrators of crime. Instead, they are part of a stealth effort to \nlimit gun ownership, and I oppose any such effort adamantly.\n  Anti-gun activists have failed to advance their agenda at the ballot \nbox. They failed to advance their agenda in the legislatures. \nTherefore, they are hoping these cases will be brought before \nsympathetic activist judges--activist judges--who will determine by \njudicial fiat that the arms industry is responsible for the action of \nthird parties.\n  Additionally, trial lawyers are working hand in glove with the anti-\ngun activists because they see the next litigation cash cow, the next \ncause of action that will create a fortune for them in legal fees.\n  As a result of some of the efforts of the anti-gun activists and some \ntrial lawyers, the gun manufacturing and sales industry face huge costs \nthat arise from simply defending unjustified lawsuits, not to mention \nthe potential of runaway verdicts. This small industry has already \nexperienced over $200 million in such charges. Even one large verdict \ncould bankrupt an entire industry.\n  Since 1988, individuals and municipalities have filed dozens of novel \nlawsuits against members of the firearms industry. These suits are not \nintended to create a solution. They are intended to drive the gun \nindustry out of business by holding manufacturers and dealers liable \nfor the intentional and criminal act of third parties over whom they \nhave absolutely no control.\n  In testimony before a House subcommittee in 2005, the general counsel \nof the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc., said:\n\n       I believe a conservative estimate of the total, industry-\n     wide cost of defending ourselves to date now exceeds $200 \n     million.\n\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\n\n  What does that produce in our country other than waste and abnormal \nenrichment of the legal system?\n  This is a huge sum for a small industry such as the gun industry. The \nfirearms industry taken together would not equal the value of a Fortune \n500 company.\n  The danger that these lawsuits could destroy the gun industry is \nespecially threatening because our national security and our civil \nliberties are at stake.\n  First, the gun industry manufactures firearms for America's military \nforces and law enforcement agencies, the 9, the 11. Due in part to \nFederal purchasing rules these guns are made in the U.S. by American \nworkers. Successful lawsuits could leave the U.S. at the mercy of small \nforeign suppliers.\n  Second, by restricting the gun industry's ability to make and sell \nguns and ammunition, the lawsuits threaten the ability of Americans to \nexercise their second amendment right to bear arms.\n  Finally, if the firearms industry must continue to spend millions of \ndollars on litigation or eventually goes bankrupt, thousands of people \nwill lose their jobs. Secondary suppliers to gunmakers will also have \nsuffered and will continue to suffer.\n  This is why it is not surprising that the labor unions, representing \nworkers at major firearms plants, such as the International Association \nof Machinists and Aerospace Workers in East Alton, IL, support this \nbill. This union's business representatives stated that the jobs of \ntheir 2,850 union members ``would disappear if trial lawyers and \nopportunistic politicians get their way.''\n  The economic impact of this problem may be felt in other ways. In my \nhome State of Oklahoma, hunting and fishing creates an enormous \neconomic impact. It is tremendously positive. Hunters bring in retail \nsales of over $292 million per year; 6,755 jobs in Oklahoma are \ndependent on hunting; $137,122,000 in salaries and wages in Oklahoma \nalone; and $22 million in State sales tax per year. The financial \ninsolvency of gun manufacturers and sellers would have a devastating \neffect on my State and many other States similar to Oklahoma.\n  Insurance rates for firearm manufacturers have skyrocketed since \nthese suits began, and some manufacturers are already being denied \ninsurance and seeing their policies canceled, leaving them unprotected \nand vulnerable to bankruptcy.\n  That is the ultimate goal of these suits--bankruptcy and the \nelimination of this arms industry. Because of that, 33 State \nlegislatures have acted to block similar lawsuits, either by limiting \nthe power of localities to file suit or by amending State product \nliability laws. However, it only takes one lawsuit in one State to \nbankrupt the entire industry, making all of those State laws \ninconsequential. That is why it is essential that we pass Federal \nlegislation.\n\n  Additionally, plaintiffs in these suits demand enormous monetary \ndamages and a broad variety of injunctive relief relating to the \ndesign, the manufacture, the distribution, the marketing, and the sale \nof firearms.\n  Some of their demands: One-gun-a-month purchase restrictions not \nrequired by State laws; requiring manufacturers and distributors to \n``participate in a court-ordered study of lawful demand for firearms \nand to cease sales in excess of lawful demand; ``prohibition on sales \nto dealers who are not stocking dealers with at least $250,000 of \ninventory--in other words, we are going to regulate how much you have \nto have in inventory before you can be a gun seller; a permanent \ninjunction requiring the addition of a safety feature for handguns that \nwill prevent their discharge by ``those who steal handguns''; and a \nprohibition on the sales of guns near Chicago that by their design are \nunreasonably attractive to criminals.\n  These lawsuits are frivolous. Anti-gun activists want to blame \nviolent acts of third parties on manufacturers of guns for simply \nmanufacturing guns and sellers of guns for simply selling them. This \ndoesn't make any sense. This would be the equivalent of holding a car \ndealer responsible for a person who intentionally runs down a \npedestrian simply because the car that was sold by the dealer was used \nby a third party to commit negligent homicide.\n  Guns, like many other things, can be dangerous in the wrong hands. \nThe manufacturer or seller of a gun who is not negligent and obeys all \napplicable laws should not be held accountable for the unforeseeable \nactions of a third party. This is a country based on personal \naccountability, and when we start muddying that aspect of our law and \nculture we will see all sorts of unintended consequences.\n  Most of the victims of gun injuries I have seen in the emergency room \nas a practicing physician were people who were intentionally shot by \nother people. The gun was the mechanism that was used, but it was the \nindividual who carried out that act. The gun was a tool. Should we ban \nall tools that are capable of committing homicide or committing injury? \nThese people were not injured by defective guns or defective \nammunition. The individuals who shot these patients deserve aggressive \nprosecution, not the industry that made the guns or the legal sellers \nof the guns. Even when I treated individuals who injured themselves \nwith guns, these tragedies were accidents. It was not part of a quality \nor product defect. It was an act of stupidity on the part of people. \nPart of our freedom comes with the ability to make wise choices. If we \nlimit our ability to make choices, then we limit our freedom.\n  These lawsuits are part of an anti-gun activist effort to make an end \nrun around the legislative system. We have seen that in multiple areas \nin our country. When you can't pass it in the legislature, you get an \nactivist judge to get done what you wanted to do in the first place, \neven though a majority of Americans and a majority of legislatures \ndon't want it. But one judge decides for the rest of us.\n  We are coming up on a judicial nomination for the Supreme Court. One \nof the questions that has to be asked is what is the proposal, What is \nthe role in terms of judges making law rather than interpreting law? It \nwill be a key question.\n  So far judges have not been convinced by their arguments. Here are a \nfew examples. The Louisiana Supreme Court struck down the right of New \nOrleans to bring a suit in the face of a State law forbidding it, in an \nopinion stating clearly:\n\n       This lawsuit constitutes an indirect attempt to regulate \n     the lawful design, manufacture, marketing and sale of \n     firearms.\n\n  Judge Berle M. Schiller of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania struck the nail on the head when dismissing \nall of Philadelphia's allegations, stating that ``the city's action \nseeks to control the gun industry by litigation, an end the city could \nnot accomplish by passing such an ordnance.''\n  The Delaware Superior Court adeptly stated that ``the Court sees no \nduty on the manufacturer's part that goes beyond their duties with \nrespect to design and manufacture. The Court cannot imagine that a \nweapon can be designed that operates for law-abiding people but not for \ncriminals.''\n  A word of caution. Most new tort ideas took a while to work. All it \nwould take is one multimillion-dollar lawsuit to severely damage this \nindustry. This bill is limited in scope. It protects only licensed and \nlaw-abiding firearms and ammunition manufacturers and sellers from \nlawsuits that seek to hold manufacturers and sellers responsible for \nthe crime that third party criminals commit with their nondefective \nproducts.\n  Manufacturers and sellers are still responsible for their own \nnegligent or criminal conduct and must operate entirely within the \nFederal and State laws.\n  Firearms and ammunition manufacturers or sellers may be held liable \nfor negligent entrustment or negligence per se; violation of a State or \nFederal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product \nwhere the violation was the proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought; breach of contract or warranty; and product defect. \nThey still are responsible for all that through this bill. It takes \nnone of that away. It holds personal accountability solid and \nsteadfast. It does not infringe on it. Claimants may still go to court \nto argue that their claims fall under one of the exceptions.\n  In my opinion, gun manufacturers and sellers are already policed \nenough, too much, through hundreds of pages of\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\nstatutes, hundreds of pages of regulations. To name a few sources of \nregulations of guns and ammunition: the Internal Revenue Code, \nincluding the National Firearms Act postal regulations restricting \nshipping of handguns; Federal explosive law; regulations for gunpowder \nand ammunition manufacture; the Arms Export Control Act; the Commerce \nDepartment export regulations; the Department of Transportation \nregulations on ammunition explosives and hazardous material transport.\n  In addition to keeping explicit records that can be inspected by \nBATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, \nlicensed dealers have to conduct a Federal criminal background check on \ntheir retail sales either directly by the FBI through its national \ninstant criminal background check or through State systems that also \nuse the NICS system. All retail gun buyers are screened to the best of \nthe Government's ability.\n  Additionally, the industry has voluntary programs to promote safe gun \nstorage and to help dealers avoid sales to potential illegal \ntraffickers.\n  Manufacturers also have a time-honored tradition of acting \nresponsibly to make recalls or make repairs as they become aware of \nproduct defects.\n  In the past, Congress has found it necessary to protect other \nclasses; for example, the light aircraft industry. Jim Inhofe, a \nSenator from Oklahoma, moved that through the House and ultimately \nthrough the Senate, an industry that was killed, literally destroyed by \nfrivolous lawsuits. Community health centers, same thing; the aviation \nindustry; the medical implant makers; Amtrak--we have created a special \nexception for Amtrak--the computer industry members who are affected by \nY2K. We took the nonsense out of the courts and put it where it \nbelongs, into statutes with common sense that requires personal \naccountability and responsibility.\n  Furthermore, Congress may enact litigation reform when lawsuits are \naffecting interstate commerce. In many of these lawsuits cities and \nindividuals are trying to use the State court to restrict the conduct \nof the firearms industry nationally, often contrary to state policies \nexpressed through their own legislatures.\n\n  A single verdict in favor of an anti-gun plaintiff could bankrupt or \nregulate an entire segment of the economy--and of America's national \ndefense. It could be out of business, but most importantly, my right, \nOklahomans' right, all of America's right to a guarantee of the second \namendment to the Bill of Rights secured for them in their ability to \nown and use firearms responsibly.\n  This bill will protect our national security. It will protect our \nconstitutional rights. It will protect an industry responsibly, and it \nwill protect thousands of jobs. It also will ensure that people who \nhave suffered a real injury from a real cause of action can be heard \nand taken seriously while law-abiding manufacturers and dealers of \nfirearms may continue to serve the law-abiding citizens exercising \ntheir constitutionally guaranteed second amendment rights.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I just came from our Republican Senate \ncloakroom doing an interview on this important piece of legislation, \nand I thought that in the course of that interview there was an \ninteresting comment made by the person on the other end of the line: \nWhy are you doing this now? And I thought it would be important for me \nto put it in the appropriate context because there is a tremendous \nnumber of important issues before the U.S. Congress at this time that \nthe American people are highly concerned about because we are headed \ntoward the end of the week. As the leader said a few moments ago, we \nare headed toward the August recess, which means Congress, in its \ntraditional way, will take the month of August off for personal time \nand family vacation as do many Americans, and we reconvene after Labor \nDay.\n  So why now are you addressing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act, S. 397? It was stated in the context that the Senate really \ncan only chew gum or dribble a ball, but it can't do both. What I think \nis important for those who might be listening to understand is that we \ncan chew gum and dribble a ball at the same time, and probably keep \nmultiple balls in the air. That is exactly what the leader is doing at \nthis moment.\n  Last night, I signed, and I think the Presiding Officer signed, a \ndocument that we are very proud of that has been 6 years in coming to \nthe desk of the President of the United States, and now comes to this \nPresident because of his very clear urging, and that is the national \nenergy policy.\n  Yes, the Congress of the United States has completed its work on a \nnational energy policy, and we believe we can take up the conference \nreport now on the floor of the Senate during the remainder of the week \nbefore we recess, and we hope that all of our colleagues would let us \nstep back for a moment from this legislation to do so before we move to \nfinal passage.\n  It is very possible that we could also do the transportation \nconference report. We have extended the legal authority under the \nTransportation Act 11 times while the Senate and the House did its \nwork, and I hope we would not extend it anymore. So, clearly, there are \nmultiple things we can do, and I trust we will do, before we adjourn \nfor the August recess. But I think the Presiding Officer and I would \nagree that when our President came to town, now, nearly 6 years ago--\nand I remember President George W. Bush elect in the leader's office \nsaying: While I spent a good deal of the campaign time talking about \neducation and a variety of other issues, I am here now to talk about \nnational energy. And the first thing I am going to do as a President-\nelect and a sworn-in President is to name a task force headed by the \nVice President to recommend to the Congress the development of a \nnational comprehensive energy policy.\n  He did, but we did not. He pushed, but we could not produce. He \ncontinued to push, and now we have produced, and finally we have a \ncomprehensive energy policy before us. So I would say to those \nlistening and to all of our colleagues, I hope we can dribble a ball \nand chew gum at the same time and get all of this work done before the \nAugust recess. If reasonable heads prevail, we should get it all done \nby late Friday night. But the leader also said we do have Saturday, and \nwe will get our work done. By early afternoon today, we will be on S. \n397, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Firearms Act.\n  What I would like to do at this time is read a letter that we sent to \nMajority Leader Frist that we think sets into the right context exactly \nwhy we are here today and tomorrow debating this important legislation.\n  The letter goes something like this: Dear Majority Leader Frist--and \nthis was sent on July 12, signed by a great many Senators, Democrats, \nand Republicans alike, Max Baucus, who is my cosponsor of this \nlegislation, and I, along with a good many others. We said:\n\n       In the early days of World War II, President Franklin \n     Roosevelt foresaw that America ``must be the great arsenal of \n     democracy.'' Americans rose to that challenge, producing \n     unprecedented quantities of arms, not only for U.S. forces \n     but also for our allies around the world.\n       That tradition continues during today, during our Global \n     War on Terror. In 2004-2005, the United States--the only \n     major world power without a government firearms factory of \n     its own--\n\n  I said, in earlier statements this morning, we are the only major \nworld power where the Government does not own a firearms factory. They \nare all owned by private citizens--\n\n     has contracted to buy over 200,000 rifles, pistols, machine \n     guns, and other small arms for our soldiers, sailors, airmen \n     and Marines. In addition, the U.S. Army alone uses about 2 \n     billion rounds of ammunition each year--about half of it made \n     by private industry. Those guns and ammunition are made in \n     the U.S. and provide good jobs for hardworking Americans.\n\n  Those gun manufacturing facilities and ammunition facilities are \nspread across the United States.\n\n       Unfortunately, our military suppliers are in danger. Anti-\n     gun activists have taken to the courts to promote their \n     agenda of more restrictive gun control. The very same \n     companies that arm our men and women on the\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\n     front line against terrorism have been sued all over the \n     country, where plaintiffs blame them for the acts of \n     criminals.\n       These lawsuits defy all the rules of traditional tort law. \n     While many have been rejected in the court--\n\n  And that is many of the lawsuits, some 24-plus filed, about half of \nthem now rejected--\n\n     even one verdict for plaintiffs would risk irreparable harm \n     to a vital defense industry.\n       These are some of the reasons I have cosponsored S. 397, \n     the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. This bill \n     would protect America's small arms industry against these \n     lawsuits, while allowing legitimate, recognized types of \n     suits against companies that make defective products, or \n     against gun dealers who break the law.\n\n  I was very clear earlier today that S. 397 sets that out in clear \nfashion.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       We urge you to help safeguard our ``great arsenal of \n     democracy'' by bringing S. 397 to the Senate floor before the \n     August recess, and working to pass it without any amendments \n     that would jeopardize its speedy enactment into law.\n\n  That is why we are here today, because a substantial majority of the \nSenate has urged our leader to bring this important legislation to the \nfloor. We have asked the Senate to be flexible, as is typical in the \nSenate. While we have legislation on the floor and conference reports \non major bills pending, we wanted to come forward to be able to set \naside the legislation and to deal with those, and I trust we will, at \nleast three: conference report on energy, the national energy policy, a \nconference report on transportation, and a conference report on the \nInterior appropriations bill, which has some critical veterans money in \nit that I and others have worked for over the last good number of \nweeks, and we hope all of that can be effectively accomplished before \nwe complete our work by late Friday night or Saturday.\n  I think that with full cooperation from all of our colleagues, we can \nget all of this legislation done in a timely amount of time.\n  Another question was asked of me a few moments ago by the person I \ndid the interview with, who said, well, these are very big companies \nthat make a lot of money and are you not protecting them a great deal?\n  Let me put that into the right context. I am not going to name names, \nbut I will say that I know of at least three firearms companies that \nhave around $100 million worth of sales a year apiece, not collectively \nbut apiece.\n  They were comparing it in this interview with the tobacco industry. I \nsaid, Well, gee, I know of those companies alone, they were selling \n$1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, some of them $2 billion industries in their \ncollective value. So we are talking apples and oranges, an industry \nthat is very limited in its capability that is now being sucked to \ndeath by the trial bar and these frivolous lawsuits to the tune of \nhundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars a year, in necessary \nlegal defenses.\n  So that is why we have been very specific in the law. It is not the \ngun industry immunity bill. It is important that we say that and say it \nagain because it does not protect firearms or ammunitions \nmanufacturers, sellers or trade associations from any lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct. The bill gives specific \nexamples of lawsuits not prohibited. Let me repeat, not prohibited:\n  Product liability, in other words, a gun that is defective, that \nmisfires, that does damage to the operator of it, those definitions are \nclearly spelled out within the law. Negligence or negligent \nentrustment, breach of contract, lawsuits based on a violation of State \nand Federal law, it is very straightforward, and we think it is very \nclear.\n  The trend of abusive litigation targeting the firearms industry not \nonly defies common sense and concepts of fundamental fairness, but it \nwould do nothing to curb criminal violence, and we know that.\n  Furthermore, it threatens the domestic industry that I think is \ncritical, as I have mentioned earlier, to the national defense of this \ncountry.\n  It would be a tragedy, and I do not know of a soldier serving today \nor one who has served that would want to serve with a firearm at his or \nher side being made by a foreign manufacturer. It does not make sense \nwhatsoever. Yet that is the end product of the effort that is under way \ntoday, to simply put firearms manufacturers out of business. If they \ncan be pushed overseas, then other forms of law can be used to block \naccess to firearms or access to the importation of firearms from \nforeign countries. The argument would be foreign nations are attempting \nto flood the American consumer with a foreign product. I have heard the \nargument on the floor by those who have attempted to ban certain types \nof importation over the years.\n  It is an argument well spelled out and well used by many. Faulty as \nit may be, it is an argument that oftentimes resonates to the American \nconsumer. But when the American consumer finds out that they have been \ndenied access to a quality U.S. product or that product does not exist, \nthen the argument turns around.\n  That is why we are on the floor today. That is why we are dealing \nwith this important legislation. It is my understanding that we have \narrived at a unanimous consent agreement that brings us on to the bill \nby 2 this afternoon. I hope at that time many of my colleagues who are \ncosponsors would join with me so that we can move this legislation \nexpeditiously through the Senate. I know there are several amendments \nthat will probably be brought to the floor, most of them destructive to \nthe intent of the bill, marginalizing it at best. As a result, I urge \nall of my colleagues to stay with us on the construct of S. 397, to be \nable to pass it from the Senate as clean as possible, hopefully, very \nclean, so the House can act on it immediately and move it to our \nPresident's desk.\n  That is the intent. As we move through S. 397 over the course of \ntoday and tomorrow, I trust we will also be able to deal with the \nconference reports I have mentioned that I think are extremely \nimportant for this country and for all of us to have prior to the \nAugust recess.\n  I see no other of my colleagues on the floor wishing to speak at this \nmoment and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I take a moment to explain the effect of \nour proceeding to this gun bill. We are putting aside an important \ndebate on national security and the needs of our troops in a time of \nwar. Last Friday I listed a number of the amendments that still were \npending that would affect the National Guard and our Reserve troops and \nalso provide additional kinds of protections for the service men and \nwomen. The decision by the Republican leadership was that we had spent \nenough time on the legislation, even though we chose to spend 2 weeks \nearlier in the year on the credit card industry and on bankruptcy and a \nsimilar amount of time on the class action legislation which benefited \nspecial interest groups. The credit card industry will profit about $6 \nbillion more this year than last year because of the actions taken. We \nalso spent time on the special interest legislation dealing with class \nactions. We spent the time on that, but we are not on the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  We had an important amendment on the whole policy of the \nadministration in developing new nuclear weapons which has profound \nimplications in terms of the issues of nuclear proliferation and \nnuclear safety. We looked forward to having an opportunity to debate \nthat issue. That was put aside by the Republican leadership because \nthey were concerned about a provision that had been introduced to the \nDefense authorization bill last Thursday. Senator Levin, Senator Reed, \nSenator Rockefeller, and I introduced an amendment to create an \nindependent commission to examine the administration's policy \nsurrounding the detention and interrogation of detainees as an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill.\n  The response of the White House was instant and negative. The \nPresident announced he would veto the Defense authorization bill, all \n$442 billion of it, if it included any provisions to restrict the \nPentagon's treatment of detainees or creating a commission to \ninvestigate detainee operations. No other response could have \ndemonstrated so\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\nclearly the urgent need to establish a commission than that this \nimperial White House considers itself immune from restraints by \nCongress on its powers no matter what the Constitution says.\n  It is appalling that the administration is so afraid of the truth \nthat they are even willing to veto the Defense bill which includes \nbillions of dollars for our troops, pay raises for our troops, and \nfunds for armored humvees to protect our troops in Iraq. But the \nadministration was prepared to veto that legislation because of this \namendment that had been offered by Senator Levin, Senator Reed, Senator \nRockefeller, and myself.\n  Now the Senate Republican leaders have pulled the Defense bill from \nthe floor. It is interesting that Republican leaders hatched this plan \nafter Vice President Cheney visited with Senate Republicans last week. \nHe told them the White House does not want votes on amendments to \nrequire an inquiry into their detention policies and practices. The \nWhite House has not only threatened to veto a national defense bill to \navoid accountability, but is preventing us from voting on the issue. It \nis already obvious that the administration's detention and \ninterrogation policy failed to respect the longstanding rules that have \nguided our policy in the past, rejecting the collective wisdom of our \ncareer military and State Department officials. In today's newspapers \nwe see the result of this action once again with the use of dogs \nagainst detainees.\n  We need to return to our core values of openness and accountability. \nThe facts we know so far about torture and other abuses, about \nindefinite detention, have already become recruiting tools for \nterrorists. But if we act now to uphold our principles, we can end the \noutrage, we can end the coverups, and hold officials accountable at the \nhighest levels. We need to disavow the abuses and harsh techniques. We \nneed to ensure our actions do not become an excuse for our enemies to \ntorture American troops when they are captured in the future or to \nattack innocent Americans in any part of the world.\n  The reports of abuse also undermine our own security efforts at home. \nThe vast majority of Muslim Americans and Arab Americans are willing to \nhelp identify potential terrorists, help prevent charitable donations \nfrom being misused, and act as eyes and ears of a community uniquely \ncapable of identifying potential threats. When the reports of abuses go \nunanswered, they undermine the community's willingness to provide that \nassistance. It is impossible for many Muslim Americans and Arab \nAmericans to be persuaded to help against such threats if they feel \ntheir own religious beliefs have been targeted.\n  The reality is our safety and security depend on accountability. It \nis not enough to pretend that problem does not exist, but that is how \nthe President has responded to the flow of reports about abuses. \nContrary to the protests of the administration, we do not have the \nanswers we need. So far, we have had 12 separate so-called \ninvestigations of allegations, but not a single report has adequately \nexamined the role that civilian authorities have played in crafting the \npolicies that led to our missteps. Twelve investigations and counting, \nand the coverup continues.\n  The administration and its proxies in the coverup have vilified \nanyone who calls for a full inquiry into the policies. They even \nstooped to claiming a request for full accounting is somehow a smear \nagainst our troops. The real smear is that the administration continues \nto prosecute only a few low-level offenders without holding accountable \nthe higher-ups who laid the groundwork for all the abuses. The real \ndisservice to our troops and to our country is done by those who leave \nthose at the bottom of the chain of command holding the bag while \nofficials at the top are promoted and rewarded.\n\n  We need a commission independent of political influence to find the \nrelevant facts, not just the facts that suit the partisan needs of the \nadministration. We need an investigation of the country's so-called \nrendition policy which sends detainees to other countries where torture \nis well known. We need answers about the administration's reaction to \nFBI complaints about abuse. We need a thorough assessment of the legal \nregime that is currently in effect.\n  With its willingness to conceal the truth, the administration will \nnever tell the American people about this practice of rendition on its \nown. We need an independent commission to examine our policies and \npractices and make appropriate recommendations. The American people \ndeserve to understand the choices made by this President and to \nevaluate them.\n  In sum, our interrogation and detention policies need much more \nthorough review. In avoiding accountability, the administration has \nmade it clear it won't accept responsibility for giving our Nation the \nclear answers it deserves. As Benjamin Franklin said, half a truth is \noften a great lie. Until now we have been fed half truths and coverups \nby the administration.\n  With the recent veto threat, the White House has declared war on any \nfull and honest accounting of responsibility. The safety of our troops \nand our citizens depends on finding out the whole truth and acting on \nit. An independent commission of respected professionals with \nbackgrounds in law and military policy and international relations is \nthe only way we can learn the truth about what has happened so we can \nend the suppression and establish a policy for the future that is \nworthy of our Nation and worthy of our respect of all nations.\n  Administration secrecy doesn't stop with their interrogation policy. \nThis administration has a systematic disregard for oversight and \nopenness. Government is intended to be ``of the people, by the people, \nand for the people.'' Democracy requires informed citizens, and to be \ninformed, citizens need to have information about the government. \nCongress and the executive branch are supposed to be open and \naccountable, so the American people know what is being done in their \nname. But under the Bush administration, openness and accountability \nhave been replaced by secrecy and evasion of responsibility. They abuse \ntheir power, conceal their actions from the American people, and refuse \nto hold officials accountable.\n  No one disputes the necessity of classifying information critical to \nprotecting our national security--military operations, weapon designs, \nintelligence sources, and similar information. But in the post-9/11 \nworld, the administration is making secrecy the norm and openness the \nexception. It has used the tragedy of 9/11 to classify unprecedented \namounts of information. Material off-limits to the public has become so \nextensive that no other conclusion is possible. The Bush administration \nhas a pervasive strategy to limit access to information in order to \navoid independent evaluation of its actions by Americans whose job it \nis to observe and critique their government. When even Congressmen, \njournalists, and public interest groups complain about limits on access \nto information, we know the difficulties faced by ordinary Americans \nseeking information from their government.\n  At a hearing last August in the House Subcommittee on National \nSecurity, the Director of the Government's Information Security \nOversight Office, J. William Leonard, testified that ``it is no secret \nthat the government classifies too much information. Too much \nclassification unnecessarily impedes effective information sharing.''\n  The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and \nSecurity, Carol A. Haave, said that as much as half of all classified \ninformation doesn't need to be classified.\n  Last year, a record 15.6 million documents were classified by the \nBush administration at a cost of $7.2 billion, many under newly \ninvented categories with fewer requirements for classification.\n  The administration argues that all this secrecy is necessary to win \nthe war on terrorism. But the 9/11 Commission Report said that too much \ngovernment secrecy had hurt U.S. intelligence capability even before 9/\n11. ``Secrecy stifles oversight, accountability, and information \nsharing,'' says the report. They know from their own experience.\n  In July 2003, the 9/11 Commission's cochairmen, Thomas Kean and Lee \nHamilton, complained publicly that the administration was failing to \nprovide requested information.\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\n  In October 2003, the Commission had no choice, after repeated \nrequests, but to subpoena records from the FAA.\n  In November 2003, after multiple requests, the Commission again had \nto subpoena information, this time from the Department of Defense.\n  For the rest of that fall and spring, the administration repeatedly \ntried to deny access to presidential documents important to the \nCommission's investigation, until public outcry grew loud enough to \nconvince the administration otherwise.\n  Key members of the administration balked at testifying, until public \nopinion again swayed their stance.\n  And then, in an ironic twist, 28 pages of the 9/11 Commission Report \nitself was classified. So, is all this secrecy really about protecting \nus from the terrorists? Or is it just to avoid accountability?\n  This administration, once in office, wasted no time challenging those \nwho would hold them accountable. In May 2001, Vice President Cheney's \nenergy task force issued its report recommending more oil and gas \ndrilling to solve our energy problems. In light of his former \nemployment at Halliburton, the recommendation was hardly astonishing. \nWhat was astonishing was the Vice President's refusal to identify the \npeople and groups who helped write the policy. In June 2001, the GAO, \nthe nonpartisan, investigative arm of Congress, requested information \non the energy task force, following reports that campaign contributors \nhad special access while the public was shut out. GAO's request was \nsimple. It asked, ``Who serves on this task force; what information is \nbeing presented to the task force and by whom is it being given; and \nthe costs involved in the gathering of the facts.'' Considering that \nthe task force wrote the nation's energy policy, it was not an \nunreasonable request.\n\n  The administration refused to comply, even though GAO's request was \nnot out of the ordinary. President Clinton's task forces on health care \nand on China trade relations were both investigated by GAO. The Clinton \nadministration turned over detailed information on the participants and \nproceedings of the task forces.\n  But the Bush administration argued that GAO did not have the \nauthority to conduct the investigation. For the first time in its 80-\nyear history, GAO was forced to file suit against an administration to \nobtain requested information. But the court sided with the \nadministration in Walker v. Cheney, and GAO's investigative oversight \nauthority was effectively reduced. Independent oversight is critically \nimportant when one party controls both Congress and the White House, \nand GAO is critical to that oversight.\n  On October 12, 2001, John Ashcroft wrote a memo outlining the Justice \nDepartment's views on Freedom of Information Act requests. The memo set \nthe tone for an administration hostile to such requests. It discouraged \nexecutive branch agencies from responding to Freedom of Information Act \nrequests, even when the agencies had the option to respond. He \nbasically reversed the longstanding policy of prior administrations.\n  The Clinton administration policy, set forth by Attorney General \nJanet Reno, was that if a document could be released without harm, an \nagency should do so, even if there were technical grounds for \nwithholding it. They knew that government openness was essential to an \ninformed public.\n  When the Bush administration came to office, Attorney General \nAshcroft disagreed--he wrote that if there is any technical ground for \nwithholding a document under the Freedom of Information Act, an agency \nshould withhold it. The Clinton policy had been ``release if at all \npossible.'' The Bush policy was ``keep secret if at all possible.''\n  Why should the public know what the administration is doing? Why \nrelease documents that might be embarrassing to the White House or its \nfriends in business?\n  Some organizations claim, based on their experience, that this \nobsession with secrecy goes even farther, and that executive branch \nagencies are being told to withhold information until it is subpoenaed. \nSean Moulton, a senior policy analyst at OMB Watch, argued that ``if \nthere are documents the government doesn't want to release but doesn't \nhave any legal basis for withholding, unless you're willing to go to \ncourt, you're not getting those documents.''\n  Since the tragedy of September 11, this administration has \neffectively shut down inquiry after inquiry:\n  In November 2001, energy companies were planning a natural gas \npipeline through the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Local citizens, \nled by former U.S. Army Ranger Joseph McCormick, asked the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission for a map of the planned pipeline. These \ncitizens weren't being nosy--they wanted to know if a large new \npipeline for natural gas would be going through their backyards. FERC \ndenied the citizens' request in the name of national security, even \nthough this type of information had been public before 9/11. Clearly, \nnational security concerns are legitimate. But without knowledge of the \npipeline's location, how could these citizens defend their property? \nJoseph McCormick put it bluntly: ``There certainly is a balance,'' he \nsaid. ``It's about people's right to use the information of an open \nsociety to protect their rights.''\n  In the fall of 2002, the chemical compound perchlorate was found in \nthe water supply of Aberdeen, Maryland--near the Army's famous Aberdeen \nProving Ground. Perchlorate is a main ingredient of rocket fuel. It \nalso stunts the metabolism and brain growth of newborns. A group of \ncitizens organized, and worked with the Army to protect their drinking \nwater from further contamination. But a few months later, the Army \nbegan censoring maps and information that would help determine which \nareas were contaminated, supposedly in the interest of national \nsecurity--if citizens could find out where the water was contaminated, \nthen terrorists could find it too. The head of the citizens' group was \na 20-year army veteran. His water well was only a mile and a half away \nfrom the proving ground. ``It's an abuse of power,'' he said. ``The \ngovernment has to be transparent.''\n  Even Members of Congress have had to subpoena information in order to \ndo their work. Last October, Congressmen Christopher Shays and Henry \nWaxman, the chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Government \nReform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and \nInternational Relations, asked for an audit of the Development Fund for \nIraq. The copy they received had over 400 items blacked out. They had \nso much difficulty obtaining an unredacted report from the Defense \nDepartment that they had to prepare a subpoena. Once they finally \nreceived an unredacted copy, guess what had been blacked out? More than \n$218 million in charges from Halliburton. So far, no one has been held \naccountable.\n  It has now been 744 days without a White House investigation into the \nCIA leak case. It took 85 days for the administration even to require \nits staff to turn over evidence relating to the leak. Senate \nRepublicans held 20 hearings on accusations against President Clinton \nand the Whitewater case, but they have held zero hearings on the leak \nof the covert identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame. So far, no one has \nbeen held accountable.\n  Last week, the Defense Department refused to cooperate with a federal \njudge's order to release secret photographs and videotapes of prisoner \nabuse at Abu Ghraib. The ACLU had sued to obtain release of 87 \nphotographs and 4 videotapes, but the administration filed sealed \ndocuments resisting the order. They are so obsessed with secrecy that \nthey even make secret arguments to keep their secrets. So far, no one \nhas been held accountable.\n  Also last week, the administration submitted an initial report on \nprogress in training Iraqi security forces. It has been more than 2 \nyears since the fall of Baghdad, and a reliable assessment of our \nprogress in training those forces was long overdue. The key questions \nthat the American people want to know are how many Iraqi security \nforces are capable of fighting on their own and what our military \nrequirements will be the months ahead. But the answers remain \nclassified. The American people deserve to know the facts about our \npolicy. They want to know how long it will take to fully train the \nIraqis and when our military mission will be completed. They can deal \nwith the truth, and they deserve it.\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\n  No one wants to do anything that would help the insurgents. But the \nadministration must do a better job of responding to the legitimate \nconcerns of the American people. The administration still isn't willing \nto be candid. It needs to find a way to shed some of the secrecy and \nanswer these questions in good faith for the American people. The \nsilence is deafening.\n  There is also a pattern of withholding information from members of \nCongress on the administration's nominations. In 2003, Miguel Estrada \nwas nominated for a Federal judgeship. We requested legal memoranda he \nwrote as Assistant Solicitor General, and we were repeatedly denied. In \n2004, Alberto Gonzales was nominated to be Attorney General. We \nrequested various memoranda he authorized on administration torture \npolicy, and we were repeatedly denied. Earlier this year, John Bolton \nwas nominated to be Ambassador to the United Nations. We requested \ndocuments to determine if he acted appropriately in his previous job, \nand we have been repeatedly denied.\n  Instead of coming clean and providing the information to the \nCongress, we have been stonewalled. Our questions have gone unanswered. \nAnd now, the President appears to be poised to abuse his power further, \nrub salt in the wound, and send John Bolton to the United Nations \nanyway with a recess appointment of dubious constitutionality.\n  Now John Roberts has been nominated to a lifetime seat on the Supreme \nCourt. We hope this nomination will not be another occasion for \nadministration secrecy, but press accounts suggest otherwise. Even \nbefore we asked for any documents, the administration announced it will \nnot release many of the memoranda written by John Roberts. The White \nHouse spokesman says they will claim attorney-client privilege, but \nmany of the memos vital to our consideration of Judge Roberts for the \nSupreme Court were written while he worked as a top political and \npolicy official in the Solicitor General's office. That office works \nfor all the American people--not just the President. Attorney-client \nprivilege clearly has never been a bar to providing the Senate with \nwhat it needs to process a nomination.\n  As we all know, no one is simply entitled to serve on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. One has to earn that right. And one earns \nthat right by getting the support of the American people, reflected in \nthe vote here in the United States Senate. And that is what the \nconfirmation process is all about. We know that the administration is \nfamiliar with and aware of Judge Roberts' positions on various issues. \nThey have had a year to study it and had their associates talk with him \nand with those who worked with him. The real question is: Shouldn't the \nAmerican people have the opportunity to get the same kind of \ninformation so that they can form their own impression and so that the \nSenate can make a balanced, informed judgment and see whether or not \nthe balance in the Supreme Court will be furthered? That is the issue \nand it appears that the administration is continuing to withhold \nimportant information that would permit the Congress the ability to do \nso.\n  Yes, the administration has consistently used the horror of 9/11 and \nits disdain of congressional oversight to get its way and avoid \naccountability. It consistently uses this secrecy to roll back the \nrights of average Americans. But even its best spin doctors can't \nconceal some of the administration's most flagrant abuses of power.\n  Last August, the New York Times reported that ``health rules, \nenvironmental regulations, energy initiatives, worker-safety standards \nand product-safety disclosure policies have been modified in ways that \noften please business and industry leaders while dismaying interest \ngroups representing consumers, workers, drivers, medical patients, the \nelderly and many others.'' Often, this has been done in silence and \nnear secrecy.\n  In 2000, Congress responded to the disclosure of defects in Firestone \ntires, which may have been responsible for as many as 270 deaths, by \npassing legislation which would make information on auto safety and \nrelated defects readily available. But in July 2003, the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration decided that reports of defects \nwould cause ``substantial competitive harm'' to the auto industry, and \nexempted warranty claims and consumer complaints from the Freedom of \nInformation Act. Clearly, that was another abuse of power that protects \nbig business while putting the American public at greater risk.\n  In 2003, the administration knowingly withheld cost estimates of its \nMedicare prescription drug bill--one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation that year. The estimates showed costs over $100 billion \nmore than the administration claimed, but the information was withheld \nbecause of fears that the actual numbers would persuade Members of \nCongress to vote no. Administration officials threatened to fire Chief \nActuary Richard Foster ``so fast his head would spin,'' if he informed \nCongress of the real cost estimate. I wrote a letter to the \nadministration on this subject, but they never responded to my \nquestions.\n  In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration kept secret a report that \nchildren on antidepressants were twice as likely to be involved in \nsuicide-related behavior. The FDA also prevented the author of the \nstudy--their expert on the issue--from presenting his findings to an \nFDA advisory committee. Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, a Harvard psychiatrist, \nsaid ``Evidence that they're suppressing a report like this is an \noutrage, given the public health and safety issues at stake . . . For \nthe FDA to issue an ambiguous warning when they had unambiguous data \nlike this is an outrage.''\n  In November 2003, the White House told the Appropriations Committees \nin both Houses of Congress that it would only respond to requests for \ninformation if they were signed by the committee chairman. In a time of \none-party rule, this tactic made congressional oversight almost \ncompletely impossible.\n\n  In April 2004, the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Jeffords, was forced to place holds on several EPA \nnominees after the administration refused to respond to twelve \noutstanding information requests, including information on air \npollution.\n  In August 2004, under pressure from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the FCC decided to make telephone service outage reports \nconfidential, and exempt them from Freedom of Information Act requests. \nThe FCC argued it was because companies could use competitors' service \noutages in ad campaigns. You may not be able to make informed decisions \non your phone company, but at least the company will be protected from \nnasty advertising.\n  Last month, we discovered that the administration had blocked studies \ncriticizing the Central American Free Trade Agreement--after it had \nalready paid for them. In 2002, the Department of Labor hired the \nInternational Labor Rights Fund to back up its argument that Central \nAmerican countries had improved on labor issues. The contractor found \nthe opposite, and posted its results on its Web site in March 2004. The \nLabor Department ordered its removal from the website, banned its \nrelease, and barred the contractor's employees from discussing the \nreport. The Department of Labor denied a Congressman's request for the \nreport under the Freedom of Information Act. These are the American \npeople's tax dollars. But when the administration didn't like an \nanswer, it abused its power to avoid accountability--at their expense.\n  Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal disclosed yet another list of \nabuses in Iraq reconstruction. Ten billion dollars of no-bid contracts \nwere awarded; $89 million was doled out without contracts at all; $9 \nbillion is unaccounted for, and may have been embezzled. An official \nfired for incompetence was still giving out millions of dollars in aid, \nweeks after his termination. A contractor was paid twice for the same \njob. A third of all U.S. vehicles that Halliburton was paid to manage \nare missing. It is a staggering display of incompetence and cover-up, \nso that no one will be held accountable.\n  Americans deserve better. They deserve the information necessary to \nbecome informed, effective citizens. We as lawmakers are better able to \nrepresent our constituents when we have access to the critical \ninformation held by the executive branch. We must never forget who we \nwork for--the American people. Congress is a co-equal branch of \ngovernment, and we\n\n[[Page S9069]]\n\nhave a duty to hold the administration accountable for its actions.\n  Mr. President, on the matter we have before the Senate at the present \ntime, here we go again on the issue of legal immunity for the gun \nindustry. Without shame, the Republican leadership has brought back \nthis special interest, anti-law enforcement bill that strips away the \nrights of victims to go to court.\n  Why the urgency to take up this bill now? This is a critical moment \nin this country's future. Surely, the Republican leadership can take \nsome time to address other priorities before attempting to give a free \npass to the gun industry. Why aren't we completing our work on the \nDefense authorization bill? That is what was before the Senate. Why \nhave we displaced a full and fair debate on the issue of the Defense \nauthorization bill--which has so many provisions in there concerning \nour fighting men and women in Iraq and about the National Guard and \ndefense--in order to consider special interest legislation?\n  That is what is before the Senate, and that is what we are \nconsidering at the present time, as a result of the Republican \nleadership. Surely, the Congress can do more for our citizens than rush \nto pass unprecedented special interest legislation. We can and should \nbe acting to meet our real challenges.\n  Last year, the Federal Government recalled a water pistol, the Super \nSoaker, just a few days before the assault weapons ban expired. America \ndoes more to regulate the safety of toy guns than real guns, and it is \na national disgrace. The gun industry has worked hard to avoid Federal \nconsumer safety regulation. Where are our priorities? Where is the \nlogic in passing a bill that makes it harder to sue for harm caused by \nreal guns than harm caused by a plastic toy gun?\n  The industry has conspicuously failed to use technology to make guns \nsafer. It has attempted to insulate itself from its distributors and \ndealers, once guns leave the factory. Under this bill, it will not even \nmatter if the guns are stolen by factory employees and snuck out of the \nfactory in the middle of the night.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe gun dealers and gun \nmanufacturers should be held accountable for their irresponsible \nconduct, similar to everyone else.\n  Cities, counties, and States incur billions of dollars in costs each \nyear as a result of gun violence. Studies estimate that the public cost \nof firearm-related injuries is over $1 million for each shooting \nvictim. Yet this bill would take a fierce toll and dismiss even pending \ncases where communities are trying to get relief.\n  This bill would bar the legal rights of hard-working law enforcement \nofficers, such as Ken McGuire and David Lemongello. These two police \nofficers from Orange, NJ, were seriously wounded in a shootout with a \nburglary suspect. The gun used by the suspect was one of 12 guns sold \nby a West Virginia pawnshop to an obvious straw purchaser for an \nillegal gun trafficker. Fortunately for the officers, this bill did not \nbecome law last year, and their case was able to proceed.\n  Recently, David Lemongello was able to obtain a $1 million \nsettlement. Significantly, the settlement required the dealer and other \narea pawnshops to adopt safer practices. These reforms go beyond the \nrequirements of current law and are not imposed by any manufacturers or \ndistributors. This is not about money. This is about public safety, and \nI commend these brave officers for their courageous battle to change \nthe system.\n  It is clear what will happen if Congress gives the gun industry this \nunprecedented legal immunity, on top of its existing exemption from \nFederal consumer safety regulations. Guns will be more dangerous. Gun \ndealers will be more irresponsible. More guns will be available to \nterrorists and criminals. There will be more shootings and more dead \nchildren.\n  The Nation's response to this death toll has been unacceptable. Yet, \nyear after year, little changes in our approach to regulating guns. How \ncan we justify this neglect? How can we continue to ignore the vast \ndiscrepancy in gun deaths in the United States compared to other \nnations? How can we possibly justify this effort to give the gun \nindustry even greater protection for irresponsible behavior?\n  Mr. President, this bill is nothing short of Congress aiding and \nabetting the provision of guns to criminals. It takes the gun industry \noff the hook when their guns are sold to the wrong people who are out \nto hurt us. Under this administration, we have seen the budget cuts to \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, so our law enforcement do \nnot have the resources they need to keep guns out of criminal hands. \nThat is why these citizen lawsuits are so important. If the police \ncannot do their job, then citizens should be able to do it. But this \nlegislation will throw the citizens out of court. It is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in \nopposition to the motion to proceed on the gun liability bill.\n  Before I begin, I want to say I find it incongruous that we had the \nDefense Authorization bill up, an important bill--we were about to \nconsider some amendments affecting enemy combatants and detainees, I \nthink very important amendments, by Senator McCain, Senator Warner, and \nSenator Graham. The bill was up for an unprecedented short time, and \nhad to have cloture, according to the Republican side. Well, some of us \nwanted to hear what Senators McCain, Warner, and Graham had to say. So, \nwe voted against cloture. Then, the leader took down the bill, and now \nwe are on a bill for a real special interest in this country, the \nNational Rifle Association.\n  Mr. President, I have carefully reviewed this bill, and in my \nassessment is it is mistitled. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act has nothing to do with protecting lawful commerce; rather, it \nprotects one segment of industry against the lawful interests of our \nStates in remedying and deterring negligent conduct.\n  The bill pretends to be part of the long-ranging and important debate \nabout gun regulation. Its proponents argue that lawsuits need to be \nstopped in order to defend their view of the second amendment. But that \nis pretense. This bill is a simple giveaway to one industry--the gun \nlobby. It is a special-interest windfall.\n  I, for one, do not believe we should be giving the gun industry \nsweeping and unprecedented protection from the type of lawsuits that \nare available to every individual involving every other industry \nanywhere in America.\n  We have to recognize that guns in America are responsible for the \ndeaths of 30,000 Americans a year. If we remove this one avenue for \nenforcing responsibility, individuals will have no recourse. Gun owners \nand gun victims alike will be left virtually powerless against an \nindustry that is already immune from so many other consumer \nprotections. So we find ourselves today on the cusp of yet another NRA \nvictory.\n  Simply put, we are considering legislation that would ensure that it \nis not in the financial interests of gun manufacturers or sellers to \ntake reasonable care in administering their business. We are removing \nthe incentives of the tort system to encourage responsible behavior. No \nlonger will those incentives to responsible behavior be present.\n  Let me be clear, if this bill is approved, it will not be a victory \nfor law-abiding gun owners who might someday benefit from the ability \nto sue a manufacturer or dealer for their negligent conduct. No, this \nwill be a victory for those who have turned the NRA into a political \npowerhouse, unconcerned with the rights of a majority of Americans who \nwant prudent controls over firearms and who want to maintain their \nbasic legal right in our civil law system.\n  Now, I do not support meritless lawsuits against the gun industry. I \ndo not think anybody does. It is my belief gun manufacturers and \ndealers should be held accountable for irresponsible marketing and \ndistribution practices, as anyone else would be, particularly when \nthese practices may cause guns to fall into the hands of criminals, \njuveniles or mentally ill people.\n  This legislation has one simple purpose: to prevent lawsuits from \nthose harmed by gun violence as a result of the wrongful conduct of \nothers. These include lawsuits filed by cities and\n\n[[Page S9070]]\n\ncounties responding to crimes often committed using guns that flood the \nillegal market, with the full knowledge of the distributors that the \nlegal market could not possibly be absorbing so many of these weapons--\nthat is why so many mayors have written strongly against this \nlegislation--and lawsuits filed by organizations on behalf of their \nmembers and victims of violent crimes and their families who are \ninjured or killed as a result of gun violence facilitated by the \nnegligence of gun manufacturers or sellers.\n  This issue is not an abstract one. The bill is going to hurt real \npeople--victims not only of criminal misuse by a well-designed firearm, \nbut victims of guns that have been marketed in ways which, quite \nfrankly, should be illegal.\n  Essentially, this bill prohibits any civil liability lawsuit from \nbeing filed against the gun industry for damages resulting from the \ncriminal or unlawful misuse of a gun by a third party, with a number of \nnarrow exceptions.\n  In doing so, the bill effectively rewrites traditional principles of \nliability law which generally hold that persons and companies may be \nliable for their negligence, even if others are liable as well. This \nbill would essentially give the gun industry blanket immunity from \ncivil liability cases of this type, an immunity no other industry in \nAmerica has today. This is truly a remarkable aspect of the \nlegislation. It is a radical approach to our Nation's laws and the \nprinciples of federalism.\n  The bill does allow certain cases to move forward, as its supporters \nhave pointed out, but these cases can proceed only on the narrowest of \ncircumstances. Countless experts have now said that this bill would \nstop virtually all of the suits against gun dealers and manufacturers \nfiled to date which are based on distribution practice, many of which \nare vital to changing industry practice and compensating victims who \nhave been horribly injured through the clear negligence or even \nborderline criminal conduct of some gun dealers and manufacturers.\n  With any other business or product, in every other industry, a seller \nor manufacturer can be liable if that seller or manufacturer is \nnegligent, but not here. Since money, rather than life or liberty, is \nat stake in a civil case, the standard of proof is lower. There need \nnot be a criminal violation to recover damages. In the overwhelming \nmajority of civil cases, there is no criminal violation. But here, \ncontrary to general negligence law covering almost every other product, \nthe bill allows negligent gun dealers and manufacturers to get off the \nhook unless they violated a criminal law. This is dreadful. It is \ndespicable. This bill would create a special area of law for gun \nmanufacturers and says that unless they violate a law, they can be \ncareless in how they stock, secure, and sell dangerous weapons.\n  The judge in Washington State, presiding over the case brought by the \nDC area sniper victims--the case where a sniper lay in the trunk of a \ncar with a hole punched through the trunk, went to different gasoline \nstations, schools, parks, and stores, and simply fired at people, \nindiscriminately killing them--has ruled twice that the dealer of the \nweapon used in the shooting, Bull's Eye Shooters Supply, and its \nmanufacturer, Bushmaster Firearms, may be liable in negligence for \nenabling the snipers to obtain their weapon. But even with the new \nmodifications of this bill, the sniper victims' cases will likely be \nthrown out of court under this legislation. So guess whose side this \nSenate is coming down on. Not the side of the victims of the DC sniper \nbut the side of Bull's Eye Shooters Supply and the manufacturer, \nBushmaster Firearms.\n  Let's make that clear. This is the most notorious sniper case in \nAmerica. There is negligence on the part of the gun dealer who sold \nthat gun. He didn't report it until very late. He allowed the snipers \nto get the gun. Now we are passing a law to prevent the victims from \nsuing under civil liability. Nowhere else in the law does this concept \nexist in this form. It is a special carve-out for the DC sniper gun \nmanufacturer and gun seller.\n  In another case, a Massachusetts court has ruled that gun \nmanufacturer Kahr Arms may be liable for negligently hiring drug-\naddicted criminals and enabling them to stroll out the plant door with \nunmarked guns to be sold to criminals. But with these proposed changes, \nthe case against Kahr Arms would be dismissed. A case would be \ndismissed where a gun manufacturer negligently hired drug-addicted \ncriminals and let them go out the plant door with unmarked guns to be \nsold to criminals. That is what this does.\n  This conduct, though outrageous, violated no law--negligent, yes; \ncriminal, no. Contrary to current law which allows judges and juries to \napportion blame and damages, this bill would bar any damages against a \nmanufacturer if another party was liable due to a criminal act.\n  Why should firearms get special treatment? In our society, we hold \nmanufacturers liable for the damage their negligence causes. We do this \nacross the board for every industry, such as the automobile industry if \nthey build a faulty gas tank or if they are negligent putting it \ntogether. Lawsuits filed against the gun industry provide a way for \nthose harmed to seek justice from the damages and destruction caused by \nfirearms. Just as important, they create incentives to reform practices \nproven to be dangerous. I will bet Kahr Arms will make every effort not \nto hire drug addicts to sell guns to criminals. If that case is \ndismissed, they can hire them. They can sell to criminals. That is not \ngoing to make a difference.\n  When this bill was introduced in the last Congress and again in this \nCongress, its supporters spoke about the need to protect the industry \nfrom frivolous lawsuits and the need to protect the industry from the \npotential loss of jobs brought on by future lawsuits. These claims are \nunfounded. This bill is simply the latest attempt of the gun lobby to \nevade industry accountability. The suits against the gun industry come \nin varying forms, but they all have one goal in common--forcing the \nfirearms industry to become more responsible. What is wrong with that? \nUnder the principles of common law, all individuals and industries have \na duty to act responsibly. What is special about the gun industry that \nthey should be exempt from this most basic of civil responsibilities? \nAnswer: Nothing. This is an industry that is less accountable under law \nthan any other in America right now. The only avenue of accountability \nleft is the courtroom. This bill attempts to slam the courtroom door in \nthe face of those who would hold the industry responsible for its \nnegligent actions.\n  We ought to hold the industry responsible for taking the proper \nprecautions to ensure law-abiding citizens are able to obtain the guns \nthey choose while criminals and other prohibited individuals are not.\n  Let me read from a letter that was sent by more than 50 full \nprofessors from law schools all across this Nation, from the University \nof Michigan School of Law, UCLA Law School, the University of Oregon \nSchool of Law, Indiana University School of Law, Harvard Law School, \nSyracuse University College of Law, Brooklyn Law School, Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center, Lewis and Clark Law School, Roger Williams \nUniversity School of Law, Northwestern School of Law, University of \nChicago Law School, William Mitchell College of Law, University of \nColorado School of Law, Duke Law School, Albany Law School, University \nof California Hastings College of Law, Houston Law Center, Widener \nUniversity School of Law, Rutgers, Tulane, Boston, Albany, Temple \nUniversity Beasley School of Law, Case Western Reserve University \nSchool of Law, Cornell Law School, Salmon P. Chase College of Law, \nNorthern Kentucky University, NYU School of Law, The George Washington \nUniversity Law School, Boston College Law School, Tulane University Law \nSchool, Columbia Law School, New York Law School, University of Alabama \nSchool of Law, Emory University School of Law, University of California \nBoalt School of Law, and on and on.\n  Let me tell you what they say. I will read parts of it. They have \nreviewed this bill, S. 397.\n\n       No other industry enjoys or has ever enjoyed such a blanket \n     freedom from responsibility for the foreseeable and \n     preventable consequences of negligent conduct.\n       S. 397 . . . would abrogate this firmly established \n     principle of tort law. Under this bill, the firearms industry \n     would be the one and only business in which actors would be \n     free utterly to disregard the risk, no matter how high or \n     foreseeable, that their conduct\n\n[[Page S9071]]\n\n     might be creating or exacerbating a potentially preventable \n     risk of third party misconduct. Gun and ammunition makers, \n     distributors, importers, and sellers would, unlike any other \n     business or individual, be free to take no precautions \n     against even the most foreseeable and easily preventable \n     harms resulting from the illegal actions of third parties. \n     And they could engage in this negligent conduct persistently, \n     even with the specific intent of profiting from the sales of \n     guns that are foreseeably headed to criminal hands.\n\n  They could engage in the conduct in an unlimited way and profit from \nthe sales of guns that are foreseeably headed for criminal hands.\n\n       Under this bill, a firearms dealer, distributor, or \n     manufacturer could park an unguarded open pickup truck full \n     of loaded assault weapons on a city street corner, leave it \n     there for a week, and yet be free from any negligence \n     liability if and when the guns were stolen and used to do \n     harm.\n\n  Mr. President, this is what we are doing. This isn't just my view, \nthis is the view of more than 50 professors of law at major law schools \nall across the Nation. We are facilitating criminal conduct by \nproviding this protection against liability.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       A firearms dealer, in most states, could sell 100 guns to \n     the same individual every day, even after the dealer is \n     informed that these guns are being used in crime--even, say, \n     by the same violent street gang.\n\n  That is a direct quote. So you are facilitating a situation where \nsomebody could sell a hundred guns a day to a street gang and have no \nliability for that action. That is what I think is really despicable--\nall because of the power of one lobby.\n  Again, it goes on to say:\n\n       It might appear from the face of the bill that S. 397 and \n     H.R. 800 would leave open the possibility of tort liability \n     for truly egregious misconduct, by virtue of several \n     exceptions set forth in Section 4(5)(I). Those exceptions, \n     however, are in fact quite narrow and would give those in the \n     firearm industry little incentive to attend to the risks of \n     foreseeable third party misconduct.\n       One exception, for example, would purport to permit certain \n     actions for ``negligent entrustment.'' The bill goes on, \n     however, to define ``negligent entrustment'' extremely \n     narrowly.\n       The exception applies only to sellers, for example, and \n     would not apply to distributors or manufacturers, no matter \n     how egregious their conduct.\n\n  So when somebody comes to the floor and argues this bill provide for \nnegligent entrustment, don't believe it. It is so limited that it \ndoesn't cover the whole field of those who handle firearms.\n  And then it goes on to say:\n\n       Even as the sellers, the exception would apply only where \n     the particular person to whom a seller supplies a firearm is \n     one whom the seller knows or ought to know will use it to \n     cause harm. The ``negligent entrustment'' exception would, \n     therefore, not permit any action based on reckless \n     distribution practices, negligent sales to gun traffickers \n     who supply criminals--\n\n  That is the pickup that is parked on the street corner containing \nloaded assault weapons and sold to anybody who comes by.\n\n       The negligent entrustment exception would, therefore, not \n     permit any action based on reckless distribution practices, \n     negligent sales to gun traffickers who supply criminals, \n     careless handling of firearms, lack of security, or any of a \n     myriad of potentially negligent acts.\n       Another exception would leave open the possibility of \n     liability for certain statutory violations, variously \n     defined, including those described under the heading of \n     negligence per se. Statutory violations, however, represent \n     just a narrow special case of negligence liability. No \n     jurisdiction attempts to legislate standards of care as to \n     every detail of life, even in a regulated industry; and there \n     is no need. Why is there no need? Because general principles \n     of tort law make clear that the mere absence of a specific \n     statutory prohibition is not carte blanche for unreasonable \n     or dangerous behavior. S. 397 and H.R. 800 would turn this \n     traditional framework on its head, and free those in the \n     firearms industry to behave as carelessly as they would like, \n     so long as the conduct has not been specifically prohibited. \n     If there is no statute against leaving an open truckload of \n     assault weapons on a street corner, or against selling \n     hundreds of guns to the same individual, under this bill \n     there could be no tort liability.\n\n  That is what this bill is opening up.\n\n       Again, this represents a radical departure from traditional \n     tort principles.\n\n  Again, this isn't just me saying this; this is more than 50 law \nprofessors from almost 50 different law schools.\n\n       As currently drafted, this bill would not simply protect \n     against the expansion of tort liability, as has been \n     suggested, but would in fact dramatically limit the \n     application of longstanding and otherwise universally \n     applicable tort principles. It provides to firearm makers and \n     distributors a literally unprecedented form of tort immunity \n     not enjoyed, or even dreamed of, by any other industry.\n\n  Mr. President, I know the motion to proceed will pass. I also know \nthat what is being engaged upon is the most stringent test of \ngermaneness I have ever seen take place in this body to prevent \namendments from being offered once cloture is invoked, which is going \nto happen. This Senate is going to do the people it represents an \nenormous harm. They are going to protect the most powerful lobby in the \nUnited States and open millions of Americans to egregious injury from \nnegligent practices by distributors and sellers of firearms in this \ncountry.\n  That is not what we were elected to do. No one in this body was \nelected to be the Senator from the National Rifle Association. Although \nthey have a point of view, and although this point of view is popular \nin many places, the question is, do we still protect the public \nwelfare?\n  I say to you we do not protect the public welfare, as more than 50 \nprofessors of law have pointed out.\n  Additionally, I will put into the Record a letter of opposition from \nlaw enforcement. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 26, 2005.\n     U.S. Congress,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As active and retired law enforcement \n     officers, we are writing to urge your strong opposition to \n     any legislation granting the gun industry special legal \n     immunity. S. 397 would strip away the legal rights of gun \n     violence victims, including law enforcement officers and \n     their families, to seek redress against irresponsible gun \n     dealers and manufacturers.\n       The impact of this bill on the law enforcement community is \n     well illustrated by the lawsuit brought by former Orange, New \n     Jersey police officers Ken McGuire and David Lemongello. On \n     January 12, 2001, McGuire and Lemongello were shot in the \n     line of duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a West \n     Virginia dealer. The dealer had sold the gun, along with 11 \n     other handguns, in a cash sale to a straw buyer for a gun \n     trafficker. In June 2004, the officers obtained a $1 million \n     settlement from the dealer. The dealer, as well as two other \n     area pawnshops, also have implemented safer practices to \n     prevent sales to traffickers, including a new policy of \n     ending large-volume sales of handguns. These reforms go \n     beyond the requirements of current law and are not imposed by \n     any manufacturers or distributors.\n       If immunity for the gun industry had been enacted, the \n     officers' case would have been thrown out of court and \n     justice would have been denied. Police officers like Ken \n     McGuire and Dave Lemongello put their lives on the line every \n     day to protect the public. Instead of honoring them for their \n     service, legislation granting immunity to the gun industry \n     would deprive them of their basic rights as American citizens \n     to prove their case in a court of law. We stand with officers \n     McGuire and Lemongello in urging you to oppose such \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         International Brotherhood of Police Officers (AFL-CIO \n           Police union); Major Cities Chiefs Association \n           (Represents our nation's largest police departments); \n           National Black Police Association (Nationwide \n           organization with more than 35,000 members); Hispanic \n           American Police Command Officers Association (Serving \n           command level staff and federal agents); National \n           Latino Peace Officers Association; The Police \n           Foundation (A private, nonprofit research institution); \n           Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police; Rhode Island \n           State Association of Chiefs of Police; Maine Chiefs of \n           Police Association.\n       Departments listed for identification purposes only:\n         Sergeant Moises Agosto, Pompton Lakes Police Dept.

This letter of opposition details the case that \nSenator Kennedy mentioned, involving two law enforcement officers from \nOrange, NJ, and points out that that case would have been thrown out of \ncourt. It is signed by numerous chiefs of police and major law \nenforcement entities.\n  The American Bar Association states in their letter of opposition:\n\n       S. 397 would preempt State substantive legal standards for \n     most negligence and product liability actions for this one \n     industry, abrogating State law in cases in which the \n     defendant is a gun manufacturer, gun seller, or gun trade \n     association, and would insulate this new class of protected \n     defendants from almost all ordinary civil liability actions.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       There is no evidence that Federal legislation is needed or \n     justified. There is no hearing record in Congress or other \n     evidence to contradict the fact that the State courts are \n     handling their responsibilities competently in this area of \n     the law.\n\n  So all those people who believe in States rights are taking States \nrights away for the National Rifle Association.\n  The American Bar Association also says:\n\n       There is no data of any kind to support claims made by the \n     industry that it is incurring extraordinary costs due to \n     litigation, that it faces a significant number of suits, or \n     that current State law is in any way inadequate. The Senate \n     has not examined the underlying claims of the industry about \n     State tort cases, choosing not to hold a single hearing on S. \n     397 or its predecessor bills in the two previous Congresses.\n\n  That is amazing to me. It continues:\n\n       Proponents of this legislation cannot, in fact, point to a \n     single court decision, final judgment, or award that has been \n     paid out that supports their claims of a crisis. All evidence \n     points to the conclusion that State legislatures and State \n     courts have been and are actively exercising their \n     responsibilities in this area of law with little apparent \n     difficulty.\n\n  This letter goes on and again concludes this is going to be the only \nindustry in the United States with this kind of immunity. There is no \ncrisis that merits this. There is no hearing record that documents the \nneed. This really worries me.\n  Maybe I am biased because I have been a mayor, because I have seen \nwhat happens on the streets. I have seen how guns are misused. I have \nseen the threats that criminals with a firearm can be. I have watched, \nover the years, as firearms have grown much more sophisticated. Their \nkilling power is greatly enhanced. The copycat, or the civilian \nversion, of the 16--the .50 caliber weapon now that is out there--can \nsend a bullet as large as my hand from Arlington Cemetery into the \nCapitol. Don't you think how those weapons are sold and distributed \nshould prevent negligence? I do.\n  I guess in all my years in this body I have never been more \ndisillusioned about how we proceed or why we proceed. We have the \nPATRIOT Act that is ready to come to the floor, and we are doing this. \nWe have an asbestos bill that is ready to come to the floor, and we are \ndoing this. I am ranking on Military Construction appropriations. We \nhave passed out a military construction bill with $70 billion in it for \nveterans benefits, and we are doing this. There are a number of other \nappropriations bills that are ready for floor action. The conference on \nthe Energy bill just concluded, and we are doing this. The Calendar of \nBusiness contains 100 items ready for Senate floor action, and we are \ndoing this. There is no hearing record for the previous two Congresses. \nMore than 50 law professors point out this is a giveaway to one special \nindustry that no other industry enjoys in the United States of America, \nand 30,000 people a year are killed with firearms in this country. I \nfind it extraordinarily disillusioning.\n  I know we are going to lose on the motion to proceed. The latest is \nthat we are not even going to have a vote. It will be voice-voted \nbecause it is so ironclad that this bill is going to swim through. And \nthen we will watch them try to stop us from putting any amendments on \nthe bill. It is a sad day in the Senate. It is a regretful day. It is \nan extraordinarily disillusioning day.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the majority \nhas control of this next hour under the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. At this time, I will yield to Senator Cornyn 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Judge John Roberts\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ncomment on the nomination of Judge John Roberts to serve on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. In particular, I would like to provide some context in a \nbrief response to some statements that have been made by our colleague \non the other side of the aisle, the senior Senator from New York.\n  My colleague has repeatedly stated his intention to ask Judge Roberts \nduring the confirmation proceedings dozens of questions about his \npositions on particular constitutional rights, as well as his views of \nparticular cases that have been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\n  He provided Judge Roberts a copy of these questions last week when \nthe two of them met and has stated that he will take ``responsibility \nto make sure that those questions are answered.''\n  Any of our colleagues can, of course, ask whatever questions they \nwant, but the notion that Judge Roberts puts his confirmation at risk \nif he does not answer the questions on the list from the Senator from \nNew York is contrary to the traditional practice of this body. Nearly \nevery single one of the questions on that list involves an issue that \nis likely to come before the Supreme Court during Justice Roberts's \ntenure. Every single Justice confirmed in recent memory has declined to \nanswer questions of the sort contained on that list.\n  As Justice Ginsburg has noted:\n\n       In accord with longstanding norm, every member of the \n     current Supreme Court declined to furnish such information to \n     the Senate.\n\n  Every member of the Court has declined to answer such questions \nbecause it has long been understood that forcing nominees to take sides \non issues while under oath compromises their ability to rule \nimpartially in cases presenting those issues once they sit on the \nCourt.\n  Judges are supposed to decide cases after hearing the evidence \npresented by the parties involved and the arguments presented by their \nlawyers. They are supposed to keep an open and impartial mind.\n  As Justice Ginsburg has also noted, ``the line each [Justice] drew in \nresponse to preconfirmation questioning is . . . crucial to the health \nof the Federal judiciary.''\n  Judges in our system are like umpires in a baseball game. They are \nnot supposed to take sides before the game has begun. Judges are not, \nfor example, supposed to pledge to the Senate that they will be ``on \nthe side of labor'' or ``on the side of corporations'' once confirmed \nto the bench. We should not demand of judges that they are biased on \nbehalf of a particular party before they have even gotten to the bench \nand heard the facts and the arguments of counsel.\n  The only side that a judge should be on is on the side of the law. \nIndeed, that is the oath that each of them take when they are sworn \ninto office. Sometimes corporations should win in court, and sometimes \nthey should lose. Sometimes labor should win in court, and sometimes \nlabor should lose. But it depends on the facts of the case and on the \nlaw that applies to those facts. Any judge worth their salt would \ndecline to make a commitment ahead of time about how that hypothetical \ncontroversy would come out, not knowing what those facts are or how the \nquestion would be presented.\n  The Senator from New York has said that his questions do not threaten \nJudge Roberts's impartiality because he is not asking about specific \ncases that are already pending before the Supreme Court. He \nacknowledges that asking questions about those cases--in other words, \ncases that are actually pending--would be inappropriate. But I would \nask my colleague to review, as I have, the Supreme Court's pending \ncases for the session set to begin in October because it clearly shows \nthat this proposed list of questions would force Judge Roberts to \nprejudge the very pending cases that the Senator has said should be off \nlimits.\n  Take, for example, the question of whether Judge Roberts ``believes \nRoe v. Wade was correctly decided.'' That is one of the Senator's \nquestions. The Senator has said specifically that this is a ``question \nthat should be answered.''\n  Demanding that Judge Roberts answer questions about Roe v. Wade will \nundoubtedly force him to prejudge a case that is currently pending on \nthe Court's docket. On November 30, the Supreme Court will hear \narguments in Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood, a case involving the \nconstitutionality of a New Hampshire law requiring a minor to notify \nher parents before having an abortion.\n  It is nearly certain that some party in that litigation, perhaps even \nan amicus party, will ask the Court to revisit or overturn Roe v. Wade \nbecause one party does so in nearly every abortion case that reaches \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Thus, whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned is not only an issue \nlikely to come before the Court during Judge Roberts's tenure, it is \nalready before the Court.\n  Accordingly, demanding an answer to a question about Roe v. Wade will \nforce Judge Roberts to prejudge at least one of the issues in the \nAyotte case, and, no doubt, many others while he is on the bench.\n  Perhaps an even better example is the Senator's question about \nwhether ``the Americans with Disabilities Act requires State buildings \nto be accessible to the disabled . . . or [whether] sovereign immunity \nexempts the States?'' Again, on November 9, the Supreme Court is \nscheduled to hear a case called Goodman v. Georgia, a case involving a \nsuit by a disabled prisoner against the State of Georgia. The only \nquestion in that case is whether the Americans with Disabilities Act \ncan force States to make prisons accessible to the disabled. Again, \nthis is precisely the question that the Senator warned Judge Roberts \nthat he would not have to answer but which, in fact, he is now being \nasked to answer.\n  It is clear then that the questions proposed by the Senator from New \nYork will force Judge Roberts to prejudge pending cases. This is \nsomething that surely all of us can agree is inappropriate. Thus, \nsurely all of us can agree in this Chamber that Judge Roberts should be \npermitted to decline to answer at least some of the questions that the \nSenator from New York has said he will ask him and others like those \nquestions.\n\n  But once it is acknowledged that Judge Roberts should be permitted to \ndecline to answer the questions involving issues already pending before \nthe Supreme Court, it becomes clear that Judge Roberts should be \npermitted to decline the rest of the questions propounded by the \nSenator as well.\n  There are literally hundreds of cases at this very moment in lower \nFederal courts raising virtually all of the questions posed by the \nSenator from New York. Judge Roberts should not be forced to guess \nwhich one of them will or will not one day make their way to the High \nCourt. This is why the Canons of Judicial Ethics counsel judges against \nanswering questions about issues that are not only already before the \nCourt, but also those that are likely to come before the Court.\n  Any case pending in the lower courts meets this definition because it \ncould be and, indeed, many will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Indeed, the danger of demanding that Judge Roberts answer such \nquestions, even though some may not now be pending before the Court, is \nclear from an event involving one of the sitting Justices, Justice \nScalia.\n  Two years ago, after delivering a speech, Justice Scalia was asked \nwhether he thought the phrase ``under God''--that is the reference in \nthe Pledge of Allegiance--was constitutional. There was not at that \ntime any case involving that question before the Court, so Justice \nScalia answered the question. But there was, as it turns out, a case \ninvolving that precise question pending before a lower Federal court \nand, as we all know, that case eventually made its way to the Supreme \nCourt. As we also know, Justice Scalia was then forced to recuse \nhimself from hearing that case because the rules of ethics prevent \njudges from publicly commenting on pending or impending cases.\n  We should not force Judge Roberts to choose between confirmation and \nrecusal. If Judge Roberts is forced to recuse himself in all of the \ncases, all of the issues on the Senator's list, then the Supreme Court \nwill be left shorthanded for much of his tenure.\n  The Senator from New York says that his list includes some of the \nmost important questions of the day, and that may well be true. But \nsurely we want all nine Justices on the Supreme Court to answer those \nimportant questions in those cases as they are presented.\n  Judge Roberts should be permitted to do what we have always permitted \nnominees to do, and that is to decline to answer questions that might \ncall into question his impartiality at a later date. We have always \nrespected the right of nominees to decline to answer questions that \nmake them feel as though their ability to do their job would be \ncompromised. That is in the interest of a value that we all hold dear, \nand that is the independence of the judiciary.\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\n  I hope and expect that we will not break that longstanding tradition \nwith Judge Roberts.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, the current Congress has taken a stand \nagainst frivolous lawsuits, and we have done so in a number of ways as \nwe paint a portrait of the fact that frivolous lawsuits today are not \nin the interest of the American people. We addressed it in class action \nreform. We addressed it to a degree with bankruptcy reform, returning \nto personal responsibility. We will do it with asbestos reform, an \nissue that has for the last 10, 15, 20 years unfairly resulted in the \ntrial lawyers doing very well, but the patient with cancer, \nmesothelioma, not being compensated, the victims not being compensated. \nWe will be addressing medical liability at some point in time, \nhopefully in this Congress, and then gun liability, the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act, which is being addressed today and \ntomorrow and possibly the next day.\n  This bill is directed at the frivolous lawsuits that today are aimed \nat gun manufacturers and people who are selling firearms. The bill \nplaces responsibility on the criminal for the unlawful use of guns, and \nthat is where that responsibility belongs.\n  Many people believe that the whole gun manufacturing industry is a \nhugely profitable industry, and that is wrong. It is not. The gun \nindustry is relatively modest. In 1999, the most recent year I have \nseen, there was an industry total profit of about $200 million. If we \nput all the manufacturers of firearms together, they would not even \nmake the Fortune 500 list.\n  More important than size is the hard-working people who are \nmanufacturing guns. I have had the opportunity, as many of our \ncolleagues have, to go to these wonderful facilities with hard-working \nAmericans, typically in rural communities, who are manufacturing and \nputting together these guns.\n  The firearm maker I visited was in a rural area with not that many \nemployees. They were putting together shotguns which many of us use to \nhunt over the course of the year. Right now my favorite avocation is \ntaking my sons hunting on the weekend, to be together and share \nfellowship.\n  I mention that because when one tours these gun manufacturing \nfacilities, they realize that frivolous lawsuits drive people out of \nthe business, which is a loss of jobs. Those jobs happen to be \npredominantly in rural communities. Anti-gun crusaders say that the \nfirearm business, which today is one of the most regulated industries \nin America, should be responsible for the criminal acts of others. They \nbelieve it is OK to use lawsuits to circumvent the democratic process \nand legislate actually from the bench, and they say so themselves.\n  If we turn to the trial attorneys and look at the quotations, one \ntrial attorney claims that what has happened is that the legislatures \nhave failed. Lawyers are taking up the slack, said the trial attorney. \nAnother anti-gun trial lawyer says that trial lawyers are ``the new arm \nof government,'' replacing the legislative branch ``that's not working \nanymore.'' These trial lawyers apparently believe they are above the \nvoters, that they are above the legislative process. I do not agree, \nmost Americans do not agree, and thus, we have the bill today.\n  Most Americans think there is too much litigation and not too little \nlitigation in this country. Legislatures in 33 States have passed laws \nto preempt frivolous gun lawsuits. They recognize that our Constitution \nprotects the right to keep and bear arms. In fact, 53 percent of \nAmerican households today own a gun. Still, the anti-gun crusaders, \naided and abetted by powerful trial lawyers, charge ahead. They know \nthat all it takes is one successful lawsuit to drive a manufacturer out \nof business. As one chapter of the United Steelworkers of America \npoints out, ``we are just one defeat away from bankruptcy.''\n  Since 1997, more than 30 cities and counties have sued firearms \ncompanies in an attempt to force them to change the way they make and \nsell guns. Firearm manufacturers have already spent more than $200 \nmillion in legal fees to defend themselves. Meanwhile, most of these \ncases have been dismissed. The Supreme Court of New York says:\n\n       [The] courts are the least suited, least equipped, and thus \n     the least appropriate branch of government to regulate and \n     micro-manage the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and \n     sale of handguns.\n\n  The Florida Third District Court of Appeals agrees, adding:\n\n       The power to legislate belongs not to the judicial branch \n     of government but to the legislative branch.\n\n  Some cases, however, are still pending and are slated to go forward. \nThus, it is critical that we act now, that we pass this legislation \nnow.\n  In California, former Governor Gray Davis signed legislation \nexplicitly authorizing lawsuits against gunmakers. Because the firearms \nbusiness is relatively small, just one big verdict--maybe not even \nbig--a substantial verdict could bankrupt the entire industry. In \nCalifornia, that is a real possibility. If the gun industry is forced \ninto bankruptcy, the right to keep and bear arms will be a right in \nname only. Even if some gunmakers are able to hold on, the prices for \nfirearms, whether it is the shotgun one buys to go hunting with or \nwhatever the firearm might be, will go sky-high.\n  There is another important issue, which is little recognized, and it \nhas been mentioned on the Senate floor, but I wanted to mention it \nagain because I am sure others will come forward because the problem is \nso real, it is so apparent, and that is that America relies on private \ngun manufacturers to equip our soldiers and our law enforcement \nofficers with the arms they need to protect us or to fight for our \nfreedom. The guns our police officers and soldiers carry are made in \nthe United States by hard-working Americans.\n  The main manufacturer of guns in my home State, just as one example, \nsupplies important small arms to the military. So far, this middle \nTennessee company has not been sued. In fact, Tennessee passed some \nliability protections back in 1999. But if they are sued and put out of \nbusiness, the military would lose a critically important supplier, and \n70 Tennesseans for this one small company, one small employer, would \nlose their jobs.\n  We all agree that guns need to be kept out of the hands of criminals, \nand that is why we have innumerable, countless laws and regulations to \nstop illegal gun sales. But we also cannot let frivolous lawsuits strip \nour police officers and our soldiers of the guns they need to protect \nus. We cannot allow unfair litigation to cripple our national security.\n  Our sympathies always first and foremost go to crime victims and \nfamilies, and no one in any way deserves to be harmed by a criminal \nwielding any kind of a weapon, be it a gun or a knife or anything else. \nBut we have to place the blame where it belongs, not on the people \nworking in that factory I visited that makes these firearms. We need to \nplace it at the feet of the violent criminals themselves, those who \ncommit the crimes and threaten our communities. They are the ones \nresponsible, and they are the ones who should be held accountable. \nBlaming gun manufacturers misses the real problem. It punishes law-\nabiding owners and undermines our constitutionally protected rights. \nEven if litigation managed to bankrupt law-abiding gun manufacturers, \nit is not going to stop the criminals from getting guns elsewhere.\n  So I urge my colleagues to help stop frivolous gun litigation. We can \naccomplish that by allowing this legislation first to come to the floor \nand then passing this legislation. A vote for reform is a vote for \nsecurity, and a vote for reform is a vote for common sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n                    following the ginsburg standard\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nJudge John Roberts to be the next Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. As we are beginning to learn, the President has selected \none of the foremost legal minds of his generation. Many of my \ncolleagues have already spoken Judge Roberts' praises on\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\nthis floor, and I agree with all of them. Judge Roberts possesses a \nkeen intellect, an open mind, very importantly, a judicious \ntemperament, and a sterling reputation for integrity. He will \nfaithfully apply the Constitution, not legislate from the bench. He \nshould be confirmed in time for the Court to operate at full strength \nby October 3.\n  Looking to recent history, and looking more specifically to the most \nrecent Supreme Court nominations of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and \nStephen Breyer, I would think that I should not have cause to worry how \nthis nominee will be treated. Then, as now, the President's party \ncontrolled the Senate. Then, as now, the President nominated a jurist \nwhose credentials could not be questioned. The only difference is that \nthe occupant of the White House then was a Democrat, and the current \nPresident is a Republican.\n  But that one simple fact may make all the difference to some of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle.\n  In recent weeks I have begun to worry that some of my Democratic \nfriends have forgotten the standard to which the Senate held Justices \nBreyer and Ginsburg when they were nominees. Judge Roberts deserves the \nsame standard, no more or no less, than the nominees of President \nClinton. But I fear that ``the Ginsburg-Breyer standard''--which I will \ncall the ``Ginsburg standard'' for short--is giving way to a double \nstandard. I would like to remind my colleagues of recent history, so we \nmay draw some lessons from the confirmation processes of Justices \nBreyer and Ginsburg.\n  Both Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer came to the Senate with a \ndistinguished record and a deserved reputation for a fine legal mind. \nBut Justice Ginsburg also came with a long record of liberal advocacy \nand thought-provoking, to put it mildly, statements. Yet the Senate \nhandled her nomination in a manner that brought credit to the \ninstitution. It followed a respectful process. Indeed, it can be said \nthat ``respect''--both for the President and his nominee--was a \nhallmark of her nomination, and the nomination of Stephen Breyer.\n  In the Ginsburg nomination, the Senate recognized that most judicial \nnominees, including Justice Ginsburg, have at one point been private \npractitioners of the law. The Senate recognized that it is unfair to \nattribute to lawyers the actions of their clients. Lawyers are zealous \nadvocates for their clients. Lawyers speak for their clients, not \nthemselves.\n  After all, if a lawyer defends a client accused of stealing a \nchicken, it does not then follow that the lawyer is a chicken thief. \nAgain, if a lawyer defends a client accused of stealing a chicken, it \ndoes not then follow that the lawyer is a chicken thief. By following \nthis standard, the Senate did not hold against Justice Ginsburg the \npolicy positions of her most famous client, the American Civil \nLiberties Union.\n  As we know, the ACLU takes consistently liberal positions on high-\nprofile issues, positions that many Americans strongly disagree with. I \nrespect that. I do not often agree with the ACLU, but its members \nbelieve strongly, and they fight for their beliefs. There is certainly \nnothing but admiration we can have for that.\n  During Justice Ginsburg's tenure as a general counsel and a member of \nits board, the ACLU, for example, opposed restrictions on pornography. \nYet even though her client had adopted controversial policy positions, \nthe Senate did not attribute them to Justice Ginsburg, let alone \ndisqualify her from service on the Supreme Court because of them.\n  In addition, this country values a healthy ``market-place of ideas.'' \nSo, the Senate did not block Justice Ginsburg's nomination because she \nmade controversial and thought-provoking statements in her private \ncapacity as a legal thinker. Those thoughts ranged from suggesting a \nconstitutional right to prostitution, to proposing abolishing \n``Mother's Day'' and ``Father's Day'' in favor of a unisex ``Parent's \nDay.'' Why did we not hold those views against her? Because by a 96-3 \nmargin, we decided she had the integrity to apply the law fairly to \neach case, despite some rather, to put it mildly, provocative personal \nviews that had been expressed over the years in her writing.\n  With both the Ginsburg and Breyer nominations, the Senate also \ncontinued its long-standing practice of respecting a nominee's right \nnot to disclose personal views or to answer questions that could \nprejudge cases or issues. Senators may ask a nominee whatever questions \nthey want. But the nominee also has the right not to comment on matters \nthe nominee feels could compromise their judicial independence.\n  For example, during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1967, \nThurgood Marshall, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, declined to \nanswer a question regarding the Fifth Amendment. He explained.\n\n        I do not think you want me to be in a position of giving \n     you a statement on the Fifth Amendment and then, if I am \n     confirmed, sit on the Court and when a Fifth Amendment case \n     comes up, I will have to disqualify myself.\n\n  Justice O'Connor, whom our Democratic colleagues have been citing so \nglowingly in the last few weeks, also demurred regarding questions she \nthought would compromise her independence. One of those questions asked \nher view of a case that had already been decided, Roe v. Wade; and in \nexplaining her position, she said:\n\n       I feel it is improper for me to endorse or criticize a \n     decision which may well come back before the Court in one \n     form or another and indeed appears to be coming back with \n     some regularity in a variety of contexts. I do not think we \n     have seen the end of that issue or that holding and that is \n     the concern I have about expressing an endorsement or \n     criticism of that holding.''\n\n  The Senate continued this practice with the Breyer and Ginsburg \nnominations. It did not require them to state their private views, or \nto prejudge matters before they had read one word of a brief or heard \none word of oral argument.\n  Justice Breyer explained why he had to be careful about pre-\ncommitting to matters:\n\n       I do not want to predict or to commit myself on an open \n     issue that I feel is going to come up in the Court. . . . \n     There are two real reasons. The first real reason is how \n     often it is when we express ourselves casually or express \n     ourselves without thorough briefing and thorough thought \n     about a matter that I or some other judge might make a \n     mistake. . . . The other reason, which is equally important, \n     is . . . it is so important that the clients and the lawyers \n     understand that judges are really open-minded.\n\n  The Senate respected Justice Breyer's concerns about prejudging and \nconfirmed him by an overwhelming 87-9 margin. This respect extended to \ncases that had already been decided. For example, our late colleague, \nSenator Thurmond, asked Justice Breyer about Roe v. Wade, a case that \nhad been decided 21 years earlier. Like Justice O'Connor, Justice \nBreyer declined to comment, stating:\n\n       The questions that you are putting to me are matters of how \n     that basic right applies, where it applies, under what \n     circumstances. And I do not think I should go into those for \n     the reason that those are likely to be the subject of \n     litigation in front of the Court.\n\n  Senator Thurmond respected Justice Breyer's position, and did not \nhold against Justice Breyer his decision not to answer that question. \nOther Senators did the same on a host of issues.\n  Justice Breyer also declined to give his personal views. He \nexplained, ``The reason that I hesitate to say what I think as a person \nas opposed to a judge is because down that road are a whole host of \nsubjective beliefs, many of which I would try to abstract from.'' As \nresult, he declined to give his personal views on whether the death \npenalty was cruel and unusual, what the scope of the exclusionary rule \nshould be and whether he supported tort reform.\n  Justice Ginsburg also invoked her prerogative not to answer questions \nthat could compromise her independence, and both sides of the aisle \nrespected her decision. Indeed, Senator Biden, who was then chairman, \nencouraged her not to answer questions that would preview her position \non a legal issue. He told her:\n\n       I will have statements that I made during the process read \n     back to me. But I do think it is appropriate to point out, \n     Judge, that you not only have a right to choose what you will \n     answer and not answer, but in my view you should not answer a \n     question of what your view will be on an issue that clearly \n     is going to come before the Court in 50 different forms, \n     probably, over your tenure on the Court.\n\n  Justice Ginsburg's effort to remain unbiased--like Justices O'Connor \nand Breyer--included not commenting on cases that had already been \ndecided.\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\nFor example, Justice Ginsburg was asked how she would have ruled in \nRust v. Sullivan, an abortion case that had already been decided. She \ndeclined to answer, explaining her position with a metaphor of the \nslippery slope:\n\n       I sense that I am in the position of a skier at the top of \n     that hill, because you are asking me how I would have voted \n     in Rust v. Sullivan. Another member of this committee would \n     like to know how I might vote in that case or another one. I \n     have resisted descending that slope, because once you ask me \n     about this case, then you will ask me about another case that \n     is over and done, and another case. . . . If I address the \n     question here, if I tell this legislative chamber what my \n     vote will be, then my position as a judge could be \n     compromised.\n\n  Indeed, Justice Ginsburg declined to comment 55 times on a variety of \nlegal questions. That is 55 times. These included: If the second \namendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms; If the death \npenalty is cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment; If \nschool vouchers for children are constitutional under the Establishment \nClause; If the Supreme Court had interpreted too narrowly the Voting \nRights Act; If the first amendment was intended to erect a wall of \nseparation between church and state; and If the Federal Government may \nprohibit abortion clinics from using Federal funds to advocate \nperforming abortions.\n  That is a lot of ``ifs'' she declined to answer and yet was confirmed \noverwhelmingly.\n  Both Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were reported out of the committee \npromptly; Republicans did not try to delay the committee vote. Nor did \nRepublicans try to deny these nominees the courtesy of an up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor.\n  As I mentioned, Justice Ginsburg was confirmed 96-3 after 2 days of \ndebate. Justice Breyer was confirmed 87-9 after only a single day of \ndebate. By giving these nominees up-or-down votes, the Senate continued \nthe practice it had followed with even contested Supreme Court \nnominees, like Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. The average time for \nSenate consideration of the Ginsburg and Breyer nominations was 58 \ndays. For Justice Ginsburg's nomination, the entire process lasted only \n42 days from nomination to confirmation.\n  It troubles us on this side of the aisle, and it should trouble all \nAmericans, when different standards are applied to different people for \nno valid reason. Unfortunately, this already appears to be happening \nwith respect to the nomination of Judge John Roberts.\n  Judge Roberts will no doubt be as forthcoming as he properly can be \nwhen he testifies. However, as with all nominees, there are some \nquestions that he will not be able to answer. His decision ought to be \nrespected as were the decisions of Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer.\n  But our colleague Senator Schumer has declared that for this \nnomination--forget all the prior nominees--``Every question is a \nlegitimate question, period.'' And he plans on asking Judge Roberts \nsome 70 questions. These include specific issues that will likely come \nbefore the Court. In addition, he wants Judge Roberts to discuss how he \nwould have voted in specific cases, such as New York Times v. Sullivan \nand United States v. Lopez.\n  If our friend from New York insists that Judge Roberts answers these \ntypes of questions, it will be a radical departure from the practice \nthat the committee followed with Justice O'Connor, Justice Breyer, \nJustice Ginsburg and other Supreme Court nominees. These nominees were \ngiven discretion in not answering questions on issues that might come \nbefore the Court. It was agreed that it would be improper for a \npotential justice to pre-commit on a matter.\n  We on this side of the aisle are not asking the Senate to change its \npractices or standards. We are not asking that this President be \ntreated better than his immediate predecessor. We are asking for equal \ntreatment. In short, we are simply asking that the Senate follow the \nGinsburg standard, not a double standard.\n  I am hopeful that the courtesy and respect the Senate showed \nPresident Clinton's nominees, and prior Supreme Court nominees, will \ncontinue with Judge Roberts. After all, it's only fair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding the Senator from South Carolina \nwould like to take 2 minutes. If I can be recognized after that, I \nwould appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of S. 397, \nprotecting gun manufacturers from lawsuits that basically would hold \nthe manufacturer liable if someone bought a gun and intentionally \ncommitted a crime with it, was irresponsible in its use. I believe \neverybody should have their day in court for a legitimate grievance. \nBut it is not legitimate, in my opinion, to sue someone who makes a gun \nlawfully, that is not defective, and that person is held responsible in \ncourt because some other person who bought the gun decides to misuse \nit, to commit a crime with it. That would ruin our economy. It would \nfundamentally change personal responsibility in America. This bill is a \ncultural moment in American history.\n  The second amendment gives us a right to bear arms, but it is not \nunlimited. We have to be responsible. We have to responsibly use that \nright. The idea that you could sue someone who is lawfully in business \nbecause someone else chooses to do something bad will destroy the way \nAmerica works. It is a ridiculous concept.\n  Suing gun manufacturers for defective products is included in this \nbill. Everyone should stand behind what they make and put in the stream \nof commerce. That has not changed. The only thing that has changed is \nwe are cutting off a line of legal reasoning that has extended to fast \nfood now: ``The reason I have health problems is because you served me \nfood that was bad for me.'' The bottom line is, if we go down this \nroad, we are going to make America noncompetitive in the 21st century, \nand we are going to rewrite the way America works--to our detriment.\n  The rule should be simple. If you make a lawful product and someone \nchooses to buy it and they decide to misuse it, it is not your fault, \nit is theirs. You are not going to have your money taken because \nsomebody else messed up. Madam President, $200 million in legal fees \nhave already been incurred by gun manufacturers because of this line of \nreasoning. You win in America; you still lose.\n  If you want to make sure our country is secure in the future, let's \nmake sure people can manufacture arms in America and we are not \ndependent on foreign sources for arms for the public or the military. \nThere is a lot at stake here. I enthusiastically support this \nlimitation on what I think would be not only a frivolous lawsuit, but a \ndangerous concept that will change America for the worse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to express my continued, \nstrong support of S. 397, the gun liability bill.\n  As I outlined yesterday, this legislation is a necessary and vital \nresponse to the growing problem of unfounded lawsuits filed against gun \nmanufacturers and sellers. These suits are being filed in no small part \nwith the intention of trying to drive them out of business.\n  These lawsuits, citing deceptive marketing or some other pretext, \ncontinue to be filed in a number of States, and they continue to be \nunsound.\n  These lawsuits claim that sellers give the false impression that gun \nownership enhances personal safety or that sellers should know that \ncertain guns will be used illegally. That is pure bunk. Let's look at \nthe truth.\n  The fact is that none of these lawsuits are aimed at the actual \nwrongdoer who kills or injures another with a gun--none. Instead, the \nlawsuits are focused on legitimate, law-abiding businesses.\n  It is this kind of rampant, race-to-sue mentality, that fuels our \ntort-happy, litigious culture. It has to stop.\n  In its Statement of Administration Policy, the White House has urged \nus to pass a clean bill, in order to ensure enactment of the \nlegislation this year. Amendments that would delay enactment beyond \nthis year are simply unacceptable.\n  The administration knows what we also know: This is a modest bill to \nhelp prevent the gun industry from a tidal wave of baseless lawsuits.\n  It is also highly relevant, I believe, that the leading suppliers of \nsmall\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\narms to our Armed Forces are the same targets of these reckless \nlawsuits: Beretta, Bushmaster, Remington, Smith & Wesson.\n  These are the companies we rely on for small arms for the military.\n  But if the proliferation of lawsuits against them continues, it could \njeopardize the supplies we receive and need for our military.\n  This bill does nothing more than prohibit--with five exceptions \nlawsuits against manufacturers or sellers of guns and ammunition for \ndamages ``resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse'' of \nnondefective guns and ammunition.\n  Let me repeat that: ``resulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse'' of nondefective guns and ammunition.\n  This bill is not a license for the gun industry to act irresponsibly. \nIf a manufacturer or seller does not operate entirely within Federal \nand State law, it is not entitled to the protection of this \nlegislation.\n  I should also note that this bill carefully preserves the right of \nindividuals to have their day in court with civil liability actions \nwhere negligence is truly an issue, or where there were knowing \nviolations of laws on gun sales.\n  It is also noteworthy that in a recent poll by Moore Information \nPublic Opinion Research, 79 percent of Americans do not believe that \nfirearms manufacturers should be held legally responsible for violence \ncommitted by armed criminals.\n  Seventy-nine percent!\n  And in this poll, 71 percent of Democrats hold this view. So this \nshould not be a partisan issue.\n  Let me just read a postcard from one of the thousands of people who \nhave written me in support of this bill from Utah. This Utahn, from the \ncity of Hyde Park, writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Please give your full support for S. \n     397 with no anti-gun amendments. As a business woman I know \n     the strength of America is productive businesses that keep \n     America strong and my fellow citizens employed!\n\n  These are the people I represent. I not only represent them, I am \nproud to be one of them. I am proud to help small businesses. And I am \nproud to help gun owners.\n  Let me just say a word about the precedents for this legislation. \nCongress has the power--and the duty--to prevent activists from abusing \nthe courts to destroy interstate commerce.\n  We did this in the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994 where \nwe protected manufacturers of small planes against personal injury \nlawsuits. That act superseded State law, as does the gun liability \nbill.\n  There are many other precedents for abusive lawsuit protection, \nincluding light aircraft manufacturers, food donors, charitable \nvolunteers, medical implant manufacturers and makers of anti-terrorism \ntechnology, just to mention a few.\n  There is simply no reason the gun makers should have to continue to \ndefend these types of meritless lawsuits. We must protect against the \npotential harm to interstate commerce. The gun industry has already had \nto bear over $200 million in defense costs thus far.\n  The bottom line is that this is a reasonable measure to prevent a \ngrowing abuse of our civil justice system.\n  The bill provides carefully tailored protections for legitimate \nlawsuits, such as those where there are knowing violations of gun sale \nlaws, or those based on traditional grounds including negligent \nentrustment or breach of contract.\n  We simply should not force a lawful manufacturer or seller to be \nresponsible for criminal and unlawful misuse of its product by others. \nWe do not hold the manufacturers of matches responsible for arson for \nthis same reason.\n  Individuals who misuse lawful products should be held responsible, \nnot those who make the lawful products.\n  In closing, I leave my colleagues with one last thought.\n  These abusive gun liability actions usurp the authority of the \nCongress and of State legislators. They are an obvious and desperate \nattempt to enact restrictions that have been widely rejected.\n  It is for this reason that many States have enacted statutes to \nprevent this type of litigation. Congress should do the same.\n  As with class action lawsuits, the few States that allow jackpot \njurisdictions can create a disastrous economic effect across the entire \ncountry, and across an entire industry.\n  We cannot allow this to happen. We must stop these abusive lawsuits.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Utah for relinquishing the rest \nof the time, and I join my colleague in strong support of S. 397, the \ngun liability bill. But I also wanted to address a topic that continues \nto draw much heat and discussion here on this floor and in the media. \nIn the heat of political rhetoric over Iraq and the administration's \nprosecution of the global war on terror, much has been lost and not all \nthe facts are being presented in the matter. Unfortunately, some are \nquick to exploit the situation in Iraq and the global war on terror \nand, by extension, the brave men and women prosecuting these conflicts \nas cannon fodder in their attacks on the President from the media and \nothers. These folks hope to undermine the administration's credibility \nwith a keen eye on gaining political advantage. However, in the end, \nthose efforts serve only to undermine the noble efforts of our Armed \nForces, the men and women of our intelligence community who take the \nfight to the enemy every day. Most damning, however, is that we have \nyet to see those who strongly criticize the President's policies \npresent any comprehensive, workable or viable alternatives.\n  This kind of politicizing only serves to erode the morale of the men \nand women in the field who do the heavy lifting. It is nothing short of \nshameful when these warriors' leaders in Congress bicker about \nnonsubstantive issues while they in the field are united and committed \nto the missions of freedom and keeping our country safe. The armed \nconflicts in which our young men and women sacrifice so much should be \nthe topic of thoughtful debate.\n  However, there is no place for this kind of posturing in the business \nof war because it merely emboldens the enemy and belittles the efforts \nof our troops.\n  Let's look at the facts. Some argue there is no connection between \nIraq and 9/11. Look at the facts. In late 1994 or early 1995, Saddam \nHussein met with a senior Iraqi intelligence officer in Khartoum. In \nMarch 1998, after bin Laden's public fatwah against the United States, \ntwo al-Qaida members reportedly went to Iraq to meet with Iraqi \nintelligence. In July, an Iraqi delegation traveled to Afghanistan to \nmeet first with the Taliban and then bin Laden. ``One reliable source \nreported bin Laden's having met with Iraqi officials, who `may have \noffered him asylum'.'' These are quotes from the bipartisan 9/11 \nCommission Report published in July 2004.\n  I do not think one could argue that these facts are either agenda-\ndriven or biased. These facts demonstrate that prior to the 9/11 \nattacks, al-Qaida and bin Laden himself maintained contacts with the \nIraqi regime and that the Iraqis even offered to harbor bin Laden.\n  Accordingly, a categorical denial that ``Iraq had nothing to do with \n9/11'' cannot be made responsibly.\n  Next contention: Iraq had and has nothing to do with the global war \non terror. That is flat dead wrong. Hardly anyone can refute the fact \nthat Iraq has become the gathering place for Sunni extremists who wish \nto wage war against the United States. From their optic, the terrorists \nhave a plethora of targets with the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq. \nThey are also motivated to combat our policy of fostering a \npluralistic, open, and democratic government in Iraq. True meaning.\n  Instead, the terrorists wish to distort Islam's true meaning, wage an \nunholy war against Iraq's Shi'a, and induce a sectarian civil war \nduring the aftermath of which the terrorists would like to establish a \nTaliban-like state in Iraq. These same terrorists are also motivated by \ntheir desire to evict U.S. forces not only from Iraq but from the \nGreater Arab Middle East, and they view our mission in Iraq as an act \nof occupation when it is a battle of liberation. The battle is one of \nhearts and minds; a battle, however, that the Iraqi people are \ndetermined to win, along with our assistance, as demonstrated\n\n[[Page S9078]]\n\nby the 58-percent voter turnout in January, where they elected a new \nnational government, and also by the continuing willingness of Iraqis--\nto face the danger of terrorist suicide attacks--to sign up to serve to \nkeep the peace.\n  But terrorism is not a new phenomenon in Iraq. Chief among the \nterrorists in Iraq today, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was known to have been \nin Baghdad since at least mid-2002. You might ask, how can a terrorist \nof Zarqawi's notoriety operate, let alone live, in a Stalinist police \nstate such as that of Saddam's Iraq, without the former regime's \nknowledge, if not consent. The answer is simple. Saddam knew Zarqawi \nwas there, undoubtedly.\n  When asked about Iraq's al-Qaida relationship by CNN's Wolf Blitzer, \non February 5, 2003, the vice chair of our Senate Intelligence \nCommittee agreed that his presence in Iraq before the war was \ntroubling. He said, ``The fact that Zarqawi is very close to bin Laden \nputs at rest, in fairly dramatic terms, that there is at least \nsubstantial connection between Saddam and al-Qaida.''\n  However, long before Zarqawi descended upon Iraq, Abu Nidal, the \nsecular Palestinian terrorist leader and founder of the Abu Nidal \norganization, lived in Iraq from 1998 until he died in 2002. Over the \nyears, that organization carried out terrorist attacks in 20 countries, \nkilling or injuring almost 900 people, including hijacking of Pan Am \nflight 373 in Karachi in 1986 and the assassination of a Jordanian \ndiplomat in Lebanon in 1994. Abu Nidal was arguably the world's most \nruthless terrorist until the rise of Saddam Hussein. He lived and \nflourished in Saddam's Iraq for 4 years.\n\n  In 1993, the Iraqi Intelligence Service directed and pursued an \nattempt to assassinate, through the use of a powerful car bomb, former \nPresident George Bush and the Emir of Kuwait. Kuwait authorities \nthwarted the terrorist plot and arrested 16 suspects led by two Iraqi \nnationals.\n  Finally, Abdul Rahman Yasin, who was indicted in the United States \nfor mixing the chemicals in the bomb that exploded beneath the World \nTrade Center in 1993, arrived in Baghdad during July of 1994. Upon his \narrival, Yasin traveled freely and received both a house and a monthly \nstipend from the Iraqi Government during his stay.\n  Next contention: Iraq did not present a danger to the United States \nat the time we commenced Operation Iraqi Freedom. Listen to the people \nwho looked at the situation. During a July 28, 2004, Senate Armed \nServices Committee hearing, the former head of the Iraq survey group \nwho went in and looked at the situation in Iraq after we occupied it, \nDr. David Kay, noted, ``It was reasonable to conclude that Iraq posed \nan imminent threat. What we learned during the inspection made Iraq a \nmore dangerous place potentially than in fact we thought it was even \nbefore the war.'' He went on to say, ``I think the world is far safer \nwith the disappearance and removal of Saddam Hussein. This may be one \nof these cases where he was more dangerous than we thought.'' The head \nof the Iraqi survey group.\n  Next contention: Iraq would have supplied WMD to terrorists. During \nthat same hearing Dr. Kay added, ``After 1998, Iraq became a regime \nthat was totally corrupt. Individuals were out for their own \nprotection, and in a world where we know others are seeking WMD, the \nlikelihood at some point in the future of a seller and a buyer meeting \nup would have made Iraq a far more dangerous country than even we \nanticipated.''\n  The 9/11 Commission during the 1990s found:\n\n       Bin Ladin sought the capability to kill on a mass scale. \n     Bin Ladin's aides received word that a Sudanese military \n     officer who had been a member of the previous government \n     cabinet was offering to sell weapons grade uranium. After a \n     number of contacts were made through intermediaries, the \n     officer set the price at $1.5 million which did not deter Bin \n     Ladin. Al-Qaida representatives asked to inspect the uranium \n     and were shown a cylinder about 3 feet long and one thought \n     he could pronounce it genuine.\n\n  Al-Qaida apparently purchased it, and it turned out that it was not a \nlegitimate one.\n  Given al-Qaida's demonstrated desire to acquire WMD and the Iraqi \nGovernment's likelihood of sharing WMD technology or actual devices \nwith anyone for the right price, no one can dispute that the liberation \nof Iraq from Saddam's dictatorial and corrupt regime was a prudent \noffensive strike in the war on terror.\n  Finally, some would argue Iraq is a quagmire and not winnable. But \nlisten to the troops. They say otherwise. These are the boots on the \nground, the soldiers, the marines. During a recent trip to Iraq, \njournalist Michael Graham spoke to more than 100 soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines, with different ranks and duties, at their forward \noperating bases, and they overwhelmingly had the same things to say \nabout the war in Iraq. And he went on to say that these 100 American \ntroops made the following points: We believe in the mission. We are \nmaking progress. The Iraqis are making progress too. We are going to \nwin.\n  I believe that says it all. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nhis article be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. I believe that article says it all. Michael Graham's \nsampling of U.S. military personnel was random, varied, not controlled \nby the Pentagon. The sample may be small, but 100 troops believe in the \nwar in Iraq and that we are going to win.\n  History teaches us that the first casualty of war is truth. The first \ncasualty of political battles can often be the men and women fighting \nthe real battles while executing our Nation's policies. Let us not \ndebase the memories of those who have laid such a sacrifice on the \naltar of freedom with meaningless finger-pointing exercises. Let's \nspeak with truth about the issues and facts at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                          Handing Over the Mic\n\n\n                         Troops talk from Iraq\n\n                          (By Michael Graham)\n\n       I just spent a week in Iraq and Kuwait cultivating a skill \n     that I, as a talk-show host, have found nearly impossible to \n     master: shutting up.\n       Turns out, it was easier than I thought, at least in Iraq. \n     When you're listening to a 20-year-old kid from Indiana tell \n     how he earned his second Purple Heart, speechlessness is the \n     natural reaction.\n       I was there as part of the much-maligned ``Truth Tour'' \n     organized by Move America Forward, a conservative group based \n     in California. According to reports in the mainstream media, \n     I was part of a ``propaganda'' junket paid for by the \n     Pentagon to buy some desperately needed positive coverage of \n     the unwinnable military quagmire. All I can say is: If this \n     was a junket, it was the worst-run junket in the history of \n     public relations.\n       My radio station and I had to pay all my expenses, I slept \n     on a bare cot in a tent in the desert, and at some locations \n     the only available ``food'' (and I use that term under \n     protest) were MREs--which stands for ``Meals Ready to Eat . . \n     . assuming you've already eaten both shoes and most of your \n     undergarments.''\n       This alleged ``junket'' failed in another way, too. The \n     Pentagon didn't control what went out over the airwaves. Then \n     again, neither did I. I left it all up to the soldiers.\n       I traveled about Iraq from Camp Victory at the Baghdad \n     International Airport to Camp Prosperity on the very edge of \n     the Red Zone, then down the Baghdad Highway to Camp Falcon, \n     and on to the Command Headquarters in the heart of the city \n     and, eventually, to the deserts of Kuwait and Camp Arifjan. \n     And everywhere I went, I flipped on my mic, sat back, and let \n     the troops tell their story.\n       These soldiers weren't stooges from Public Affairs or \n     handpicked flag wavers foist on me by media handlers. I found \n     some in the mess hall, others working security checkpoints; \n     others sought me out because they have family living in the \n     D.C. area where my radio show is broadcast. The least \n     fortunate were the soldiers in Humvees stuck with ``tourist \n     duty,'' four friendly but serious young men who got stuck \n     with a couple of bonehead radio hosts riding along on patrol.\n       In all, I spoke to more than 100 soldiers, sailors, airmen, \n     and Marines, with different ranks and different duties at \n     their FOBs (forward operating base), and yet they \n     overwhelmingly had the same things to say about the war in \n     Iraq:\n       ``We believe in the mission.''\n       ``We're making progress.''\n       ``The Iraqis are making progress, too.''\n       And, perhaps most important of all: ``We're going to win.''\n       I expected to hear this sort of positive assessment from \n     General George Casey, commander of operations in Iraq, when I \n     interviewed him at his headquarters deep inside the \n     International Zone. When he pointed out that, one year ago, \n     there was just one standing battalion in the Iraqi army, but \n     there are\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\n     107 battalions today, he was doing his job of supporting the \n     war. And I expected it from Lt. General Steve Whitcomb, \n     commanding general of the 3rd Army, as he talked about \n     successfully moving more than one million gallons of fuel \n     across Iraq every day, despite the best efforts of the \n     insurgents.\n       Generals are supposed to be gung ho. It comes with the pay \n     grade.\n       But I heard the same, positive assessments from 23-year-old \n     sergeants from New Iberia, La., and from PFCs from Wisconsin \n     and Alabama. I heard it from Lieutenant Li, whose Humvee had \n     been hit by IEDs so many times he'd lost count. I heard it \n     from Airman Truong, who was born in Vietnam and had recently \n     returned to his native country to marry. Two weeks after ``I \n     do,'' Airman Truong was headed back to Kuwait to do his duty \n     for his adopted country.\n       Again and again, from ``white-collar'' soldiers working in \n     the relative safety of Camp Victory at the Baghdad airport to \n     the ``real'' soldiers patrolling Route Irish (a.k.a the \n     ``Highway of Death''), I heard that America and their Iraqi-\n     army allies are winning the war against the insurgents. I was \n     told again and again by the soldiers themselves that their \n     (our) cause is just, the strategy is working, and the enemy \n     they fight represents evil itself.\n       In other words, I heard things seldom heard on CBS or read \n     in the pages of the New York Times.\n       It was only a week, and I have my obvious Bush-supporting, \n     troop-cheering biases, but how much closer can a reporter get \n     to delivering unspun, bias-free objective reporting than \n     live-mic broadcasting instantly back to the states? No edits \n     or filters or editorial meetings. Just the young men in the \n     hot desert telling what they've seen, what they've heard, and \n     what they now believe based on those experiences.\n       Isn't it at least significant that not one in 100 thought \n     invading Iraq was a mistake? Was it mere coincidence that a \n     random selection of 100 soldiers all believe their mission is \n     worthwhile? Should we detect the hand of the Vast, Right-Wing \n     Conspiracy in the fact that the vast majority of the troops \n     find the media coverage of the war ignorant, harmful, or \n     both?\n       I'm proud to say that, for a week, the soldiers had their \n     say. If I were the editor of a major daily newspaper or a \n     national network, I would be concerned that what they said is \n     so contrary to what I am printing or broadcasting.\n       But the mainstream media don't need to hear from the \n     soldiers. They already know that the war was a terrible \n     mistake, that the world would be safer if we'd left Saddam in \n     power, and that there is no chance for victory in Iraq.\n       Me, I'm not so smart. I like to let the guys on the ground \n     tell their story. I believe it is completely possible that \n     they know something that I--and the New York Times editorial \n     page--do not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The next hour is controlled by \nthe minority.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am one Member, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, who believes we should be debating not this gun liability \nbill but the Department of Defense authorization bill for the coming \nfiscal year. I serve on that committee. It was a good bipartisan \neffort. I was planning to offer an amendment to add $120 million for \nchildcare and family support for the families of reservists and \nNational Guard men and women who are called to active duty. Others had \namendments, including one regarding BRAC, of particular note to me and \nothers in Minnesota affected by that process.\n  But we are not on that bill. Instead, we are dealing with the most \nspecial interest legislation I have encountered in my 4\\1/2\\ years in \nthe Senate. We are going to leave at the end of this week for a month \nand we have one last window of opportunity to take up what presumably \nwould be the most important measure before the Nation and the Senate. \nInstead, we get this special interest bill.\n  We are not on stem cell legislation that would allow us to create a \nmedically and scientifically based framework to protect the sanctity of \nhuman life or prohibit cloning, and yet still allow medical research \nthat could save many thousands of lives for years to come. That is not \nthe Republican leadership's top priority.\n  Nor is the constitutional amendment to prohibit the burning or \ndesecration of the American flag, of which I am a proud cosponsor, \nbrought to the Senate. In my 4\\1/2\\ years in the Senate, not once has \nthe leader brought that measure to the Senate for an up-or-down vote by \nthe Senate. Evidently it won't happen this week, either, because, \nagain, that does not rate as a top priority.\n  No, according to the Republican leadership, the most important issue \nfacing America and earning the most urgent attention of the Senate is \nthe supposed need to give special immunity from the standards for \nnegligence and product liability that apply to all other businesses and \nall other products. When this legislation passes, and it will pass with \nease, because the NRA, National Rifle Association, has the money and \nthe political clout to get whatever it wants around here, no matter how \nunnecessary, unfair, or ill advised it is, this bill will soon become \nthe law of the land.\n  One of its findings is:\n\n       (7) The liability actions commenced or contemplated by the \n     Federal Government, States, municipalities, and private \n     interest groups and others are based on theories without \n     foundation and hundreds of years of common law and \n     jurisprudence of the United States and do not represent a \n     bona fide expansion of the common law. The possible \n     sustaining of these actions by a maverick judicial officer or \n     petit jury would expand civil liability in a manner never \n     contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, by Congress, \n     or by the legislatures of the several States. Such an \n     expansion of liability would constitute a deprivation of \n     rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed to a citizen of \n     the United States under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution.\n\n  It goes on to say one of the purposes is to preserve a citizen's \naccess to a supply of firearms and ammunition for all lawful purposes, \nsomething I certainly support.\n  It goes on to say the purpose is to protect the right under the first \namendment of the Constitution of manufacturers, distributors, dealers, \nand importers of firearms or ammunition products, and trade \nassociations to speak freely, to assemble peacefully, and to petition \nthe Government for redress of their grievances.\n  This legislation is supposedly necessary to protect the first \namendment rights of people in the lawful business of manufacturing, \ndistributing, or selling firearm and buying the same.\n  In the manufactured hysteria of this fabricated crisis, the \nGovernment or a maverick judicial officer or a petit jury evidently is \nthreatening to violate the first amendment, the second amendment, and \nthe 14th amendment rights of all gun manufacturers, distributors, and \ndealers in the United States of America. What utter nonsense. But if \nthe National Rifle Association says the sky is green and the grass is \nblue, the majority of Congress will run for the paint.\n\n  I strongly support the second amendment of the U.S. Constitution. I \nam a gun owner myself and a hunter. This bill does not benefit gun \nowners or hunters, who are most of the NRA members. They are being used \nto give special favors and special treatment to someone's special \nfriends and someone's big contributors.\n  Last year, according to industry data, there were over 1.3 million \nhandguns sold in the United States. That is just handguns. Sales \ntotaled $605 million. The sales of rifles and shotguns last year \ntotaled $1 billion. The number of long guns sold was not available, but \nsimple math puts that number well over 2 million rifles and shotguns \nsold in the United States last year.\n  Given that volume of sales and weapons available, can anyone believe \nany law-abiding American's constitutional right to lawfully purchase \nand own as many guns as he or she wants is being endangered? What \nnonsense. Absolute nonsense.\n  Our major gun manufacturers are certainly not in danger. Smith and \nWesson's most recent annual report showed net product sales of $118 \nmillion last year, an increase of almost 20 percent over the previous \nyear.\n  Sturm, Ruger and Company on July 20 of this year reported net sales \nfor the 6 months ended June 30, 2005 as $78.7 million, an 8-percent \nincrease over 2004, and the chief executive stated firearm unit \nshipments in the second quarter increased 11 percent from the prior \nyear due to strong demand.\n  This is not an industry being hounded out of business. Would the \nindustry like to rid itself of all lawsuits stemming from products and \nsales? Of course, and so would every other industry and company in \nAmerica. I am not here to defend our Nation's litigation practices, \nwhich are often excessive and sometimes even extreme, but whatever so-\ncalled reforms are made should apply to everyone. Gun manufacturers and \ndealers are not the only people who make and sell potentially dangerous \nproducts or products that can be used illegally and misused. And\n\n[[Page S9080]]\n\njudges and juries are not indiscriminately finding against gun \nmanufacturers. Most are probably gun owners and hunters as well.\n  Despite what the NRA pedals to its members to justify its existence \nand their dues, the second amendment is accepted and respected by the \noverwhelming majority of Americans and there is no threat to \nresponsible manufacturers, dealers, lawful buyers, or owners of the \nmillions of guns in America. There is no justification for this special \nlegislation and the special treatment it gives to that industry.\n  Of course, the gun industry is accustomed to getting special \ntreatment from Congress. Firearms and tobacco are the only two consumer \nproducts specifically exempt from regulation by the Consumer Products \nSafety Commission. What an exemption. I have to hand it to the NRA, \nwhether I agree with them or not, they sure know how to operate around \nhere. Many industries and even individual corporations pour a lot more \nmoney into lobbying and into political contributions than the NRA and \nthey do not get nearly the special treatment, special favors from \nCongress the gun lobby does--a complete exemption from consumer product \nsafety laws and regulations, and now almost complete immunity for \nlawsuits from negligence or product malfunctions. All other businesses \nand industries in America are in discount coach while the gun lobby has \nspecial privileges flying first class on Air America under this \nCongress and preceding Congresses.\n  It is because there is that exemption from the consumer product \nsafety laws of this country that some of these lawsuits, not frivolous, \nbut determined by a judge or jury through the process to be legitimate \nand bona fide, and the resulting civil damages are necessary to move \nthe industry to take some of the safety actions it can technologically \nand financially certainly afford to make that it probably would not do \notherwise.\n  For example, take Bushmaster. Their dealer lost the sniper's assault \nrifle along with 238 other guns that were then used by the snipers \nagainst the innocent victims in Washington, DC. As a result of its \nsettlement with the victims of those families, they agreed also to \ninform their dealers of safer sales practices that hopefully will \nprevent other criminals from obtaining the guns, something that had \nnever been done before.\n  In June of 2004, two former New Jersey police officers were shot in \nthe line of duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a West \nVirginia dealer. They won a $1 million settlement, and the dealer who \nsold the gun, along with 11 other handguns in a cash sale to a straw \nbuyer for a gun trafficker--after that lawsuit that dealer, as well as \ntwo other area pawnshops, agreed to implement safer practices to \nprevent sales to traffickers, including a policy of ending large-volume \nsales of handguns.\n  In 2004 also, Tennille Jefferson, whose 7-year-old son was \nunintentionally killed by another child with a trafficked gun, won a \nsettlement from a gun dealer that amounted to $850,000. The handgun was \none of many the dealer sold to the trafficker despite clear signs the \nguns were headed for the underground market. That, too, resulted in \nchanges in policies and sales practices that hopefully will prevent \nother mothers from suffering that terrible fate of losing a child.\n  I am not saying every one of those cases filed against the \nmanufacturers or dealers is proper. Again, that is for the process to \ndetermine. But there is no evidence, no evidence at all, that there is \nanything about the nature of these suits, the outcomes of them, the \njury awards relative to the damages that have occurred, that indicates \nthis industry is being prejudiced or plagued by those who they contrive \nto be doing so, to justify this legislation. If we are going to reform \nthe tort system in this country, let's do it openly and aboveboard with \nall industries, all of American businesses affected equally by those \nchanges. To single out one industry, particularly one that \nmanufacturers products, potentially, as dangerous as guns, is just a \nterrible day for the Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a sad day in the Senate. It is a \nsad day in two respects. Yesterday, we were debating a bill, the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act. It is an important bill. It is \na $440 billion bill for our American military: our soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, airmen, members of the Coast Guard, Guard and Reserve. We were \ntrying, in that bill, to help our fighting men and women and their \nfamilies.\n  We had a long list of amendments that we wanted to consider: extra \npay for totally disabled veterans, help for the widows and orphans of \ncombat soldiers who die in the line of duty, fair compensation for \nGuard and Reserve when they are activated and they are Federal \nemployees, daycare for the families of soldiers who are activated, \nquality-of-life issues for the men and women in uniform who are \nfighting for America.\n  A decision was made by the Republican leadership to leave that bill, \nleave that issue, to come to this one. What could be more important for \nus to consider than the safety, the lives, and fortunes of the men and \nwomen who serve our country and risk their lives, on military duty, and \ntheir families?\n  Well, in the estimation of the Republican leader, Senator Frist, \nthere was one issue that was more important than talking about our men \nand women in uniform. That issue was providing immunity from liability \nfor one industry in America, to say that of all the businesses in \nAmerica that provide us with goods and services, all of the businesses \nthat are currently held responsible for wrongdoing, we will create one \nexception. We will say, if the gun industry is guilty of wrongdoing, \nthey cannot be sued. That is right. The firearms industry, which sells \nmillions of firearms each year in the United States, should not be held \nresponsible for their bad conduct and wrongdoing.\n  It is hard to say those words and not shake your head. If personal \nresponsibility is what it means to be an American and an American \nbusiness man or woman, why in the world would you exempt one industry \nand say they are special, they are political royalty, they cannot be \nheld liable for their misconduct? And why did we move to this bill and \naway from the Department of Defense authorization bill to help our \nsoldiers and their families? The answer is too obvious. It is because \nof the political clout of the National Rifle Association and the gun \nlobby. It is the only group I can think of which would just go \nstraightforward with the concept they are more important to the Senate \ncalendar than the fighting men and women who are now risking their \nlives for our country. They have done it many times.\n  The NRA runs certain people in this Chamber and on the other side \nwhen it comes to the agenda. They decide what will be taken up and what \namendments will pass--an extremely powerful group. The NRA succeeded in \nhaving the Senate debate guns--and that is a rare debate--but only when \nit comes to this question of gun immunity.\n  Isn't it interesting, we want to put an amendment on this bill that \nsays when you sell a firearm you have to check to see if the purchaser \nis on a watch list of terrorists. Is that unreasonable? If you have \ncomputer access through your store--and these stores do--shouldn't you \ncheck to see if that person standing across the counter from you is on \nthe watch list for terrorism in America? That concept is rejected by \nthe National Rifle Association. Background checks: extremely limited. \nInformation gathered about criminal people is to be destroyed so \nquickly that it is of little value to law enforcement.\n  A March 2005 report from the Government Accountability Office found \nthat between February and June of 2004, people on U.S. lists of \nsuspected terrorists applied 44 times to buy guns. It is not unheard \nof. It happens in this country. In only nine instances were they turned \ndown. In the months since the study ended, 12 more suspected terrorists \nhad the green light to buy or carry guns.\n  FBI Director Bob Mueller--whom I respect very much--said he was \nforming a group to study the problem. Why aren't we talking about this \ninstead of granting immunity for the gun dealer who sells a weapon to \nsomeone he should have known could misuse it for a crime or for \nterrorism? We are shielding them from civil liability for not\n\n[[Page S9081]]\n\nliving up to their responsibility when it comes to the sale of lethal \nfirearms.\n  Or we could talk about ways to solve the problem in America of guns \nbeing trafficked, many crossing State lines, and used in crimes. The \nATF says 90 percent of the guns recovered in crimes were used by \npersons other than the original purchaser, other than ``straw men,'' \npeople who bought them to sell them to criminals. One-third of all \ncrime guns cross State lines.\n  In my State of Illinois, 47 percent of guns traced to crimes \ncommitted in Illinois originated in other States. One State, \nMississippi--the little State of Mississippi--is far and away the per \ncapita leader in selling guns exported from their State and used in \ncrime. Do you know why? Because firearms laws are not really strictly \nenforced in Mississippi, and some other States.\n\n  From 2000 to 2002, Department of Justice prosecutors filed three \ncases in Mississippi for violations of gun trafficking laws. In \ncontrast, 32 cases were filed in Kentucky, 28 in Tennessee. So we have \ngun dealers in Mississippi selling trunkloads of guns to people who get \non the interstate and drive up to Illinois and, perhaps, your State, \ntoo, selling them to gun gangs and drug gangs on the streets, and then \nspreading out these guns to kill innocent people. And the people \npushing this bill are arguing that we should not hold those firearms \ndealers responsible because they did not ``know'' that a crime was \ngoing to be committed.\n  One hundred ``Saturday night specials'' to stick in the trunk of your \ncar, junk guns, that you would never use for sports or hunting, and \nthey didn't know? They should have known. That is a standard in law \nalmost everywhere: that you knew or should have known. They are \nchanging the law. They are saying, for firearms dealers, we are not \ngoing to hold them to this same standard that we hold every other \nbusiness in America to when people buy products.\n  There are lots of other issues we could talk about, the gun show \nloophole, and others. But I think one of the most important things we \ncould talk about is why this bill is on the floor today. It is not \nbecause gun manufacturers and gun dealers are facing bankruptcy and a \nlot of litigation. I read into the Record yesterday--and will not \nrepeat--the major gun manufacturers in this country have no problems in \nterms of profitability. In fact, one of the leading companies, Smith & \nWesson, said:\n\n       In the nine months ended January 31, 2005, [Smith & Wesson] \n     incurred $4,535 in [legal] defense costs, net of amounts \n     received from insurance carriers, relative to product \n     liability and municipal litigation.\n\n  Mr. President, $4,500--does that sound like a business crisis that \nwould move a gun immunity bill to the front of the calendar in front of \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill? What it comes down to is \nthis gun lobby has a lot of clout, and they are pushing for this \nsweeping immunity.\n  What kind of cases are we talking about? I said to my staff, you can \ntalk about the law. And I could stand here as a person trained in law \nschool and go through the obvious problems with this bill. But I think \nit is more important to talk about real-life situations. It is more \nimportant to give illustrations of why this is such a terrible bill.\n  Let me tell you about Anthony Oliver. Anthony Oliver was 14 years \nold. He was shot and killed on July 23 of last year while he was \nplaying video games with his friend who was 13. Anthony's friend, his \n13-year-old friend, had just bought a gun on the street for $50. He \ntold the police he bought the gun with his allowance near his home \nbecause he was intimidated by a group of kids who jumped his friend and \nthreatened to beat him up. He said he thought the safety was on when he \naccidentally killed Anthony with one shot to the stomach.\n  Federal investigators traced the gun. It was a ``Saturday night \nspecial,'' one of those cheap guns just used for crime. They traced it \nto Lou's Jewelry and Pawn store in Upper Darby, PA. From 1996 to the \nyear 2000, this pawnshop in Pennsylvania sold 441 guns traced to crime. \nIt ranks as the No. 1 dealer in Pennsylvania in selling guns to \ncriminals and 43rd in the Nation among all gun dealers.\n  In 2003, the last year for which we have statistics, Lou's sold 178 \nguns traced to crime. That year, less than 1 percent of the more than \n3,000 dealers in Pennsylvania sold even one gun traced to crime. So you \nhave a handful of dealers, just a small percentage, who are not paying \nattention or ignoring openly the fact that they are selling guns over \nand over and over again to gun traffickers and to straw purchasers.\n  How is that done? Well, the person who has a criminal record and \ncannot buy a gun brings his girlfriend in, and while he is standing \nthere picking out the guns, the girlfriend is handing over the credit \ncard or the cash to pay for them. They cannot sell to him. He is a \ncriminal. He has a record of felonies, so the girlfriend buys it. So \nshould the gun dealer be aware of that? Why, of course. It is obvious.\n  Should they be held accountable if they should have known that gun, \nthrough that girlfriend, is going straight into the hands of a felon, \nstraight on to the street, killing innocent people? In America, a jury \ndecides that. They will not be able to when this bill is passed. When \nthis bill is passed, those who vote for it have decided they will be \nthe jury forever when it comes to those questions of liability. We are \ntaking that matter out of the hands of American citizens. We are \nputting it in the hands of a handful of Senators.\n  The gun that killed Anthony was sold in 2003 by Lou's to a trafficker \nwho had purchased six guns in a very short period. They bought multiple \nguns, including many ``Saturday night specials,'' which are small, \neasily concealed, low-quality handguns sought basically by kids, drug \ngangs, and those who are going to have a fast crime experience on a \nSaturday night.\n\n  The purchase of multiple firearms at once should have been a red flag \nto Lou, but Lou doesn't pay any attention to that: Give me some cash--\nI'll give you a gun; no questions asked.\n  When this bill passes, the family of Anthony Oliver will lose their \nlawsuit, the lawsuit they brought against Lou's pawnshop that continues \nto sell these guns used in crime. So what a great piece of news for \nthat family: the tragedy of losing your 14-year-old son to a ``Saturday \nnight special'' from a pawnshop which specializes in selling guns to \ngun traffickers and criminals. This is a great bill, isn't it?\n  Let me tell you about another case. Danny Guzman was a 26-year-old \nfather of two from Worcester, MA, killed by a stray bullet fired \noutside of a nightclub on Christmas Eve in 1999.\n  After the shooting, the loaded gun used in the shooting was found \nbehind an apartment building by a 4-year-old child. The gun had no \nserial number. They determined the gun was one of several stolen from \nKahr Arms, a Worcester gun manufacturer, by their own employees, who \nhired many of these employees and, it turns out, never checked whether \nthey had criminal records.\n  One of the thieves, Mark Cronin, who worked for this gun \nmanufacturer, had been hired despite his history of crack addiction, \ntheft, alcohol abuse, violence, and assault and battery. They did not \ncheck it. The gun manufacturer hired people to make guns and did not do \na criminal background check on their employees.\n  Cronin told an associate that he took guns out of the Kahr company \n``all the time'' and that he could just walk out the door with them. He \ntook the gun that was used to kill Danny right off the assembly line. \nAnd he was pretty smart about it. He took it off the assembly line \nbefore it was stamped with a serial number. Smart guy. Can't be traced.\n  The investigation also led to the arrest of another employee, Scott \nAnderson, who had a criminal history, who pled guilty to stealing guns \nfrom the company.\n  Fifty Kahr firearms disappeared in a 5-year period. The local police \ncaptain classified the recordkeeping at that facility as ``shoddy,'' \nthat it was possible to remove weapons without detection because they \ndid not keep their records well.\n  Danny Guzman's family brought a wrongful death suit in Massachusetts \nState court against the owner of the gun manufacturing company, saying: \nYou should have kept your records so you could see that guns were being \nstolen. And you certainly should have done a background check on your \nemployees. Hiring somebody who has such a criminal record to work in a \nplant\n\n[[Page S9082]]\n\nthat makes guns is clearly a question of negligence.\n  The trial judge denied the efforts of the company to dismiss the \nlawsuit, and it is still pending. Do you know what happens to that \nlawsuit by the family of Danny Guzman against that arms manufacturer if \nwe pass this bill? It is immediately removed. They have no rights in \ncourt to pursue that. Why? Why would we say to a person who owns a \ncompany that makes guns that you are held to a lesser standard than a \nperson who owns a company that makes toys? That is what it boils down \nto. You are doing it because the gun lobby insists on it. They want \nthis immunity.\n\n  The case that has brought many policemen forward--and I will close \nwith this--involves police officers. The last time we debated this \nbill, we said: Shouldn't we at least create an exception that if the \ngun is used to kill a police officer in the line of duty, that we are \ngoing to hold a gun dealer responsible if they should have known that? \nWouldn't we hold a gun manufacturer responsible if they were involved \nin supplying guns to Lou's Pawnshop, which ranks one of the highest in \nthe Nation of turning guns over to criminals? So we asked for an \nexception for law enforcement. It was defeated. All the people here who \ntalk about law and order and how much they love policemen in uniform \ndefending our communities and neighborhoods with their lives voted \nagainst them when they had a chance to put that exception in the law.\n  Let me give you a specific example. On January 12, 2001, police \nofficers in Orange, NJ, were performing undercover surveillance at a \ngas station that had been robbed repeatedly. Someone acting \nsuspiciously walked up to the gas station and then turned away. When \nDetective David Lemongello approached the man a few blocks away to \nquestion him, he responded by turning and opening fire. Detective \nLemongello was hit in the chest and left arm, and the suspect fled. \nWhen additional officers, including Kenneth McGuire, found the man \nhiding beneath some bushes, the man started shooting again. Officer \nMcGuire was hit in the abdomen and right leg. McGuire and two other \nofficers returned fire and killed the man, even though they had been \nshot. Although Detective Lemongello and Officer McGuire survived, they \nhave suffered serious, debilitating injuries.\n  The man who shot them was wanted for attempted murder and had been \narrested several times. So how did he get a gun? How did this man come \ninto possession of a gun? Gun trafficker James Gray traveled from New \nJersey to West Virginia to buy his guns. He and his companion, Tammi \nLea Songer, visited Will's Jewelry and Loan, a pawnshop in South \nCharleston, WV, and Songer acted as a ``straw purchaser'' by buying the \ngun for Gray who couldn't purchase it himself because he was a three-\ntime convicted felon and out-of-State resident. The girlfriend bought \nthe gun while he was standing there. Good old Will's Jewelry and Loan \ntook the cash and handed the gun over.\n  They returned to Will's 17 days later, purchased 12 more guns--see \nthe pattern--which the girlfriend bought and paid for with thousands of \ndollars in cash. Should the gun dealer have been saying at this point, \nThis looks a little fishy? I think so. Reasonable people would. Gray \npicked out the guns for the girlfriend to purchase in full view of \nWill's Jewelry and Loan pawnshop personnel, a clear signal this was a \n``straw purchase.'' One of those guns was the gun used to shoot these \npolice officers, McGuire and Lemongello.\n  Will's personnel had reservations regarding the nature of the \ntransaction but went through with it anyway before contacting the ATF \nto report their suspicions. The ATF then contacted the girlfriend, \nTammi Lea Songer, who agreed to assist them in a sting operation that \nresulted in the capture of Gray. However, in the time it took the ATF \nto set up its sting, Gray had already trafficked the gun--sold it on \nthe street--which was used to shoot these police officers.\n  The police officers and their families are suing the gun dealer, \nsaying: You didn't use good sense and any reasonable standard of \nconduct in selling to this guy's girlfriend when you should have known \nsomething fishy was up. So they have a lawsuit against them and the \nmanufacturer. Do you know what happens to this lawsuit from these \npolicemen if this bill passes? It is over. Not another day in court. No \nchance for these wounded policemen or their families to recover.\n  Will's settled, incidentally, with Officers McGuire and Lemongello \nfor a million and agreed to change its practices in terms of \nunderground traffickers. If the current bill passes before this \nsettlement is reached and final, justice will not have been done. The \nshop would not have agreed to take the steps to make the streets safer.\n  That is what we are up against--people who want to stand behind and \nprotect gun dealers who are selling guns that they should know are \ngoing out on the street to menace and threaten innocent people.\n  How in the world have we reached this point that we leave the \nDepartment of Defense bill to come to this? It is a sad day for the \nSenate. It is sad to think that one lobby has so much power over the \nSenate that they can move us away from the men and women in uniform, to \nwhom we have a first responsibility, to protecting gun dealers like \nWill's pawnshop in Virginia or Lou's in Pennsylvania. What in the world \nare we doing here? We owe it to the men and women in uniform and the \npolicemen who risk their lives for us to defeat this bill. We owe it to \nthe mothers and fathers who want their kids to come home safe every \nnight and not be menaced by driveby shootings and ``Saturday night \nspecials'' to defeat this bill. It is time to decide who you are \nworking for in the Senate. Is it the gun lobby or the policemen and \nfamilies of America?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize we are up against a time limit. I \nask unanimous consent that my comments appear as though in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of John Roberts\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to bring \npeople up to date on where we are on the John Roberts nomination to the \nSupreme Court.\n  It is now a little over a week since President Bush made a dramatic \nevening announcement of his intention to nominate John Roberts to \nsucceed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. In the \nSenate, we haven't received this nomination. It has not come up yet. \nNonetheless, we are well on the way to preparation for the Senate's \nprocess in considering the nomination.\n  During the past weeks, some of us have met with Judge Roberts. We \nhave urged him to be forthcoming at his upcoming hearing. The Judiciary \nCommittee has already sent him a questionnaire seeking background \ninformation. Most importantly, Chairman Specter and I have already \nbegun laying the groundwork for full and fair hearings which we are \nboth committed to holding. I expect that we will soon be able to \nannounce the Judiciary Committee's schedule for those hearings.\n  Late yesterday, the White House provided some documents from Mr. \nRoberts' time when he served as special counsel to Attorney General \nWilliam French Smith during the Reagan administration. None of us had \nrequested these particular documents but, of course, we are always \nhappy to receive anything they want to send. There are at least three \ncategories of documents from Mr. Roberts' years in the executive branch \nthat are relevant to this nomination.\n  The second group relates to Mr. Roberts' work from 1982 to 1986 as an \nassociate White House counsel under the supervision of White House \nCounsel Fred Fielding. These are apparently kept in the Reagan Library \nin California.\n  Yesterday, in our continuing effort to expedite the process, we sent \na letter to the White House asking that the files from those years be \nmade available as quickly as possible, and to help speed it up, we \nidentified by name the files we wished to be priorities. I hope the \nreported statements by White House officials over the last couple of \ndays indicating they expect it will take 3 or 4 weeks to make these \nmaterials available are in error and, instead,\n\n[[Page S9083]]\n\nthey can be made available on a prompt basis, not a delayed basis. \nOtherwise, it would almost appear--I certainly wouldn't want to suggest \nthe White House would do this--that they are trying to make sure the \ndocuments arrive after the hearings and not before them or arrive so \nclose to the time of the hearings, there would be no time to review \nthem. I trust there will be those at the White House who would \nunderstand this would be the wrong way to proceed and would actually in \nthe long run end up adding more time to the process.\n  The third category of files is from Mr. Roberts' work when he was a \npolitical appointee in the Justice Department's Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral. He served as Kenneth Starr's principal deputy during the prior \nBush administration. The reason I say these are important, the \nPresident said that his work at this time was one of the reasons he \nselected Judge Roberts as his nominee. Of course, the President has \nevery right to consider whatever reasons for a Supreme Court nominee. \nHaving said that, however, in carrying out our responsibilities, it is \nappropriate that the Senate also be entitled to the same kind of \ninformation that the White House weighed in making its decision about \nthis nomination. In other words, if this work is one of the reasons \nthey say he is qualified to be on the Supreme Court, all the more \nreason the 100 Members of the Senate should be able to see it and make \nup our own minds.\n  Actually, it might be the most informative of the documents we are \ngoing to seek. We could get a practical sense of how, when, and why \npolitics and the law intersect for him. I am not expecting to seek \nproduction of all the files and the hundreds of matters on which Mr. \nRoberts worked in those critical years. Nobody is asking for that. \nRather, in our effort to cooperate and expedite the process, we are \nputting together a targeted catalog of documents. I hope we can work \nwith Chairman Specter to send a reasonable bipartisan request for a \nselected group of those files.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter we \nsent to the White House yesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2005.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are disappointed that the White \n     House appears to have so quickly moved to close off access by \n     the Senate to important and informative documents written by \n     Supreme Court nominee John Roberts while he was at the \n     Department of Justice. According to news reports today, your \n     Administration may be preemptively protecting thousands of \n     documents not even requested yet by the Committee--documents \n     that could very well hold important information necessary to \n     evaluate Judge Roberts' judicial philosophy and legal \n     reasoning.\n       While many documents are being delivered today from Judge \n     Roberts' work for Attorney General William French Smith at \n     the Reagan Justice Department, it is far too early to \n     determine whether these documents are relevant, adequate, or \n     even helpful. It may be that this group of documents, along \n     with the upcoming hearings, will give us enough information \n     to fulfill our constitutional duty to advise and consent on \n     this nomination. But it would be premature for either the \n     Senate or the White House to make that determination now. \n     Judge Roberts spent some four years working for President \n     George H.W. Bush, and it may very well be that documents from \n     that time will be helpful to the Committee as well.\n       It is our hope that the confirmation process moves swiftly \n     and smoothly over the coming weeks. We can assure you that no \n     Senator is attempting to unduly delay the proceedings. We \n     intend to work with Chairman Specter if and when further \n     requests for documents or information appear appropriate. But \n     in the meantime, we believe that judgment should be withheld \n     on which and how many documents regarding this nominee might \n     be released to the Senate. The history of past nominations is \n     varied but clear--each confirmation process is different, and \n     the type and number of documents shared between the White \n     House and the Senate has depended on the nature of the \n     debate, the needs of the Committee, and a cooperative \n     negotiation between the Senate and the White House. A blanket \n     statement that entire groups of documents are off limits is \n     both premature and ill advised.\n       Finally, it is our understanding that many more publicly \n     available documents will soon be sorted and delivered to the \n     Committee. In the interests of speeding up the process, we \n     have attached a list of the document areas within that group \n     we feel would be most helpful to the Committee.

When we review the documents volunteered by the White \nHouse, obviously, we are going to be asking, Is this more of the old \ntrick of flooding us with stacks of really unimportant materials in \norder to divert attention from those that matter the most? I hope the \nWhite House will begin to work with us instead of acting unilaterally.\n  There is one very easy way. They could send up documents that make no \nsense. They could say, Here is 400 pages of something he had on his \ndesk every day when he was working as a political appointee of the \nJustice Department, and send us the telephone book. That is 400 pages. \nIt was on his desk. It is not very helpful.\n  So the bottom line is this: The White House is eager to supply \ndocuments it selected and certainly provided with great fanfare, but we \nhave yet to receive the documents we have, in fact, requested. It is an \nunfortunate pattern we have seen too often. Of course, the White House \nhas available to it all the documents. The President has spoken about \nthe designee's work in the Reagan White House and at the Bush Justice \nDepartment. But they have yet to share those materials with the Senate.\n  Other nominations have run into trouble when this White House has \ndecided to let the Senate see only what the White House wants the \nSenate to see. If the White House's midnight announcement on Monday \nthat was reportedly embargoed to deny Democratic Senators an \nopportunity to comment is, contrary to appearances, actually intended \nto begin a dialog about documents, then I welcome it. Of course, if it \nis intended to unilaterally preempt a discussion about documents the \nSenate may need and is entitled to, then this is regrettable.\n  Past administrations, Republican and Democratic, have been willing \ncooperatively to work with the Senate to accommodate its requests for \ndocuments. There are ample precedents in both parties documenting such \ncooperation. I believe the Senate is going to need the White House's \nfull cooperation to expedite the scheduling of this process as the \nPresident has requested.\n  Let us be serious. Now that the White House has gotten the stagecraft \nout of the way, let's go back to working on the substance of the \nSenate's work on this very important nomination. The President has, \nrightfully so, announced his choice. Now the Senate must rise to the \nchallenge and do its work. To fulfill our constitutional duties, we \nneed to consider this nomination as thoroughly and carefully as the \nAmerican people deserve. A Supreme Court Justice is not there to \nrepresent either the Republican or Democratic Party; they are there to \nrepresent all 280 million Americans. The Senate is supposed to find, Is \nthis the person the American people deserve, all 280 million of them?\n  That takes time, it takes the cooperation of the nominee, and it \ntakes the cooperation of the administration. It means that Republicans, \nas well as Democrats, have to take our constitutional obligations on \nbehalf of the American people seriously.\n\n[[Page S9084]]\n\n  Let us remember this is not to see who scores political points. This \nis to determine how we protect the rights of all Americans--the \nultimate check and balance for all Americans. This is somebody who \ncould well serve until the year 2030 or beyond.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Vermont for his \neloquent remarks. I will talk about the legislation before us, the gun \nliability legislation.\n  The legislation before us cannot be all things. It cannot be an \neffective barrier against litigation to protect the gun industry and, \nat the same time, be a way to protect legitimate rights of citizens who \nhave been injured or killed by guns. It is not both; it is one of them. \nIt is carefully, cleverly worded legislation to immunize the entire gun \nindustry from virtually any type of liability.\n  There are, perhaps, minor exceptions, but the most important, \ncompelling cases we have seen in recent years--the case of the DC \nsnipers, the case of Police Officers Lamongello and McGuire in New \nJersey, and the pending case of Kahr Arms in Worcester, MA--would be \nbarred. I don't think that is a mere incidental coincidence. They will \nbe deliberately barred.\n  Thankfully, the first two cases were settled after the Senate \nrejected this legislation last year. The families of the victims of the \nWashington area snipers had their day in court and were able to go \nforward, and a settlement was reached. Officers Lamongello and McGuire \nsimilarly had the opportunity to press their cases, and a settlement \nwas reached, but the Kahr Arms case is still pending in court.\n  One of the sweeping aspects of this legislation is that it does not \nmerely attempt to set the rules prospectively, as we go forward, to say \nthese cases would not be heard by a court in the U.S.; it literally \nwalks in and tells people who have filed cases--cases that have \nsurvived motions for summary judgment, cases which judges, looking at \nthe facts and circumstances and the law, have said at least can go \nforward to trial and jury--it would take those cases and throw them out \nof State courts and out of Federal courts if they have been filed.\n  Let's take a look at the Kahr Arms case. It is the case of Guzman v. \nKahr Arms. It was filed under the wife's name--Hernandez, I believe. It \ninvolves Danny Guzman and Kahr Arms. A lawsuit was filed by the family \nof 26-year-old Danny Guzman of Worcester, MA, who was fatally wounded \nwith a 9 mm handgun that was stolen from the Kahr plant by a drug-\naddicted employee who had a criminal record. The manufacturer, Kahr \nArms, operated the factory without basic security measures to protect \nagainst theft, such as metal detectors, security mirrors, or security \nguards. Guns were routinely taken from the factory by felons the \ncompany had hired without conducting background checks.\n  The gun used to kill Danny Guzman was one of several removed by Kahr \nArms employees before serial numbers had even been stamped on them, \nrendering them virtually untraceable. Some point has been made about \nthe fact that it is illegal to erase serial numbers. These people were \nable to get the weapons before serial numbers were imprinted upon the \nweapons, so that law would not apply at all. The guns were then resold \nto criminals in exchange for money and drugs. The loaded gun that \nkilled Mr. Guzman was found by a 4-year-old behind an apartment \nbuilding near the scene of the shooting. Thank goodness that 4-year-old \ndidn't decide to test the weapon himself or herself.\n  Had Kahr Arms performed background tests or drug tests on prospective \nemployees, or secured its facility to prevent theft, Danny Guzman might \nbe alive today. A Massachusetts court held that the suit states a valid \nlegal claim for negligence, but this bill would throw the case out of \ncourt, denying Danny's family their day in court.\n  Again, this is the Congress reaching into a State court and telling \nthat judge, we don't care what your law says, we don't care what 200 \nyears of legal precedent in Massachusetts or any other State in the \ncountry amounts to. This suit should be stricken, taken out, thrown \nout.\n  This legislation is sweeping and it is unprecedented. It deals a \nserious blow to citizens throughout this country, while enhancing \ndramatically the legal protections for the gun industry. Now, the \nbill's proponents repeatedly say you cannot hold someone responsible \nfor the criminal actions of another--as my colleagues have said, the \nintervening criminal actions of another.\n  First of all, that is not what this case is about. And, frankly, that \nis not the law. I am surprised that my colleagues who are attorneys \nwould come down and make such an erroneous statement about the law. A \nmemorandum by a professor at the University of Michigan Law School \npoints out that in the restatement of torts--this is as in all law--\nthis is the basic summary of the status of the law in the U.S. with \nrespect to torts. Section 449:\n\n       If the likelihood that a third person may act in a \n     particular manner is a hazard or one of the hazards which \n     makes the actor negligent, such an act, whether innocent, \n     negligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal, does not \n     prevent the actor from being liable from harm caused thereby.\n\n  This is black letter law. There is no special exemption for the \ncriminal act of another if you fail in your duty to the public. And the \nduty here with respect to Kahr Arms is to secure dangerous weapons and \nto have employees who are responsible. That is what they are being sued \nabout. They have a duty under the law for the whole community to act in \na way that will not unnecessarily cause harm to others. What should be \ndecided in a court is whether they lived up to that duty. If this \nlegislation passes, they will be denied the opportunity to determine \nwhether their duty to the community was upheld.\n\n  This is about responsibility for their actions--in this case, the \nactions of Kahr Arms Company. In the case of gun dealers, it is the \nrequirement and the obligation to take precautions, to use the standard \nof care a businessperson would use in the conduct of that business--the \nstandard of care any businessperson would use. Certainly, this standard \nof care should apply to those who manufacture weapons, who sell \nweapons, and the trade associations associated with them.\n  The allegation in all these cases is that they failed to do that--not \nthat they were unwitting, incidental victims of a criminal mind, but \nthat they failed in their duty. Bull's Eye Shooter Supply in Washington \nState, for example, who supplied the Washington snipers with their \nsniper weapon, could not account for 238 weapons. They had no idea \nwhere they were. The evidence was overwhelming that there was no \nstandard of adequate care, no effective controls on inventory. The \nowner of that gun store claimed a teenager--he didn't realize it at the \ntime--must have walked in and shoplifted an automatic weapon, a 3-foot-\nlong sniper weapon, and carried it away, undetected, during business \nhours. In fact, this was missing without his knowledge for weeks and \nmonths. That is not the standard of care the community should expect \nfrom anyone engaged in this type of business. Is that the standard of \ncare? No, it is not the standard we expect. It is particularly not the \nstandard when you are dealing with weapons that can kill people. I \nwould think most Americans on the streets, if you asked them, Would you \nsay gun dealers and manufacturers should be a little more cautious than \npeople who make other items, I think the answer would be, invariably: \nYes, of course. These are inherently dangerous products.\n  So this is not about punishing people for the criminal activities of \nothers. It is about holding individuals and corporations up to the \nstandard of conduct we expect from everybody. There are various \nexamples. Some say, my goodness, if a store sells someone a knife that \nis then used in a crime, they should not be responsible. Others have \ntalked about car dealers. But if you have the car dealer who leaves the \nkeys in a car, and they have no security, and a teenager gets into that \ncar and harms someone, certainly I think the parents of that individual \nharmed or that individual themselves could go to court and say this \ndealer didn't meet the rational standard of care of those in the \nautomobile industry. They have to secure the car and provide security.\n\n[[Page S9085]]\n\nThey cannot make them so easily available that a young person would \ntake the car and get into an accident. That applies to automobile \ndealers.\n  But if this legislation passes, common sense doesn't apply to the gun \nindustry in this country. In fact, this is a license for \nirresponsibility we are considering today. Whatever precautions they \nare taking today, because they might anticipate this type of danger and \nanticipate, perhaps, litigation, there is no incentive after today to \ntake those rudimentary precautions. There will be a race to the bottom, \nto the worst standards of the industry, to the worst operations of the \nworst operators.\n  With this bill, we are saying, in addition to your Federal firearms \nlicense, you get another license; you can be irresponsible. That is not \nto suggest all dealers and manufacturers are irresponsible. But some \nare. Those very few have landed in court--very few.\n  We talk about junk lawsuits. It is not a junk lawsuit when your \nhusband has been shot by a sniper while sitting in a bus waiting to go \nto work, to drive his bus, to service this community, to pick people up \nand get them to work. I don't think the family of Conrad Johnson \nvolunteered to be part of a social experiment. I think any suggestion \nto that effect is offensive. They have been harmed grievously. A wife \nlost her husband. Children have lost their father. The livelihood of \nthis family is in question. They seek redress, as anybody would. That \nis not a junk lawsuit.\n  On the contrary, these families have been harmed, in part, because of \nthe negligence of someone, and that someone should pay. The suggestion \nthat this legislation is in response to some avalanche of lawsuits that \nis devastating the firearms industry is without foundation. The \nindustry is so stressed that they have managed to raise, preemptively, \n$100 million to protect themselves--not just in terms of going to court \nand paying claims, but also in terms of controlling documents and \ncommunications between themselves and their attorneys, so they can \nclaim the benefits of the law, attorney-client privilege, at the same \ntime they are trying to take away the benefits of the law from average \ncitizens who have been harmed by guns. That is a stunning hypocrisy.\n  This is not an industry that seems to be without resources. As my \ncolleagues have said, and as I have said, in some of these annual \nreports to the SEC, companies have said there were adverse effects \nbecause of these suits, but ``don't worry, stockholders, we are not \nlosing any money.'' One company reported out-of-pocket costs of $4,500 \nin a period of less than a year for this type of litigation--$4,500. \nFor that, we are here on this floor to take away rights of Americans \nthey have enjoyed for over 200 years to go to court, to allege they \nhave been harmed by a negligent industry, and let a jury of their peers \ndecide it.\n  We are not facing a situation where we would be without gun \nmanufacturers because of these lawsuits. It is outlandish to suggest \nour national security is being jeopardized because we cannot find \npeople in the United States who produce firearms, and that American \ncompanies cannot stand up to this torrent of lawsuits. And the \nsuggestion that we have to turn to firearms suppliers for our military \nis rather odd. Indeed, today, many, if not most, of the suppliers for \nnational defense are the subsidiaries of foreign companies. Browning, \nWinchester, and Fabrique Nationale, which supplies M-16 A-4 assault \nrifles and the M-2 49G squad automatic weapons are subsidiaries of \nHerstal, a Belgian firm. The Pentagon contracted with H, a German \nfirm, to help develop the next generation of weapons.\n  Clearly, the Pentagon doesn't believe American manufacturers are so \ndistressed that they have to go overseas. They are going overseas \nbecause they are looking for what they consider to be the best product \nand best design. They are dealing with subsidiaries of foreign \ncompanies. The suggestion, of course, that these suits are driving \nAmerica and the Pentagon away from acquiring American-made weapons is \nludicrous.\n  It is not about preserving our defense. It has nothing to do with our \ndefense. The Pentagon is making decisions to buy foreign weapons \nbecause they believe they are better weapons. This is about protecting \none industry from the legal responsibility to exercise caution, a \nresponsibility every individual must exercise. All industries must do \nthat or, indeed, the vast majority.\n  This is not about protecting the integrity of the courts. What does \nit say to the integrity of the courts of West Virginia when a judge \nfound that a suit brought by two brave New Jersey police officers \nshould proceed, when we say: No, you are wrong, throw that case out. \nWhat will it say to Massachusetts courts if we pass this legislation \nwhen that case against Kahr Arms is thrown out the door? It will say we \nare meddling in the affairs of the courts in an unprecedented fashion. \nThankfully, Officers Lemongello and McGuire were able to settle their \nlegitimate case, but there are cases pending, and those cases have to \nbe dealt with.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this gun industry immunity bill.\n  I want to make one other point before I yield the floor. Much has \nbeen made of a letter from the Beretta Company about the danger of an \navalanche of lawsuits. If you look closely, what has happened is the \nDistrict of Columbia, their duly constituted legislative body, passed a \nstrict liability bill. The courts have upheld that. They say it is \nappropriate. That is the American system, legislators pass bills. That \nis what we are trying to do today. That is a strict liability bill, and \nthat may raise concerns with the gun industry. This bill goes way \nbeyond strict liability. It says simple negligence is out the door, and \nto conflate those two arguments does a great disservice to the accuracy \nof the truth of this debate.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we stay on the \nDefense bill and that upon completion of that bill, we go to the gun \nliability legislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, reflecting \non yesterday, if we had invoked cloture yesterday, we would have been \nable to complete the Department of Defense authorization bill. We were \nunable to invoke cloture. I made it clear at that time at some point we \nwould return to the Department of Defense authorization bill, a very \nimportant bill.\n  At the same time, we have about five pieces of legislation we have to \naddress over the next 72 hours. We need to move on, as we will shortly \ndo.\n  Also, the chairman and ranking member will have the opportunity over \nthe next few days and weeks to take these more than 200 amendments, \nlook at those amendments and see how many are absolutely necessary, \nbased on their judgment, and then we can come back and address the \nissue of defense.\n  Finally, I ask that the Democratic leader consider my request from \nyesterday so that at any time determined by the majority leader, in \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, then the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold for one second. \nThere is now before the Senate a request to stay on the Defense bill \nand finish the gun bill when the Defense bill is finished. It is my \nunderstanding the distinguished majority leader has asked to modify \nthat request so that he would be able to call up the Defense bill at \nany time he wishes; is that the way I understand the request as \nmodified?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will phrase it that at any time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate will resume consideration of the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand that. I am disappointed we are \nnot going to the Defense bill. My statement has been spread on the \nRecord consistently and repeatedly, so there is no need for me to give \nthat speech again.\n\n[[Page S9086]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, can the leader give us \nsome indication as to when we will go on the Defense authorization \nbill, as one who has an amendment and is glad to participate?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am happy to say, that is why I \nspecifically stated in my unanimous consent request ``in consultation \nwith the Democratic leader.'' Until we get through the highway bill, \nthe Energy bill, Interior appropriations, Legislative Branch \nappropriations, and gun liability, it is going to be hard for me to \npredict exactly when--plus we have a 5-week recess between now and \nthen.\n\n  The whole purpose of my unanimous consent request is I stay in touch \nthrough consultation with the Democratic leader to find the appropriate \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will not object. My feeling is, I \nregretted the fact we got off the Defense bill--particularly because of \nits importance to our national security--to go on to this gun liability \nbill. I am not going to object to the leader coming back. As one who \nhas an amendment--I know many of our colleagues were eager to focus on \nthose amendments. We will expect to hear from our leader as to when the \nleader will do that.\n  Further reserving the right to object, is it the intention of the \nleader to permit amendments to the gun liability bill so we will, now \nthat we are on that legislation, at least be able to talk about and \noffer amendments on the gun liability legislation?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is our intention--and I will be offering \nan amendment shortly--but we will be in discussions with the leadership \nand the ranking member and chairman discussing amendments and allowing \nthem to be offered accordingly in the judgment of the chairman and \nranking member and the leadership.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am not going to object to the other, \nbut that sounds to me as if--having been around and familiar with the \nrules of the Senate--they can effectively let what amendments come up \nthat are agreeable to the floor managers and deny other Members the \nopportunity to offer amendments. I think the Senate rules provide, when \nwe are dealing with cloture, to be able to offer amendments that are \nrelevant to the underlying bill. I don't understand why we are not \ngoing to be permitted the different options. I am not going to object \nto the leader being able to go to Defense authorization when he wants \nto, but it does seem to me we are facing a stacked deck here and \ndenying Members under the Senate rules the opportunity which the rules \nprovide for. It would be simple to say we are going to run \nconsideration of the gun liability according to the Senate rules. That \nwould be the answer most of us would have hoped. I guess there is a \ndifferent plan ahead for the Senate, but we all want to be fully aware \nof what that means. That means some Members will be able to get their \namendments in and others will not.\n  Mr. REID. If I can say one thing, I think it was an oversight on the \npart of the majority leader, but one of the issues we have to deal with \nbefore we leave is Native Hawaiians also.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is correct, and I was thinking the \nexact same thing when I was talking, and Department of Defense as well. \nWe have a whole range of issues. The Democratic leader knows I am in \nconstant discussion with him as to how we are going to get the business \ndone, and the fact we did not get cloture yesterday on the Department \nof Defense bill, we are moving ahead in an orderly fashion, hopefully \nin a civil way, working with the other side, through the managers on \nthe Democratic side and Republican side, with the leadership in order \nto complete the business this week.\n  Mr. President, I guess we have a modified unanimous consent request \nthat at any time determined by the majority leader, after consultation \nwith the Democratic leader, the Senate resume consideration of the \nDefense authorization bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Is there objection to the \nrequest as modified? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 2 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of S. 397.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9086-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 28, 2005\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senate will now proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 397, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 397) to prohibit civil liability actions from \n     being brought or continued against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition \n     for damages, injunctive or other relief resulting from the \n     misuse of their products by others.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday, as everyone knows, we invoked \ncloture on the motion to proceed to this underlying legislation with a \nvote of 66 to 32. Although we are now proceeding to the substance of \nthe bill, it has been made clear that the bill will be subjected to a \nfilibuster. While we respect a Senator's right to debate this \nliability, it is apparent that a cloture vote will be needed to \nultimately bring this very bipartisan bill to a final vote. For that \nreason, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close, debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 15, S. 397: A bill to prohibit civil \n     liability actions from being brought or continued against \n     manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of \n     firearms or ammunition for damages, injunctive or other \n     relief resulting from the misuse of their products by others.\n         Bill Frist, George Allen, Larry E.

Mr. President, this vote can technically ripen as early as \n1 a.m., not tomorrow but the next day, Friday morning. I am not certain \nat this point if we will vote then or later that morning. I will \ncontinue and want to continue to consult with my colleagues on the \nschedule.\n  As we just discussed on the Senate floor, we have a lot of business \nto accomplish over the next several days. We have the energy conference \nreport, the highway conference report, the Interior bill, the veterans \nhealth money attached, a number of nominations. Therefore, I hope that \nwhen cloture is invoked, we can find a way to bring this bill to a \nfinal vote so that we can expedite some of these other very important \nissues.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1605\n\n  Having said that, I now send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for Mr. Craig, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1605.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                   (Purpose: To amend the exceptions)\n\n       On page 10, line 5, strike ``or'' and all that follows \n     through line 16 and insert the following:\n       (v) an action for death, physical injuries or property \n     damage resulting directly from a defect in design or \n     manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a \n     reasonably foreseeable manner, except that where the \n     discharge of the product was caused by a volitional act that \n     constituted a criminal offense then such act shall be \n     considered the sole proximate cause of any resulting death, \n     personal injuries or property damage; or\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1606 to Amendment No. 1605\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I now send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1606 to amendment No. 1605.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will read the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To make clear that the bill does not apply to actions \n commenced by the Attorney General to enforce the Gun Control Act and \n                         National Firearms Act)\n\n       At the end, insert the following:\n       (vi) an action or proceeding commenced by the Attorney \n     General to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of title 18, \n     United States Code, or chapter 53 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the actions that have just taken place have \nput us on S. 397, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. \nEarlier this morning, I submitted for the Record some now 67 \ncosponsors, which demonstrates that this bill is clearly very \nbipartisan legislation, supported by a Republican and Democrat majority \nin the Senate.\n  The actions the leader has just taken to file cloture would allow the \ncloture motion to ripen by as early as 1 a.m. Friday morning. \nAmendments have just been filed by the leader, and we will begin the \nprocess of debate on this important legislation.\n  With that in mind, if this bill and this debate seem familiar to any \nof us,\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\nit should, because the Senate debated a very similar measure a little \nover a year ago. At that time, we had a full debate over a number of \ndays. It is worth noting that the Senate defeated every amendment \naddressing the actual substance of the bill. However, opponents \nsucceeded in attaching a couple of unrelated poison-pill amendments \nthat ultimately caused the bill to fail.\n  The need for this legislation is very real. Over the course of \nyesterday and today, some of us have expressed what we believe is the \nurgency of this legislation. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct would stop junk lawsuits that attempt to pin the blame and the cost \nof criminal behavior on businesspeople who are following the law and \nselling a legal product. In fact, the one consumer product where access \nis protected by nothing less than our Constitution itself is our \nfirearms, and that is exactly what is at stake today: the right of law-\nabiding American consumers, American citizens, to have access to a \nrobust and productive marketplace in the effective manufacturing and \nsale of firearms.\n  This bill responds to a series of lawsuits filed primarily by \nmunicipalities to shift the financial burden for criminal violence onto \nthe law-abiding business community. These suits are based on a variety \nof legal theories. We heard some of them expressed by opposition to \nthis bill earlier in the day seeking to hold gun manufacturers and \nsellers liable for the cost of injuries caused by people over whom they \nhave no control--criminals who choose to use firearms illegally.\n  This is a bipartisan bill, as I mentioned. Let me acknowledge my \nprimary Democrat sponsor, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, and thank him \nfor his work on this initiative. Senator Baucus and I introduced this \nbill in February, and more than half of the Senate, both Republicans \nand Democrats, have now joined us since it was formally introduced in \nits final form.\n  Earlier in the day, I inserted into the Record all of those who are \nnow cosponsors. This range of cosponsorship reflects extraordinary, \nwidespread support that crosses party and demographic lines and covers \nthe spectrum of political ideologies represented in the Senate. It \ndemonstrates a strong commitment by a majority of this body to take a \nstand against a trend toward predatory litigation that impugns the \nintegrity of our courts, threatens a domestic industry that is critical \nto our national defense, jeopardizes hundreds of thousands of good-\npaying jobs of hard-working men and women across America, and puts at \nrisk the access Americans have to a legal product used for hundreds of \nyears across the Nation for lawful purposes such as recreation and, \nmost important, self-defense.\n  I have used the term ``junk lawsuits,'' and I wish to make very clear \nto everyone listening to this debate that I do not mean any disrespect \nin any way whatsoever to the victims of gun violence who might be \ninvolved in these actions. Although their names are sometimes used in \nthese lawsuits, they are not the people who came up with the notion of \ngoing after the industry instead of going after the criminals \nresponsible for the injuries or the loss of life of their loved ones. \nThat notion originated with bureaucrats, anti-gun advocates and the \nlawyers who work with them.\n  Victims, including their families and communities, deserve our \nsupport and compassion, not to mention our insistence on an aggressive \nlaw enforcement effort that puts punishment where it ought to be \nrendered--to the criminal.\n  In the nearly 6 years of the Bush administration, death by guns and \ncrime in which guns were used in the commission of that crime have \nplummeted. Why? Because this Justice Department has gone after the \ncriminal and not the law-abiding citizen.\n  It is the criminal who acts illegally. It is the criminal who ought \nto be prosecuted. But somehow, some who are involved in this movement \nhave a tremendously distorted idea that the person who produces a legal \nproduct and sells that legal product somehow is responsible because \nthey just should have known that product might fall into the hands of a \ncriminal and might cost someone their life.\n  If those laws need to be toughened or if law enforcement efforts need \nto be improved, then the proper source of help is legislators and \ngovernments to ensure the tightening of the laws and not the courts and \ncertainly not law-abiding businesses or workers who had nothing to do \nwith those who were victimized by the criminal element of this country.\n  No. These junk lawsuits do not target the responsible party in those \nterrible crimes. This is predatory legislation, looking for a \nconvenient deep pocket to pay for somebody else's criminal behavior, \nand by every definition it therefore deserves to be called a junk \nlawsuit. If one wants to stand on the floor and defend that kind of \naction in the courts of America, so be it. I believe in the democratic \nprocess. But Americans get it, they clearly understand it, and so do \nSenators, and that is why now 67 Senators support this legislation. \nThese are junk lawsuits because they are driven for political motives \nto hobble or bankrupt the gun industry as a way of controlling guns.\n  For decades, anti-gunners have come to the Senate floor or the House \nwith one scheme or one idea after another, and the American people, \nbased on what they believe strongly to be their constitutional rights, \nhave rejected this. Now the anti-gun community attempts once again to \ncome through the back door of the Congress by going in through the \nfront door of the courthouse. It simply has not worked, and it will not \nwork.\n  But there is another motive in mind. By definition, the legislation \nwe are considering today aims to stop lawsuits that are trying to force \nthe gun industry to pay for the crimes of people over whom they have no \ncontrol.\n  I used an analogy last year. I will use it again today. It is like \nsaying to GM, General Motors, or any car manufacturer that because \nsomebody buys their car and gets drunk and gets in that car and kills \nsomeone out on the road, gee whiz, they should have known that a drunk \nwould drive that car, and therefore they should never have produced it, \nand therefore they are liable. For years, I have always understood that \nthere are some in our society who say no one is responsible for their \naction, no one should be held responsible for their action, and that is \nan underlying core of the debate we are talking about or the issue we \nare talking about today.\n  Let me stop a minute and make sure everyone understands the limited \nnature of the bill. Some will argue it differently, but I would argue \nthose who argue it differently are trying to expand the definition of \nwhat we believe to be very clear within the legislation. What this bill \ndoes not do is as important as what it does do. This is not a gun \nindustry immunity bill. I think I have already heard that said since \nthe clock tolled 12 noon. This bill does not create a legal shield for \nanybody who manufactures or sells a firearm. It does not protect \nmembers of the gun industry from every lawsuit or legal action that \ncould be filed against them. It does not prevent them from being sued \nfor their own misconduct.\n\n  This bill only stops one extremely narrow category of lawsuits, \nlawsuits that attempt to force the gun industry to pay for the crimes \nof third parties over whom they have no control. We have tried to make \nthat limitation as clear as we possibly can and in several ways. For \ninstance, section 2(b) of the bill says its No. 1 purpose is:\n\n     to prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers and importers of firearms or ammunition \n     products and their trade associations for the harm solely \n     caused by the criminal or unlawful use or misuse of firearms \n     products or ammunition products by others when the product \n     functions as designed and intended.\n\n  We have also tried to make the bill's narrow purpose clear by \ndefining the kind of lawsuit that is prohibited. Section 5 defines the \none and only kind of action prohibited by this bill as follows:\n\n       [A] . . . civil action or proceeding or an administrative \n     proceeding brought by any person against a manufacturer or \n     seller of a qualified product, or a trade association, for \n     damages, punitive damages, injunctive or declaratory relief, \n     abatement, restitution, fines, or penalties, or other relief \n     resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified \n     product by the person or a third party. . . .\n\n  We have also tried to make the narrow scope of the bill clear by \nlisting specific kinds of lawsuits that are not prohibited. Section 5 \nsays they include actions for harm resulting from defects\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\nin the firearm itself when used as intended--in other words, a faulty \nproduct--that is, product liability suits; actions based on negligence \nor negligent entrustment; or breach of contract.\n  Furthermore, if someone has been convicted under title 18, section \n924(h) of the U.S. Code or comparable State law--in plain English, that \nmeans someone who has been convicted of transferring a firearm knowing \nthat the gun will be used in the commission of a crime of violence or \ndrug trafficking--that individual is not shielded from civil lawsuits \nby anybody harmed by that firearm transfer.\n  I am not quite sure how much more clearly we can make the law.\n  Finally, this bill does not protect any member of the gun industry \nfrom lawsuits for harm resulting from any illegal actions they have \ncommitted. Let me repeat it. If a gun dealer or manufacturer violates \nthe law, this bill is not going to protect them from a lawsuit brought \nagainst them for harm resulting from that misconduct. Section 5 further \nexplains that this includes, but is not limited to, the situation in \nwhich these parties falsify the firearms records they are required to \nkeep under Federal or State law or knowingly fail to make appropriate \nentries into those records or if they worked with others in making \nfalse statements about the lawfulness of the selling of firearms.\n  You will hear arguments on the floor about certain gun dealers and \nthat we are now holding them harmless, even though on the surface of \nthe argument it appears they violated the law. Let me again say, as I \nsaid, if in any way they violate State or Federal law or alter or fail \nto keep records that are appropriate as it relates to their \ninventories, they are in violation of law. This bill does not shield \nthem, as some would argue. Quite the contrary. If they have violated \nexisting law, they violated the law, and I am referring to the Federal \nfirearms laws that govern a licensed firearm dealer and that govern our \nmanufacturers today.\n  Another example of conduct that would not be shielded from a civil \nlawsuit under this bill is the case in which the manufacturer or seller \naided, abetted or conspired with any other person to sell firearms or \nammunition if they knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the \npurchaser intended to use those products for the furtherance of a \ncrime.\n  How clear can you get? If a manufacturer or a federally licensed \nfirearms dealer knew they were selling to somebody who had criminal \nintent in mind for the use of the weapon, the firearm they just \npurchased, they are in violation of the law and it does not protect \nthem. This is not a shield to do just that.\n  What I have listed for the convenience of my colleagues is all \nspelled out in title V of the bill. For those who question it, read it. \nIf you don't understand it, get your lawyer and read it again because \nwe worked overtime to make this as clear as it possibly can be made. \nAgain, this is a rundown of the universe of lawsuits against members of \nthe firearms industry that would not be stopped by this narrowly \ntargeted bill.\n  What all these nonprohibited lawsuits have in common is that they \ninvolve actual misconduct or wrongful actions of some sort by a gun \nmanufacturer, a seller or a trade association. Whether you support or \noppose the bill, I think you can all agree that individuals should not \nbe shielded from the legal repercussions of their own lawless acts. The \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act expressly does not provide \nsuch a shield.\n  I am going to repeat this because some opponents continue to \nmischaracterize the bill. My guess is, in the closing arguments on \nFriday of this week, that mischaracterization will continue. This is \nnot a gun industry immunity bill. It prohibits one kind of lawsuit, a \nsuit trying to fix the blame of a third party's criminal acts or \nmisdeeds on the manufacturer or the seller of the firearm used in that \ncrime.\n  Even though this is a narrowly focused bill, it is an extremely \nimportant one. The junk lawsuits we are addressing today would reverse \na longstanding legal principle in this country, and that principle is \nthat manufacturers of products are not responsible for the criminal \nmisuse of those products. You don't have to be a lawyer to know that \nrunaway juries and activist judges can turn common sense on its head in \na lot of cases, setting precedents that have dramatic repercussions and \nare potentially devastating in their results.\n  If a gun manufacturer is held liable for the harm done by a criminal \nwho misuses a gun, then there is nothing to stop the manufacturers of \nany product used in crimes from having to bear the costs resulting from \nthe actions of those criminals. So as I mentioned earlier, automobile \nmanufacturers will have to take the blame for the death of a bystander \nwho gets in the way of the drunk driver. The local hardware store will \nhave to be held responsible for a kitchen knife it sold, if later that \nknife is used in the commission of a rape. The baseball team whose bat \nwas used to bludgeon a victim will have to pay the cost of the crime. \nThe list goes on and on.\n\n  Did that sound silly? Tragically enough, some lawyers and some \nactivist judges and some runaway juries have taken us in those \ndirections in the past. That is why we constantly, in the Congress, \ntalk about tort reform, trying to narrow it, trying to make it more \nclear--still recognizing that law-abiding citizens have their rights \nand should not in any way be jeopardized in the legal sense from their \nconstitutional right to go to court. At the same time, I don't think \nany of us believed that the court system of America would be gamed the \nway it has been gamed or that we would see the myriad of junk lawsuits \nthat are being filed today and the venue shopping that continues to go \non.\n  It is not just unfair to hold law-abiding businesses and workers \nresponsible for criminal misconduct with the products they have made \nand sell, but this would also bring havoc to our marketplace. Hold onto \nyour wallets, America, because those businesses will have to pass those \ncosts directly on to the consumer if they plan to stay in business. \nWorse, some of those businesses will not be able to pass on those costs \nand still stay competitive. For some of them, this will mean layoffs, \nand ultimate bankruptcies, and the closure of the manufacturer's door.\n  We have already seen this in some of the firearm industry. In fact, \nthese lawsuits have the potential to bankrupt the gun industry, even if \nthey are not successful.\n  How could that be? The sheer cost of litigation, the repetitive \nfiling of laws, the need to defend those lawsuits literally costs \nhundreds of millions of dollars. It is important to keep in mind that \nthe deep pocket of the gun industry is not all that deep. In hearings \nbefore the House of Representatives, experts testified that the sales \nof the firearms industry taken together would not equal those of a \nsingle Fortune 500 company.\n  Why would I say that? People think this is a monolithic, large \nindustry. It is not. It is a lot of small businesses, small \nmanufacturers. In other words, all of them combined in America today \nwould not equal one Fortune 500 company.\n  As of this year, it was estimated--and we can only estimate because \nthe cost of litigation is confidential business information--that these \nbaseless lawsuits have cost the firearms industry more than $250 \nmillion. Half of them have already been thrown out of court. \nFurthermore, don't think these companies can pass the costs off to \ntheir insurers because in nearly every case insurance carriers have \ndenied coverage.\n  The impact on innocent workers and communities is not the only \npotential repercussion of these lawsuits. If U.S. firearms \nmanufacturers close their doors, where will our military and our peace \nofficers go to obtain their guns? As my colleagues know, the United \nStates of America is the only major world power that does not have a \ngovernment-run firearms factory. This is a little known fact but a \nreality. Yet last year we purchased more than 200,000 small arms for \nour soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. The very same companies \nthat supply our troops in the war on terrorism, both abroad and here at \nhome, are the targets of these reckless lawsuits that could force them \nto close their doors.\n  Some would say: Oh, gee, we buy some of our arms already from foreign \ncountries.\n  Yes, we do. Does that mean that is where we should buy all of them; \nthat we should be dependent on foreign\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\ncountries for the supply of firearms to our military? Surely we do not \nwant foreign suppliers to control our national defense and community \nlaw enforcement--not to mention the ability of individual American \ncitizens to exercise their second amendment-protected rights through \naccessing firearms for self-defense, recreation or other lawful \npurposes.\n  For all of those reasons, more than 30 States have laws on the books \noffering some protection for the gun industry from these extraordinary \nthreats. Support has already grown in Congress to take action at the \nFederal level. The House has passed this measure several times. The \nSenate is now attempting to do so.\n  This would not be the first time Congress acted to prevent a threat \non an industry. Some would wring their hands and say: Oh, dare not, \ndare not change the Federal law; dare not, in some way offer some \nprotection. But let me tell you this is not the first time, and my \nguess is, with the courts and the trial bar where it is, it will not be \nthe last.\n  For example, there are a number of Members in this Chamber who were \nserving in Congress when the General Aviation Revitalization Act was \npassed barring product liability suits against manufacturers of planes \nmore than 18 years ago. Just a few years ago in the Homeland Security \nAct, Congress placed limits on the liability of a half a dozen \nindustries, including the manufacturers of smallpox vaccine and the \nsellers of antiterrorism technology.\n  These are only a couple of examples of a significant list of Federal \ntort reform measures that have been enacted over the years when \nCongress perceived a need to protect a specific sector of our economy \nor our defense interests from the burdensome, unfair and, as I believe, \nfrivolous litigation of the kind we see today.\n  It is high time we act to stop this threat to our courts, our \ncommunities, our economy, and, yes, to our defense.\n  I have heard some Senators talking about loading up this bill with \npolitical amendments that have nothing whatsoever to do with the \nlegislation. Let me say right here and now these are killer amendments. \nMany of them know that. That is why they are trying to place them.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the underlying legislation. It is well \nwritten, it is thoroughly vetted with all of the interested parties. I \nask my colleagues to look at it as they have already looked at it--in a \nvery strong, bipartisan way. Here now in the Senate a supermajority, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, supports this legislation. I hope they \nwould resist the kinds of amendments that are obviously intended to \ndrag this bill down once again. Some attempted it last year, and they \nwere successful in doing so. I hope those who have signed on as \ncosponsors are sincere in their support of the bill, as I believe they \nare, and they will allow us to move it through the process over the \nnext several days in a clean and effective way.\n  Our courts are supposed to be a forum to redress wrongs, not enact \npolitical agendas. How many times has the anti-gun community been \nrejected by the American public through the voice of their Senator or \nthrough the voice of their Congress men and women? Time and time again. \nAnd yet because of their political alignment and their philosophical \nbent, they stay at the issue even though clearly and profoundly we have \ndescribed it as and believe it to be a constitutional right of an \nAmerican citizen to own a firearm. Well, because they have not been \nsuccessful at the doorsteps of Congress, they have turned to the doors \nof the courtroom. Lawsuits are being filed. Lawsuits are being \nrejected. Thousands upon thousands of dollars are used in legal fees to \nprepare the arguments. New and inventive ways are approached: Let's try \nthis angle, let's try that angle. Surely we can get to the deep pocket.\n  I am also amazed at those who would not suggest that American \ncitizens are responsible for their own actions, and most assuredly the \ncriminal element ought to be. We have watched some administrations walk \none direction. But I tell you where this administration is. It believes \nthe criminal element ought to be prosecuted. And guess what happened in \nAmerica when we started prosecuting the criminal element and putting \nthem behind bars. Crime began to go down very rapidly. The streets of \nAmerica and the communities of America became safer places because \nthose who would violate the law and, more importantly, those who use a \ngun in the commission of a crime get locked up. That is gun control in \nthe right sense. That is gun control that a majority of the American \npeople support and that the Congress has continually supported.\n  This legislation, as I have mentioned, is clear. It is well defined, \nand it is narrow by its action. We believe that is why a bipartisan \nmajority now supports it and why it deserves to become the law of the \nland, so we don't have venue-seeking, politically minded efforts to \nignore the criminal element in the zealous support or approach to gun \ncontrol but to go after the law-abiding citizen who either manufactures \nthe firearm or sells it under a Federal firearms license.\n  That is the essence of S. 397, and I hope as we work through this \nbill, the clarity of that issue comes forward.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Idaho makes it very \nclear what seems to be going on now. I heard a few moments ago the \nmajority leader's response to Senator Kennedy, saying there would be an \nopportunity to present amendments, to debate this bill. I would also \nnote that prior to any other action, cloture was filed on this bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Obviously, I have an amendment on the floor now, or I \nshould say an amendment that was filed by Leader Frist. Under \nappropriate consultation, it is very possible there are a variety of \namendments that could come to the floor prior to the ripening of the \ncloture motion. To now immediately move to that without consultation \nwith the floor leader, myself, is something I will object to, and the \nSenator understands that. So let us not be tactical here. Let us work \nand cooperate. I am very happy to look at any amendments----\n\n  Mr. REED. If I may reclaim my time----\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator might have, but with that, my objection still \nstands until full consultation is brought, full cooperation is sought. \nI thank you.\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, I thank the Senator.\n  This amendment has been shared with the majority. It has been \nreviewed by the majority. We are not attempting to surprise anyone with \nthis amendment. It deals with child safety locks. In fact, it is an \namendment that was offered to the bill last year and passed \noverwhelmingly. It is my intent to provide opportunity to discuss \nissues with respect to gun legislation and to present them to the \nSenate.\n  Again, I would note when the majority leader requested unanimous \nconsent to lay aside one of his amendments to offer another amendment, \nno one on my side objected because in fact we thought we were \nproceeding in good faith, that we shared amendments if we had an \nopportunity to look at the amendments beforehand, that we could proceed \nin an orderly and reasonable fashion. But I am a bit shocked. This \namendment has been with the majority for the last, I would suggest, 30 \nor 40 minutes. It is an amendment that was presented in substance \nbefore to the floor. So I am a little bit surprised about the Senator's \nreaction.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Last year this amendment was offered by Senator Boxer, \nmodified by Senator Kohl, and passed the Senate. We are examining the \namendment now. We have only had it for 30 minutes or less. The Senator \nis absolutely right. And the amendment is substantively the same, but \nthere are some differences in it. We are analyzing to see what those \ndifferences might be.\n  So, you see, there was a basis for my objection--until we clearly \nunderstand it. I think the agreement the Senator\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\nwas speaking to was one based on the exact amendment of Senator Kohl of \na year ago. So let us examine what those changes might be in the \namendment and then there may be no objection on this side. But until \nthat time I believe we have adequate time here to resolve the issue, \nand my objection would have to stand.\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, again, I appreciate the Senator's \ncomments with respect to the amendment, but once again I think we \nprovided you the opportunity to look at the amendment.\n  There are several issues here. The first issue is whether you think \nit would be appropriate to support and vote for it, which presumptively \ncomes after debate. But the first issue is allowing us to offer the \namendment. You might very well object to the substance of the \namendment. You might very well urge our colleagues to reject it. I \nrespect that. But the right to deny the amendment since you object goes \nagainst what the majority leader said in how we conduct this debate.\n  I will make a few comments now in general and I hope perhaps during \nthe course of my comments the review of the amendment would allow us to \nformally offer it.\n  Again, there have been some comments about these junk lawsuits. These \ncomments might have some resonance in this Chamber, but I doubt if we \nwere talking to the widow of Conrad Johnson we would have the temerity \nto say the suit she filed on behalf of the family was a junk lawsuit. \nOr if you had a working man, someone sitting in his bus seat in the \nearly morning having a cup of coffee and reading the paper--and when I \nread about that, it reminded me of what my father did every day as a \nschool custodian. He would get up in the morning, read the paper, have \na cup of coffee either at the school or someplace else, in the \nkitchen--and then suddenly his life was ended by snipers, leaving a \nwife and children. Then they find after the tragic incident the weapon \nwas obtained by the snipers because, in my view, of the \nincontrovertible evidence of gross negligence, 230 or more weapons \nmisplaced by the dealer, not realizing that a teenage boy walked into \nhis gun shop and took a 3-foot assault weapon off the counter and \nwalked out. That is not negligence?\n  Oh, and, by the way, because we were able to stop this legislation \nlast year and because in that case the defendant recognized that if \nthey went to a jury of 12 Americans sitting and deciding whether they \nwere responsible in their actions, they settled.\n  That is not a junk lawsuit. Is it a junk lawsuit when two police \nofficers are called to a violent scene and find themselves in a \ncrossfire, find themselves critically injured, brought to a hospital, \ngiven their last rites, and then it is discovered the weapon that \nharmed them was purchased by a straw purchaser? Or that an individual \nwalked in with a female companion, pointed out the guns, bought 12 of \nthem at one time for cash, had her buy them because he could not pass a \nweapons background check, jumped in a car, took off--in fact, so \nobviously that the dealer called the ATF and said I took the money, \ngave them guns, but watch out. Negligence.\n  Both those lawsuits would have been stopped by this legislation. \nThose are not frivolous suits. Those are examples of people being hurt, \npolice officers, bus drivers, through the negligence of gun dealers and \ngun manufacturers.\n  There is this constant refrain, the law is clear, the law is clear, \nwe can't blame someone else for criminal activities, when in fact the \nlaw is quite clear on this point. I mentioned it before. What is the \nlaw of the United States? Well, in terms of tort law these laws are \nsummarized, updated constantly in what is known as restatement. \nBasically it is a catalog of different positions of the law. Everyone \nknows it. Everyone coming to the floor, having passed a bar in one \nState of this country, knows the restatement basically says what is the \nsettled law, the settled law with respect to criminal activity. I will \nread it again.\n  Section 449 of the Restatement Second of Torts:\n\n       If the likelihood that a third person may act in a \n     particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which \n     makes the actor negligent, such an act, whether innocent, \n     negligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal does not \n     prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby.\n\n  What does that mean? It means you have a duty to the public to take \ncertain steps, and if you don't take those steps, even if in the chain \nof causation there is a criminal act by another party, you are still \nliable--not for that criminal act, you are still liable because you \nfailed in your duty.\n  What this bill does is--this great talk about responsibility--it says \neveryone is responsible except the gun industry. Automobile \nmanufacturers are responsible. In fact, when we get in our vehicles and \ndrive home tonight, we are all going to benefit because years ago under \nthe laws of tort and negligence, automobile companies were forced to \nimprove the safety of their vehicles for the protection of the public. \nNow the logic that, oh, they can't be held liable for this because no \none intends to crash the car, well, that is right; no one intends to \ncrash an automobile, but if the design of the automobile is defective, \nif there are safety precautions that could be taken, those have to be \nadopted because they have a duty to the public to provide a safe \nproduct, to avoid obvious dangers.\n  This is a situation in which we have the obligation to take steps. So \nthis notion about criminal intervening activities is not the law. That \nis not what the black letter law of this country says. The idea that \nmanufacturers are not subject to the common obligation or duty to \nprovide safe products, even if they are not required by statute, that \nis not the law either.\n  There is also a deliberate attempt to confuse two very different \nprinciples. We have criminal laws, we have regulations, we have \nstatutes that require certain behavior. They define a range of \nactivities that are impermissible. What this bill says is, if you \nviolate a law, one of those aspects of impermissible behavior, yes, \nmaybe you can sue a gun manufacturer. But there is a whole other range \nof activities--accidents, unreasonable behaviors--that are not defined \nby law. They are not the criminal, but they do involve opportunities \nunder civil litigation to go to court and say this person acted \nunreasonably. They did not technically violate a statute. They acted \nunreasonably.\n  This statute essentially says, by and large, you can show they \nviolated a very narrowly drawn legislative enactment or statute--they \nfailed to fill out a record, et cetera--yes, maybe you can go to court.\n  What about all the cases we have talked about, the cases of the straw \npurchaser where weapons were sold and, obviously, to the casual \nobserver, in a very peculiar way. Why didn't that fellow, I believe, in \nSouth Carolina, who is buying the pistols that eventually wounded \nofficers Lamongello and McGuire, why didn't he offer his name? He \nobviously was picking out the weapon. Why did they buy 12 at one time? \nThere is no law against buying 12 weapons at one time. Isn't it curious \nthat would happen?\n  Again, we have a situation where this legislation has been carefully \nworked out to stop these lawsuits. Not the frivolous lawsuits, all \nlawsuits except under very narrow circumstances. And those \ncircumstances do not seem to apply to the cases that have been filed. \nThe exceptions would not have kept alive a suit by Officers Lamongello \nand McGuire or by the families of the victims of the Washington, DC, \nsnipers or in the situation of Danny Guzman and Kahr Arms. That is more \nthan coincidental. It is very deliberate.\n  Again, as I mentioned before, this legislation can't be the panacea \nfor the gun industry, the one touted by the NRA, as we have to have \nthis on one hand, and then allow all the good suits there, the really \ngood suits, the ones, in fact, that have been filed. And it is not. It \nis designed to stop practically every attempt to be compensated for the \nnegligence of a manufacturer, a gun dealer, or a trade association.\n  All of the particular aspects of the bill provide some window \ndressing--it sounds good, section XYZ of the United States Code--but \nwhen it doesn't work in practice, that is all it is. This explosion of \nsuits, where are they? A small number of suits filed in this country \ninvolve anything covered by this legislation. The cost to the industry? \nThis cost goes up $50 million every day we are here talking about it.\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\n  What we know for a fact is that the industry has pooled $100 million \nto protect themselves, preemptively, to ensure that the communications \nare covered by the attorney-client privilege, to ensure that doctors \nare all centralized so they cannot easily be accessed because of \nattorney-client privilege. They are using our system of civil justice \nin the courts very well to protect themselves. They are unwilling to \nlet others use the same devices to protect themselves.\n  This great surge of lawsuits, as was indicated before many times in \nthe Senate, financial reports filed with the SEC, many of the companies \nare privately held so only few report publicly, indicate to their \nshareholders there is no material financial risk involved with these \nsuits by municipalities or individual litigants. The litigation costs \nout of pocket for one of these publicly reporting companies is about \n$4,500 in the last several months. Hardly a crisis.\n  And then there is the suggestion that our defense will be imperiled. \nAs I pointed out in my opening remarks, voluntarily the Defense \nDepartment is contracting with foreign manufacturers. It is not because \nof lawsuits. In fact, I don't know what the status is of the civil law \nin Europe, but I would be surprised if it was more lenient than our \nlaws at present, but they are doing it because they want better \nweapons.\n  I can recall as I entered the Army in 1967, the Colt .45 automatic \nwas the side arm of the U.S. Army and had been since the Philippine \ninsurrection in 1903. Now it is a Beretta Italian model produced by an \nAmerican subsidiary, wholly owned subsidiary of an Italian company, and \nnot, I don't believe, by a national armory of the Italian Government. \nThey are a privately held company.\n  This notion that this has anything to do with the national defense is \nunsupported, unsubstantiated by any fact and by the behavior of the \nPentagon. They are not coming to us and asking us for this bill so they \ncan keep alive the necessary firearms manufacturers in the United \nStates. They have made a conscious choice for many reasons to go \noverseas to buy these weapons.\n  Again, I am in a situation where we are attempting to reach into the \ncourts of each State of the United States and tell them that their \nlegislatures--that propound many of these rules with respect to civil \nliability--cannot do that. What can be more antidemocratic than that? \nThen, going to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and saying: You know, \nthose laws and rules you passed about liability? Can't do that. We \ndon't like it. Or the gun industry doesn't like it.\n  The case most frequently cited to suggest a crisis is the result of \nthe deliberations of the Washington, DC, council that passed a strict \nliability bill. That bill was upheld by the DC Court of Appeals. The DC \nCourt of Appeals did not create a rule of strict liability. They said, \nessentially, the democratic process is working. Elected representatives \nof the people decided that would be the rule. As a court we cannot step \nin and overturn that. That is democracy. Of course, we are deciding we \ncan step in and overturn the rules of 50 States. That is \nantidemocratic.\n  This legislation is going to deny people who have been hurt the right \nto bring their case. They might not succeed. As my colleagues have \npointed out, many of these cases have been turned down because they \ncould not show that the duty owed to the public was violated by the \nparticular manufacturer or gun dealer. But they have the right now to \nmake that showing. We are taking that right away from them. This right \nis something that I would think we all would protect, not try to \ncircumscribe and deny, and you cannot go into court with a theoretical \ncomplaint saying: I do not like the law; make new law, Your Honor. You \nhave to have a case. You have to show harm. You have to show what the \nduty of the defendant was, how that duty was breached, and how that \nbreach caused the harm.\n  That is the way our system works. But not after this legislation \npasses. You can have the duty, you can have a breach of that duty, and \nyou can have grievous harm. But the victim cannot go to court. It is \nnot about an avalanche of lawsuits. There are a minuscule number of \nsuits filed in this regard. It is not about courts out of control. In \nsome sense it is Congress out of control, saying to State governments, \nwe don't care what the State rules are, we are making the rule.\n  We should be able not only to talk about but to offer amendments. I \nhope in the intervening time we have had to analyze the amendments that \nwe could offer amendments and talk about them. I hope that is the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will submit for the Record a letter from \nBeretta U.S.A. Corporation that the Senator just mentioned as an \nItalian subsidiary, fully owned U.S. corporation. It is a significant \nletter because it effectively refutes almost all of what the Senator \nhas said. I say that in this respect. It is true everything the Senator \nhas said, and that is not in dispute as it relates to who Beretta is \nand what they do. They make the standard sidearm for U.S. Armed Forces, \nand they have had a long-term contract right now to supply this pistol \nto our fighting forces in Iraq. These pistols have been used \nextensively in combat during the current campaign, just as they have \nbeen used since the adoption of the Armed Forces in 1985.\n  Beretta U.S.A. also supplies pistols to law enforcement departments \nthroughout the United States, including the Maryland State Police, Los \nAngeles City Police Department, and Chicago Police Department.\n  But here is what is significant about Beretta. What Beretta says is \nexactly what the Senator refuses to recognize. The decision by the \nDistrict Court of Appeals to uphold the DC strict liability statute as \nthey have in the case of DC v. Beretta U.S.A. has the likelihood of \nbankrupting not only Beretta U.S.A. but every manufacturer of \nsemiautomatic pistols and rifles since 1991.\n  The letter to this administration, to Vice President Dick Cheney, \ngoes on to say:\n\n       There are hundreds of homicides committed with firearms \n     each year in D.C. and additional hundreds of injuries \n     involving criminal misuse of firearms. No firearm \n     manufacturer has the resources to defend itself against \n     hundreds of lawsuits each year and, if that company's pistol \n     or rifle is determined to have been used in a criminal \n     shooting in the District, these companies do not have the \n     resources to pay the resultant judgment against them in which \n     they would have no defense if the pistol or rifle was \n     originally sold to a civilian consumer.\n\n  That is the essence of a lawsuit that has just been decided in the \nDistrict.\n  Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield, I notice you read the letter, \nbut the subject of that letter is strict liability, which in layman's \nterms--and I will consider myself a layman--means that there is no real \njudgment about the behavior of the defendants; that if they can prove \nit was a weapon manufactured by Beretta, and it was involved in a \ncrime, they would be liable without a showing of duty or negligence and \nwhether they took rational and reasonable steps. That is what strict \nliability is.\n  There is a difference between strict liability and negligence. The \nlegislation we are considering is not about strict liability alone. It \nis about negligence. It goes way beyond that letter. If we were \ndebating legislation that said essentially a company may not be held \nstrictly liable for X, Y, and Z, this would be a different debate \nentirely.\n  This legislation goes way beyond strict liability. It says that \nnegligence cases, those that you must show that, in fact, the \nmanufacturer or the dealer had a duty and unreasonably failed to \nperform that duty, that is what you have to show. In fact, I think I \naccurately represented what was in the letter.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I did not say you didn't.\n  Mr. REED. I appreciate that. I do. But the point is we are taking a \nlegal theory of strict liability, which they are upset about, \nobviously, and concerned about, but it does not translate to this bill. \nNone of these cases I talked about--Lemongello or the case with respect \nto Guzman--is arguing these manufacturers or sellers are strictly \nliable. They are saying, essentially--now there might be other cases--\nbut they are saying, essentially, they had a duty, they were negligent.\n  This legislation we are debating today would wipe away their rights \nto make a negligence claim. So I agree entirely with the letter in \nterms of its accuracy. That is what they are talking about. They are \nconcerned about it.\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\n  Frankly, if I were the general counsel of Beretta, I would be \nconcerned about it. It might not move me to do the same thing they are \nsuggesting. But we have to be very clear about this legislation, which \ngoes way beyond the strict liability. Again, if we were talking about \nlimiting strict liability suits, this would be an entirely different \ndebate. I do not think I would necessarily agree, but certainly I would \nbe looking at an almost entirely different subject matter.\n  I thank the Senator for being extremely kind in yielding me time and \nalso being extremely accurate in summarizing my views.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Let me read another paragraph from that letter, which I think clearly \nspells out the fear that my colleague would wish to step aside from and \nargue that is simply not the case. He is dealing with a strict \nliability statute.\n  This paragraph says:\n\n       Passed in 1991, the D.C. statute had not been used until \n     the District of Columbia recently filed a lawsuit against the \n     firearm industry in an attempt to hold the firearm makers, \n     importers and distributors liable for the cost of criminal \n     gun misuse in the District. Although the Court of Appeals \n     (sitting en banc in the case D.C. v. Beretta U.S.A. et al.) \n     dismissed many parts of the case, it affirmed the D.C. strict \n     liability statute and, moreover, ruled that victims of gun \n     violence can sue firearm manufacturers simply to determine \n     whether that company's firearm was used in the victim's \n     shooting.\n\n  Now, does that take away the costs involved in the preparation, the \nhundreds of millions of dollars that are now being spent? No, it does \nnot. This was a frivolous lawsuit from the beginning. It was clearly \nintended. And that is what the district court said. The District of \nColumbia did not hide it. They were after the industry because they \nbelieved the industry had produced the gun that the criminal used in \nthe commission of a crime.\n  So it goes on. I submit this letter for the Record. I think the \nletter stands on its own. It clearly affirms why we are here on this \nfloor debating S. 397 and the importance of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Beretta U.S.A. Corp.\n\n                                 Accokeek, Maryland, May 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     Vice President of the United States, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President:  A few weeks ago, the Washington, \n     D.C. Court of Appeals issued a decision supporting a D.C. \n     statute that holds the manufacturers of semiautomatic pistols \n     and rifles strictly liable for any crime committed in the \n     District with such a firearm.\n       Passed in 1991, the D.C. statute had not been used until \n     the District of Columbia recently filed a lawsuit against the \n     firearm industry in an attempt to hold firearm makers, \n     importers and distributors liable for the cost of criminal \n     gun misuse in the District. Although the Court of Appeals \n     (sitting en banc in the case D.C. v. Beretta U.S.A. et al.) \n     dismissed many parts of the case, it affirmed the D.C. strict \n     liability statute and, moreover, ruled that victims of gun \n     violence can sue firearm manufacturers simply to determine \n     whether that company's firearm was used in the victim's \n     shooting.\n       It is unlawful to possess most firearms in the District \n     (including semiautomatic pistols) and it is unlawful to \n     assault someone using a firearm. Notwithstanding these two \n     criminal acts, neither of which are within the control of or \n     can be prevented by firearm makers, the D.C. strict liability \n     statute (and the D.C. Court of Appeals decision supporting \n     it) will make firearm manufacturers liable for all costs \n     attributed to such shootings, even if the firearm involved \n     was originally sold in a state far from the District to a \n     lawful customer.\n       Beretta U.S.A. Corp. makes the standard sidearm for the \n     U.S. Armed Forces (the Beretta M9 9mm pistol). We have long-\n     term contracts right now to supply this pistol to our \n     fighting forces in Iraq and these pistols have been used \n     extensively in combat during the current campaign, just as \n     they have seen use since adopted by the Armed Forces in 1985. \n     Beretta U.S.A. also supplies pistols to law enforcement \n     departments throughout the U.S., including the Maryland State \n     Police, Los Angeles City Police Department and to the Chicago \n     Police Department. We also supply firearms used for self-\n     protection and for sporting purposes to private citizens \n     throughout our country.\n       The decision of the D.C. Court of Appeals to uphold the \n     D.C. strict liability statute has the likelihood of \n     bankrupting, not only Beretta U.S.A., but every maker of \n     semiautomatic pistols and rifles since 1991. There are \n     hundreds of homicides committed with firearms each year in \n     D.C. and additional hundreds of injuries involving \n     criminal misuse of firearms. No firearm maker has the \n     resources to defend against hundreds of lawsuits each year \n     and, if that company's pistol or rifle is determined to \n     have been used in a criminal shooting in the District, \n     these companies do not have the resources to pay the \n     resultant judgment against them--a judgment against which \n     they would have no defense if the pistol or rifle was \n     originally sold to a civilian customer.\n       When the D.C. law was passed in 1991, it was styled to \n     apply only to the makers of ``assault rifles'' and \n     machineguns. Strangely, the definition of ``machinegun'' in \n     the statute includes semiautomatic firearms capable of \n     holding more than 12 rounds. Since any magazine-fed firearm \n     is capable of receiving magazines (whether made by the \n     firearm manufacturer or by someone else later) that hold more \n     than 12 rounds, this means that such a product is considered \n     a machinegun in the District, even though it is semiautomatic \n     and even if it did not hold 12 rounds at the time of its \n     misuse.\n       The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (S. 397 and \n     H.R. 800) would stop this remarkable and egregious decision \n     by the D.C. Court of Appeals. The Act, if passed, will block \n     lawsuits against the makers, distributors and dealers of \n     firearms for criminal misuse of their products over which \n     they have no control.\n       We urgently request your support for this legislation. \n     Without it, companies like Beretta U.S.A, Colt, Smith & \n     Wesson, Ruger and dozens of others could be wiped out by a \n     flood of lawsuits emanating from the District.\n       This is not a theoretical concern. The instrument to \n     deprive U.S. citizens of the tools through which they enjoy \n     their 2nd Amendment freedoms now rests in the hands of trial \n     lawyers in the District. Equally grave, control of the future \n     supply of firearms needed by our fighting forces and by law \n     enforcement officials and private citizens throughout the \n     U.S. also rests in the hands of these attorneys.\n       We will seek Supreme Court review of this decision, but the \n     result of a Supreme Court review is also not guaranteed. Your \n     help in supporting S. 397 and H.R. 800 might provide our only \n     other chance at survival.\n           Sincerest and respectful regards,\n                                                    Jeffrey K. Reh\n                         General Counsel and Vice-General Manager.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 1619, if possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are going \nto make every effort, over the course of today and tomorrow, to screen \nthe amendments that are coming forward because there is a pending \namendment on the floor that would have to be set aside. We are looking \nat the Senator's amendment now. He has just submitted it to us. Once we \nhave analyzed it, I will be happy to get with him to determine whether \nI feel comfortable or we feel comfortable with that amendment and go \nforward.\n  So at this time, clearly, I appreciate the Senator's sincerity, but I \nwould have to object to the setting aside of the pending business on \nthe floor, which is the amendment offered by the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator if I \nmight be able to understand the principles that would be involved in \ndeciding whether there are particular avenues of exploration to make \nsure that this amendment is acceptable going forward? How would we look \nat this?\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Certainly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the rulings of the Senate. There is pending \nbusiness before the Senate. It would take unanimous consent to set \naside the pending business to go on to other business. So that is the \ncircumstance we are involved in at this moment. And defending my right \nto the floor and the amendment before the floor, I am simply upholding \nthat right to the rules of the Senate.\n  The leader has said, most sincerely, that we would examine all the \namendments that are brought forth to determine if there are some that \nwe can agree on, that ought to go forward, that fall, I think, into the \nconscript of those of us 67 Senators who are the supporters of this \nlegislation and who would do so. But now it is the rules of the Senate \nthat cause me to take the action I have taken.\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's candor. I hope \nwe will be able to bring up my amendment, which will protect the rights \nof law enforcement officers who are victimized by gun violence to get \njustice through the American legal system.\n  I would note the presence of my colleague from the State of New \nJersey in the Chamber, who has been a remarkable advocate for law \nenforcement and for the safety and security of people in our community.\n  This past Monday night, I missed a vote on the floor of the Senate \nbecause I went to a wake for a police officer, Officer Reeves, who was \nshot on the streets of Newark by a gang member. The gun that was used \nhas not yet been traced to find out whether it was trafficked in the \nillegal or black market, or whether it was bought by a straw purchaser.\n  But there is one thing that is certain--there were five children \nsitting in the pew with their mother at that wake, all under the age of \n11. Gun violence is real. The amendment I would like to bring up--which \nI appreciate the rules of the Senate and respect the judgment of the \nSenator from Idaho--but the Lemongello amendment I would like to offer \nto the gun immunity bill is about protecting police officers on the \nstreet and giving them the right to get justice in a court of law. If, \nby unfortunate circumstances, they are the victims of gun violence, we \nhave the right in the State of New Jersey, within the legal system, to \ncall to account those who have wrongfully allowed guns to get into the \nhands of criminals.\n  In the case of Detective Lemongello, 11 guns were sold to a gun \ntrafficker out of a gunshop--11 guns. Why does one person happen to \nneed 11 guns? These guns were bought by a straw-purchaser for a career \ncriminal, who then put the guns in a car and drove them to New Jersey, \nwhere one was sold to the criminal who shot Detective Lemongello in \nOrange, NJ.\n  That gun was turned on this gentleman shown in this picture, \nDetective Lemongello, just as a gun was recently turned on the young \npolice officer whose wake I recently attended in Newark on Monday \nnight, Officer Dwayne Reeves. Officer Reeves was 31 years old, and he \nwas married with five children.\n  I believe in the constitutional right of individuals to bear arms \nunder circumstances that will protect the public. I have no argument \nwith that. But I do not think there is a constitutional right to put \nguns into the hands of criminals who attack police officers and other \ninnocent victims in our country.\n  I represent a State where crime rates are going down, but murder \nrates are going up because guns are freely available among gangs on the \nstreets in our communities. This is completely unacceptable. And to \nallow gun trafficking to continue on, without giving the victims of gun \nviolence the right to seek justice in a court of law, is just plain \nwrong. It should be enough for any individual with common sense to say: \nEnough is enough.\n  Prohibiting civil liability actions as this bill does--and I \nrecognize that some may argue about limited exceptions to the general \nimmunity given to the gun industry in this bill--would make it next to \nimpossible for Detective Lemongello, his partner Officer McGuire, or \nthe family of Officer Dwayne Reeves to have their day in court, to seek \nand receive justice through the American legal system.\n  So again, the purpose of my amendment is to protect the rights of law \nenforcement officers. I understand that this bill is going to pass \nwith, I understand, 61 cosponsors. But I hope my colleagues will \nunderstand that, at a minimum, law enforcement officers should be \npermitted to bring lawsuits against culpable gun dealers and \nmanufacturers.\n\n  In the Lemongello case, actually, the people who sold the guns \nrecognized their own mistake, and settled with Detective Lemongello and \nOfficer McGuire. They were able to reach this settlement because \nCongress did not pass this bill last year, which would have given the \ngun dealer immunity and removed these lawsuits from the courts.\n  Now, what's more, the gun dealer who sold the gun to the criminal who \nshot Detective Lemongello and Officer McGuire, along with several other \npurveyors of guns in that West Virginia city, changed their policies. \nThese gun dealers now sell one gun at a time as a result of this \nlawsuit and they no longer make bulk sales.\n  So this is a real issue. This is not just a debate. There are people \ndying because we are not doing the right thing. There are lots of \nforums where we can make this case, and we will continue to, those of \nus who care about public safety, who want fewer guns on the streets, \nand who care about accountability.\n  It is hard for me to understand this legislation as it relates to \nStates rights, in the sense that State legislatures, both Republican \nand Democratic, have supported the right of victims of gun violence to \nhave access to the courts.\n  So this is my view, and I am only one Senator, but it is heartfelt. \nMy opposition to this bill and my support for this amendment comes in \nthe context of the real problems and the real tragedies that will occur \nif we do not have the right checks and balances in the system, if we \ntake away the right of innocent victims to go to court when they are \nwronged.\n  I understand that this bill will pass but I am asking all my \ncolleagues to, at the least, support this amendment to protect the \nbrave men and women in uniform who risk their lives to protect the \ncitizens of our country every single day--people like Detective \nLemongello, Officer McGuire, and Officer Reeves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey and \nwill share a little personal perspective.\n  I have been in law enforcement for the better part of my professional \ncareer as a prosecutor. Some of my best friends are law enforcement \nofficers. I have stood shoulder to shoulder with them in prosecuting \ncases. I know the risks they undertake to carry out their duties. I \nbelieve in what they do, and I believe they should be supported.\n  These law enforcement officers are not telling me that if a criminal \nmurders one of their brothers or sisters, that they want to sue Smith & \nWesson. The thought does not cross their mind. They are concerned that \nif they catch the criminal who did it, that it is likely to be 15 or 20 \nyears before the litigation and prosecution is over. If they are found \nguilty and sentenced to death--if the law provides for it, they should \nbe--they get upset when it never seems to happen, and years and years \nand years go by. That disrespects police officers.\n  It seems to me some of the same people who are talking so much about \ndefending police officers are not as aggressive as they should be on \nsome of these issues that really mean much to them.\n  I would say that I think, on the Lemongello case that has been \nreferred to, based on my experience and understanding of the law as a \nprosecutor in the Federal court, as a U.S. attorney who prosecuted \nindividuals under Federal laws involving this, you cannot sell a \nfirearm to a ``straw'' person who is holding it to move it to another \nperson. And if you have reasonable evidence to believe the person you \nare selling it to is a ``straw'' person, and it is going to someone \nelse, then that someone else must fill out all the forms, put their \nname on it, and qualify to receive the weapon. And if you do that, and \nsell the firearm under those circumstances to someone who is not the \ntrue purchaser, you are not only subject to a lawsuit under this bill \nfor civil damages, but you are subject to criminal prosecution as \nviolating a Federal law.\n  I have prosecuted people for that. I have even had the responsibility \nto prosecute a gun dealer for not accurately handling these kind of \nmatters. If it is a crime, there is clearly a basis to sue the gun \nseller. But you don't want to sue the manufacturer off in Massachusetts \nor wherever they are making the gun. If a seller irresponsibly sells it \nor violates a law in selling a weapon, you don't sue the manufacturer. \nThey don't become an insurer for criminal acts.\n  That is what we are trying to do here, to pass some legislation that \ndoes nothing more than restore the classical understanding of American \ncivil liability. Who should be sued and under what\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\ncircumstances should they be sued? If they sell 11 guns and they don't \nmake them comply with the waiting requirement, if they don't get the \nproper identification from the person who is actually buying the gun, \nthen they have aided and abetted in getting the gun to someone \nillegally. That is something for which they can be prosecuted and sued \nunder this legislation. What we are talking about is abusive lawsuits \nwhere people are being held liable for criminal intervening acts. That \nis not a principle of American law.\n  People say: Enough is enough. We just have to do something.\n  What do you mean we have to do something? We are the legislative \nbranch. We can consider laws if there are enough votes to pass them. \nBut that doesn't mean we allow improper lawsuits to go forward. Senator \nCraig just read the letter from Beretta. One city, Washington, DC, if \nits laws are allowed to stand, which make gun manufacturers liable \nstrictly for every crime committed by a criminal in DC, it will \nbankrupt every gun company in America. One city can do that. And these \ncompanies sell guns to our police officers. They sell guns to our \nmilitary people. They are an important part of our American economy. \nAre we going to now buy our guns from foreign companies? We are not \ngoing to have any left in the United States that can survive this flood \nof lawsuits. It is a serious matter.\n  The bill is carefully crafted. That is why the Democratic leader, \nSenator Reid, and former Democratic leader, Senator Byrd, and others \nare cosponsoring this bill. It has been here for several years. It has \nbeen reviewed. The loopholes in it have been examined and closed. It \nhas gained support. Now we have a bill that should have already been \npassed.\n  I find it passing strange that our colleagues who filibustered a \nmotion to proceed to consider the bill--they filibustered that and \ndelayed this process over a day on that issue alone, when we could have \nalready had the bill up, debated, and voted on. The votes are here to \npass it. Let's move forward and get it done. It is quite odd that our \ncolleagues would complain about wasting time on the bill. They are just \nunhappy because they don't have the votes to defeat it up or down. They \ndon't have the votes to sustain a filibuster. They are conducting \ndelaying tactics that make this legislation that is needed, that has \nstrong bipartisan support, cost more days and more hours of the \nSenate's time than it ought to.\n  I wish to share an overall perspective on gun law enforcement in \nAmerica. Back when I was a U.S. attorney, I came to believe that we \nshould aggressively prosecute criminals who utilize guns during the \ncourse of criminal activity, that felons ought not to possess firearms. \nBoth of these have been in our Federal law for many years. We enhanced \npenalties. Not too many years ago, in the 1980s, they made it a \nmandatory 5 years in jail, 60 months without parole, for anybody to \ncarry a firearm during the commission of a Federal felony or any \nfelony. That is a strong tool. I believe we ought to prosecute those \ncases because I am convinced that a lot of the murders in this country \nare caused by drug dealers and gang members carrying guns around as \nthey do their criminal work. And if somebody crosses them, they pull \nout a gun and shoot them, and people get killed.\n  Let me say this first: Most Americans are not murderers. Most \nAmericans are not criminals. Most Americans who have guns--and most \nAmericans do have guns--are law-abiding, decent, peaceful citizens. \nThey are not ever going to murder somebody. This is some sort of myth \nout there that we are going to fill up the jails if we enforce these \nlaws. There are not that many people out here trying to kill somebody \nor commit crimes carrying firearms. That is a hardcore group of \ncriminals who deserve to be targeted.\n  I created my own program called ``project trigger lock'' in the \n1980s. I created a newsletter on it. We sent out news to our sheriffs \nand our police chiefs about these kind of crimes and the policies of my \noffice to prosecute cases that they may be working on involving these \nkind of criminals. We enhanced our prosecutions.\n  Then I was elected to the Senate. I come in here in the middle of the \n1990s. All I heard is, we have to pass more laws to crack down on \ninnocent people who own guns, people who don't commit crimes. They are \nthe ones for whom they want to make it more difficult. They want to \nconstrict the constitutional right to keep and bear arms through any \nnumber of devices. At that time, it was thought to be politically \npopular, that we would just keep voting more and more restrictions on \nprivate ownership of guns. Pretty soon, I guess they thought people \nwould just give up and Americans would capitulate and not stand up for \ntheir right to keep and bear arms. But it didn't happen that way. The \nAmerican people got their back up on it.\n  The politicians are beginning to hear it now, and the people expect \nto be able to maintain their constitutional right to have a firearm. \nThat is just what has happened.\n  As all this happened--and I am in the Senate--I am thinking, This \nisn't going to affect crime. Ninety percent of convictions in Federal \nfirearms cases have to do with using a firearm or carrying a firearm \nduring the commission of a felony and the possession of a firearm after \nhaving been convicted of a felony. Those are the bread-and-butter \ncases. Many of them are being brought. And when you effectively enforce \njustice, just those two laws--and there are many others, such as \nmachine guns and other kinds of sawed-off shotguns--that is a common \ncase that used to be prosecuted, and I prosecuted lots of them. I \npersonally tried sawed-off shotgun cases. I personally tried and \nprosecuted cases where the serial number had been erased from a \nfirearm. It is a crime to erase it. It is a crime to sell or to carry a \nfirearm that has a serial number erased. It is a crime to transfer a \nfirearm to somebody else that has the serial number erased. We have all \nkinds of laws. It is a crime to go to a gun dealership and provide any \nfalse statement on a document that you have to sign before you get a \nfirearm or to violate any of the myriad of laws out there.\n\n  What I am saying again is that the most common cases are the \npossession of a sawed-off shotgun, carrying of a firearm during a \ncriminal offense, or possession of a firearm after having been \nconvicted of a felony. For the rest of your life, unless your \ndisabilities are removed, if you are convicted of a felony, you cannot \nbe allowed to possess any firearm, even to go hunting. That really \ngalls some people, but that is the law. We enforce that. It is enforced \nright now in Federal court.\n  So we had all these cases. And the other side, President Clinton and \nVice President Gore, was declaring that if you did not support all \nthese new restrictions on legitimate ownership of guns--these laws and \nregulations that they were putting up, one right after another; as soon \nas one passed, they would come up with another one--then you didn't \nbelieve in law enforcement, you didn't believe in fighting crime, that \nyou were allowing murders to take place, that you didn't love children. \nWe heard all that.\n  I went down to the Department of Justice to pull their statistical \nbook. I have seen the statistical book. I used to get it when I was \nU.S. attorney. It would show the number of prosecutions in every \ncategory of crime. What did I find? That under President Clinton's \nAttorney General Reno, Department of Justice gun prosecutions had \ndeclined rather significantly. At the same time they were accusing \nMembers on this side of being soft on gun crimes and not supporting \nefforts to protect the innocent from criminals and all of these things, \nthey were reducing the number of Federal prosecutions for gun crimes. I \nraised that in hearing after hearing after hearing. By the time the \nClinton administration was leaving office, the numbers had picked up a \nlittle bit.\n  President Bush came in. At the first hearing, I asked new Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft: Are you going to make it a priority of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice to increase the number of gun prosecutions in \nthis country? Attorney General Ashcroft said: Yes, that is my mandate. \nThat is what the President wants. That is what I believe in, and we are \ngoing to do it. And prosecutions have gone up. Murders continue to \ndecline. That is one of the more remarkable things that has happened.\n  We can celebrate. Murder and violent crime have been on a period of \ndecline. I am absolutely convinced that one of\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\nthe reasons that has occurred is because of the steadfast, consistent, \ntough prosecution of criminals who carry guns, either former criminals \nor criminals while they are conducting their crimes on the streets. I \nbelieve it works. In fact, it is known throughout the criminal \ncommunity that if you carry a firearm during drug-trafficking offenses, \nif you carry a firearm during any other kind of crime you are \ncommitting, you are likely to go to Federal court to be tried by a \nFederal prosecutor. And in addition to the sentence you get for the \nunderlying crime you committed, such as selling drugs or robbery or \nburglary, you get whacked by another 5 years in jail without parole. If \nyou carried a machine gun, a fully automatic weapon, that is 20 years \nconsecutive without parole. It is goodbye, so long, throw away the key. \nYou are exiled from our community. That is what happened.\n  During the Clinton administration, a very fine U.S. attorney in \nRichmond began to drive this issue. He called it ``Project Exile.'' He \nput out the word in the street. They had billboards. They put up signs. \nIf you are convicted of carrying a gun during a crime--you are a felon \nand you carried a gun--we will prosecute you. You will be guaranteed a \nlong time in jail without parole. You will be sent off to a Federal \ninstitution, maybe in a distant city. That is why he called it \n``Project Exile.'' The violent crime rate in Richmond plummeted. They \ndid what they said they were going to do. They prosecuted those cases.\n  All I am saying is, with great sincerity, based on my personal \nexperience and a fair analysis of what has happened out there, let's \ncontinue to be aggressive with these prosecutions.\n  Let's not let up. Let's make sure that even more people understand \nwith crystal clarity that if they are a criminal and they are out using \na gun in the course of their work, or carrying one as they go about \ntheir business, they will be prosecuted. And when they are prosecuted, \nthey will not only be convicted, but they can be assured they are not \ngoing to get probation, some sort of halfway house, a couple of months \non probation, or something like that, but they are going to the slammer \nfor a significant period of time--perhaps a very long period of time. \nAnd if we keep that pressure on, we are going to continue to see the \ncrime rate drop.\n  That is my hope and that is what is happening. I believe that is the \nfact. Fortune magazine, in the last few months, had an article about \nit. They said very few people have commented on the obvious fact that, \nyes, our prison population has gone up, but our crime rate has dropped. \nCan we add 2 and 2? Most people in America are not criminals. We are \nnot going to continue to have the prison population go through the roof \nbecause most people don't commit robbery, burglary, or carry guns \nduring illegal activities. Very few people do that.\n  What we were doing in the 1960s and 1970s was calling the criminal \nthe victim. We forgot the true victims. We wanted to see what we could \ndo to help the person who was committing the crimes. We finally \nrealized that some of these people are just dangerous criminals and \nthey have to be punished and removed from society. If you let them back \nout, they will commit more crimes.\n  So this has been occurring in our society. We are doing a better job \nof targeting repeat offenders. We are doing a better job of targeting \nviolent offenders. Can we do better? Yes, we can. Can we be more \nsophisticated? Yes. Are our current laws a bit too heavyhanded? \nProbably so. We could probably reduce the penalties on some of the \ndefendants. But the very principle that there is certainty and tough \npunishment for violation of Federal gun laws is one of the concepts \nthat has led to the reduction of violent crime in America, for which we \nall ought to be excited.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by saying we are doing some things \nright in law enforcement. Our law enforcement officers really are doing \na fine job. We have turned the tide, in some ways. It is a mathematical \nthing. I have come to understand that.\n  Back in the 1960s, the crime rate was increasing 10, 15, 18 percent a \nyear. People went from the 1950s when they never locked their doors to \nbeing terrified, raped, robbed, and murdered in the 1960s and 1970s. \nThe crime rate had more than doubled in 20 years. Now there has been a \ndecline. It has been declining for the reasons I just stated. We can be \nmore sophisticated. I have personally offered legislation that would \nreduce the mandatory penalties for crack cocaine. Some on my side think \nthat is soft on crime. I think we need to be sophisticated in \nenforcement. Every year in jail should be carefully considered, and \npeople should not serve longer than they need to serve. I think we can \nmodify that. Judges tell me they think it ought to be modified. I \nstepped up to the plate to do that.\n  But the basic principle that you crack down and you are tough on \npeople who commit crime, and you are consistent, and they know if they \nare carrying a gun and committing a crime in our country they are going \nto be sentenced to a long time in jail, that will deter them. The word \nis out in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Alabama that if you carry a gun \nduring your crimes, you are likely to go to Federal court and serve \nhard time, without parole. And they are not doing it so much.\n  I say this: It is likely that the number of gun prosecutions are \ngoing to begin to decline because criminals are not carrying guns \nanymore because they know it is a ticket to the big house. It is \nsomething that has worked. It has saved hundreds and thousands of \ninnocent lives in this country. It has saved thousands of people from \nbeing permanently disabled by being victims of crime, whether it is \nguns, knives, or anything else. It has been a good thing that has been \naccomplished. I love the law enforcement community, our law officers \nwith whom I served. They put their lives on the line for us. They work \nvery hard for us.\n  As the crime rate has declined, we now have more police officers per \ncrime. They are able to give even closer focus on each individual \ncrime. At one point, there were so many crimes they hardly had time to \ninvestigate or prosecute them. Now, we have trends going our way. We \nneed to keep after it. But having the right to bring out bogus lawsuits \nagainst an honest seller of a legal firearm, or against an honest \nmanufacturer of a legal firearm, is not the right approach. It is just \nnot consistent with our American principles of law; it is not what we \nbelieve in. It is not a legitimate tactic. It is an abuse of the legal \nsystem to carry out a political agenda, and it should not be done.\n  Every company, every person who has a license to sell guns, according \nto the law, ought to be able to do so without fear of being brought \ninto some bogus lawsuit. That is all we are saying. I think this bill \ndoes that. I see my colleague from New Jersey, the great advocate that \nhe is on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about this \nbill and how I see it.\n  I think this is a terrible period for America--the fact that we are \ntaking an action and making it a preceding action to considering some \nother issues that are, I think, far more important than the subject at \nhand.\n  I heard an accusation by our friends on the other side that the \nDemocrats were using delaying tactics and just not permitting us to get \nthis bill--this important piece of legislation that says if a gun \nmanufacturer does something, or the dealer is careless and leaves the \ngun on the counter and someone picks it up and goes out and kills \nsomeone, you cannot sue them; there is no civil action. That is \ndetermined to be more important than getting a defense authorization \nthrough that said give our troops everything they need to protect \nthemselves. No, no, no, we have to put that aside because what we want \nto protect today in this place--and it is shameful, in my view--is gun \nmanufacturers who might knowingly make guns available to a criminal or \nsomeone who is deranged and not yet a criminal--he is not a criminal \nuntil he pulls the trigger--or a distributor or a gun dealer.\n  We saw a case not too long ago regarding the Washington sniper, and \nthe fact that the shop owner could not tell whether this fellow had \nstolen the gun or whether he sold him the gun. There were no records \nkept. It is shocking. We have heard this: When a car manufacturer \nproduces a car and a drunk\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\ndriver takes that car and kills somebody on the road, should the \nautomobile manufacturer be liable? I don't think that is a proper \ncomparison. I say that if a gun shop owner walks away from his counter \nand leaves a pistol on the counter and somebody takes it and goes out \nand kills somebody, he ought to be punished--not only punished by \nhaving a civil action against him, but punished by going to jail. That \nis what the sentence ought to be.\n  When we talk about whether a product is used to harm others, \nautomobiles typically are not produced to harm others. But guns are \nlethal. When you pull a trigger, something happens. I carried a gun. I \ncarried a gun in the uniform of my country. I knew what I was supposed \nto do with that gun. I was supposed to kill the other guy, if I saw him \nfirst. So guns are not play toys and they ought not to have such a \nplace in our society that we can delay getting onto our Defense bill, \ngetting onto other legislation that we desperately need, such as the \nTransportation bill or Energy bill.\n  We cannot discuss those things, no. The majority says: No, America. I \nwant Americans to listen to this. The most important thing we could do \nin this Senate--all 100 of us representing every State in the country--\nis make sure that gun manufacturers, or gun distributors, or gun \nretailers who may be careless--hear that--or grossly negligent, or \nreckless in the way they are handling their records or weapons--no, \ncome on, America, stand up and protect those gun manufacturers and \ndealers. The heck with the rest of this other stuff that affects \neveryday lives, affects a family who has someone sitting in Iraq, maybe \nwith not enough armor on their humvee, or not enough weapons.\n  I met with a group of veterans the other day who had returned from \nIraq. They were here for some rehabilitation. They had gone through \ntraumatic experiences, wounds, et cetera. I asked them: Was there \nanything you were missing? A young woman soldier who had seen combat \nsaid: We don't have enough ammunition to practice using a .50-caliber \nmachine gun so that when we are in combat, we are not quite sure how to \nuse it.\n  That is more important than protecting a gun manufacturer or dealer \nwho is negligent in their behavior. I cannot get this. Negligence, \ngross negligence, recklessness, carelessness--in other words, you can \nbehave any way you want. It is like calling out ``fire'' in a theater. \nYou get punished for that. That is a crime. But for a gun dealer who \ndoesn't handle the weapons inventory properly--no, we have to make sure \nwe don't go after those guys.\n  Talk to the parents. Talk to those who have seen what happens with \ntheir child, in terms of gun violence, and see how they feel about the \nSenate spending time on this issue and holding up everything else. You \ncannot do other things, no, because artfully, craftily, the other side \nhas shut down the ability to offer amendments. I don't want to get too \ncomplicated in explaining the process to the American public. They are \nnot interested in the process.\n  My colleague was on the floor a moment ago, Jon Corzine, the \ndistinguished Senator and my friend, and I enjoy serving with him. He \ntried to introduce an amendment that would make it a special penalty if \na police officer was killed by a gun. You could then pierce this wall \nof immunity that says you cannot bring a lawsuit against a gun \nmanufacturer, a gun distributor, a gun dealer--no, you cannot do that \nbecause that is important.\n  After all, these guys give money. They give money for campaigns. The \nNRA--a small organization in numbers--controls what we do in this body. \nIt is shocking. It is shocking that that organization, which is bent on \nmaking sure that everyone who wants a gun can get it--that is what they \nare saying. No, we have to protect them.\n  But the remaining 290 million people--or whatever the number is--are \nnot entitled to the same protections as we want to give the gun \nindustry.\n  We heard talks about how can you, said one of our distinguished \ncolleagues--and these people are my friends; we differ so much on this \nissue--how can you take a legitimate business and take away their \nability to do business and punish them if somebody they sell a weapon \nto has a record of mental delinquency, a disability, a bent to \nviolence? How can we blame the gun dealer? We make sure we protect gun \ndealers who are not licensed. It is a gun show loophole. Those are \ndealers who don't have to have a license, and they can sell a gun to \nanybody--Osama bin Laden, and the whole thing--and not get punished for \nit. They don't ask for any identification, no address, no phone number. \nThey sell the person a gun and get the money. Those poor people, why \nshould we make them go through the rigors of getting a license just \nbecause they are selling lethal weapons, the kind of weapons policemen \ncarry and the FBI carries, and criminals? Why should we make them go \nthrough that?\n  My colleague talked about the policeman in New Jersey who just lost \nhis life, Dwayne Reeves. He loved being a cop. He was following in his \nfather's footsteps. Officer Reeves was breaking up a fight when a gang \nmember pulled a gun and shot and killed him.\n  While this is another American tragedy, unfortunately it is not \nunique. We see lots of people every year perish because of a gun \nmishandled or a gun directed at innocent people. In the State of New \nJersey, we had 415 gun deaths in 2002, according to the CDC. Mr. \nPresident, 2002 is the last full year of statistics they have. \nAccording to the CDC, 2,867 children and teenagers died from gunshot \nincidents in the United States in 2002. Again, that is the last year \nfor which complete statistics are available.\n  We see that in the United States, 30,000 people were killed, \nincluding suicides, homicides, unintentional, accidental shootings. But \nwhen we look at other countries, we see how few households there are \nwith firearms and gun homicides per million. In Japan, it was less than \n1. In the United Kingdom, it was 1.3. In America, it is 62, 62 guns per \nmillion where homicide is involved. So we see we are especially \nsusceptible in this society of ours to casual gun ownership, gun use, \nvery frankly.\n  We see incidents in my State, as we see in every State. A young woman \nin Atlantic City, NJ, was at a dance. An older man with a history of \nmental disturbance met her at a friend's home and tried to engage her \nphysically. He shot her through the eyes. She was 15 years old. Like \nevery child killed by gun violence, the girl mentioned left behind many \nanguished loved ones--parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, \nfriends, and classmates.\n  I heard those parents ask: How did a gun fall into the hands of a \nderanged person? I heard police officers question how guns were \nobtained by gangsters, such as the man accused of murdering Dwayne \nReeves, the police officer murdered the other day. I heard teachers, \npastors, and neighbors bemoan the gun violence that has ripped \ncommunities apart and destroyed lives. But in my 20 years in the \nSenate, no one in New Jersey has ever come up to me and said: You know, \nFrank, I am worried about the fact that gun manufacturers might be held \naccountable for all this violence and bloodshed. Can you make sure we \nprotect the gun dealers and gun manufacturers?\n  That is why I cannot believe the Republican leadership is wasting the \nSenate's time on this gun violence immunity bill. I believe it \nillustrates just how badly we as a Senate have lost touch with reality, \nwith the concerns of the average American families.\n  If this bill passed the last time it was brought to the floor, the \nfamilies of the six victims of the Washington snipers would have lost \ntheir right to sue the gun dealer who negligently put a gun in the \nhands of those murderers. The gun dealer, in that case, ultimately \nsettled a lawsuit for $2.5 million. Why did they settle? Because they \nknew they were negligent.\n  Instead of debating gun violence immunity, we should be pressing \nforward with the Defense bill, as I said earlier, to support our \ntroops, to really show concern for the average family because the \naverage family are the ones supplying the sons and daughters to fight \nfor our interests in the Middle East. But the majority leader decided \nthat protecting gunmakers, distributors, and dealers from legitimate \nlegal redress for their careless or reckless behavior is more important \nthan making sure our troops have the armor, the weapons and, as I said, \nthe ammunition they need. The Senate is setting aside the safety of our \ntroops in order to protect gun dealers. What an outrage that is.\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\n  During the July recess, I had the chance, as I mentioned, to meet \nwith some soldiers and military families in New Jersey. They have been \naffected by the Iraq war. The effects are so enormous that when you \nlook at the problems they encounter, you shake your head and wonder, \nhow can we do more to take care of them.\n  I talked with one young man who says, when he applies for a job, he \ndoesn't list the fact that he is a member of the National Guard. Why? \nBecause an employer does not want to hire someone who is going to be \naway for a couple of years.\n\n  We ought to be trying to shorten that term of duty. We ought to make \nsure we have more troops engaged so we can send some who are in Iraq \nhome because they accidentally have been called up and are now doing \ntours of duty never dreamt about.\n  The soldiers and their families talk about not getting the resources \nthey need to fight the war. They talk about shortages of tires for \nhumvees. So there are not enough vehicles in working order. The \nshortage of humvees means troops don't get the appropriate practice of \nwhat to do when the convey is attacked.\n  As if that isn't bad enough, a soldier told me there is not enough \nGatorade for them to drink while they are working in 125-degree heat. \nWe know what it is like outside here, but we are not wearing full \nbattle gear, and it is not 125 degrees.\n  When soldiers find a roadside bomb, when one explodes, they like to \nmark the spot with spray paint so it will be easy for them to tell if \nanother bomb is put in the same place. But one soldier told me that the \nArmy doesn't have any spray paint available. Soldiers were told to use \ntheir own money to buy paint to identify a place that is comfortable \nfor someone to place a roadside bomb. They should use their own money \nto buy spray paint in a local market.\n  In short, I learned that our troops in Iraq are facing unnecessary \ndanger because of inadequate training, lack of resources, but here we \nare in the Senate shoving the Defense bill aside so we can do this gun \nviolence immunity bill. I dare these colleagues to call the families I \nmet with and tell them we cannot help them because the NRA is asking us \nto grant legal immunity to these gun manufacturers, distributors, and \nsellers.\n  We should be taking up a bill to expand stem cell research. But \nrather than work on the stem cell bill to save lives, we are working to \nprotect those who negligently sell guns to criminals which result in \npeople being killed.\n  Most American families would prefer we devote our time to the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act of 2005, the stem cell bill that I am \nproud to cosponsor, which would expand Federal funding for embryonic \nstem cell research. There are many other issues.\n  When we look just at the stem cell situation, as many as 100 million \nAmericans could benefit from stem cell research, but we don't do that. \nStem cell research can help Americans living with diseases such as \ndiabetes or asthma--which afflicts 9 million children under the age of \n18, including one of my grandchildren--- cancer, Parkinson's disease, \nautism, spinal cord injury.\n  I find it amazing that the leadership of the Senate, a brilliant \nphysician, the majority leader, is more concerned at this point with \nproviding immunity for rogue gun dealers than giving a ray of hope to \n100 million Americans who might benefit from stem cell research. Talk \nabout misplaced priorities.\n  The Republican leadership in this Senate and this administration have \nlost touch with the priorities of the average family. What is the one \nthing that touches the life of every American every day? \nTransportation. We should have passed the highway bill 2 years ago. \nOnce again, we are bogged down and the President is threatening to veto \nthe highway bill if the final version is closer to the one passed by \nthe Senate.\n  So we have a lot of debate, a lot of argument to go through. If it \nwere up to the American people, they would pass a highway bill and veto \nthis bill on gun violence immunity. The list of misplaced priorities \ngoes on and on. We cannot address issues such as childcare and job \ntraining, but we can waste our time on gun violence immunity, and \ninstead of letting a jury decide the merits of the case involving gun \nviolence, Congress wants to give special protection to rogue gun \ndealers and restrict the right of all other Americans to plead their \ncase before a judge and jury. That does not make sense.\n  When most Americans think about gun violence, they pray that their \nloved ones don't become a statistic. They are not looking to grant \nspecial legal immunity to the companies that sell guns. This bill is \nanother example of the Republican leadership taking its marching orders \nfrom a rightwing special interest group and ignoring the interests of \naverage families.\n  I don't know if this bill will pass, but I know one thing. If we \nspent our time addressing the issues that really matter to average \nfamilies, this bill would never have seen the light of day. I hope the \nmajority leader will take a cue from the American people and turn our \nattention to issues that matter to them--stem cell research, national \ndefense, and transportation.\n  In fairness and equity, I have a disagreement with some of my friends \nin the Democratic Party also, and I urge them to put aside the time \ndevoted to this gun immunity bill and let us get on with other issues.\n  Mr. President, I offer an amendment that poses a question to the \nSenate. The question is simple, Is it more important to protect our \nNation's children or a special interest lobbying group? This bill gives \nimmunity to the gun industry even when they are grossly negligent. What \nmy amendment says is there should not be a blanket grant of immunity in \ncases in which a child is the victim.\n  How can we look a mother in the eye and tell her she cannot hold \naccountable the people who caused the death of her child? What the bill \nsays now is that the parents of a child killed by gunfire when someone \nelse is at fault cannot seek redress. What we are saying is, too bad \nabout your child, but we cannot let you harm these friendly donors of \nours.\n  I call up amendment No. 1620 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object, we appreciate the Senator \ncoming to the floor. I know he is committed to these issues and has \nbeen for a good number of years. We are reviewing the amendment now \nconsistent with all of the amendments that are being submitted at this \nmoment. We have not yet completed that review. We received the \namendment about 25 or 30 minutes ago.\n  With that, I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection has been heard to the amendment.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Reserving my right to object--and I will not object, \nobviously--I know the Senator is looking carefully at these amendments. \nI make a point, I have served in the House of Representatives where \nthere is a Rules Committee that looks at every amendment and decides \nwhat is coming to the floor. In the Senate that was never the practice. \nWe are trying to be extremely cooperative and transparent in what we \nare doing, going, we hope, the extra mile. I hope it is reciprocated so \nwe can get to amendments and get to votes. That is how in the Senate \namendments are decided, not by a committee putting them up or down for \nconsideration, but by Members voting. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are examining these amendments closely. \nAs I had mentioned to the Democratic floor leader a few moments ago on \nthe trigger lock amendment, it was not last year's amendment. We are \nexamining it now. It is quite extensive. It is a new approach toward \ntrigger locks and licensed gun dealers and a much broader issue than \nbefore.\n  I see another Senator on the floor to speak. Let me speak only \nbriefly because the Democratic floor leader, Senator Reid, had \nmentioned in his debate a few moments ago a statement by Smith & Wesson \nin relation to the expenses involved as it relates to defending \nthemselves in these frivolous lawsuits.\n  I have a letter from Smith & Wesson to Senator Bill Frist that I \nthink is\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\nimportant to recognize because it does put in context something that \ncan very easily be taken out of context.\n  Michael Golden, president and CEO of Smith & Wesson, put it this way. \nHe speaks to a letter in response to the Brady Center's wire story, \nobviously trying to knock down the claims of gun manufacturers in their \nsupport of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. He stated:\n\n       In the article, the Brady Center attempts to minimize the \n     financial implications that the numerous ``junk'' lawsuits \n     have had on the firearms industries. To support their \n     position, they cite, among other things, Smith & Wesson's \n     most recent 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission. They quote Smith & Wesson's filing, stating, ``In \n     the nine months ended January 31, 2005, we incurred $4,535 in \n     defense costs, net of amounts received from insurance \n     carriers, relative to product liability and municipal \n     litigation.''\n       As stated in our filing, the figure report reflects fees \n     incurred over a 9-month period, and is exclusive of \n     settlement amounts received from our insurers. Smith & Wesson \n     entered into settlement agreements with two of its insurance \n     carriers following years of coverage disputes. The settlement \n     amounts equal a fraction of the total fees incurred by Smith \n     & Wesson in defending against frivolous lawsuits. In fact, \n     over the past 10 years, Smith & Wesson has spent millions of \n     dollars defending itself against precisely the type of \n     ``junk'' lawsuits that the legislation--\n\n  Referencing the legislation that is before us today--\n\n     is designed to prevent.\n\n  So they do openly support passage of the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. They feel it is critical to not only the survival \nof Smith & Wesson but to the firearms industry of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Smith & Wesson,\n\n                                   Springfield, MA, July 26, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, U.S. Capitol Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: This letter is in response to the Brady \n     Center's newswire released yesterday regarding the Protection \n     of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The newswire was entitled \n     ``The Biggest Lie Yet: Hoping to Ram Bill Through Senate, NRA \n     Supporters Use Phony Scare Tactics, Says Brady Campaign.\n       In the article, the Brady Center attempts to minimize the \n     financial implications that the numerous ``junk'' lawsuits \n     have had on the firearms industry. To support their position, \n     they cite, among other things, Smith & Wesson's most recent \n     10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They \n     quote Smith & Wesson's filing stating, ``In the nine months \n     ended January 31, 2005, we incurred $4,535 in defense costs, \n     net of amounts received from insurance carriers, relative to \n     product liability and municipal litigation.''\n       As stated in our filing, the figure reported reflects fees \n     incurred over a nine-month period, and is exclusive of \n     settlement amounts received from our insurers.

In fact, \n     over the past 10 years, Smith & Wesson has spent millions of \n     dollars defending itself against precisely the type of \n     ``junk'' lawsuits that the legislation is designed to \n     prevent.\n       Passage of Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \n     obviously critical to Smith & Wesson, the firearm industry, \n     our nation's economy and America's hunting traditions and \n     firearm freedoms. Thank you for your sponsorship of this very \n     important piece of legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Michael F. Golden,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. LINCOLN are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as most of our colleagues know, we are now \non S. 397, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Firearms Act. There is \nan amendment on the Senate floor for consideration at this moment. \nCloture on the bill has been filed.\n  What I thought I might do is take a few moments to discuss some of \nthe differences between S. 397, the one currently on the Senate floor, \nand S. 1805, the previous version of the Protection of Lawful Commerce \nin Firearms Act, which was considered in the Senate in the 108th \nCongress. Language has been added in this version to address developing \nissues or concerns expressed last Congress, garnering more support and \nadding more cosponsors on both sides.\n  As I announced this morning and submitted for the Record, we now have \n61 cosponsors including myself. In some cases, the changes are just \ntechnical in their character.\n  But before I get to the changes, let me assure my colleagues that \nthese changes do not alter the essential purpose and effect of the \nbill. As we have stressed repeatedly, this legislation will not bar the \ncourthouse doors to victims who have been harmed by the negligence or \nmisdeeds of anyone in the gun industry. Well recognized causes of \naction are protected by the bill. Plaintiffs can still argue their \ncases for violations of law, breach of warranty, and knowing transfers \nto dangerous persons. Specific language has been added to make it clear \nthat the bill is not intended to prevent suits for damage caused by \ndefective firearms or ammunition. The only lawsuits this legislation \nseeks to prevent are novel causes of action that have no history or \ngrounding in legal principle.\n  This bill places blame where blame is due. If manufacturers or \ndealers break the law or commit negligence, they are still liable. \nHowever, if the cause of harm is the criminal act of a third person, \nthis bill will prevent lawsuits targeting companies that have ``deep \npockets'' but no control over those third persons.\n  The first change we made in this bill was to add the words \n``injunctive or other relief' in the title of the bill. This is to make \nsure S. 397 will prevent all qualified suits and respond to concerns \nthat the 108th version would only have prevented suits for damages. The \nversion of the bill before us today will prevent suits that seek \ninjunctive or other relief besides those seeking only money damages. \nWithout adding this language, law-abiding firearms businesses could \nstill be crippled by being prevented from manufacturing or selling \nfirearms. Any court decision that incorrectly finds dealers or \nmanufacturers liable for criminal acts of others will destroy an \nindustry whether there is an award of money damages or not.\n  In the ``findings'' section of the bill, we have made a couple of \nchanges that do not alter but strengthen and clarify the second \namendment principles that are reviewed there.\n  That same section contains a new paragraph responding to questions \nabout the bill's Commerce Clause implications. That new section \nexpresses the reality that the bill actually strengthens federalism and \nprotects interstate commerce. Thirty-three states have already \nforbidden lawsuits like the ones this bill seeks to eliminate. \nAdvocates of gun control are trying to usurp State power by \ncircumventing the legislative process through judgments and judicial \ndecrees. Allowing activist judges to legislate from the bench will \ndestroy state sovereignty. This bill will protect it.\n  A new paragraph in the ``purposes'' section of the bill echoes this \nchange.\n  In the ``definitions'' section of the bill spelling out what we mean \nby a ``qualified civil liability action,'' we have added the words ``or \nadministrative proceeding . . .''. This change responds to the \nexperience of some in the industry, who have found themselves not only \nthe target of junk lawsuits filed by a municipality but also the target \nof administrative proceedings, such as those to change zoning \nrestrictions, also aimed at putting a law-abiding manufacturer or \nseller out of business just because it made or sold a firearm that was \nlater used in a crime. However, it must be remembered that not all \nadministrative proceedings involving someone in the firearms industry \nwould be covered by this addition--only those that were ``resulting \nfrom the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by the \nperson [bringing the action] or a third party . . .''. Let me \nemphasize: this change is not intended to, and would not, have the \neffect of preventing ATF or any other Federal, State, or local agency \nfrom using administrative proceedings to enforce Federal or State \nregulations that control the firearms business. So we are not trying to \ncircumvent the Justice Department in any sense of the\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\nword; or, as I have said, State or local agencies that have the right \nto enforce the law. For example, if a dealer actually violated a zoning \nregulation or local licensure requirement, this provision would not \nprevent an action against the dealer. Likewise, if a dealer knowingly \nviolated the law or committed any other infraction for which he or she \ncould lose a Federal firearms dealer's license, this provision would \nnot prevent ATF from initiating an administrative proceeding to revoke \nor suspend that dealer's license. This addition of the words \n``administrative proceeding'' is simply intended to clarify that \nwhether it is a reckless court or court-like administrative proceeding \nthat is brought against a law-abiding business, based on a third \nparty's misuse of a firearm, it is covered by this bill.\n  Also in this section of the bill, we have added the words \n``injunctive or declaratory relief, abatement, restitution, fines, or \npenalties, or other relief . . .''. This is to ensure that the bill \nencompasses all qualified lawsuits, regardless of the relief being \nsought.\n  In the section relating to causes of action that would not be barred \nby this legislation, we have specifically listed circumstances in which \nmanufacturers or sellers ``knowingly'' violate a statute. In the last \nCongress, we had two different versions of this section: one required \nthe violation to be both knowing and willful, and the other version \ndidn't require either. Since a person cannot violate the law \n``willfully'' without doing so ``knowingly,'' we have dropped the word \n``willfully'' in this version.\n  Also in the section relating to causes of action that would not be \nbarred by this legislation, we have made some clarifying changes to the \nparagraph concerning product liability actions. Again, this bill is not \nintended to prevent lawsuits against the industry for damages resulting \nfrom a defective product. Language was added to this section of the \nbill to make clear that even if the person who discharged a defective \nproduct was technically in violation of some law relating to possession \nof the product, that alone would not bar the lawsuit. For instance, if \na juvenile were target shooting without written permission from his \nparents--that is a violation of current law, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \n922y--and was injured by defective ammunition, the juvenile would still \nbe able to bring a suit against the ammunition manufacturer.\n  The final major change, other than clarifications and emphasizing \nlanguage, is the provision conforming the definition of trade \nassociation to the definition in the Internal Revenue regulations. The \npurpose of the change was to address some arguments that were made in \nthe last Congress, attempting to stretch the concept of ``trade \nassociation'' to include groups that no one has ever considered to be a \ntrade association. So, for anyone who might have been concerned that \nthe National Rifle Association would somehow be protected by this \nbill--as was argued last time--being defined as a trade association, \nthis change will prevent that from happening. We want that to be \nperfectly clear. It will also prevent illegitimate gun sellers, such as \ngangs or gun traffickers, from somehow qualifying as a trade \nassociation under the bill.\n  I believe that I have addressed most, if not all, of the significant \nchanges in the bill. As we often find with legislation, while they are \nrelatively small changes in the language itself, it took a lot of words \nto describe them. Even so, I hope this explanation is helpful to my \ncolleagues.\n  This legislation is not identical to the legislation of the 108th, \nbut it is to all intents and purposes the same, with the kind of \nclarifying examples I have just given. I certainly welcome the debate \non the importance of this measure. I hope we can move it quickly \nthrough the Senate and conclude our work and provide this country with \nthe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Firearms as should be the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't know how many of our colleagues \nduring this past number of hours have had the time to listen to the \ncomments of our colleague from Rhode Island. I know we all have busy \nschedules and appointments in our offices and with the hearings we \nattend. I have had those meetings in my office as well. One thing I \nhave not done today, which I do under normal circumstances, is put on \nthe mute button when constituents come to my office. In the last couple \nof hours, I have not done that. I have been transfixed, listening to \nour colleague from Rhode Island.\n  I have witnessed a lot of people over my 24 years in the Senate make \na case for or against a piece of legislation, and I do not recall \nanother instance when someone has been as eloquent, as thoughtful, as \nwell prepared as Jack Reed of Rhode Island has in presenting his case \nhere today as to why this bill is a bad idea. I publicly commend him \nfor his well-prepared, well-thought-out, passionate arguments on why \nthis is a troublesome piece of legislation. I thank him for being a \ngood educator on this subject matter.\n  Let me take a few minutes, if I can, to express some views. It is not \nevery day that I question at all the majority leader's decision to seek \nto bring a particular piece of legislation to the floor of the Senate. \nAs someone who has been in this body for almost a quarter of a century, \nI have great respect for the role of majority leader and how difficult \na job it is. In fact, it is the job of the majority leader to set the \nagenda and to exercise his or her prerogatives to move that the Senate \nproceed to a particular matter. So I am not questioning his right to do \nso. I am questioning the wisdom of having made this decision.\n  In this case, I cannot let pass the decision the majority leader has \nmade to bring us to consideration of a gun liability bill. By his \nactions, the Senate has been prevented from concluding consideration of \nthe Defense authorization bill. We were making very good progress on \nthat bill on a number of issues that were very important to our men and \nwomen in uniform, to the families of our service men and women, to \ntheir survivors, and to the veterans of this country who were also the \nsubject of numerous amendments that would have been offered on the bill \nhad it remained on the floor of the Senate for another couple of days.\n  In my years here, good debates on a Defense authorization bill, which \nis what this body is all about, have gone on 9, 10, and 11 days before \na cloture motion would be filed. There have been other occasions when \nit has been filed in less time, but never in less than 5 days of \ndebate. You always look forward to the week or two prior to the August \nbreak when we gather to debate and discuss the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  For the good part of the last 24 years, we have not had a debate on \nthe subject matter of that legislation at a time of war. This time, of \ncourse, we were. Therefore, it was stunning to me to know, at a time \nwhen our men and women are in a dangerous place, when there are \nliterally hundreds who have lost their lives, thousands who have been \ninjured, and thousands every day who are putting themselves in harm's \nway, that the decision was made by this body, by the leadership of this \nbody, to put aside that bill, which might do some things to make their \nlives safer, provide some security for the survivors of those who lost \ntheir lives, and be of some help to veterans. It is stunning that we \nwould set aside those issues to take up this bill that is now before \nus. In my quarter of a century in this body, I don't recall the Senate \never being forced off of a Defense bill in this manner.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee put it \nsimply and succinctly several months ago in this Chamber. Senator \nWarner of Virginia said the following--when confronted, by the way, \nwith a similar fact situation. There was a movement a year or so ago to \ntake up the class action reform bill, of which I was the principal \nauthor at that time. I am a strong supporter of tort reform. There was \na movement to bring up the class action reform bill.\n  In fact, I wrote a letter, with several other Members of this body, \nurging the leadership, as strongly as we felt about class action \nreform, not to set aside the Defense authorization bill in order to \nbring up the class action reform bill. That point of view prevailed and \nwe stayed on the Defense authorization bill. But during consideration \nof that motion or that effort, the chairman of\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\nthe Armed Services Committee said, ``We are at war.''\n\n  We have men and women wearing the uniform of the United States Armed \nForces who are this very moment being hunted by enemies of our Nation. \nThey are in combat. They are under siege. They are enduring some of the \nharshest conditions ever faced by American soldiers.\n  That is exactly where we are today. Yet, unlike a year or so ago when \nwe turned back the efforts of those who would have put aside the \nDefense authorization bill to deal with a class action bill, this time \nwhen it comes to the gun lobby we said no, the gun lobby is more \nimportant than the men and women in uniform, more important than the \npeople who are putting their lives on the line every day.\n  So here we have now the majority of the Senate saying those soldiers \nwill have to wait a while. This is evidently a higher priority, and it \nis this bill, a bill that would confer special privileges on a small \nbut very powerful industry. I am frankly incredulous, to say the least, \nthat we will apparently recess for an entire month having spent barely \n2 days to decide on the critical needs of the soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, marines, veterans, and their survivors. I think we should \nfinish our job. It is the least the Senate could do for our troops \nbefore we take a month-long break from our work.\n  Our business is about choices, sometimes very difficult choices. You \ncan't do everything at the same time. But I don't know how you could \npossibly draw the conclusion that this immunization bill for the gun \nindustry is a more important piece of legislation than the Defense \nauthorization bill, to provide additional protection and the needs of \nthe people in uniform, for veterans, for survivors. I do not know how \nanyone could possibly draw that conclusion at a time we are at war. \nWhat do people think happened in London a few days ago, in Sharm el-\nSheik a few days ago? What event has to occur to convince this body \nthat we ought to be about the business of doing everything we can to \nprotect this Nation? Instead, we decide it isn't quite that important, \nthat this is more important.\n  I am stunned in many ways that anyone would even suggest this \nlegislation in lieu of the Defense authorization bill. I can only \nimagine what the reaction would be if I were to come to this Chamber \nand offer a similar amendment that would exclude another entire \nindustry from exposure to potential liability for wrongdoing.\n  I have more than a passing knowledge of the gun industry. The State \nof Connecticut, which I am proud to represent, has been, and to my \nknowledge remains, home to more gun manufacturers than any other State \nin America. I know of nine such companies that currently call \nConnecticut their home: Colt Manufacturing, Sturm Ruger, U.S. Repeating \nArms, Marlin Firearms, U.S. Firearms Manufacturing, Charter Arms, L.W. \nSeecamp, Wildey, and O.F. Mossbert and Sons. From 1972 to 1997, more \nguns were manufactured in my home State of Connecticut than any other \nState. More than 25 million in all were produced in my small State of \nConnecticut. These are good people. These are good companies. And I \nrepresent good people who work in this industry. We produce fabulous \nguns. They are well constructed. They are the envy of the world.\n  Eli Whitney, of course, is best known as the inventor of the cotton \ngin. He also built a musket armory in New Haven, CT in the late 1700s. \nSince then, Connecticut has been the gun manufacturing capital of the \ncountry of our Nation, if not the world, for that matter. The first \nrevolver was developed and mass produced in Connecticut in the 1830s by \nSamuel Colt and his wife Elizabeth who ran that company after Sam \npassed away at a very young age. That company today bears his name and \nthat revolver became known as ``the gun that won the West.''\n  I also represent probably more insurance companies and more \npharmaceutical companies in the State of Connecticut than almost any \nother State in the Nation. I am very proud to represent these \nindustries. They do a first-rate job. But even though I support the \npeople who work in these businesses and respect what they do, the idea \nthat we would take any one of these industries in this Senator's State \nand absolve it from its legal responsibilities is stunning to me.\n  I have been a strong advocate of legal reform. I authored the \nsecurities litigation reform bill with the Senator from New Mexico. I \nwrote the uniform standards litigation bill. I coauthored the tort \nreforms on the Y2K litigation with Senator Bennett of Utah. I have been \na proponent of asbestos litigation reform. I coauthored the Class \nAction Fairness Act. I am proud of the work I have done in the area of \ntort reform. We need it. It is necessary. In my view, these bills have \nstruck the right balance between frivolous lawsuits, while retaining \ncitizens' rights to seek the redress of wrongs in a court of law.\n  But the idea that we would take an entire industry and give it \nimmunity from wrongdoing is simply wrong, in my view. We are saying to \nthis industry, if you act irresponsibly or wrongfully, and if you can \nforesee the consequences of your irresponsible or wrongful conduct, you \ndo not have to worry about being held accountable for your actions. No \nmatter how much harm you may cause, no matter how many people die or \nare injured at least in part as a result of your wrongful conduct, you \nwill not be held responsible. In this day and age that this body would \nso overwhelmingly endorse an idea such as this is breathtaking. And it \nis little more than ironic that such an idea would be put forward by \nsome who routinely lecture others about the need to take \n``responsibility'' for their actions.\n  Evidently, taking responsibility is a fine philosophy for some, the \npoor, the elderly, schoolchildren, and men and women who struggle each \nand every day to put food on the table for themselves and their \nfamilies. But the gun industry is being absolved in this legislation of \nvirtually all responsibility for its actions.\n\n  Let's consider some of the consequences of enacting this legislation. \nFirst, it will have absolutely no impact whatsoever on reducing the \nrate of gun violence in our Nation. In fact, this bill ignores the \ndevastating toll firearm violence continues to take on our fellow \ncitizens.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there \nwere more than 30,000 deaths in the United States from firearms in the \nyear 2002 alone--30,000 deaths. That is, of course, 10 times the number \nof lives that were tragically lost on September 11 at the World Trade \nCenter, here in Washington, and in a field in Pennsylvania. In fact, a \nyear of gun violence in America nearly equals the number of Americans \nwho died in the Korean war and almost half the Americans lost in the \nentire Vietnam conflict. The numbers are staggering. These numbers \nexceed by a huge margin the number of firearms-related deaths on a per \ncapita basis in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, \nJapan, and France.\n  Among those individuals most affected by gun violence are children. \nFirearms are the second leading cause of death among young Americans \nage 19 and under. Approximately 2,700 children under the age of 19 are \nkilled each year as a result of gun violence or the improper use of \nguns.\n  The rate of firearm deaths of children under the age of 14 is already \n12 times higher in the United States than 25 other industrialized \nnations combined.\n  Let me repeat that. The firearms death rate of children under the age \nof 14 is 12 times higher in the United States than in 25 other \nindustrialized nations in the world. One study noted the firearms \ninjury epidemic among children is nearly 10 times larger than the polio \nepidemic in the first half of the 20th century.\n  Yet we are about to exclude an entire industry from even being \nbrought to the bar to question whether they might be liable for some of \nthese deaths.\n  The human cost of gun-related deaths and injuries is tragic in \nitself, but the economic loss is also significant. According to a study \npublished in the year 2000, the average cost of treating gunshot wounds \nwas $22,000 for each unintentional shooting and $18,000 for each of the \ngun injuries. These costs would undoubtedly be much higher today. The \ntotal societal cost of firearms is estimated to be between $100 billion \nand $126 billion each year. Who pays these expenses? By large measure, \nthe American taxpayer does.\n  My colleagues speak against unfunded mandates, and yet this bill, if\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\nenacted, burdens the Nation's cities and counties with billions and \nbillions of dollars in medical care, emergency services, police \nprotection, courts, prisons, and school security. It is shameful that, \nwhile tens of thousands of people are dying each year due to firearms \nand while the American taxpayers pay tens of billions of dollars to \ncope with the effect of gun violence, the Senate is doing absolutely \nnothing to make our streets and homes safer, in my view. In fact, we \nare doing quite the opposite through our actions today.\n  Second, the legislation will give this industry special legal \nprotections no other industry in the United States has. Neither \ncigarette companies nor asbestos companies nor polluters have such \nsweeping immunity as we are about to give this industry.\n  Let me quote from a recent letter sent to all Senators and \nRepresentatives from over 75 law professors from across our Nation. \nAccording to them the bill:\n\n     . . . would represent a sharp break with traditional \n     principles of tort liability. No other industry enjoys or has \n     ever enjoyed such a blanket freedom from responsibility for \n     the foreseeable and preventable consequences of negligent \n     conduct.\n\n  Gun manufacturers and sellers are already exempt from Federal \nConsumer Product Safety Commission regulation, despite the fact that \nfirearms are among the most dangerous and deadly products in our \nsociety. We have more regulations on toy guns than we do on the ones \nthat fire real bullets. Imagine a toy gun that you buy from Mattel. The \nConsumer Product Safety Commission issues literally pages of \nregulations on what must be included in the production of that gun. \nThere is not a single word in the regulations of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission about the production of guns that may kill 30,000 \npeople each year in this country.\n  The National Rifle Association made sure of this exemption 30 years \nago, just as highly addictive tobacco products are not subject to \nregulation by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  I have supported tort reform in specific areas where I believe it is \nappropriate. My colleagues know I worked with many of them on these \nissues. At the same time I recognize that litigation has been a \npowerful tool in holding parties accountable for their negligence and \nproviding them with the incentive to improve the safety of their \nproducts. It has been employed on behalf of other potentially dangerous \nproducts such as automobiles, lawnmowers, household products, and \nmedicines to protect the health of the American people. The fact that \nguns are already specifically exempt from the oversight of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission is reason enough, in my view, why we can't \nafford to grant the firearms industry legal immunity.\n  Third, this legislation is likely to increase criminal behavior, in \nmy view, in our Nation. Consider the views of the people who know best, \nour Nation's law enforcement officers. Yesterday some 80 sheriffs, \npolice chiefs, and others wrote to each and every Senator that this \nbill will ``strip away the rights of gun violence victims, including \nlaw enforcement officers and their families, to seek redress against \nirresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers.''\n  This legislation will do nothing to help our Nation's law enforcement \nofficers to stop these criminals or to receive justice if they are shot \nor killed. Who better to listen to than our own police chiefs? Law \nenforcement officers will tell you this is a bad bill. It is a bad \nbill, and it is going to cause more problems in the streets of our \ncountry. And here is what two former Directors of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had to say about this bill:\n\n       To handcuff ATF, as this bill does, will only serve to \n     shield corrupt gun sellers, and facilitate criminals and \n     terrorists who seek to wreak havoc with deadly weapons. To \n     take such anti-law enforcement action in the post 9/11 age, \n     when we know that suspected terrorists are obtaining \n     firearms, and may well seek them from irresponsible gun \n     dealers, is nothing short of madness.\n\n  If this legislation is enacted, it would remove any incentive under \ncurrent tort law for gun manufacturers to make their firearms safer. \nStudies have shown that the technology is both readily available and \nvery inexpensive to help avoid future gun-related tragedies. For \nexample, a load indicator could be included to tell the user that the \ngun is still loaded. That is never going to happen now, I promise you. \nA magazine disconnect safety could be installed by the manufacturers to \nprevent guns from firing if the magazine is removed. Even childproofing \nthe gun with safety locks can be done relatively easily. However, if \nthis bill is enacted into law, gun manufacturers will lose the huge \nincentive to include such reasonable safety devices in their products.\n  Evidence has been uncovered that reveals that the gun industry has \nbeen engaged in irresponsible behavior for many years. Senator Reed and \nothers have already mentioned one such industry actor, Bull's Eye \nShooter Supply in Takoma, WA.\n  This gun store claims it ``lost'' the gun used by the Washington, DC, \nsnipers, John Muhammad and John Lee Malvo, as well as more than 200 \nother guns. Many of these firearms were traced to other crimes. Bull's \nEye Shooter Supply had no record of the gun ever being sold and did not \nreport it until the Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms recovered the weapon \nand traced it back. After the rifle was linked to the sniper shootings \nand the newspaper reported on the disappearance of the gun from Bull's \nEye, the rifle manufacturer, Bushmaster, still considered Bull's Eye a \ngood customer and was happy to keep selling to that shop.\n  The judge in this case has since ruled twice that the suit brought by \nthe families of the DC area sniper victims against Bull's Eye and \nBushmaster should proceed to trial, and a preliminary ruling has been \nrejected.\n  Nevertheless, this case, as well as other important pending and \nfuture lawsuits against negligent gun dealers and manufacturers, would \nbe banned if this bill becomes law, as I suspect it will, according to \nthe opinion of some of our Nation's most prominent legal scholars.\n  There are many more instances of the gun industry not taking steps to \nprevent guns from reaching the illegal market. According to Federal \ndata from the year 2000, 1.2 percent of dealers account for 57 percent \nof all guns recovered in criminal investigations. Undercover sting \noperations in Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana have found that such \ndealers routinely permit gun sales ``to straw purchasers,'' individuals \nwith clean records who buy guns for criminals, juveniles, or other \nindividuals barred by law from purchase.\n  If the Senate bill is enacted, police officers shot by a gun bought \nby a ``straw purchaser'' would no longer get his day or her day in \ncourt.\n  Gun shows are also an important source of guns for criminals. Studies \nhave shown that unlicensed dealers often sell large quantities of \nweapons at these shows without having to run criminal background checks \nor keeping records. Many of my colleagues might recall that a gun show \nwas the source of the firearm purchased by Eric Harris and Dylan \nKlebold before they went on their murderous rampage at Columbine high \nschool, but the Senate bill would not hold such gun dealers responsible \nfor the injuries and deaths their firearms cause.\n  Supporters of this legislation contend that there is a gun litigation \ncrisis in America and that many of the cases being brought against the \ngun industry are frivolous. Nothing could be further from the truth. In \nfact, there are no massive backlogs of claims against the gun dealers \nand manufacturers burdening our court system. About 10 million tort \nsuits were filed in State courts from 1993 through the year 2003; 57 of \nthem were against gunmakers or dealers, 57 out of 10 million cases. Is \nthat a litigation crisis, with 57 lawsuits out of 10 million other \nsuits filed in the same relevant area? And the result of those 57 \ncases. The impact on the gun industry has hardly been crushing. Some of \nthese suits have been dismissed. Some have been settled. Some have been \nappealed.\n  The industry claims it is spending $200 million a year on litigation \ncosts. Yet it offers absolutely no data to support this. There is \nevidence that litigation costs are virtually insignificant: 57 cases in \n10 years out of 10 million tort cases being filed. That alone ought to \ntell you this is a frivolous piece of legislation. This is what is \nfrivolous, to suggest we need to clean up a problem involving 57 cases, \nmany of which were dismissed.\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\n  One major gun manufacturer in a filing last November with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission--a filing, by the way, that it made \nunder the pain and penalty of perjury--said this:\n\n       It is not probable and is unlikely that litigation, \n     including punitive damage claims, will have a material \n     adverse effect on the financial position of the company.\n\n  Another gun manufacturer said this to the SEC in March of 2005:\n\n       In the nine months ended January 31, 2005, we incurred \n     $4,535 in defense costs . . . relative to product liability \n     and municipal litigation.\n\n  That is a litigation crisis? It is outrageous to claim it is.\n  Of the small number of lawsuits filed against this industry, none to \nmy knowledge have been dismissed as frivolous. On the contrary, there \nhave been favorable rulings on the legal merits of many of these cases. \nCourts have recognized such cases are based upon well-established legal \nprinciples, negligence, product liability, and public nuisance. \nImportant information on the gun industry's wrongful actions, which has \nbeen cloaked in secrecy for many years, has been revealed and injured \nparties have been compensated, fairly and justly. These cases, however, \nwill be precluded, and the information gleaned from them will be lost \nif the gun industry is granted immunity, as it seeks with this \nlegislation.\n  Rather than giving special immunity to those manufacturers and \ndealers who wrongfully make and sell guns to criminals, the Senate \nshould be today or at some point--again I wish we were back on the \nDefense authorization bill--at some point we should work to protect our \npolice officers and the people they protect every single day. Instead \nof zeroing out the COPS program we ought to take our time to do \nsomething about strengthening the police departments of our Nation. \nRather than placing more guns on the streets, the Senate should be \nconsidering more responsible gun legislation such as making the ban on \nassault weapons permanent and closing the gun show loophole.\n  Rather than encouraging reasonable and safe gun use, the Senate is \ndestroying any incentive for gun manufacturers to improve the safety of \ntheir deadly wares. This legislation, to this Senator, is an outrage. \nAnd, I represent more of these manufacturers than any other Member of \nthis body. I know it is not common for a Senator to get up and speak \nagainst an industry in his State, and I have at least nine of them, as \nI said earlier, that have produced 25 million guns in the last 12 or 13 \nyears. I respect my manufacturers. They are good people. But the idea \nthat I would immunize nine industries in my State from their \nwrongdoings is incredible. While it may seem strange to have the \nSenator from the largest gun-producing State making these statements, I \nfeel strongly. It is wrong to be doing it. It is an outrage.\n  You can say this is wrong, and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves \nfor taking an entire industry and not holding it liable for the harm it \nmay cause to people across the country. Thirty thousand people die \nevery year, almost 3,000 kids, and we are about to say to the \nmanufacturer of the products that kill them to take a walk and that you \nnever have to show up again in court. That is shameful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, in the context of what the Senator from Connecticut \nhas said, let me read some statistics from the National Safety Council \ninjury fact sheet. I am talking about some very important statistics: \nBetween 1993 and 2003, accidental or unintentional deaths by firearms \nhas gone down 40 percent in America. Between 2002 and 2003, that \nreduction of accidental deaths has again gone down by 33 percent. Very \nsignificant numbers.\n  Here also are other significant numbers that my colleagues would want \nto be aware of that are tremendously important. Total unintentional \naccidental deaths in America, 101,500 in 2003; motor vehicle deaths of \nthat year, 44,000; falls at home and work and on the streets of \nAmerica, 16,000; drownings, 13,000; fire and burns, 4,300; ingestion of \nfood objects, 2,900; firearms was down into the number of 700. That is \nless than 1 percent.\n  Here is what is most significant, because I don't take 700 \nunintentional accidental deaths by firearms lightly. But these are \nimportant statistics to understand as we look at the total scope of the \nlegislation and even what the Senator from Connecticut said that I \ndon't think pertains to this legislation.\n  Here are the statistics from the National Safety Council. Accidental \nfirearms-related fatalities have been consistently decreasing for many \nyears. Primarily, statistics show accidental firearms-related \nfatalities decline by 13 percent in one category, 2002 to 2003. Here is \nwhat is most important because we are all concerned about the young \npeople of America. Over the past 7 years, accidental firearms-related \nfatalities among children under 14 years of age has decreased by 60 \npercent. Why? Because there are tremendous safety efforts not by the \nFederal Government but by private organizations and by responsible \nparents to teach their young people how to deal with firearms when they \nare either subject to them or find them in a location. These numbers \nare important in the context of this debate.\n  Again, this debate has nothing to do with crime on the street. This \nhas everything to do with frivolous lawsuits against law-abiding \ncitizens. I am afraid we have to start dealing with the criminal \nelement instead of the law abiding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Correct me if I am wrong, but I cited statistics between \n1993 and 2003. There were 10 million lawsuits brought in the United \nStates for wrongful death under the tort system. Of those 10 million, \nwe have been able to find 57 in 10 years, 57 cases brought against gun \nmanufacturers and gun dealers. Is the Senator telling me those are \nfrivolous, 57 lawsuits out of 10 million? Is that a crisis in \nlitigation?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. What the Senator is saying, there have been 24 or 25 \nlawsuits filed against gun manufacturers and dealers by municipalities. \nHalf of them have been thrown out of the courts as being frivolous.\n  Mr. DODD. So what is the problem?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The problem is, and the Senator well knows, this Congress \nhas, from time to time when they have seen industries subjected to \nwrongful lawsuits, chosen to exempt them from the wrongful lawsuit but \nnot from liability.\n  Mr. DODD. For 24 cases in 10 years?\n  Mr. CRAIG. And millions and millions and millions of dollars spent. I \nappreciate the Senator's mindset on this issue. He is fundamentally \nwrong, and that is why we have the legislation now to provide a very \nnarrow scope of protection, but certainly not from malfunctioning, not \nfrom bad product, only from that third-party criminal issue.\n  I am sorry to say the Senator would disagree with me, but a person \nwho manufacturers a firearm is not the criminal who pulls the trigger \nand therefore should not be liable for that criminal act.\n  Mr. DODD. You are going to have your way if this bill is adopted, but \nthat is the only industry in America with this special status. You \nwould not do it for the automobile or chemical industry.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We did it for aircraft industry some years ago because of \nfrivolous lawsuits that nearly bankrupted them until Congress stepped \nin and said, No, in certain categories that is unfair, and it allowed \nthem to stabilize their economy and continue to build aircraft for the \nAmerican consumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am concerned about what is going on in the \nSenate procedurally. This is the first time I can remember, during the \ntenure of Senator Frist, we have had a bill where the so-called \n``tree'' has been filled, allowing no amendments to be offered.\n  Senator Frist, I have stated, has been very fair in allowing bills to \ngo forward, with rare exception.\n  I am concerned about what has gone on very recently: filing cloture \non the Defense bill after 1 day of debate. I direct these remarks \nthrough the Chair to the distinguished manager of the bill. Mr. \nPresident, I direct these remarks through you to the distinguished \nmanager of the bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I apologize.\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I participated in a conversation I am confident the manager \nof the bill was in on this morning where the distinguished majority \nleader said he wanted to take a little bit of time, after having filled \nthe tree, which is very unusual, and he would look at the amendments \noffered by the Senator from Rhode Island and make a decision as to \nwhich of those he would allow to be debated. He did say he had no \nproblem with him offering amendments and we would be able to debate--\nand I do not recall him saying ``vote on them''--but at least debate \nspecific amendments that were up. But I assumed in the tenor of the \nconversation there would be votes on the amendments.\n  We have been on this bill now for 3 hours, after proceeding to it, \nand my friend from Rhode Island has been unable to offer any \namendments. So I say to the manager of the bill, through the Chair, how \nmuch longer is it going to take before the majority makes a decision on \nsomething that should be fairly routine, as to when the Senator from \nRhode Island can have some of his amendments heard before the body?\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. President, let me address the minority leader.\n  Certainly, all that he has said is exactly the conversation from my \nreference point that went on between him and the majority leader. There \nis no intent to block all amendments. That is not the intent of what \nthe majority leader did.\n  We have seen these amendments less than 30 minutes, in almost every \ninstance, prior to the time they were offered. Certainly, the Senator \nfrom Nevada knows the opportunity to examine and look at these \namendments, in light of similar amendments offered last year, is a \nreasonable request. That is the request the majority leader and I, as \nthe floor manager, have made. Those amendments are under review now.\n  The floor leader for the Democrats, Senator Reed, and I have visited \nabout some of them that may well meet that scope, and we are reviewing \nthem at this moment. This is not unprecedented, and the Senator from \nNevada knows that. This is a procedure under the rules of the Senate \nthat has been used over time. Has Majority Leader Frist used it? I \ndon't know. I am not that good of a historian. But I have been here not \nquite as long as the Senator from Nevada, and I do know that both his \nside and our side have used it from time to time. It is clearly within \nthe prerogative of the Senate to do so under its rules.\n  At the same time, clearly, what the majority leader has expressed was \nexpressed in good faith with the minority leader. I would hope in the \ncourse of the evening--and we will certainly be on this legislation all \nday tomorrow because the cloture motion does not ripen until early \nFriday morning--- that it would be adequate time to consider several of \nthese amendments that have been offered. I know that is the intent of \nthis floor leader. And certainly I believe it is the intent of the \nmajority leader to do so.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to hear the review is still \ntaking place. I would hope that during the tenure of this reviewing of \nthe amendments, a decision could be made so the Senator from Rhode \nIsland can offer his amendments. I am happy to hear the decision has \nbeen made to allow him to do that, in keeping with my conversation with \nthe majority leader, that amendments would be debated here on the \nfloor.\n  I would also say something else as to how I look at all this. I know \nthe majority leader has a real problem with trying to jam a lot of \nthings in this final week before we go back to our States.\n  I say my friend from Rhode Island, who feels so strongly about this \nissue, has been willing--and I am saying publicly on his behalf and \nannouncing to the Senate--in that we have conference reports that need \nto be completed, hopefully on the Energy bill, the highway bill, the \nInterior bill, the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, and that we \nhave to do something on the Native Americans legislation, and other \nincidentals that crop up as we are trying to finish a period such as \nthis for a 5-week break, the Senator from Rhode Island has said he is \nwilling to allow the Senate to go forward with all these other items we \nhave before us that I have outlined and, in fact, will waive the second \n30 hours he will be entitled to after cloture is probably invoked on \nthe underlying bill. The only thing he requires is that final passage \nof the bill take place, not on Saturday morning, in keeping with the \nrules here, but as soon as we get back, whenever the majority leader \nwould want to do this bill when we get back. He can do it the first \nhour we get back here, the first day we get back here.\n  But I want the Senate to understand, both Democrats and Republicans, \nwho are clamoring to go places--home or other places they have set to \ngo during this recess--that Senator Reed is not holding this up. Under \nthe procedures of the Senate, he has a right and will keep us here \nuntil Saturday morning, unless there is a decision made that we can \nfinish all this as quickly as possible, eliminating the 30 hours, and \ngoing forward with the other business of the Senate. Otherwise, it is \ngoing to be real tough to jam all that in.\n\n  I see nothing lost. There has been some talk: Well, during the 5-week \nperiod both sides will run ads and things of that nature. I have no \ndoubt that may be true. But I cannot imagine it will change any votes.\n  But I want everyone to understand, when people come to me and say, \n``Why is Senator Reed of Rhode Island being so unreasonable?'' the \nSenator from Rhode Island is being totally reasonable. Some of us have \nspoken to him. I think it is reasonable what he has agreed to do. So if \npeople come to me and say, ``Senator Reed is not letting us leave here \nwhen we want to, and we have all this work to do,'' everyone should be \ndisabused of that. It certainly is not true.\n  We are willing to finish our work here. We could finish all the work \nwe have to do here tomorrow, early in the evening, and not have to be \nhere Saturday. The rest is up to the majority. They are the ones, we \nunderstand, who control what amendments we can offer on this bill. They \ncontrol when we will finally dispose of this bill. It can either be \nSaturday morning or it can be when we get back here in September.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REED. For the record, there are three amendments we have \nattempted to offer. One is an amendment authored by Senator Kohl, which \nI offered on child safety locks. The floor manager and I have discussed \nthis amendment. There are some technical concerns about it. But that is \none.\n  The second is an amendment Senator Corzine would like to offer about \nexempting law enforcement officers from the provisions of the bill.\n  The third is an amendment Senator Lautenberg would like to offer with \nrespect to the denial of immunity when the victims are children.\n  These are the three amendments. But we are not seeking any \nextraordinary, provocative amendments. We are trying to get amendments \nup that are relevant to this discussion about gun safety. I honestly \nbelieve that 3 hours--my amendment is going to take 3 hours--and at \nleast several hours for the other amendments will be sufficient time to \nreview this.\n  I am not going to make a formal parliamentary inquiry now, but I am \nnot under the impression, under the rules of the Senate, that a Senator \nmust get the permission of any other Senator to offer an amendment. If \nhe has the floor, and particularly before cloture, the amendment can be \noffered. I will seek to clarify that. I do not want to be in error on \nthat point.\n  But we have gone to great lengths to be cooperative, collegial, to be \nable to offer these amendments, and to this point we have got this sort \nof silence--or not silence, but simply: We are looking at it, we are \nlooking at it, we are looking at it. I do not think we can continue in \nthis posture indefinitely.\n  I thank the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say--and I meant to say this in my \nresponse to the Senator from Idaho--no one has said he or the majority \nleader are violating the rules. Everyone is going by the rules here. I \nknow them. I am just saying, it is very unusual for Majority Leader \nFrist. In fact, I have nothing in my memory that he has ever done this \nbefore; that is, immediately going to a bill and filling the tree so no \nother amendments can be offered. I have never, ever known him to do \nthis. It is so unusual. It is not in keeping with how he has done \nbusiness\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\nhere during his tenure as majority leader. While filling the tree is \nwithin the rules, it is done very rarely. And again, I am surprised \nthat Senator Frist did this.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I have yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we should be using our time right now to \ncontinue our work on the Department of Defense authorization bill, \nworking through important amendments relating to the needs of our \nmilitary and our Nation's security and giving these issues the time and \ncareful attention that they so clearly deserve. At a time when our \nbrave men and women in uniform are deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nelsewhere--risking and, too often, losing their lives in service to \nthis country--we ought to be working intensively on the Defense bill. \nAt a time when terrorist networks continue to strike at our allies, \nkilling innocent civilians in an attempt to intimidate everyone who \nrejects their violent, extremist agenda, we ought to be focusing \nsustained attention on ensuring that our military has the tools that it \nneeds, and our country has the policy that it needs, to create a more \nsecure world for our children. And as a part of that effort, we must \ndevote more time and more attention to a realistic assessment of where \nwe stand today in Iraq, and where we should be going.\n  As my colleagues know, I have submitted a resolution calling for the \nPresident to provide a public report clarifying the mission that the \nU.S. military is being asked to accomplish in Iraq and laying out a \nplan and timeframe for accomplishing that mission. This doesn't seem \nlike much to ask for. After all, if we don't have a clear plan and \ntimeframe, how can we even hold ourselves accountable for giving the \nmilitary the tools they need to succeed in achieving those goals? The \nresolution also calls on the President to submit a plan for the \nsubsequent return home of U.S. troops that is also linked to a \ntimeframe, so that we provide some clarity about our intentions and \nrestore confidence at home and abroad that U.S. troops will not be in \nIraq indefinitely.\n  My resolution does not dictate deadlines or dates certain. And it \ndoes request flexible timeframes for achieving our goals in Iraq rather \nthan imposing any, because drawing up timeframes is best and most \nappropriately left to the administration, in consultation with military \nleaders. And, of course, any timeframe has to be flexible. There are \nvariables that will affect how quickly various missions can be \naccomplished. But it is hard to conceive of an effective strategic plan \nthat isn't linked to some timeframes. That is what the administration \nneeds to share.\n  I want to respond directly to some of the criticisms I have heard of \nthis approach.\n  Some have suggested that to question the path that we are on is to \nundermine our united commitment to support the courageous men and women \nwho have been deployed in harm's way.\n  And some believe that any discussion of timeframes, flexible or \notherwise, is basically a code for a ``withdraw now'' agenda.\n  Neither of these charges is credible. Just this morning, General \nCasey spoke publicly--publicly--of the potential to reduce our troop \nlevels fairly substantially by the spring and summer of 2006. I think \nhis comments, and Iraqi Prime Minister Jafari's frank acknowledgement \nthat ``the great desire of the Iraqi people is to see the coalition \nforces be on their way out,'' are constructive. And I hardly that \nGeneral Casey be accused of failing to support his fellow service men \nand women.\n  My support for our troops has not wavered one inch. And it will not. \nI did not support the administration's decision to go to war in Iraq, \nbut I have consistently voted to provide our service men and women with \nthe resources they need in Iraq. And I know that our troops have done, \nand continue to do, a remarkable job. The brave men and women of the \nU.S. Armed Forces deserve our admiration, our respect, and our \nunflagging support. But that is not all that they deserve. They deserve \nsound policy from elected officials. They don't have that right now. \nThe administration must not leave them in the lurch any longer. Are \nU.S. forces supposed to be waging a counterinsurgency campaign? Are \nthey supposed to be taking sides in what may be an emerging civil war? \nAre they supposed to be focused primarily on training Iraqi forces so \nthat the Iraqis can be in the driver's seat when it comes to taking the \ndecisions, and the risks, associated with achieving their own \nstability? I hope the administration knows the answers to these \nquestions, but until they provide them, all of us are in the dark.\n  It is also clear that we must not accept a false choice between \nsupporting the status quo in Iraq and the so-called idea of cutting and \nrunning. The status quo--staying a rudderless course without a clear \ndestination--would be a mistake. The course we are on is not leading to \nstrength. In fact, I am concerned that the course we are on is making \nAmerica weaker and our enemies stronger.\n  The ill-defined and open-ended military commitment that characterizes \nour current policy in Iraq is actually strengthening the very forces \nwho wish to do us harm. I am not talking about disgruntled Baathists, \nalthough I am concerned that nationalist sentiments will make it more \nand more difficult for many Iraqis to accept a massive foreign troop \npresence on soil--something that they regard as a humiliation. But, \nmore alarmingly, I am talking about the forces that attacked this \ncountry on September 11, 2001. These forces were not active in Iraq \nbefore the invasion, but they came once disorder in Iraq took hold. And \ntoday, as CIA Director Porter Goss has made plain in testimony before \nCongress:\n\n       Islamic extremists are exploiting the Iraqi conflict to \n     recruit new, anti-U.S. jihadists.\n\n  Just recently, President Bush told the country that ``with each \nengagement, Iraqi soldiers grow more battle-hardened and their officers \ngrow more experienced.''\n  Unfortunately, the same is true of the foreign fighters. Iraq has \nbecome a prime on-the-job training ground for jihadists from around the \nworld, terrorists who are getting experience in overcoming U.S. \ncountermeasures, experience in bombing, and experience in urban \nwarfare. They may well be getting a better education in terrorism than \njihadists received at al-Qaida's camps in Afghanistan. And they don't \njust have skills. They now have contacts. They are building new, \ntransnational networks, making the most of al-Qaida's new model of \nsupporting loosely affiliated franchise-type organizations. Press \nreports suggest that the CIA is calling this emerging threat the \n``class of '05 problem.'' All of us, on both sides of the aisle, should \nbe thinking about how to ensure that there is no similar class of '06.\n  It would be nice to believe that these terrorists will be swept into \nIraq only to be annihilated by U.S. forces. But that kind of ``roach \nmotel'' approach to fighting is hardly a strategic vision. At its best, \nit is wishful thinking, and more wishful thinking is just what our Iraq \npolicy and our strategy for fighting terrorism do not need. I agree \nwholeheartedly with the President that we must not waver in our \ncommitment to defeating the terrorist networks that wish to do us harm. \nAnd I know, as he must know, that these networks exist around the \nworld. Fighting terrorists in Baghdad does not mean that we won't have \nto fight them elsewhere. Sadly, we need only look at the headlines over \nthe past few weeks to find the terrible evidence of this hard fact.\n  I am gravely concerned that not only are our enemies gaining strength \nunder the administration's current policies. I am concerned that we are \ngetting weaker. The U.S. Army is being hollowed out by the \nadministration's policies. The Army is straining to maintain the cycle \nof rotations and training that we know it needs to sustain its \ncapacities, and recruitment efforts have been in serious trouble for \nsome time now. Meanwhile, costs for the Future Combat System--a system \nthat depends on technology that is not yet even developed--spiral out \nof control. We cannot stand by and allow the U.S. Army to be broken. We \ncannot stay this course.\n  The current course of action simply is not inspiring confidence among \nthe American people. I know that my constituents are terribly troubled \nby the\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\nadministration's handling of the war in Iraq. After the shifting \njustifications for this war, the rosy scenarios that bore no \nresemblance to reality, and the unreliable declarations of ``mission \naccomplished,'' they sense that our policy is adrift. A democracy \ncannot succeed in achieving its goals without the support of the \npeople. They deserve clarity and candor and so do our troops on the \nground.\n\n  Finally, I want to talk about the most common criticism leveled at \nanyone who invokes the phrase ``timetable'' in talking about our \nmilitary deployment in Iraq. The charge goes something like this: if \nthe insurgents know when we plan to go, they will simply hunker down \nand lie in wait for the time when we are no longer present in large \nnumbers, and then they will attack.\n  If that were the insurgents' plan, why wouldn't they cease all \nattacks now, lay low, let everyone believe that stability has been \nachieved, and spring up again once the security presence in Iraq is \ndramatically reduced? If we really believe the argument that any kind \nof timetable is a ``lifeline'' to the insurgents, then why wouldn't \nthey try to induce us to throw them that lifeline?\n  We cannot know all the reasons behind the choices made by the diverse \nelements waging Iraq's insurgency. But one thing is clear: Ultimately, \nwe will withdraw from Iraq, and it will not be secret when we do. Does \nthe administration believe that the insurgents will be entirely \ndefeated at that point? Is it really our policy to stay in Iraq until \nevery last insurgent and every last terrorist is defeated? Recently \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld made news when he said that the \ninsurgency could well last a decade or more, and that ultimately, \n``foreign forces are not going to repress that insurgency,'' rather it \nis going to be defeated by the Iraqis themselves. I think this analysis \nmakes good sense, especially given the fact that our very presence in \nIraq is helping to recruit more foreign jihadists every day. But the \nSecretary's candor made waves, because for long, costly months we \nlacked clarity on this critical point regarding just what the remaining \nU.S. military mission is in Iraq. Is it to defeat the insurgency, or is \nit to give the Iraqis the tools to do that themselves?\n  If the remaining military mission is to train Iraqis to provide for \ntheir own security, we ought to be able to articulate a clear plan for \ngetting that job done. If we know how many troops we need to train, and \nwe know how long it takes to train effectively, then we ought to have \nsome sense of how long it will take to accomplish our mission.\n  When I was in Baghdad in February, a senior coalition officer told me \nthat he believes the U.S. could ``take the wind out of the sails of the \ninsurgents'' by providing a clear, public plan and timeframe for the \nremaining U.S. mission. He thought very clearly, that this could rob \nthem of their recruiting momentum. I also think it could rob them of \nsome unity. All reports indicate that the forces fighting U.S. troops \nand attacking Iraqi police, soldiers, and civilians are a disparate \nbunch with different agendas, from embittered former regime elements to \nforeign fighters. The one thing that unites them is opposition to \nAmerica's presence in Iraq. Remove that factor, and we may see a more \ndivided, less effective, more easily defeated insurgency.\n  Intense American diplomatic and political engagement in and support \nfor Iraq will likely last long after the troops' mission is \naccomplished and they are withdrawn. I expect that we will continue \nsome important degree of military and security cooperation with the \nIraqis, as we work with them and with others around the world to combat \nterrorist networks, whether they are operating in Iraq or Afghanistan \nor England. And we have to be working diligently to combat a burgeoning \nculture of corruption in Iraq, or the rule of law doesn't stand a \nchance. We need to make reconstruction work and deliver real democracy \ndividends for the Iraqi people. The situation in Iraq is complex, and \nit requires a long-term political commitment from the U.S. What my \nresolution addresses is just one piece of the puzzle for achieving our \ninterests in Iraq and helping the people of Iraq and the region move \ntoward a more stable future.\n  I certainly don't have all the answers to the complex problem we \nconfront in Iraq. But I know that it's time to restore confidence in \nthe American people that this President and this administration know \nwhere we are going and how we plan to get there. It's time to put Iraq \nin the context of a broader vision for our security. It's time to \nregain a position of strength. That starts with sustained attention, \nfocus, and debate--and we should be doing that right here in this \nCongress, right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to support the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. This act has strong \nbipartisan support. Sixty-one Senators are cosponsoring this \nlegislation. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill. \nI thank my good friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, for his leadership in \nintroducing the legislation and bringing the bill to the Senate floor, \nmanaging the legislation and doing an exemplary job.\n  The legislation we are considering will correct a significant \ninjustice that threatens the viability of a lawful U.S. industry; that \nis, the firearms industry. An increasing number of lawsuits are being \nfiled against the firearms industry seeking damages for wrongs \ncommitted by persons who have misused the industry's products. These \nlawsuits seek to impose liability on lawful businesses for the actions \nof people over whom the industry has no control. Outrageous. Businesses \nthat comply with all applicable Federal and State laws and produce a \nproduct fit for its intended lawful purpose, including elk hunting, \nduck hunting, target shooting, or personal protection, should not be \nsubjected to frivolous lawsuits that have only one goal--to put them \nout of business. This is an unacceptable burden on lawful interstate \ncommerce. No other law-abiding industry faces this kind of attack.\n  People in my State are proud of their independence. We are proud of \nour outdoor heritage. Montanans are avid sports men and women. We \ncherish our right to hunt and fish and enjoy the outdoors. Passing this \nbill will allow us to protect that right by ensuring that the firearms \nindustry stays in business.\n  Each year, hunters, shooters spend nearly $21 billion. This, in turn, \ngenerates more than 366,000 jobs that pay more than $8.8 billion in \nsalaries and wages and provide $1.2 billion in State tax revenues. In \naddition, excise taxes imposed on firearms under the Federal Aid to \nWildlife Restoration Act, also known as the Pittman-Robertson Act, \ngenerate critical revenues for State fish and wildlife conservation \nefforts and hunter safety training. For example, the Pittman-Robertson \nAct generated more than $150 million in revenue in 2002 alone.\n  In Montana, hunters and sportsmen generated $250 million in retail \nsales, generating about 5,592 jobs, over $100 million in salaries and \nwages, and $11 million in State tax revenues--no small matter.\n  In addition, threats to the U.S. gun industry also pose a threat to \nthe U.S. military. Many domestic gun manufacturers supply the military \nwith necessary firearms. If these companies are forced out of business, \nthe U.S. military must look abroad to arm itself, and we cannot let \nthat happen.\n  In short, the U.S. firearms industry serves America's gun owners, \nserves our sportsmen, and our military very well. It provides good-\npaying jobs for many Americans. It provides revenues that benefit all \nAmericans. The industry should not be penalized for legally producing \nor selling a product that functions as designed and as intended. But \nthat is exactly what certain groups are trying to do by asking the \ncourts to step in and micromanage the industry. The Congress and most \nState legislators have refused to do so.\n  Let me list some of the demands so you get a flavor of how credible \nthese lawsuits are. Some of these lawsuits would require one-gun-a-\nmonth purchase restrictions not required by State law. Others require \nfirearm manufacturers and distributors to participate in a court-\nordered study of lawful demand for firearms and to cease sales in \nexcess of lawful demand, if you can imagine. Others require a \nprohibition on sales to dealers who are not stocking dealers with at \nleast $250,000 in inventory, talking about the small gun\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\ndealers. Others would require systematic monitoring of dealers' \npractices by manufacturers and distributors.\n  These are just a few of the sweeping demands made in the lawsuits \nthat the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act seeks to stop. As \nyou can tell, these suits are asking the courts to step well outside of \ntheir jurisdiction, to legislate regulation of the industry. They also \nhave nothing to do with holding accountable those who actually misuse \nthe firearms.\n  Most courts have dismissed such lawsuits that are brought before \nthem. A New York appellate court judge stated:\n\n       The plain fact is that the courts are the least suited, \n     least equipped, and thus the least appropriate branch of \n     government to regulate or micromanage the manufacturing, \n     marketing, distribution, and sale of handguns.\n\n  However, the time, expense, and effort that goes into defending these \nnuisance suits is a significant drain on the firearms industry, costing \njobs and millions of dollars, increasing business operating costs, \nincluding skyrocketing insurance costs, and threatening to put dealers \nand manufacturers out of business. That is why this bill is so \nnecessary.\n  Let me be clear about a couple the things. This bill will not close \nthe courthouse doors to legitimate suits against the firearms industry. \nIt will not shield the industry from its own wrongdoing or from its \nnegligence or if the industry puts out a bad product. For example, the \nbill will not require dismissal of a lawsuit if a member of the \nindustry breaks the law or if someone in the industry acts negligently \nin supplying a firearm to someone they have reason to believe is likely \nto misuse the firearm or supplies a firearm to someone they had reason \nto know was barred by Federal law from owning a firearm or a \nrepresentative of the industry who designs a defective product. The \nbill also doesn't protect unlicensed dealers. The bill would only \nprotect federally licensed manufacturers, dealers, or importers of \nfirearms.\n  This bill is only intended to protect law-abiding members of the \nfirearms industry from nuisance suits that have no basis in current \nlaw, that are only intended to regulate the industry or harass the \nindustry or put it out of business, none of which are appropriate \npurposes for a lawsuit.\n  Certainly, regulating the industry is well outside the appropriate \nrole of the courts.\n  We could all agree that when a firearm is used in a criminal or \ncareless manner that causes serious injury or loss of life, that is a \nterrible tragedy. Those responsible should be punished to the full \nextent of the law in both the civil and criminal areas. That includes \nthe firearms industry, if one of its members breaks the law or acts \nnegligently in selling a firearm to a criminal or other person they \nshould have known would use the firearm to hurt another person. The \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act will do nothing to change \nthat or shield the arms industry from criminal wrongdoing.\n  At the same time, it is not right or fair to hold law-abiding members \nof the industry accountable for independent actions of third parties \nwho use a firearm in a manner that industry never intended. Why, for \nexample, should the industry be held liable if a member of the industry \nsells a gun to a lawful customer and that gun is then stolen from a \ncustomer and used in a crime? That makes no sense.\n  Again, the fact that a crime occurred is sad and tragic, but that \ndoesn't mean that the firearms industry is in any way responsible for \nsuch a gross misuse of its product. But that is exactly what is \nhappening in some of these lawsuits. This bill would put a stop to \nthat. It is a very short, simple bill with a simple purpose. Nothing is \nhidden in it. It is also critically important to a vital national \nindustry. We need to pass it, pass it now, as the situation will only \nget worse. I ask my colleagues to give it their full support.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    HEALTH CARE AND COMPETITIVENESS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, every few minutes, a new Chevy Malibu, a \npopular family sedan, rolls off the assembly line of General Motors \nCorporation's Fairfax plant Kansas City, KS. The invoice price starts \nat $17,600.\n  And every few minutes, across the ocean, a new Toyota Camry, a \npopular family sedan, rolls off the assembly line of the Toyota Motor \nCorporation plant in near Nagoya, Japan. The invoice price starts at \nabout $16,600, a full $1,000 less than the Malibu.\n  One reason for the price difference between the Malibu and the Camry \nis health care. Yes, health care. For GM, health care costs amount to \nmore than $1,500 for every vehicle it produces. For Toyota, health care \ncosts account for closer to $500 for every vehicle that it produces. \nThat is about the thousand dollars difference.\n  Two-thirds of Americans get their health insurance at their jobs. The \nsystem started in World War II, when the Government capped wages. \nEmployers competed for workers by offering more generous fringe \nbenefits. After the war, a Government tax preference further encouraged \nemployers to provide health insurance.\n  Almost all Japanese get their health insurance through their \ngovernment. That is true of pretty much every other major \nindustrialized country.\n  America's system has yielded high health care costs. The average \nAmerican spends more than $5,000 a year on health care. That is 53 \npercent more than the next most costly country. The average Japanese \nspends only about $2,000 a year on health care.\n  Last year, GM paid $3.6 billion in health care costs for about \n450,000 retirees and their spouses. When GM workers retire, GM \ncontinues to pay much of their health care costs as part of the worker \nretiree benefits plan.\n  This year, 1,200 Japanese Toyota employees will retire. Within 2 \nyears, pretty much every one of them will switch from Toyota's health \ninsurance plan to the Japanese national plan. At that point, Toyota \nwill pay absolutely nothing in health care costs for those 1,200 \nretirees and their spouses.\n  General Motors provides more medical benefits than any other private \nentity. GM covers 1.1 million Americans, including workers, retirees, \nand their families. Last year, GM paid for more than 11 million \nprescriptions for its hourly workers.\n  Premiums for health insurance have increased 15 percent or more in \nmany years. GM expects that its health care bill will go up $1 billion \nthis year, to $6.2 billion total. That is a year. Last year, GM spent \n$1.4 billion on prescription drugs alone. Last year, GM put $9 billion \ninto a trust fund to pay for health care costs.\n  Remember, when those retirees leave Toyota, they do not cover the \nhealth care costs. The government does it in Japan.\n  In the late 1970s, GM controlled nearly half of the American car \nmarket. Since then, competitors such as Toyota, Nissan, and Honda have \ncut GM sales to about a quarter of the American market.\n  In the fiscal year ending March 2004, Toyota earned $10 billion in \nprofits. GM has now been losing money for three quarters in a row. GM \nlost more than a billion dollars in the first quarter of this year \nalone.\n  Toyota is making nearly $1,500 a car in profit. GM is losing more \nthan $2,300 per car.\n  Now, part of the blame for GM's declining market share lies with GM's \ninability to adjust to change. In the wake of the OPEC oil embargo, \nJapanese car makers sold low-cost, fuel-efficient cars to American \nfamilies. But OPEC imposed its oil embargo more than 30 years ago, and \nJapanese car companies still lead the way in energy-efficient cars. \nToday, only Toyota and Honda mass produce fuel-efficient hybrid sedans.\n  But part of the blame also lies with the American health care system. \nCarrying the burden of health care costs handicaps American companies \nin their race for global markets.\n  Americans are smart. Americans work hard. But American manufacturers \ncannot compete with foreign manufacturers when American companies have \nto bear the extra load of these higher health care costs.\n  You might think that because Americans pay more for health care, \nwell, at least we get better health care. But we do not.\n  The average American does not have better access to health services. \nForty-five million Americans lack health insurance. Fifteen percent of \nour population is uninsured. Japan offers better\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\naccess to the dialysis and diagnostic image services--MRIs and so \nforth--than America does.\n  Nor do we have better outcomes. That is a fancy term for saying our \npeople are not healthier after they see a doctor and go to the \nhospital. We are not better. The average American woman can expect to \nlive to age 79. The average Japanese woman can expect to live 5 years \nlonger, to age 84. People can expect to live longer in Canada, France, \nGermany, Sweden, Switzerland, and Britain. And all of those countries \nspend less per person on health care than do we.\n\n  America's fragmented system yields high administrative costs. In \n2003, administrative costs accounted for nearly a quarter of American \nhealth care costs. That is $400 billion--a quarter of what we spend on \nhealth care.\n  America is the only country in the industrialized world without a \nnational health system. We do not have a single-payer system like \nCanada, Britain, or Switzerland. Instead, we have a system of \nuncoordinated payers, from private insurers to Medicare, from employers \nto State Medicaid programs. It is very uncoordinated, very diverse.\n  America's massive $2 trillion health care bill ought to buy more. \nAmerica's health care system needs serious reform.\n  National health care reform appears unlikely any time soon. But we \nhave at our disposal--if Congress can act--the means to attack some of \nthe most glaring inefficiencies in our health care system and reduce \nunnecessary costs.\n  We can improve health care by facilitating the use of health \ninformation technology. We can improve health care by tying payment to \nthe quality and value of care, rather than just spending on whatever \nservices the doctors and hospital provide, irrespective of the quality \nand the outcome.\n  By encouraging investment in health information--technology, \ncomputers, interoperability, getting rid of the paperwork--we can \nreduce unnecessary administrative costs, and we can enhance patient \nsafety and clearly improve the quality of care.\n  Let me explain. America often invents new medical technologies. We \noften adopt new medical technologies early. We are leaders in the areas \nof drugs and devices, pills and procedures, science and surgeries.\n  But we have not complemented this innovation with the proper use of \nhealth information technology. The staggering cost of administering \nAmerican's pen and paper system of health care claims proves the point.\n  Mr. President, 30 to 40 percent of American health care transactions \nstill rely on paper claims. That is according to health economist, Ken \nThorpe of Emory University. These claims can cost from $5 to $20 each.\n  But administering health care claims electronically can cut those \ncosts to as little as 50 cents each. Professor Thorpe estimates that \nrequiring automated claims processing would save the Federal Government \nnearly $80 billion over 10 years. Significant savings would also accrue \nto the private sector, if it fully automated claims.\n  And proper use of health IT can prevent unnecessary medical errors, \nhospitalizations, and other health care services.\n  Each year, about 7,000 Americans die because of errors in \nadministering their medication. I also had a figure--and nobody \ndisputed this--that the equivalent of two 747s crashing today is the \nnumber of Americans who die today because of medical errors. That is \nmany more than people who die of gun deaths or in traffic accidents. \nThe equivalent of two 747s crashing every day is the number of \nAmericans who died on account of medical errors--not bad outcomes but \nmedical errors.\n  Technology can help ensure that medical professionals give the right \ndrug to the right patient at the right time. We are talking about \ndrugs. We can help to do that by putting bar codes on all drugs, and by \nusing health information technology to link medication administration \nto a patient's clinical information.\n  The inability to exchange clinical data among providers often causes \nduplication of diagnostic tests. Clearly, if you take somebody in \nMontana who goes on vacation in the great State of Louisiana and gets \nill--maybe has a heart attack--and he goes to see a doctor, or goes to \nthe emergency room, that doctor looks at the Montanan, administers some \ntests, and has no record of the Montanan who happens to be there on \nvacation--no idea what is going on. He has to start from scratch and \nrun all these tests all over again. Clearly, it is unnecessary \nduplication. Just think how much more efficient we would be if that \nLouisiana doctor in that hospital could push a button and my Montanan's \nhealth care record would be available. Clearly, it could protect the \nright of privacy and confidentiality, but just think of the savings \nthat can be made. Think of how much better the health care would be to \nmy Montanan in Louisiana.\n  We could help make it easier for one doctor to pull up that x ray \nthat another doctor took a week before. Duplication is eliminated and \nthe quality of care clearly improves.\n  Medicare spends $50,000 more for the average 65-year-old in Miami \nthan for the average 65-year-old in Minneapolis, MN--$50,000 more per \nbeneficiary in Miami than in Minneapolis, MN. You might ask, why is \nthat? In their last 6 months of life, Medicare beneficiaries in Miami \nvisited specialists six times more often than those in Minneapolis. You \nmight say, they are healthier; more is spent on them. Or they go \nbecause there are more specialists in Miami compared to Minneapolis. \nBut that is not what is happening.\n  By using health IT appropriately, we can reduce error and duplication \nand overuse of services. We can also coordinate senior care to ensure \nthat they receive adequate preventive care and management for their \nchronic conditions. In fact, patients who see primary care physicians \nin Minneapolis tend to be healthier, where fewer dollars are spent, \nthan do seniors in Miami who see more specialists. That is \ncounterintuitive, but that is the fact.\n  Why is America falling behind in health information technology? Part \nof the reason is lack of investment. The health care industry invests \nonly about 2 percent of its revenues in health information technology. \nOther information-intensive industries invest about 10 percent. Think \nof the banking industry.\n  As a result, many health practitioners in America have limited \ninformation technology capability. In Britain, nearly all general \npractitioners--98 percent--have a computer somewhere in their office. \nIn America, extremely few small physician practices--just 5 percent--\nuse anything but a pen and paper.\n  We have to help ensure that health information systems can \ncommunicate with one another. We need an agreed-upon set of standards \nso that health information technology systems can work together. \nOtherwise, we will have a Tower of Babel preventing communication of \ncritical health information.\n  We can do better, and that is why I have worked with my colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee and on the HELP Committee to introduce the Better \nHealthcare Through Information Technology Act, a bill which facilitates \nnationwide adoption of information technologies in the health care \nfield. It will help those systems to talk to one another, it will set \nup loans and grants to encourage the use of more health IT, and it will \nhelp us to improve health care quality.\n  We need to emphasize quality care. Medicare is the dominant care in \nAmerica's health system, but Medicare is at best neutral and at worst \nnegative toward quality. Medicare pays for the delivery of a service; \nMedicare does not pay for the achievement of health. And we see the \neffect. Patients receive recommended treatments only about half the \ntime, and more care is often not producing better care.\n  Among the 50 States, levels of cost and quality vary greatly. In my \nhome State of Montana, for example, Medicare spends about $5,000 per \nyear per beneficiary. Quality of care ranks near the top. By contrast, \nsome States spending around $7,000 a year per beneficiary--$2,000 \nmore--have quality that ranks near the bottom.\n  States such as Montana, with its higher proportion of primary care \npractitioners, often produce lower costs and better quality. Less \nexpensive care, when concentrated and patient centered, can do more for \na patient than high-cost services.\n  I have introduced a bill with my colleagues, Senators Grassley, Enzi, \nand Kennedy, that will build value into the\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\nway Medicare pays for its services. The Medicare Value Purchasing Act \nof 2005 will provide higher Medicare reimbursements to providers who \nshow they are working to improve the quality of care they deliver.\n  Together, these two bills I mentioned form a package. This quality \nbill goes hand in hand with the health IT bill I just mentioned. \nTogether, they will help improve American health care and help keep \nAmerican businesses competitive.\n  In his recent book about competitiveness, ``The World is Flat,'' Tom \nFriedman talks about the need to strengthen what he calls the \n``muscles'' of the individual American worker. Part of the solution to \nglobal competition, he says, lies in ensuring that the American health \ncare system provides our workers with access to health care services \nwithout placing them or their employers in financial jeopardy. That \nmeans congressional action on health quality, and it means \ncongressional action on health IT. I stand ready to work with my \ncolleagues to realize that goal. Until we act, health care costs will \ncontinue to make America less competitive. Until we start investing in \nhealth IT, we risk falling further behind. And until we start paying \nfor health care quality, we risk slowing our progress to a better \nfuture.\n  A little more than a century ago, in 1903, a man named Henry Ford \nestablished the Ford Motor Company in Detroit, MI. That same year, a \nman named Orville Wright became the first person to pilot an airplane \nin powered flight. Americans have been at the forefront of \ntransportation ever since. In 1929, the Duesenberg J, a premier four-\ndoor luxury sedan, began rolling off the assembly line. The price was \nexpensive at that time, starting at $13,000.\n  Like the automotive industry, health care has come a long way in the \nlast century. And like the automotive industry, health care needs to \nadjust and adjust dramatically to change. If we invest in health IT and \nstart paying for health care quality, we can help both the American \nautomobile industry and the American health care system to keep moving \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a moment or two, I am going to propound \na unanimous-consent request while the manager is here. Before I do \nthat, I congratulate the Senator from Montana for his analysis of \nhealth care costs in relationship to the manufacturing situation in \nwhich we find ourselves.\n  He has pointed out something which is critically important, which is \nthat of all the competition faced by American manufacturers, one of the \ncompetitive disadvantages we put them in is the health care system we \nhave compared to the health care systems their competitors have, \nleading to, for instance, in the automotive area, a disadvantage of \nsomething like $1,000 or $1,500 a car.\n  I congratulate him for his efforts in this particular area and many \nother areas as well.\n  I have one little minor note, and that is, the Senator from Montana \nis currently looking at the proud owner of a Ford hybrid. So America \nnow is manufacturing hybrids.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And may Ford produce many more.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May they produce many more. I thank the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. President, I want to for a couple minutes comment on the bill and \nthen make a unanimous-consent request that the amendment I will offer \nbe in order and that other amendments be laid aside. But first a moment \nor two of commentary.\n  The bill before us, S. 397, says that its purpose is ``to prohibit \ncivil liability actions from being brought or continued against \nmanufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or \nammunition for damages, injunctive or other relief resulting''--and \nhere are the keywords--``from the misuse of their products by others.''\n\n  On page 3, in section 2, findings and purposes, finding No. 6 is:\n\n       The possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry \n     for harm that is solely--\n\n  And that is the keyword--\n\n     solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system. . . \n     .\n\n  I happen to agree with that. If harm is solely caused by others, it \nwould be an abuse of the legal system to impose liability on someone \nwho did not contribute to somebody else's damage.\n  My amendment would make it clear, and I will just read one paragraph \nfrom my amendment:\n\n       That nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit a \n     civil liability action from being brought or continued \n     against a person if the gross negligence or reckless conduct \n     of that person was a proximate cause of death or injury.\n\n  What my amendment would do is basically take the words that are in \nthe stated purpose of this bill, which is that it is wrong that anyone \nhave liability imposed on them for harm that is solely caused by \nothers, and say that basically I accept that premise.\n  The problem with the bill is that it does not or could not or might \nnot allow for damages to be imposed where someone's own reckless or \ngross misconduct is a cause, a proximate cause, or contributes to \ndamages which others have.\n  This is an important part of this bill. We have a number of \nexceptions in the bill which are set forth. If somebody negligently \nentrusts a weapon to somebody else knowing that person will misuse it \nor if there is a violation of law or there are two other allowed \nlawsuits, but we surely should allow a lawsuit, particularly if State \nlaw allows it--and that is the key--but if State law allows the \nlawsuit, which most States do, against a person whose own gross \nnegligence, whose own recklessness is a proximate cause of somebody \nelse's damages, we should not prevent advertently or inadvertently that \ncause of action from being brought. State law would be displaced by \nthis bill. This is a radical departure in terms of tort liability \nbecause it would displace State law.\n  The traditional role of the States in tort liability would be \ndisplaced in this instance, and I think it is important that we take \nthe language that this bill says in its purpose is the purpose of the \nbill--that where harm is solely caused by others, that we should not \nallow liability to be imposed on some person who had no contributing \ncause or was not a contributing cause--it takes that stated purpose and \nputs into amendment form ``that nothing in this act would be construed \nto prohibit a civil liability action from being brought or continued \nagainst a person if that person's own gross negligence or own reckless \nconduct was a proximate cause of the death or injury.''\n  That is the explanation of my amendment. Now, with the manager's \nattention, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be laid \naside so that my amendment No. 1623, which I believe has been at the \ndesk for a number of hours, be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my colleague \nis most sincere in his effort. We received the amendment about 30 \nminutes ago. We are taking a look at it now. I remind my colleagues, \nSenator Levin offered a similar amendment last year that dealt with \ngross negligence and reckless conduct.\n  I must say, my frustration with these kinds of amendments are that \nthese are not well-defined terms. There are thousands, if not millions, \nof pages of case law that have attempted to define them, but not \nsuccessfully.\n  I suggest to the Senator, he refers to State law and State venue. \nThirty-three States have already very specifically restricted liability \nin the context of what we are attempting to do here. Thirty-three \nStates have already spoken. We did table this amendment last year by a \nfairly substantial margin. So at this time, until I have had a chance \nto review----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will withhold that objection for \n30 more seconds so I can respond to one point the good Senator said.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The term ``gross negligence'' is defined in my amendment \nas the term is defined in 42 United States Code 1791(B), and the term \n``reckless'' has the meaning given under section 2(A)1.4 of the Federal \nSentencing Guidelines. So we do define both terms very precisely as \nthey are already defined in two laws.\n  I appreciate the Senator withholding his objection at this time so I \ncould make that statement. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9110]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I do appreciate the Senator's effort, but \nat this time, until we have effectively reviewed the amendment, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                                 Trade\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, late this evening or perhaps tomorrow \nmorning, there will be a vote in the U.S. House on something called the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement. I have come to the Senate floor \nto speak about trade issues, but I especially want to discuss the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement, which passed in the Senate by a \nvery narrow margin. The estimate is that the votes do not exist to pass \nthis agreement it in the House.\n  Lord knows how many bridges and highways have been promised in the \nlast 48 hours, and it may very well be, at midnight tonight, magically \nthe votes sufficient to pass this trade agreement will appear and we \nwill have miles of highways and all kinds of bright bridges built in \nthis country in order to persuade wavering House Members to vote for \nthis awful trade agreement. It will be one more chapter in a boom of \nfailed trade strategy and will mean more Americans will lose their \njobs.\n  Incidentally, there are some people today from the textile area of \nthis country saying there will be some changes in CAFTA to protect the \ntextile industry, which presumably would require some other legislation \nto be passed to implement these changes.\n  Let me just say to anybody who thinks there are going to be any \nchanges to this, there will be nothing coming through this Senate that \nwill not be slowed down to the nth degree, and we will try in every way \npossible to block it. But also if anybody promises you that they will \ndo something in a trade agreement, don't believe it, it is not worth \nthe paper it is written on. I have papers in my desk going all the way \nback to the United States-Canadian Free Trade Agreement, that have \npromises in writing from the Trade Ambassador, Clayton Yeutter, that \ndidn't mean a thing, wasn't worth the paper it was written on. The same \nis true with sugar and sweeteners in Mexico. It could go on and on.\n  My hope is that those few who have been promised the Moon with \nrespect to some changes for the textile folks will not swallow that \nminnow tonight.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the Chair.)\n  I hope they will vote against CAFTA, and I hope the CAFTA trade \nagreement will be defeated. Let me say why. Similar to all the other \ntrade agreements, it sets us up for losing more jobs.\n  I am going to talk about a company I have spoken about a number of \ntimes on the Senate floor, but there is new news about this company \nwhich is what brings me to the floor at a time when we are all talking \nabout international trade. This company is kind of a poster child for \nwhat is going wrong in our economy. It is called the Huffy Bicycle \nCompany.\n  Now I have talked about this company before, and the reason I come to \nthe floor tonight is there is new news about Huffy Bicycles. Huffy \nBicycles makes a lot of bicycles. At one point in one plant I believe \nthey were making 19,000 bicycles a day. Huffy Bicycles had a \nsubstantial portion of the bicycle market in our country. They could be \nbought in Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Sears Roebuck. Everybody remembers Huffy \nBicycles. They can be found in most of our communities.\n  The problem is, Huffy Bicycles left this country. Their first plant \nin Dayton, OH dates back to 1898. They made bicycles under the brand \nname of Huffy for many decades. In fact, between the handle bar and the \nfront tire they had a little emblem on it that had the U.S. flag. When \nHuffy escaped our country, as have so many companies, to produce their \nbicycles in China, they replaced the flag with a little decal of the \nglobe. I am told it was the last job that the U.S. employees had when \nthat company moved its jobs to China. They had to take the existing \ninventory of bikes and change the U.S. flag on the bicycle to a globe.\n  Well, let me talk about the production plant in Celina, OH. This was \nthe headline in the Dayton Daily News, June 29, 2005. Now I told my \ncolleagues that Huffy Bicycles are not made in America any more. All \nthe folks that work for Huffy lost their jobs because these jobs are \nnow in China. Here is what happened last month: Huffy Corporation, a \n117-year-old bicycle and sporting goods company, on Tuesday, announced \nit wants to quit paying pension benefits and become a Chinese-\ncontrolled company.\n  Let me read that again. Huffy wants to quit paying its pension \nbenefits and become a Chinese-controlled company.\n  So how did that come to pass? Well, in 1998, the company celebrated \nits 100th anniversary by laying off 1,800 workers from its three \nplants. The jobs were outsourced both to Mexico and a plant in \nShenzhen, China. That plant is located in the very same Chinese city \nwhere Wal-Mart held its annual board meeting last year. Eight hundred \nfifty workers got fired by Huffy, and they earned $11 an hour, plus \nbenefits. The company felt that was way too much money to pay people to \nbuild bicycles.\n  Now those employees were not getting wealthy but they liked their \njobs. I have talked to some of them. They enjoyed working at Huffy. \nMany of them worked there for a lifetime, but their jobs went to a \nplant in Shenzhen, China. The workers there make 33 cents an hour. They \nwork 15-hour shifts, according to the reports from those who visited \nthe plants, they work from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m., 7 days a week. They \nare housed in crowded barracks and fed two meals a day. They have no \nhealth benefits, and when they get sick, as many do, they are fired. \nIf, of course, they tried to organize--there is no evidence that these \nworkers tried to organize--they not only would be fired, but precedent \nwould suggest some of them would be sent to prison for organizing for \nworkers' rights.\n  Even though the jobs are gone, the bicycles are still sold in \nAmerica, made in China but sold in America. Now, Huffy wants to become \na Chinese company. The vice president of the Chinese company that is \nplanning to buy Huffy said this:\n\n       We look forward to Huffy's future growth as one of \n     America's leading bicycle brands . . .\n\n  Notice he did not say one of America's leading bicycles because those \nbicycles are not made here any more, just ``one of America's leading \nbicycle brands.''\n  Meanwhile, the U.S. workers who lost their jobs read this in the \nDayton Daily News: Huffy to quit paying pension benefits and become a \nChinese company.\n  This is a letter that former Huffy employees received a couple of \nweeks ago. I obtained a copy of this letter from a former Huffy \nCorporation worker in Ohio with whom I spoke yesterday. This says that \nas a result of its Chapter XI, Huffy will be filing a motion asking the \nU.S. Bankruptcy Court to approve a distress termination of the Huffy \nretirement plan. If approved, the PBGC, Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, the Government agency that ensures these plans, will take \nover. It says: You are still going to get your benefits. That will not \nbe affected by this action. It is just that the PBGC, or the American \ntaxpayer, the Federal Government, will pay your retirement.\n  Then, down in the other portion, it says, but some may lose a portion \nof their retirement. You may not get all of your retirement.\n  So they want to become a Chinese company, make all their bikes in \nChina, sell their bikes in America and pawn off pensions that were \npromised to workers who used to work for Huffy to the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, which is guaranteed, of course, by the American \ntaxpayers.\n  The letter says: Your retirement benefits will not be affected by \nthis action, but after it states that retirees will receive their full \npension benefits, it says some may lose benefits. That is the fine \nprint.\n  As I said, I recently spoke to a former Huffy employee. The reason I \nam talking about this company is that it is symbolic of so many \ncompanies in exactly the same position. He told me that there are many \npeople who worked a lifetime for Huffy, and now they are worried sick. \nThey earned a pension because they worked every day, came to work every \nday, liked their job, were proud of the work they did, and now they are \nworried sick. Many older workers could only find low-wage jobs after \nbeing laid off and losing their jobs to China, so they were counting on \ntheir pensions to be there.\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\n  The workers at the Celina, OH, plant took a 30-percent wage and \nbenefit cut to keep their jobs at one point, only to have Huffy decide \nit did not matter.\n  The Huffy worker whom I spoke to yesterday told me something \npoignant. He said, when the workers at the plant in Celina, OH, lost \ntheir jobs, on the last day of work, as those employees left the \nparking lot for the last time, they left a pair of shoes in the place \nwhere their car had been parked. So when the last car left the lot, \nthere was a parking lot full of shoes. Workers wanted to tell this \ncompany that they had worked a lifetime for that company and loved \ntheir jobs. They wanted to say to that company: You are not going to \nfind people to fill our shoes, you just will not find people to fill \nour shoes. You can find people who will work for 30 cents an hour. You \ncan find people whom you can fire who want to join a labor union. You \ncan find people whom you put in a plant working 15 hours a day, 7 days \na week, but you will not find people who will fill these shoes.\n  Another worker who worked at the Celina plant was Ruth Schumaker. I \ndid not know Ruth Schumaker, but I came across her name when I began \nlooking at this case--I looked at many cases, Fruit of the Loom, Levis, \nFig Newton cookies, I can talk forever about these companies who have \nleft our country and taken their production elsewhere--Ruth Schumaker \nwas one of those employees who made bicycles. She had been paid $12 an \nhour. She worked 28 years and was very proud of her job. When she was \ntold she was going to be laid off, she was going to lose her job \nbecause it was going to China, she was not able to retire because she \nstill had many costs to deal with.\n  The only job she could find at that point was a part-time job at $7 \nan hour at the breakfast bar at the Holiday Inn. Her daughter said she \nnever quite got over the stress of losing that job. Ruth died 2 years \nago of cancer.\n  At the time they closed this plant, by the way, and moved these jobs \nto China and laid off Ruth and the last car left that parking lot with \nshoes in the parking spaces saying you will not fill these shoes, the \nCEO of that company was paying himself $771,000 a year. And, oh, by the \nway, Wal-Mart has expanded now in Celina. A Wal-Mart supercenter has \nbeen built on 50 acres that used to belong to Huffy. So it comes full \ncircle.\n  I talk about Huffy only because of this news, this venerable old \nbicycle company with bicycles built by American hands that were proud \nof their jobs, announces that it wants to become a Chinese company \nafter having moved all of its production to China. I have 33 pages--\nsingle-spaced, front and back--of information from the Department of \nLabor that describes jobs lost in this country this year by companies \nthat have certified to the Department of Labor, so their employees can \nget trade adjustment assistance, that they have moved certain jobs \noverseas or that certain jobs have been displaced by overseas trade. I \nhave 33 pages--front and back, single-spaced, in small lines--of the \nnames of the companies and the number of employees. That is just since \nthe first of this year.\n  The question is: Does anybody care? The answer likely is, not people \nwho matter, not people who can affect the outcome of this, certainly \nnot this Senate because by a handful of votes this Senate said, let us \njust keep doing this. Let us continue to give tax breaks to companies \nthat move their jobs overseas. Let us keep rewarding those who fire \nAmerican workers and move those jobs overseas. Let us say to the \nAmerican worker, you ought to have to compete against 30-cent-an-hour \nlabor, you ought to have to compete against people who work in unsafe \nplants and are put in jail if they try to join a labor union.\n  Tonight there will be a vote in the House on CAFTA, and likely the \nmessage coming from the House will be, let us do more of the same. My \ncolleagues from the South have all of these sayings, and former \nCongressman Stenholm always used to talk about the law of holes: When \nyou find yourself in a hole, you ought to stop digging. But that does \nnot seem to be the case with this Congress and international trade.\n  It is obvious to everyone this is not working. We have the biggest \ntrade deficit in the history of this country. We have massive job loss. \nWe have jobs that are moving outside of this country very quickly, and \nwhen American workers can find a job to replace the job they have lost, \nin most cases, they find a job paying 75 or 80 percent of their former \nincome.\n  The question for our kids and their kids is what kind of a country \nwill they inherit? We fought for a century over the conditions of \nproduction. We became the most productive country in the world. We are \nthe world's leading economic power and military power. But we will not \nlong remain the world's leading economic power without our major \nmanufacturing base, and that manufacturing base is shrinking \ndramatically. Again, nobody seems to care very much.\n  I have introduced legislation to address this. We get blocked. It \ncannot even come to the Senate floor, regrettably. When the next trade \nagreement comes to the floor that does exactly the same thing and sets \nup American workers against unfair foreign competition, this Congress \nembraces it like a teddy bear.\n  In September, I intend to provide three or four lengthier discussions \nabout international trade and talk about the specifics and remedies. \nToday, on the eve of the CAFTA vote in the House, I wished to call the \nattention of my colleagues to this company's story. It is so symbolic \nof the failure of our trade policy.\n\n  My hope is that perhaps, instead of talking about the general and \ninstead of talking about the theory of it all, perhaps we can start \nthinking about and talking about real Americans who go to work every \nmorning proud of their jobs, and who believe that this country they \nhave inherited ought to give them an opportunity to do well if they \nplay by the rules and do the things that are necessary.\n  The Pledge of Allegiance is not said everywhere these days. There is \na pledge in the board room, and a pledge to profits, but not \nnecessarily a pledge to this country's long-term economic health. I \nhope very much that is going to change, and I hope that the \ncircumstances that existed for these employees will one day call to \naction the conscience of this Congress, and that it will say, this \nought not to continue, this country can do better than that.\n  These people in this company, similar to the people in so many other \ncompanies I have talked about, did not lose their jobs and were not \nfired because they were not good Americans. It is because they could \nnot compete against 30-cent labor, and they could not compete against a \ncountry that says: Try to organize, and we will fire you. They could \nnot compete against a country that says to companies: Come on in, build \nyour plants here and dump your chemicals into the streams and into the \nair. They could not compete against a country that says: Come on in and \nput your workers in an unsafe plant because we are not going to have \nOSHA here, and we are not going to enforce safe workplaces. We cannot \ncompete against countries in which little kids are taken into a \nworkplace at ages 9, 10, 11, and 12 and locked into that workplace, and \nwhere then the work product comes out and goes to the shelves of stores \nin Fargo or Toledo or St. Louis, and then the American worker is told: \nCompete with that, compete with, that; if you cannot, you lose your \njob.\n  That is not the way we built this country. It is not the way Congress \nshould allow this trade strategy to continue. It is my hope that at \nsome point, some way, somehow in the days ahead we will be able to take \naction on the floor of the Senate and further strengthen this country's \nlong-term opportunities, help rebuild a manufacturing base, and give \npeople the opportunity in this country, and the belief in this country \nthere is an opportunity, for them and their families to have a good job \nthat pays well, with job security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COBURN). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object, I know the intent of the \nSenator from Virginia is to file an amendment at the desk and not usurp \nthe position of the current amendment that is before the Congress. I \nwould have to ask the Parliamentarian as to the priority of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment can only be laid aside \nby unanimous consent.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator does not have to lay the pending amendment \naside to file an amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, he does not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would object to the laying aside of the pending \namendment, which would not restrict the Senator's right to file an \namendment at the desk and speak about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment may be submitted for the Record.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I so amend my request to the Presiding \nOfficer for the purpose of filing the amendment. I marvel at the \nparliamentary situation of the managing of this bill. Perhaps if I had \ndone something similar, I would now be on the Defense bill. But \nnevertheless, we are where we are.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment, but I will file it at \nthe present time and hope at some point I can be recognized for the \npurpose of having this placed into the queue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can be recognized to discuss his \namendment at this time if he so desires.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thought I made that request to the Chair. I failed to \ncommunicate. I now make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to discuss his \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. From the outset, let me make it clear I have long been a \nsupporter of tort reform. I believe the proliferation of baseless \nlawsuits and runaway jury awards is having a profound negative effect \non many Americans, and indeed on the American economy. For these \nreasons I was a strong supporter of the Class Action Fairness Act that \nwas signed into law earlier this year. I also support reforming the \nasbestos litigation system and I support medical malpractice liability \nreform.\n  In my view, measured, balanced reforms to our tort system can address \nvery real problems. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Indeed, throughout history Congress has responded to very real \nproblems in our tort system by passing reasonable tort reform measures. \nIn 1994, Congress passed the General Aviation Revitalization Act. The \nlaw does not bar lawsuits altogether against the airline industry. \nInstead, it bars any product liability suit against a manufacturer \ninvolving planes more than 18 years old with fewer than 20 seats.\n  I remember that legislation as if it were yesterday, to the \neverlasting credit of one of my classmates, who joined when I came into \nthe Senate 20-some-odd years ago, Nancy Kassebaum. She was the author \nof that historic breakthrough in tort reform as a Senator.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food \nDonation Act. This law, which was intended to address the legal \nuncertainties that prevented food donation, provided limited immunity \nto certain individuals who are involved in the donation of food. It is \nimportant to note, however, that immunity does not apply in cases of \ngross negligence or intentional misconduct.\n  In 2001, Congress passed the Paul Coverdell Teacher Protection Act. \nWhat a wonderful man Senator Coverdell was. I so cherish the memories, \nhaving served with him here in this Chamber. This measure provided \nteachers with immunity from negligence lawsuits when teachers' actions \nare legal and in furtherance of efforts to control classroom \ndiscipline. The act did not immunize teachers from lawsuits claiming \ngross negligence or reckless or willful misconduct. So we see there has \nbeen a slow evolution of the law so that you don't give absolute \nimmunity, but immunity that is in a balanced way. That is the purpose \nof my amendment.\n\n  In my view, the proponents of the gun immunity bill have undoubtedly \nacted in good faith by trying to respond to another very real problem. \nWithout question, the gun industry in America is under legal siege, \nfighting lawsuits, many of them frivolous, all over the country.\n  I will have a letter printed in the Record from a gun manufacturer in \nmy State who indicates the seriousness of this problem and the \nlikelihood that the facility in Virginia may not survive unless some \nprotection is given to the manufacturing industry. I strongly support \nprotection to the manufacturing industry as provided in this bill.\n  My amendment goes to another provision in the bill, which I will \nenumerate momentarily.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. The costs incurred by the gun industry in defending these \nlawsuits is staggering. Indeed, the costs are so great that Beretta \nUSA, an American company that supplies weapons for the U.S. Armed \nForces, has written to me claiming that their ``ability to continue \noperations is threatened by these lawsuits.'' That is from the letter I \nplaced in the Record.\n  Without a doubt, I think some reasonable measure of tort reform is \nnecessary to protect the manufacturers. However, I must say I am deeply \nconcerned about the broad scope of this litigation in other areas. In \nmy view, it will undoubtedly have unintended consequences, but it is \nlikely that we in the Senate will not be able to recognize some of \nthese inequities until they occur. However, experiences in my State of \nVirginia make it clear to me that there is currently one unintended \nconsequence in the bill as drafted that, if not corrected now, could \nimpose a glaring inequity.\n  It is absolutely clear that this bill, if it had become law in a \nprevious Congress, would have prevented certain lawsuits brought by \nvictims of the snipers who wreaked havoc in the Virginia, DC, and \nMaryland area. In particular, this bill would have prevented the \nvictims and their families from ever having their day in court, to sue \na gun dealer, from which the snipers John Allen Muhammad and John Lee \nMalvo illegally received their weapon.\n  The facts surrounding this gun dealer continue to amaze me. According \nto reports, the DC area snipers ``stole'' a gun from this particular \ngun dealer in Washington State who had lost over 200 guns in the \nprevious 3 years.\n  I say those words ``lost'' or ``stolen'' carefully, because I am not \nsure how any legitimate, law-abiding dealer can lose or have stolen \nfrom its possession over 200 guns. But these were the facts that were \ndeveloped in this case.\n  In my view, gun dealers such as this one, which at best have an \nestablished history of irresponsibility of securing its firearm \ninventory and at worst show signs of illegal activity in who they sell \ntheir guns to, ought not to have the blanket immunity as provided in \nthis bill.\n  I can understand the need to protect responsible gun dealers from \nfrivolous lawsuits. I join those in seeking that effort. After all, if \na gun dealer is selling legal products to people legally entitled to \nbuy weapons, then the dealer has done nothing wrong and should not be \nlegally held responsible.\n  Indeed, in my view, the vast majority of gun dealers in America are \nfaithfully abiding by the law. They are deserving of protection, and I \nwould like to support the provisions of the bill that try to give that \nprotection.\n  But we need to make sure this bill does not immunize the \nirresponsible behavior of a gun store such as the one in Washington \nState. How do you ``lose'' or ``have stolen'' more than 200 weapons? In \nmy view, gun dealers who have established histories of lost or stolen \nweapons should not be immune from lawsuits when such a weapon is used \nto commit a violent crime. To give these dealers immunity in these \ncases is to give them a completely free pass from having to exercise \nany type of responsibility in securing or accounting for their weapons. \nThat is plain wrong.\n  Accordingly, the amendment I am offering tonight would make it \nabsolutely clear that victims of these types of crimes would be \nabsolutely able to pursue their cases against those very few \nirresponsible or unscrupulous gun dealers in America. My amendment\n\n[[Page S9113]]\n\nsimply says if a gun dealer has an established history of lost or \nstolen guns as defined by the Attorney General of the United States, \nand the lost or stolen gun is used in a way that causes death or injury \nto another, then that lawsuit would not be barred from its outset from \ngoing forward by the legislation now before the Senate.\n  In sum, this Warner amendment, which is based on the very real \ninstances in the Virginia, DC, and Maryland sniper cases, makes it \nclear that irresponsible gun dealers will not be given a free pass by \nthe Congress. It is a narrowly tailored amendment that will directly \naddress a very real scenario. I would like at this time to read the \nlanguage of the bill, together with my amendment.\n  I go to a section of the bill. I refer colleagues to page 8 of S. \n397, copies of which are on each Senator's desk. It provides as \nfollows:\n\n       An action brought against a seller for negligent \n     entrustment or negligence per se. . . .\n\n  I would add the following to it. My amendment reads: ``On page 8, \nline 21''--that is the line to which I have drawn the attention of the \nSenate--``before the semicolon, insert the following:''\n\n     . . . or an action against a seller that has an established \n     history of qualified products being lost or stolen, under \n     such criteria as shall be established by the Attorney General \n     by regulation--\n\n  That is the Attorney General of the United States--\n\n     --for an injury or death caused by a qualified product that \n     was in the possession of the seller, but subsequently lost or \n     stolen.\n\n  That provides, I think, and reposes in the proper authority the \nresponsibility to look at these cases and determine what has, in fact, \nbeen the record of this dealer.\n  As I understand it, the ATF keeps certain records, and other records \nare kept, perhaps, by the States to determine how this gun dealer \nconducted its business. The regulations would spell out the criteria, \nfirst of their record, and then how this weapon was stolen. So, in my \njudgment, I think it strengthens the legislation. If it is a case, as I \nsay, such as the sniper case in Virginia and Maryland--it captivated \nwith fear the people in this region. I think it is our duty, in drawing \nup this legislation, to ensure we are doing everything possible not to \nhave a repetition of that chapter.\n  I remember it so well because I was heavily involved with others in \nit. Certainly it was in my State. People didn't go out at night. People \ndidn't go to gas stations; they didn't go to the market. They lived in \nfear, and it was a serious impact on the economy in this region, not to \nmention the tragedy of the loss of life and injury inflicted by these \ntwo extraordinary criminal individuals who had obtained a gun in the \nState of Washington from a dealer who had a horrible record, a record \nwhich on its face spelled out the highest degree of negligence.\n  So I ask the managers, at the appropriate time, if I may bring up \nthis amendment, and I entrust to them a sense of fairness.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course. I would ask the Parliamentarian if they \nwould look at the amendment to determine whether, should cloture be \nfiled, it would be a germane amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be reviewed for the \nSenator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Which is to say that at this point in time I cannot \nobtain such ruling; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I yield to the wisdom of the Presiding Officer and \nthe Parliamentarian and at some point in time that judgment can be \nmade.\n  I yield the floor to my good friend.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I know he is sincere in \nthe offering of this amendment. Of course, it will be reviewed by the \nParliamentarian as to its germaneness postcloture. I would ask the \nSenator and his staff to examine the Frist amendment that was laid down \nand that is now pending because what we attempt to do by that amendment \nis to send a message, if you will, downline to federally licensed \nfirearms dealers that there is no forgiveness here to bad faith and/or \nto the misuse or the misconduct within the current Federal statutes. We \nare examining now, but clearly that Washington dealer that the Senator \nreferred to--\n  Mr. WARNER. Washington State.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Washington State dealer the Senator referred to--yes, \nthere are no gun dealers in Washington, this city--those were actions \nin violation of Federal firearms law. And of course the question is the \nadministering of the law, and clearly that amendment does so.\n  But I have seen the amendment in quick glance, will review it to see \nif there can be some accommodation here. I know the intent of the \nSenator. It is intent in good faith to do exactly what he said and that \nis exactly what we want done. We do not want those who are under the \numbrella of a federally licensed dealer to in any way misuse that law \nand not to be prosecuted for the misuse of that law.\n  That is the intent here. It is the frivolous lawsuits that we are \nattempting to block. We have been very clean and specific in the \nlanguage of the bill. We have even refined it over last year in a way \nthat I hope the Senator might be able to support in the end because I \nthink it clarifies a complicated situation that is currently before \nmanufacturers and licensed dealers.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will look at the Frist amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                             Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,\n\n\n                                                Beretta Drive,\n\n                                       Accokeek, MD, May 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     Vice President of the United States, Eisenhower Executive \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: A few weeks ago, the Washington, \n     D.C. Court of Appeals issued a decision supporting a D.C. \n     statute that holds the manufacturers of semiautomatic pistols \n     and rifles strictly liable for any crime committed in the \n     District with such a firearm.\n       Passed in 1991, the D.C. statute had not been used until \n     the District of Columbia recently filed a lawsuit against the \n     firearm industry in an attempt to hold firearm makers, \n     importers and distributors liable for the cost of criminal \n     gun misuse in the District. Although the Court of Appeals \n     (sitting en banc in the case D.C. v. Beretta U.S.A. et al.) \n     dismissed many parts of the case, it affirmed the D.C. strict \n     liability statute and, moreover, ruled that victims of gun \n     violence can sue firearm manufacturers simply to determine \n     whether that company's firearm was used in the victim's \n     shooting.\n       It is unlawful to possess most firearms in the District \n     (including semiautomatic pistols) and it is unlawful to \n     assault someone using a firearm. Notwithstanding these two \n     criminal acts, neither of which are within the control of or \n     can be prevented by firearm makers, the D.C. strict liability \n     statute (and the D.C. Court of Appeals decision supporting \n     it) will make firearm manufacturers liable for all costs \n     attributed to such shootings, even if the firearm involved \n     was originally sold in a state far from the District to a \n     lawful customer.\n       Beretta U.S.A. Corp. makes the standard sidearm for the \n     U.S. Armed Forces (the Beretta M9 9mm pistol). We have long-\n     term contracts right now to supply this pistol to our \n     fighting forces in Iraq and these pistols have been used \n     extensively in combat during the current campaign, just as \n     they have seen use since adopted by the Armed Forces in 1985. \n     Beretta U.S.A. also supplies pistols to law enforcement \n     departments throughout the U.S., including the Maryland State \n     Police, Los Angeles City Police Department and to the Chicago \n     Police Department. We also supply firearms used for self-\n     protection and for sporting purposes to private citizens \n     throughout our country.\n       The decision of the D.C. Court of Appeals to uphold the \n     D.C. strict liability statute has the likelihood of \n     bankrupting, not only Beretta U.S.A., but every maker of \n     semiautomatic pistols and rifles since 1991. There are \n     hundreds of homicides committed with firearms each year in \n     D.C. and additional hundreds of injuries involving \n     criminal misuse of firearms. No firearm maker has the \n     resources to defend against hundreds of lawsuits each year \n     and, if that company's pistol or rifle is determined to \n     have been used in a criminal shooting in the District, \n     these companies do not have the resources to pay the \n     resultant judgment against them--a judgment against which \n     they would have no defense if the pistol or rifle was \n     originally sold to a civilian customer.\n       When the D.C. law was passed in 1991 it was styled to apply \n     only to the makers of ``assault rifles'' and machineguns. \n     Strangely, the definition of ``machineguns'' in the statute \n     includes semiautomatic firearms capable of holding more than \n     12 rounds. Since any magazine-fed firearm is capable of \n     receiving magazines (whether made by the firearm manufacturer \n     or by someone else later) that hold more than 12 rounds, this \n     means that such a product is considered a machinegun in the \n     District, even though it is semi-automatic and even if it did \n     not hold 12 rounds at the time of its misuse.\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\n       The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (S. 397. H.R. \n     800) would stop this remarkable and egregious decision by the \n     D.C. Court of Appeals. The Act, if passed, will block \n     lawsuits against the makers, distributions and dealers of \n     firearms for criminal misuse of their products over which \n     they have no control.\n       We urgently request your support for this legislation. \n     Without it, companies like Beretta U.S.A., Colt, Smith & \n     Wesson, Ruger and dozens of others could be wiped out by a \n     flood of lawsuits emanating from the District.\n       This is not a theoretical concern. The instrument to \n     deprive U.S. citizens of the tools through which they enjoy \n     their 2nd Amendment freedoms now rests in the hands of trial \n     lawyers in the District Equally grave, control of the future \n     supply of firearms needed by our fighting forces and by law \n     enforcement officials and private citizens throughout the \n     U.S. also rests in the hands of these attorneys.\n       We will seek Supreme Court review of this decision, but the \n     result of a Supreme Court review is also not guaranteed. Your \n     help in supporting S. 397 and H.R. 800 might provide our only \n     other chance at survival.\n           Sincerest and respectful regards,\n                                                   Jeffrey K. Reh,\n                         General Counsel and Vice-General Manager.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think if Senator Reid is ready, I am \nready to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. REED. I am. Go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily set aside and that Senator Reed then be \nrecognized in order to call up amendment No. 1626 on behalf of Senator \nKohl; provided further that on Wednesday there be 1 hour equally \ndivided for debate in relation to the Kohl amendment and that following \nthe use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the Kohl amendment, with no amendment in order to the \namendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I should say, yes, I would amend that unanimous consent to \nsay Thursday, not Wednesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator wishes to make brief remarks, then I would \nput the Senate in morning business.\n  Mr. REED. I will bring up the amendment and make brief remarks.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Surely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1626\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will call up amendment 1626 on behalf of \nSenator Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for Mr. Kohl, proposes an \namendment numbered 1626.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, to \n  require the provision of a child safety lock in connection with the \n                         transfer of a handgun)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5.

and\n       (3) to avoid hindering industry from supplying firearms to \n     law abiding citizens for all lawful purposes, including \n     hunting, self-defense, collecting, and competitive or \n     recreational shooting.\n       (c) Firearms Safety.--\n       (1) Mandatory transfer of secure gun storage or safety \n     device.--Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(z) Secure Gun Storage or Safety Device.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided under paragraph (2), \n     it shall be unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed \n     manufacturer, or licensed dealer to sell, deliver, or \n     transfer any handgun to any person other than any person \n     licensed under this chapter, unless the transferee is \n     provided with a secure gun storage or safety device (as \n     defined in section 921(a)(34)) for that handgun.\n       ``(2) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to--\n       ``(A)(i) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession \n     by, the United States, a department or agency of the United \n     States, a State, or a department, agency, or political \n     subdivision of a State, of a handgun;

I thank the Chair.\n  Very briefly, this amendment is a very important one related to \nsafety for children with respect to firearms. There are more than \n10,000 accidental shootings a year in this country, and many of these \nshootings result in the senseless deaths of children, and many of those \naccidental deaths do not fully take into account the violence because, \nin addition to that, there are many young people who tragically use a \nfirearm to take their own lives. So we are looking at a situation where \nnearly 3,000 children, young people, die each year from gun-related \ninjuries. And this recitation of numbers is not only\n\n[[Page S9115]]\n\ngrim but to all of us, I believe, unacceptable and particularly painful \nto families who must bear this terrible loss.\n  This legislation is simple, straightforward, and effective. I must \ncommend Senator Kohl for his authorship and for his persistence in \npursuing this legislation. It mandates that a child safety lock device \nor trigger lock be sold with every handgun. Most locks resemble a \npadlock that locks around the gun trigger and immobilizes the trigger, \npreventing it from being used. These and other locks can be purchased \nfor every gun for less than $10 and thus used by thousands of gun \nowners to protect their firearms from unauthorized use.\n  This approach is supported by a huge number of individuals. In fact, \nthis Senate has gone on record previously overwhelmingly supporting \nthis amendment. Polls have shown that 73 percent of the American public \nsupports this amendment, including 6 out of 10 gun owners.\n  This legislation is not only well meaning and well intended, but it \ncould be very effective if we adopt it. I am pleased to see we are now \nmoving to consider this amendment. I am delighted that tomorrow morning \nwe will get a chance for further debate and a vote on this amendment.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Reed for his \ncooperation and effort today as we work our way through this \nlegislation. Several amendments that had have been brought to the floor \nwith an attempt to offer them we are looking to see if we can work with \nour colleagues in acceptance of them. We have a broad base of support \nfor the underlying legislation, and we want to be able to sustain that \nsupport as we go into final passage.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have now had the opportunity to review \nthe Frist amendment, No. 1606. This amendment simply restates that the \nAttorney General of the United States can continue to enforce current \nFederal firearms laws against those who violate them, including \ndealers. In my view, nothing in S. 397 would prohibit the Attorney \nGeneral from going forward in those matters. Nevertheless, at this \ntime, I have no objection to restating that authority, as proposed in \namendment No. 1606.\n  In my view, though, amendment No. 1606 does not address the \ncircumstances that my amendment seeks to remedy. The Attorney General \nhas always had the authority to enforce its gun laws yet some dealers \ncontinue to act irresponsibly. My concern is that the provisions of S. \n397 would completely immunize from lawsuits those irresponsible gun \ndealers who have an established history of repeatedly losing guns or \nhave an established history of firearms being stolen again and again \nfrom their inventory. If enacted without my amendment, S. 397 could \ncause the relatively small number of irresponsible gun deales to grow, \nnot shrink.\n  My amendment is precisely aimed at these irresponsible and \nunscrupulous gun dealers who repeatedly lose firearms and have firearms \nstolen from their inventory. This is exactly what happened in the DC \narea sniper case. The snipers, both of whom were not allowed under the \nlaw to purchase a firearm, apparently stole their weapon from a gun \nstore in Washington state that had previously lost or had stolen more \nthan 200 weapons over a short period of time. When a gun dealer has an \nestablished history of lost or stolen guns and that lost or stolen gun \nis used in the commission of a serious crime that causes death or \ninjury, it is a grave inequity to lock those victims out of the \ncourthouse doors.\n  While I have no objection to amendment No. 1606, it clearly does not \naddress the very real problem remedied by my amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9115-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, there has been a significant development in \nprivate pension law this week, and I have come to the floor to discuss \nit briefly because I think it is something that will be of enormous \ninterest to working families across the country who, of course, have \nbeen reading for months now about their pension plans going belly up. \nThese are workers who work hard, play by the rules, hope to have a \ndignified retirement and have understood that Social Security was never \ngoing to cover all of their retirement security needs. So they have \nsought to have a private pension, and companies across this country \nhave given them the impression--falsely, in a number of instances--that \ntheir private pension would be secure and there for them when they \nretire.\n  One of the aspects of this whole challenge, with respect to pension \nsecurity, has been to eliminate what I believe is a double standard \ntoday in private pension laws. There is in fact a double standard in \nprivate pension law because so often the executive retirement benefits \nget hidden in a lockbox while the worker ends up getting creamed in the \nprocess.\n  What we have done, on a bipartisan basis in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, is to say that that double standard, the standard that \nprotects the executives while it clobbers the workers, will no longer \nbe tolerated under our private pension statutes.\n  As a result of a change that a number of our colleagues worked on, \nwhich was backed by Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, if this \nprovision that we have developed becomes law, if a company pension plan \nis funded at less than 80 percent, then the executive pensions cannot \nbe hidden under the ruse of being ``deferred compensation.'' That is \nwhat we have seen come to light in the last few months, that somehow \nthe executives walk away with millions of dollars worth of pension \nbenefits under the guise of it somehow being something called deferred \ncompensation while the workers end up seeing their pensions disappear \nby 40, 50, 60 percent.\n  This provision, in my view, is extremely important because it will \nprevent companies whose pension plans are at risk of going under from \nprotecting the executive pension while allowing the employees' pensions \nto sink like a stone.\n  An example of this would be a flight attendant from Tigard, OR, who \ngave United Airlines 16 years of service, saw her pension fall recently \nto a net of $138 a month, while the CEO of United is going to continue \nto receive $4.5 million. Now, of course, the CEO claims it is not \nreally a pension, that this was compensation worked out before the \nexecutive came to United. But I can tell you that elderly woman in \nTigard, OR, would sure like to have what the United executive has, \nregardless of what it is technically referred to under pension law.\n  A lot more needs to be done to ensure that the executives are not \ngoing to reap these huge gains at the expense of their workers. Captain \nDuane Woerth of the Airline Pilots Association said it well, in my \nview, when he said, ``While thousands of pilots will retire with only a \nfraction of the pension benefits they earned and expected, airline \nexecutives can look forward to retirements knowing that their nest eggs \nare solid gold.'' This was reported in Fortune magazine. And there are \nnumerous other examples where generous executive pensions have been \nprotected at the expense of the workers' retirement.\n  In March of 2002, for example, US Air CEO Stephen Wolf took a lump-\nsum pension payout of $15 million, including benefits, for 24 years of \nservice that he never actually performed. Six months later, the company \nfiled for bankruptcy and terminated its pilot pension plan, leaving the \nPension Benefit Guarantee Corporation with $2.2 billion in liabilities. \nWhere is the fairness in all of that? The executive takes this huge \ngolden parachute away while the workers try to figure out how to make \nends meet when the company files for bankruptcy and terminates the \npension plan.\n  Three months before United filed for bankruptcy in 2002, the company\n\n[[Page S9116]]\n\nplaced $4.5 million in a special bankruptcy protected trust for their \nCEO, Mr. Glenn Tilton. United then terminated all of its pension plans \nin 2005, leaving the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation with $6.6 \nbillion in liability.\n  In 2002, the Motorola Company chose to not make any contributions to \nits pension plan for 70,000 employees and retirees, a plan that was \nunderfunded by $1.4 billion. At the same time, Motorola found another \n$38 million to give its top executives a variety of pension perks.\n  In 1999, IBM's cash balance conversion resulted in dramatic pension \ncuts for the older workers. It is still being litigated in the courts, \nbut in 2002, IBM CEO Lou Gerstner, who oversaw the cash conversion, \nretired with a pension of $1.1 million per year.\n  In November of 2002, Delta began phasing out its traditional defined \nbenefit plan for 56,000 employees and replaced it with a cash balance \npension plan. As Delta was shorting its workers, their former CEO got a \ngenerous guaranteed pension plan of $1 million per year that will be \navailable to him when he turns 65.\n  These are a few examples, Mr. President, of excessive executive \ngenerosity, and they have been particularly egregious in the airline \nsector, where there have been numerous threats of bankruptcy and actual \nproblems with respect to keeping the workers' pensions intact or even a \nportion of them secure.\n  I am pleased the Finance Committee took a significant first step \nyesterday toward cutting off this corporate spigot that has been \ngushing millions of dollars for executive pensions but produces less \nthan a trickle of funds for tens of thousands of hard-working \nAmericans. There is more to do.\n  Certainly the first step that began yesterday in the Senate Finance \nCommittee at ending this double standard came about because Chairman \nGrassley and Senator Baucus worked in a bipartisan fashion, and Senator \nBingaman, Senator Kerry, Senator Schumer, and others joined me in \npressing for this change. But suffice it to say there is more to do in \nthis area. Certainly the question of what companies are required to do \nin terms of making their premium payments is important. In the days \nahead the Finance Committee and eventually the Senate as a body will \nhave to take up these issues.\n  What I wanted to bring to the Senate's attention today is that this \nis an important start. It is a start that keeps faith with American \nworkers who have come to my townhall meetings. The Presiding Officer is \nfrom Georgia and represents a number of workers affected by the \nfinancial problems of Delta Airlines. People come to our town meetings \nand ask, how is it that the executives get off scot-free with respect \nto these pension issues while we are getting clobbered? I am tired of \nreading about how the executives have somehow been able, under the \nguise of deferred compensation or special retirement benefits that are \nprotected from bankruptcy proceedings, and I am tired of seeing how the \nexecutives always come out hunky-dory while the workers end up trying \nto figure how to make ends meet when their pensions have been slashed \nby 40, 50, or 60 percent.\n  There is more to do in terms of reforming private pension law, but \nthis effort to eliminate the double standard where executives get \nprotected and workers get hurt, eliminating that double standard is at \nthe center of what good bipartisan pension reform ought to be all \nabout. Fortunately, the Senate Committee on Finance took a big step in \nthe right direction by saying yesterday that if a company's pension \nplan is not actually funded, then the executives cannot find their way \nto yet another lockbox and protect themselves with these deferred \ncompensation arrangements.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9116-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JERMAIN TAYLOR\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me to \ntake a few moments for an important recognition for Arkansans. Today I \nrise to pay tribute to two very distinguished Arkansans, first to the \nnew and undefeated, undisputed middleweight champion of the world, \nJermain Taylor.\n  Jermain Taylors' skill in the boxing ring is only one reason for me \nto recognize him on the Senate floor. Jermain is one of boxing's rising \nyoung stars.\n  He is known for his skill and his power in the ring, but he is also \nknown for his grace and humility outside of the ring.\n  On July 16, Jermain, a Little Rock native, thrilled the people of \nArkansas when he stepped into a ring in Las Vegas, NV and took the \nmiddleweight championship of the world from Bernard Hopkins.\n  Jermain's victory that night was the culmination of a lifetime of \nhard work and sacrifice that began when he was just a small boy. When \nJermain was 5, he had to take on the responsibility of being the man of \nthe house after his father left the family.\n  Even at that young age, he took responsibility for his younger \nsisters without hesitation.\n  At the age of 13, he made his way into Ozell Nelson's gym and, though \nhe lost his first sparring session, he enjoyed the challenge and \nbelieved he would improve, and he could improve with hard work.\n  He did, and in 1996 he won the U.S. Under 19 Championships. In 2000, \nhe won a bronze medal while representing his country in the Olympic \nGames held in Sydney, Australia. Shortly thereafter he began his pro \ncareer.\n  By all accounts and by every measure, Jermain Taylor is a great \nfighter, but he is an even better person. He has been described as \nhumble, determined and one who knows that family comes first.\n  In short, he embodies the best of what being an Arkansan is all \nabout.\n  He is a self described country boy with country values. Being an old \nfarmer's daughter myself, I can vouch for the fact that there is \nnothing wrong with that.\n  Thousands of Arkansans traveled to Las Vegas to support their local \nhero. Chants of J.T. and the calling of the hogs could be heard \nthroughout the fight as Jermain outworked and outboxed his opponent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9116-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9116-S9117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO JACKSON T. ``JACK'' STEPHENS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I also now go to a sadder note and rise \nto pay tribute to a fallen pillar of the Arkansas business and \nphilanthropy community, Mr. Jack Stephens. Jack passed away quietly at \nhis home on Saturday, July 23, after a period of illness. He has been \nremarked to have been one of the most incredible businessmen in his \nlifetime. We have truly lost a visionary businessman who invested in \nhundreds of Arkansas companies, many of which became leaders in their \nindustry.\n  He also became one of my home State's most active philanthropists, \nnever forgetting his humble roots and the value of rural life. Jackson \nT. Stephens was born during the Roaring Twenties and was raised during \nthe Great Depression on a farm in south central Arkansas. He picked \ncotton and worked a mule on the farm before taking jobs in nearby Hope, \nAR, during his teens.\n  The Depression helped to shape a generation of Americans who valued \nevery penny and deeply respected the opportunities that freedom brings, \nthe opportunity to earn a living and to give back. Those lessons were \nnot lost on Jack Stephens. His parents A. J. and Ethel taught him the \nvalues of self-reliance, diligence, integrity, and hard work. His \nfather once told Jack, ``Success is not a destiny to be reached but the \nquality of the journey we make.''\n  After attending public schools in Prattsville, AR, and graduating \nhigh school from Columbia Military Academy in Columbia, TN, Jack \nStephens became a 1947 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. For the rest \nof his life, he remained close to many of his Naval Academy buddies, \nparticularly ADM William Crowe, Ambassador Vernon Weaver, and President \nJimmy Carter. He never forgot the important value of that education at \na service academy and, more importantly, his service to this great \nNation.\n  After finishing up at the Naval Academy, Jack joined his brother Witt \nStephens at his financial company, Stephens, Inc. The two of them built \none of the country's most premier investment banking firms, the largest \noff Wall Street.\n\n[[Page S9117]]\n\n  In recent years, Jack has been recognized for his philanthropy. He \nonce told a reporter there are only two pleasures associated with \nmoney: making it and giving it away.\n  For over 20 years, Jack has been the principal benefactor for the \nDelta Project, a program designed to assist and educate underprivileged \nchildren in Arkansas's delta. He also supported the City Educational \nTrust Fund. For 20 years, the trust fund has provided scholarships for \nstudents and incentive awards for innovative teachers.\n  Jack also gave $48 million to the University of Arkansas for Medical \nSciences. The money was used to build, equip, and support the Jackson \nT. Stephens Spine and Neuroscience Institute.\n  In 1997, he gave $5 million to support First Tee, a program designed \nto allow underprivileged children to learn about and play the game of \ngolf. He viewed First Tee as a teaching tool for children. He \nunderstood that the lessons of patience, respect, and following the \nrules the game of golf teaches could be used in any area of a child's \nlife and, more important, provided them the life skills they needed to \nbe a success in the future.\n  He also served from 1991 to 1998 as the fourth chairman of the \nAugusta National Golf Club, home of the Master's Golf Tournament. Jack \nalso gave about $20 million to the University of Arkansas at Little \nRock for a special events center that will be used for basketball.\n  In closing, I want to say a word about the character of Jack Stephens \nand the men and women of his generation. Jack came from a time when \nArkansans believed in the spirit of Arkansas. We in Arkansas believe in \nourselves. We believe in our family and our family of Arkansas people. \nWe believe in our dreams and the things we can accomplish when we work \nhard and we reach out to one another.\n  Men such as J. B. Hunt, Sam Walton, John Tyson, Witt Stephens, and \nJack Stephens believed in the values they were taught in Arkansas and \nknew that the best place to build a business was right there in their \nown backyard.\n  All of these men along with Jack Stephens, nurtured and invested in \nthe businesses and the people of their great State of Arkansas, knowing \nfull well that Arkansas, Arkansas's hard work, its ethics, its values, \ncould be marketed all across the globe.\n  In the 1980s, Jack Stephens was one of the first to venture and look \ntoward places in the East where investments could be made and \nrelationships built for future of the global economy in the 21st \ncentury. They set a high standard for all of Arkansas to follow. Many \nof us look to the image of Jack Stephens to know of the success that \ncan happen in Arkansas.\n  My thoughts and prayers go to the family and friends of Jack Stephens \nthis week, as we celebrate his wonderful life and cherish the moments \nthat were spent with him. The people of Arkansas can all be proud of \nJack Stephens and the life he lived. He contributed mightily to the \nwell-being of our State and to its people, all because he never forgot \nwhere he came from. I am sure the entire Senate will join with me as I \nhonor the well-lived life of Jackson T. ``Jack'' Stephens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9117-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9117-S9147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF H.R. 6\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled ``Description and \nTechnical Explanation of the Conference Agreement of H.R. 6, Title \nXIII, ``Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2005,'' prepared by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, dated July 27, 2005, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Description and Technical Explanation of the Conference Agreement of \n       H.R. 6, Title XIII, ``Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2005''\n\n                A.

The class lives of \n     assets placed in service after 1986 are generally set forth \n     in Revenue Procedure 87-56. Revenue Procedure 87-56 includes \n     two asset classes either of which could describe natural gas \n     gathering lines owned by nonproducers of natural gas. Asset \n     class 46.0, describing pipeline transportation, provides a \n     class life of 22 years and a recovery period of 15 years. \n     Asset class 13.2, describing assets used in the exploration \n     for and production of petroleum and natural gas deposits, \n     provides a class life of 14 years and a depreciation recovery \n     period of seven years. The uncertainty regarding the \n     appropriate recovery period of natural gas gathering lines \n     has resulted in litigation between taxpayers and the IRS. In \n     each of three recent cases, appellate courts have held that \n     natural gas gathering lines owned by nonprocedures fall \n     within the scope of Asset class 13.2 (i.e., seven-year \n     recovery period). The appellate court in each case reversed a \n     lower court holding that natural gas gathering lines owned by \n     nonproducers fall within the scope of Asset class 46.0 (i.e., \n     15-year recovery period).

A certified pollution control facility is defined as \n     a new, identifiable treatment facility which (1) is used in \n     connection with a plant in operation before January 1, 1976, \n     to abate or control water or atmospheric pollution or \n     contamination by removing, altering, disposing, storing, or \n     preventing the creation or emission of pollutants, \n     contaminants, wastes or heat; and (2) does not lead to a \n     significant increase in output or capacity, a significant \n     extension of useful life, a significant reduction in total \n     operating costs for such plant or other property (or any unit \n     thereof), or a significant alteration in the nature of a \n     manufacturing production process or facility. Certification \n     is required by appropriate State and Federal authorities that \n     the facility complies with appropriate standards.\n       For a pollution control facility with a useful life greater \n     than 15 years, only the portion of the basis attributable to \n     the first 15 years is eligible to be amortized over a 60-\n     month period. In addition, a corporate taxpayer must reduce \n     the amount of basis otherwise eligible for the 60-month \n     recovery by 20 percent. The amount of basis not eligible for \n     60-month amortization is depreciable under the regular tax \n     rules for depreciation.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       The House bill expands the provision allowing a taxpayer to \n     recover the cost of certain certified air pollution control \n     facilities (but not water pollution control facilities) over \n     60 months by repealing the requirement that only certified \n     pollution control facilities used in connection with a plant \n     in operation before January 1, 1976 qualify. Under the House \n     bill, a certified air pollution control facility which used \n     in connection with an electric generation plant which is \n     primarily coal fired will be eligible for 60-month \n     amortization regardless of whether the associated plant or \n     other property was in operation prior to January 1, 1976. In \n     the case of a facility used in connection with a plant or \n     other property not in operation before January 1, 1976, the \n     facility must be property that either (i) the construction, \n     reconstruction, or erection of which is completed by the \n     taxpayer after April 11, 2005 (to the extent of the portion \n     of the basis properly attributable to the construction, \n     reconstruction, or erection after that date), or (ii) is \n     acquired after April 11, 2005, if the original use of the \n     property commences with the taxpayer after that date. The \n     House bill does not change the present-law rules relating to \n     corporate taxpayers or to pollution control facilities with a \n     useful life greater than 15 years, and the House bill does \n     not modify in any way the treatment of water pollution \n     control facilities.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for air \n     pollution control facilities placed in service after April \n     11, 2005.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House bill, except \n     that the amortization period is 84 months (rather than 60 \n     months) for certified air pollution control facilities used \n     in connection with an electric generation plant which is \n     primarily coal fired and which was not in operation before \n     January 1, 1976.\n\n     5. Modification of credit for producing fuel from a non-\n       conventional source (sec. 1305 of the House bill, secs. \n       1321 and 1322 of the conference agreement, and sec. 29 and \n       new sec. 45K of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Certain fuels produced from ``non-conventional sources'' \n     and sold to unrelated parties are eligible for an income tax \n     credit equal to $3 (generally adjusted for inflation) per \n     barrel or Btu oil barrel equivalent (``section 29 credit''). \n     Qualified fuels must be produced within the United States.\n       Qualified fuels include:\n       oil produced from shale and tar sands;\n       gas produced from geopressured brine, Devonian shale, coal \n     seams, tight formations, or biomass; and\n       liquid, gaseous, or solid synthetic fuels produced from \n     coal (including lignite).\n       Generally, the section 29 credit has expired, except for \n     certain biomass gas and synthetic fuels sold before January \n     1, 2008, and produced at facilities placed in service after \n     December 31, 1992, and before July 1, 1998.\n       The section 29 credit may not exceed the excess of the \n     regular tax liability over the tentative minimum tax. Unused \n     section 29 credits may not be carried forward or carried back \n     to other taxable years. However, to the extent the section 29 \n     credit is disallowed because of the tentative minimum tax, \n     the minimum tax credit allowable in future years is increased \n     by the amount so disallowed.\n       Other business credits are included in the general business \n     credit (sec. 38). Generally, the general business credit may \n     not exceed the excess of the taxpayer's net income tax over \n     the greater of the taxpayer's tentative minimum tax or 25 \n     percent of so much of the taxpayer's net regular tax \n     liability as exceeds $25,000. General business credits in \n     excess of this limitation may be carried back one year and \n     forward up to 20 years. The section 29 credit is not part of \n     the general business credit.\n       The section 29 credit includes definitional cross-\n     references and a credit limitation relating to the Natural \n     Gas Policy Act of 1978. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 \n     has been repealed.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       The provision makes the credit for producing fuel from a \n     non-conventional source part of the general business credit. \n     Thus, the credit for producing fuel from a non-conventional \n     source will be subject to the limitations applicable to the \n     general business credit. Any unused credits may be carried \n     back one year and forward 20 years.\n       The provision also makes certain clerical changes in cross-\n     references to the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, which has \n     been repealed.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to credits \n     determined for taxable years ending after December 31, 2005. \n     The clerical changes are effective on the date of enactment.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House provision with \n     modifications. In addition to making the section 29 credit \n     part of the general business credit, the conference agreement \n     adds a production credit for qualified facilities that \n     produce coke or coke gas. Qualified facilities must have been \n     placed in service before January 1, 1993, or after June 30, \n     1998, and before January 1, 2010. The conferees understand \n     that a single facility for the production of coke or coke gas \n     is generally composed of multiple coke ovens or similar \n     structures.\n       The production credit may be claimed with respect to coke \n     and coke gas produced and sold during the period beginning on \n     the later of January 1, 2006, or the date such facility is \n     placed in service and ending on the date which is four years \n     after such period began. The amount of credit-eligible coke \n     produced may not exceed an average barrel-of-oil equivalent \n     of 4,000 barrels per day. The $3.00 credit for coke or coke \n     gas is indexed for inflation using 2004 as the base year \n     instead of 1979. A facility that has claimed a credit under \n     Code section 29(g) is not eligible to claim the new credit \n     for producing coke or coke gas.\n       The conferees understand that the Internal Revenue Service \n     has stopped issuing private letter rulings and other \n     taxpayer-specific guidance regarding the section 29 credit. \n     The conferees believe that the Internal Revenue Service \n     should consider issuing such rulings and guidance on an \n     expedited basis to those taxpayers who had pending ruling \n     requests at the time the moratorium was implemented.\n\n  6. Modification to special rules for nuclear decommissioning costs \n (sec. 1306 of the House bill, sec. 1310 of the conference agreement, \n                       and sec. 468A of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Overview\n       Special rules dealing with nuclear decommissioning reserve \n     funds were enacted in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 \n     (``1984 Act''), when tax issues regarding the time value of \n     money were addressed generally. Under general tax accounting \n     rules, a deduction for accrual basis taxpayers is deferred \n     until there is economic performance for the item for which \n     the deduction is claimed. However, the 1984 Act contains an \n     exception under which a taxpayer responsible for nuclear \n     powerplant decommissioning may elect to deduct contributions \n     made to a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund for future \n     decommissioning costs. Taxpayers who do not elect this \n     provision are subject to general tax accounting rules.\n     Qualified nuclear decommissioning fund\n       A qualified nuclear decommissioning fund (a ``qualified \n     fund'') is a segregated fund established by a taxpayer that \n     is used exclusively for the payment of decommissioning costs, \n     taxes on fund income, management costs of the fund, and for \n     making investments. The income of the fund is taxed at a \n     reduced rate of 20 percent for taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 1995.\n       Contributions to a qualified fund are deductible in the \n     year made to the extent that these amounts were collected as \n     part of the cost of service to ratepayers (the ``cost of \n     service requirement''). Funds withdrawn by the taxpayer to \n     pay for decommissioning costs are included in the taxpayer's \n     income, but the taxpayer also is entitled to a deduction for \n     decommissioning costs as economic performance for such costs \n     occurs.\n       Accumulations in a qualified fund are limited to the amount \n     required to fund decommissioning costs of a nuclear \n     powerplant for\n\n[[Page S9119]]\n\n     the period during which the qualified fund is in existence \n     (generally post-1984 decommissioning costs of a nuclear \n     powerplant). For this purpose, decommissioning costs are \n     considered to accrue ratably over a nuclear powerplant's \n     estimated useful life. In order to prevent accumulations of \n     funds over the remaining life of a nuclear powerplant in \n     excess of those required to pay future decommissioning costs \n     of such nuclear powerplant and to ensure that contributions \n     to a qualified fund are not deducted more rapidly than level \n     funding (taking into account an appropriate discount rate), \n     taxpayers must obtain a ruling from the IRS to establish the \n     maximum annual contribution that may be made to a qualified \n     fund (the ``ruling amount''). In certain instances (e.g., \n     change in estimates), a taxpayer is required to obtain a new \n     ruling amount to reflect updated information.\n       A qualified fund may be transferred in connection with the \n     sale, exchange or other transfer of the nuclear powerplant to \n     which it relates. If the transferee is a regulated public \n     utility and meets certain other requirements, the transfer \n     will be treated as a nontaxable transaction. No gain or loss \n     will be recognized on the transfer of the qualified fund and \n     the transferee will take the transferor's basis in the fund. \n     The transferee is required to obtain a new ruling amount from \n     the IRS or accept a discretionary determination by the IRS.\n     Nonqualified nuclear decommissioning funds\n       Federal and State regulators may require utilities to set \n     aside funds for nuclear decommissioning costs in excess of \n     the amount allowed as a deductible contribution to a \n     qualified fund. In addition, taxpayers may have set aside \n     funds prior to the effective date of the qualified fund \n     rules. The treatment of amounts set aside for decommissioning \n     costs prior to 1984 varies. Some taxpayers may have received \n     no tax benefit while others may have deducted such amounts or \n     excluded such amounts from income. Since 1984, taxpayers have \n     been required to include in gross income customer charges for \n     decommissioning costs (sec. 88), and a deduction has not been \n     allowed for amounts set aside to pay for decommissioning \n     costs except through the use of a qualified fund. Income \n     earned in a nonqualified fund is taxable to the fund's owner \n     as it is earned.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n     Repeal of cost of service requirement\n       The House bill repeals the cost of service requirement for \n     deductible contributions to a nuclear decommissioning fund. \n     Thus, all taxpayers, including unregulated taxpayers, are \n     allowed a deduction for amounts contributed to a qualified \n     fund.\n     Permit contributions to a qualified fund for pre-1984 \n         decommissioning costs\n       The House bill also repeals the limitation that a qualified \n     fund only accumulate an amount sufficient to pay for a \n     nuclear powerplant's decommissioning costs incurred during \n     the period that the qualified fund is in existence (generally \n     post-1984 decommissioning costs). Thus, any taxpayer is \n     permitted to accumulate an amount sufficient to cover the \n     present value of 100 percent of a nuclear powerplant's \n     estimated decommissioning costs in a qualified fund. The \n     House bill does not change the requirement that contributions \n     to a qualified fund not be deducted more rapidly than level \n     funding.\n     Exception to ruling amount for certain decommissioning costs\n       The House bill permits a taxpayer to make contributions to \n     a qualified fund in excess of the ruling amount in one \n     circumstance. Specifically, a taxpayer is permitted to \n     contribute up to the present value of total nuclear \n     decommissioning costs with respect to a nuclear powerplant \n     previously excluded under section 468A(d)(2)(A). It is \n     anticipated that an amount that is permitted to be \n     contributed under this special rule shall be determined using \n     the estimate of total decommissioning costs used for purposes \n     of determining the taxpayer's most recent ruling amount. Any \n     amount transferred to the qualified fund under this special \n     rule is allowed as a deduction over the remaining useful life \n     of the nuclear powerplant. If a qualified fund that has \n     received amounts under this rule is transferred to another \n     person, the transferor will be permitted a deduction for any \n     remaining deductible amounts at the time of transfer.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 2005.\n\n\n                              Senate Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House bill, with the \n     following modification. The conference agreement requires \n     that a taxpayer apply for a new ruling amount with respect to \n     a nuclear powerplant in any tax year in which the powerplant \n     is granted a license renewal, extending its useful life.\n\n 7. Arbitrage rules not to apply to prepayments for natural gas (sec. \n1307 of the House bill, sec. 1327 of the conference agreement, and sec. \n                            148 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Arbitrage restrictions\n       Interest on bonds issued by States or local governments to \n     finance activities carried out or paid for by those entities \n     generally is exempt from income tax. Restrictions are imposed \n     on the ability of States or local governments to invest the \n     proceeds of these bonds for profit (the ``arbitrage \n     restrictions''). One such restriction limits the use of bond \n     proceeds to acquire ``investment-type property.'' The term \n     investment-type property includes the acquisition of property \n     in a transaction involving a prepayment if a principal \n     purpose of the prepayment is to receive an investment return \n     from the time the prepayment is made until the time payment \n     otherwise would be made. A prepayment can produce prohibited \n     arbitrage profits when the discount received for prepaying \n     the costs exceeds the yield on the tax-exempt bonds. In \n     general, prohibited prepayments include all prepayments that \n     are not customary in an industry by both beneficiaries of \n     tax-exempt bonds and other persons using taxable financing \n     for the same transaction.\n       On August 4, 2003, the Treasury Department issued final \n     regulations deeming to be customary, and not in violation of \n     the arbitrage rules, certain prepayments for natural gas and \n     electricity. Generally, a qualified prepayment under the \n     regulations requires that 90 percent of the natural gas or \n     electricity purchased with the prepayment be used for a \n     qualifying use. Generally, natural gas is used for a \n     qualifying use if it is to be (1) furnished to retail gas \n     customers of the issuing municipal utility who are located in \n     the natural gas service area of the issuing municipal \n     utility, however, gas used to produce electricity for sale is \n     not included under this provision (2) used by the issuing \n     municipal utility to produce electricity that will be \n     furnished to retail electric service area customers of the \n     issuing utility, (3) used by the issuing municipal utility to \n     produce electricity that will be sold to a utility owned by a \n     governmental person and furnished to the service area retail \n     electric customers of the purchaser, (4) sold to a utility \n     that is owned by a governmental person if the requirements of \n     (1), (2) or (3) are satisfied by the purchasing utility \n     (treating the purchaser as the issuing utility) or (5) used \n     to fuel the pipeline transportation of the prepaid gas \n     supply. Electricity is used for a qualifying use if it is to \n     be (1) furnished to retail service area electric customers of \n     the issuing municipal utility or (2) sold to a municipal \n     utility and furnished to retail electric customers of the \n     purchaser who are located in the electricity service area of \n     the purchaser.\n     Private activity bond tests\n       State and local bonds may be classified as either \n     governmental bonds or private activity bonds. Governmental \n     bonds are bonds the proceeds of which are primarily used to \n     finance governmental functions or the debt is repaid with \n     governmental funds. Private activity bonds are bonds where \n     the State or local government serves as a conduit providing \n     financing to private businesses or individuals. A bond will \n     be treated as a private activity bond if more than five \n     percent of the proceeds of the bond issue, or, if less, more \n     than $5,000,000 is used (directly or indirectly) to make or \n     finance loans to persons other than governmental units (the \n     ``private loan financing test'') or if it meets the \n     requirements of a two-part private business test.\n       The exclusion from income for State and local bonds does \n     not apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are \n     issued for certain purposes permitted by the Code. Section \n     141(d) of the Code provides that the term ``private activity \n     bond'' includes any bond issued as part of an issue if the \n     amount of the proceeds of the issue which are to be used \n     (directly or indirectly) for the acquisition by a \n     governmental unit of nongovernmental output property exceeds \n     the lesser of five percent of such proceeds or $5 million. \n     ``Nongovernmental output property'' generally means any \n     property (or interest therein) which before such acquisition \n     was used (or held for use) by a person other than a \n     governmental unit in connection with an output facility \n     (other than a facility for the furnishing of water). An \n     exception applies to output property which is to be used in \n     connection with an output facility 95 percent or more of the \n     output of which will be consumed in (1) a qualified service \n     area of the governmental unit acquiring the property, or (2) \n     a qualified annexed area of such unit.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n     In general\n       The House bill creates a safe harbor exception to the \n     general rule that tax-exempt bond-financed prepayments \n     violate the arbitrage restrictions. The term ``investment \n     type property'' does not include a prepayment under a \n     qualified natural gas supply contract. The provision also \n     provides that such prepayments are not treated as private \n     loans for purposes of the private business tests.\n       Under the House bill, a prepayment financed with tax-exempt \n     bond proceeds for the purpose of obtaining a supply of \n     natural gas for service area customers of a governmental \n     utility is not treated as the acquisition of investment-type \n     property. A contract is a qualified natural gas contract if \n     the volume of natural gas secured for any year covered by the \n     prepayment does not exceed the sum of (1) the average annual \n     natural gas purchased (other than for resale) by customers of \n     the utility within the service area of the utility (``retail \n     natural gas consumption'') during the testing period, and (2) \n     the amount of natural gas that is needed to fuel \n     transportation of the natural gas to the governmental \n     utility. The testing period is the 5-calendar-year period \n     immediately preceding the calendar year in which the bonds\n\n[[Page S9120]]\n\n     are issued. A retail customer is one who does not purchase \n     natural gas for resale. Natural gas used to generate \n     electricity by a utility owned by a governmental unit is \n     counted as retail natural gas consumption if the electricity \n     was sold to retail customers within the service area of the \n     governmental electric utility.\n     Adjustments\n       The volume of gas permitted by the general rule is reduced \n     by natural gas otherwise available on the date of issuance. \n     Specifically, the amount of natural gas permitted to be \n     acquired under a qualified natural gas contract for any \n     period is to be reduced by the applicable share of natural \n     gas held by the utility on the date of issuance of the bonds \n     and natural gas that the utility has a right to acquire for \n     the prepayment period (determined as of the date of \n     issuance). For purposes of the preceding sentence, \n     ``applicable share'' means, with respect to any period, the \n     natural gas allocable to such period if the gas were \n     allocated ratably over the period to which the prepayment \n     relates.\n       For purposes of the safe harbor, if after the close of the \n     testing period and before the issue date of the bonds (1) the \n     government utility enters into a contract to supply natural \n     gas (other than for resale) for a commercial person for use \n     at a property within the service area of such utility and (2) \n     the gas consumption for such property was not included in the \n     testing period or the ratable amount of natural gas to be \n     supplied under the contract is significantly greater than the \n     ratable amount of gas supplied to such property during the \n     testing period, then the amount of gas permitted to be \n     purchased may be increased to accommodate the contract.\n       The calculation of average annual retail natural gas \n     consumption for purposes of the safe harbor, however, is not \n     to exceed the annual amount of natural gas reasonably \n     expected to be purchased (other than for resale) by persons \n     who are located within the service area of such utility and \n     who, as of the date of issuance of the issue, are customers \n     of such utility.\n     Intentional acts\n       The safe harbor does not apply if the utility engages in \n     intentional acts to render (1) the volume of natural gas \n     covered by the prepayment to be in excess of that needed for \n     retail natural gas consumption, and (2) the amount of natural \n     gas that is needed to fuel transportation of the natural gas \n     to the governmental utility.\n     Definition of service area\n       Service area is defined as (1) any area throughout which \n     the governmental utility provided (at all times during the \n     testing period) in the case of a natural gas utility, natural \n     gas transmission or distribution services, or in the case of \n     an electric utility, electricity distribution services; (2) \n     limited areas contiguous to such areas, and (3) any area \n     recognized as the service area of the governmental utility \n     under State or Federal law. Contiguous areas are limited to \n     any area within a county contiguous to the area described in \n     (1) in which retail customers of the utility are located if \n     such area is not also served by another utility providing the \n     same service.\n     Ruling request for higher prepayment amounts\n       Upon written request, the Secretary may allow an issuer to \n     prepay for an amount of gas greater than that allowed by the \n     safe harbor based on objective evidence of growth in gas \n     consumption or population that demonstrates that the amount \n     permitted by the exception is insufficient.\n     Nongovernmental output property restrictions\n       A qualified natural gas supply contract as defined in the \n     provision is not nongovernmental output property for purposes \n     of subsection (d) of section 141. Subsection (d) of section \n     141 does not apply to prepayment contracts for natural gas or \n     electricity that either under the Treasury regulations or \n     statutory safe harbor are not investment-type property for \n     purposes of the arbitrage rules under section 148. No \n     inference is intended regarding the application of subsection \n     141(d) to prepayment contracts not covered by the statutory \n     safe harbor or Treasury regulations.\n     Application to joint action agencies\n       In a number of States, joint action agencies serve as \n     purchasing agents for their member municipal gas utilities. \n     The provision is intended to allow municipal utilities in a \n     State to participate in such buying arrangements as \n     established under State law, subject to the same limitations \n     that would apply if an individual utility were to purchase \n     gas directly. When acting on behalf of its municipal gas \n     utility members, the total amount of gas that can be \n     purchased by a joint action agency under the provision's \n     exception to the arbitrage rules is the aggregate of what \n     each such member could purchase for itself on a direct basis. \n     Thus, with respect to qualified natural gas supply contracts \n     entered into by joint action agencies for or on behalf of one \n     or more member municipal utilities, the requirements of the \n     safe harbor are tested at the individual municipal utility \n     level based on the amount of gas that would be allocated to \n     such member during any year covered by the contract.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for bonds \n     issued after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House bill.\n     8. Determination of small refiner exception to oil depletion \n         deduction (sec. 1308 of the House bill, sec. 1328 of the \n         conference agreement, and sec. 613A of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law classifies oil and gas producers as independent \n     producers or integrated companies. The Code provides special \n     tax rules for operations by independent producers. One such \n     rule allows independent producers to claim percentage \n     depletion deductions rather than deducting the costs of their \n     asset, a producing well, based on actual production from the \n     well (i.e., cost depletion).\n       A producer is an independent producer only if its refining \n     and retail operations are relatively small. For example, an \n     independent producer may not have refining operations the \n     runs from which exceed 50,000 barrels on any day in the \n     taxable year during which independent producer status is \n     claimed. A refinery run is the volume of inputs of crude oil \n     (excluding any product derived from oil) into the refining \n     stream.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       The bill increases the current 50,000-barrel-per-day \n     limitation to 75,000. In addition, the bill changes the \n     refinery limitation on claiming independent producer status \n     from a limit based on actual daily production to a limit \n     based on average daily production for the taxable year. \n     Accordingly, the average daily refinery runs for the taxable \n     year may not exceed 75,000 barrels. For this purpose, the \n     taxpayer calculates average daily refinery runs by dividing \n     total refinery runs for the taxable year by the total number \n     of days in the taxable year.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable \n     years ending after date of enactment.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House bill.\n     9. Extension and modification of renewable electricity \n         production credit (secs. 1501-1503 of the Senate \n         amendment, secs. 1301 and 1302 of the conference \n         agreement, and sec. 45 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       An income tax credit is allowed for the production of \n     electricity from qualified facilities sold by the taxpayer to \n     an unrelated person (sec. 45). Qualified facilities comprise \n     wind energy facilities, closed-loop biomass facilities, open-\n     loop biomass (including agricultural livestock waste \n     nutrients) facilities, geothermal energy facilities, solar \n     energy facilities, small irrigation power facilities, \n     landfill gas facilities, and trash combustion facilities. In \n     addition, an income tax credit is allowed for the production \n     of refined coal.\n     Credit amounts and credit period\n       In general\n       The base amount of the credit is 1.5 cents per kilowatt-\n     hour (indexed for inflation) of electricity produced. The \n     amount of the credit is 1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for 2005. \n     A taxpayer may claim credit for the 10-year period commencing \n     with the date the qualified facility is placed in service. \n     The credit is reduced for grants, tax-exempt bonds, \n     subsidized energy financing, and other credits. The amount of \n     credit a taxpayer may claim is phased out as the market price \n     of electricity (or refined coal in the case of the refined \n     coal production credit) exceeds certain threshold levels.\n       Reduced credit amounts and credit periods\n       In the case of open-loop biomass facilities (including \n     agricultural livestock waste nutrient facilities), geothermal \n     energy facilities, solar energy facilities, small irrigation \n     power facilities, landfill gas facilities, and trash \n     combustion facilities, the 10-year credit period is reduced \n     to five years commencing on the date the facility is placed \n     in service. In general, for eligible pre-existing facilities \n     and other facilities placed in service prior to January 1, \n     2005, the credit period commences on January 1, 2005. In the \n     case of a closed-loop biomass facility modified to co-fire \n     with coal, to co-fire with other biomass, or to co-fire with \n     coal and other biomass, the credit period begins no earlier \n     than October 22, 2004.\n       In the case of open-loop biomass facilities (including \n     agricultural livestock waste nutrient facilities), small \n     irrigation power facilities, landfill gas facilities, and \n     trash combustion facilities, the otherwise allowable credit \n     amount is 0.75 cent per kilowatt-hour, indexed for inflation \n     measured after 1992 (currently 0.9 cents per kilowatt-hour \n     for 2005).\n       Credit applicable to refined coal\n       The amount of the credit for refined coal is $4.375 per ton \n     (also indexed for inflation after 1992 and equaling $5.481 \n     per ton for 2005).\n       Other limitations on credit claimants and credit amounts\n       In general, in order to claim the credit, a taxpayer must \n     own the qualified facility and sell the electricity produced \n     by the facility (or refined coal in the case of the refined \n     coal production credit) to an unrelated party. A lessee or \n     operator may claim the credit in lieu of the owner of the \n     qualifying facility in the case of qualifying open-loop \n     biomass facilities originally placed in service on or before \n     the date of enactment and in the case of a closed-loop \n     biomass facilities modified to co-fire with coal, to co-fire \n     with other biomass, or to co-fire with coal and\n\n[[Page S9121]]\n\n     other biomass. In the case of a poultry waste facility, the \n     taxpayer may claim the credit as a lessee or operator of a \n     facility owned by a governmental unit.\n       For all qualifying facilities, other than closed-loop \n     biomass facilities modified to co-fire with coal, to co-fire \n     with other biomass, or to co-fire with coal and other \n     biomass, the amount of credit a taxpayer may claim is reduced \n     by reason of grants, tax-exempt bonds, subsidized energy \n     financing, and other credits, but the reduction cannot exceed \n     50 percent of the otherwise allowable credit. In the case of \n     closed-loop biomass facilities modified to co-fire with coal, \n     to co-fire with other biomass, or to co-fire with coal and \n     other biomass, there is no reduction in credit by reason of \n     grants, tax-exempt bonds, subsidized energy financing, and \n     other credits.\n       The credit for electricity produced from renewable sources \n     is a component of the general business credit (sec. \n     38(b)(8)). Generally, the general business credit for any \n     taxable year may not exceed the amount by which the \n     taxpayer's net income tax exceeds the greater of the \n     tentative minimum tax or so much of the net regular tax \n     liability as exceeds $25,000. Excess credits may be carried \n     back one year and forward up to 20 years.\n       A taxpayer's tentative minimum tax is treated as being zero \n     for purposes of determining the tax liability limitation with \n     respect to the section 45 credit for electricity produced \n     from a facility (placed in service after October 22, 2004) \n     during the first four years of production beginning on the \n     date the facility is placed in service.\n     Qualified facilities\n       Wind energy facility\n       A wind energy facility is a facility that uses wind to \n     produce electricity. To be a qualified facility, a wind \n     energy facility must be placed in service after December 31, \n     1993, and before January 1, 2006.\n       Closed-loop biomass facility\n       A closed-loop biomass facility is a facility that uses any \n     organic material from a plant which is planted exclusively \n     for the purpose of being used at a qualifying facility to \n     produce electricity. In addition, a facility can be a closed-\n     loop biomass facility if it is a facility that is modified to \n     use closed-loop biomass to co-fire with coal, with other \n     biomass, or with both coal and other biomass, but only if the \n     modification is approved under the Biomass Power for Rural \n     Development Programs or is part of a pilot project of the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation.\n       To be a qualified facility, a closed-loop biomass facility \n     must be placed in service after December 31, 1992, and before \n     January 1, 2006. In the case of a facility using closed-loop \n     biomass but also co-firing the closed-loop biomass with coal, \n     other biomass, or coal and other biomass, a qualified \n     facility must be originally placed in service and modified to \n     co-fire the closed-loop biomass at any time before January 1, \n     2006.\n       Open-loop biomass (including agricultural livestock waste \n           nutrients) facility\n       An open-loop biomass facility is a facility using open-loop \n     biomass to produce electricity. Open-loop biomass is defined \n     as (1) any agricultural livestock waste nutrients, or (2) any \n     solid, nonhazardous, cellulosic or lignin waste material \n     which is segregated from other waste materials and which is \n     derived from certain forest-related resources, solid wood \n     waste materials, or agricultural sources. Eligible forest-\n     related resources are mill residues, other than spent \n     chemicals from pulp manufacturing, precommercial thinnings, \n     slash, and brush. Solid wood waste materials include waste \n     pallets, crates, dunnage, manufacturing and construction wood \n     wastes (other than pressure-treated, chemically-treated, or \n     painted wood wastes), and landscape or right-of-way tree \n     trimmings. Agricultural sources include orchard tree crops, \n     vineyard, grain, legumes, sugar, and other crop by-products \n     or residues. However, qualifying open-loop biomass does not \n     include municipal solid waste (garbage), gas derived from \n     biodegradation of solid waste, or paper that is commonly \n     recycled. In addition, open-loop biomass does not include \n     closed-loop biomass or any biomass burned in conjunction with \n     fossil fuel (co-firing) beyond such fossil fuel required for \n     start up and flame stabilization.\n       Agricultural livestock waste nutrients are defined as \n     agricultural livestock manure and litter, including bedding \n     material for the disposition of manure.\n       To be a qualified facility, an open-loop biomass facility \n     must be placed in service after October 22, 2004 and before \n     January 1, 2006, in the case of a facility using agricultural \n     livestock waste nutrients and must be placed in service at \n     any time prior to January 1, 2006 in the case of a facility \n     using other open-loop biomass.\n       Geothermal facility\n       A geothermal facility is a facility that uses geothermal \n     energy to produce electricity. Geothermal energy is energy \n     derived from a geothermal deposit which is a geothermal \n     reservoir consisting of natural heat which is stored in rocks \n     or in an aqueous liquid or vapor (whether or not under \n     pressure). To be a qualified facility, a geothermal facility \n     must be placed in service after October 22, 2004 and before \n     January 1, 2006.\n       Solar facility\n       A solar facility is a facility that uses solar energy to \n     produce electricity. To be a qualified facility, a solar \n     facility must be placed in service after October 22, 2004 and \n     before January 1, 2006.\n       Small irrigation facility\n       A small irrigation power facility is a facility that \n     generates electric power through an irrigation system canal \n     or ditch without any dam or impoundment of water. The \n     installed capacity of a qualified facility must be not less \n     than 150 kilowatts but less than five megawatts. To be a \n     qualified facility, a small irrigation facility must be \n     originally placed in service after October 22, 2004 and \n     before January 1, 2006.\n       Landfill gas facility\n       A landfill gas facility is a facility that uses landfill \n     gas to produce electricity. Landfill gas is defined as \n     methane gas derived from the biodegradation of municipal \n     solid waste. To be a qualified facility, a landfill gas \n     facility must be placed in service after October 22, 2004 and \n     before January 1, 2006.\n     Trash combustion facility\n       Trash combustion facilities are facilities that burn \n     municipal solid waste (garbage) to produce steam to drive a \n     turbine for the production of electricity. To be a qualified \n     facility, a trash combustion facility must be placed in \n     service after October 22, 2004 and before January 1, 2006.\n       Refined coal facility\n       A qualifying refined coal facility is a facility producing \n     refined coal that is placed in service after October 22, 2004 \n     and before January 1, 2009. Refined coal is a qualifying \n     liquid, gaseous, or solid synthetic fuel produced from coal \n     (including lignite) or high-carbon fly ash, including such \n     fuel used as a feedstock. A qualifying fuel is a fuel that \n     when burned emits 20 percent less nitrogen oxides and either \n     SO2 or mercury than the burning of feedstock coal \n     or comparable coal predominantly available in the marketplace \n     as of January 1, 2003, and if the fuel sells at prices at \n     least 50 percent greater than the prices of the feedstock \n     coal or comparable coal. In addition, to be qualified refined \n     coal the fuel must be sold by the taxpayer with the \n     reasonable expectation that it will be used for the primary \n     purpose of producing steam.\n     Summary of credit rate and credit period by facility type\n\n  TABLE 1.--SUMMARY OF SECTION 45 CREDIT FOR ELECTRICITY PRODUCED FROM\n              CERTAIN RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND REFINED COAL\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    Credit amount for    Credit period\n     Electricity produced from       2005  (cents per     (years from\n        renewable resources           kilowatt-hour;   placed-in-service\n                                     dollars per ton)       date)\\1\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWind..............................                1.9                 10\nClosed-loop biomass...............                1.9                 10\nOpen-loop biomass (including                      0.9                  5\n agricultural livestock waste\n nutrient facilities).............\nGeothermal........................                1.9                  5\n    Solar.........................                1.9                  5\nSmall irrigation power............                0.9                  5\nMunicipal solid waste (including                  0.9                  5\n landfill gas facilities and trash\n combustion facilities)...........\n                                   -------------------------------------\n    Refined Coal..................              5.481                 10\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For eligible pre-existing facilities and other facilities placed in\n  service prior to January 1, 2005, the credit period commences on\n  January 1, 2005. In the case of certain co-firing closed-loop\n  facilities, the credit period begins no earlier than October 22, 2004.\n\n     Taxation of cooperatives and their patrons\n       For Federal income tax purposes, a cooperative generally \n     computes its income as if it were a taxable corporation, with \n     one exception--the cooperative may exclude from its taxable \n     income distributions of patronage dividends. Generally, \n     cooperatives that are subject to the cooperative tax rules of \n     subchapter T of the Code are permitted a deduction for \n     patronage dividends from their taxable income only to the \n     extent of net income that is derived from transactions with \n     patrons who are members of the cooperative. The availability \n     of such deductions from taxable income has the effect of \n     allowing the cooperative to be treated like a conduit with \n     respect to profits derived from transactions with patrons who \n     are members of the cooperative. Present law does not permit \n     cooperatives to pass any portion of the income tax credit for \n     electricity production through to their patrons.\n\n\n                               house bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            senate amendment\n\n     Extension of placed-in-service date for qualifying facilities\n       The provision extends the placed-in-service date by three \n     years (through December 31, 2008) for the following \n     qualifying facilities: wind facilities; closed-loop biomass \n     facilities (including a facility co-firing the closed-loop \n     biomass with coal, other biomass, or coal and other biomass); \n     open-loop biomass facilities; geothermal facilities; small \n     irrigation power facilities; landfill gas facilities; and \n     trash combustion facilities. The proposal does not extend the \n     terminating placed-in-service date for solar facilities \n     (December 31, 2005) or refined coal facilities (December 31, \n     2008).\n     New qualifying energy resources\n       The provision adds three new qualifying energy resources: \n     fuel cells; hydropower; and wave, current, tidal, and ocean \n     thermal energy.\n       Fuel cells\n       A qualifying fuel cell facility is an integrated system \n     composed of a fuel cell stack assembly and associated balance \n     of plant components that converts a fuel into electricity \n     using electrochemical means. A qualifying facility must have \n     an electricity-\n\n[[Page S9122]]\n\n     only generation efficiency of greater than 30 percent, \n     generate at least 0.5 megawatt of electricity, and be placed \n     in service after December 31, 2005 and before January 1, \n     2009.\n       Hydropower\n       A qualifying hydropower facility is (1) a facility that \n     produced hydroelectric power (a hydroelectric dam) prior to \n     the date of enactment at which efficiency improvements or \n     additions to capacity have been made after the date of \n     enactment and before January 1, 2009, that enable the \n     taxpayer to produce incremental hydropower or (2) a facility \n     placed in service before the date of enactment that did not \n     produce hydroelectric power (a nonhydroelectric dam) on the \n     date of enactment and to which turbines or other electricity \n     generating equipment have been added after the date of \n     enactment and before January 1, 2009.\n       At an existing hydroelectric facility, the taxpayer may \n     only claim credit for the production of incremental \n     hydroelectric power. Incremental hydroelectric power for any \n     taxable year is equal to the percentage of average annual \n     hydroelectric power produced at the facility attributable to \n     the efficiency improvement or additions of capacity \n     determined by using the same water flow information used to \n     determine an historic average annual hydroelectric power \n     production baseline for that facility. The Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission will certify the baseline power \n     production of the facility and the percentage increase due to \n     the efficiency and capacity improvements.\n       At a nonhydroelectric dam, the facility must be licensed by \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and meet all other \n     applicable environmental, licensing, and regulatory \n     requirements and the turbines or other generating devices are \n     added to the facility after the date of enactment and before \n     January 1, 2009. In addition there must not be any \n     enlargement of the diversion structure, or construction or \n     enlargement of a bypass channel, or the impoundment or any \n     withholding of additional water from the natural stream \n     channel.\n       In the case of electricity generated from a qualifying \n     hydropower facility, the taxpayer may claim a credit equal to \n     one-half the otherwise allowable amount.\n       Wave, current, tidal, and ocean thermal energy\n       A qualifying wave, current, tidal, and ocean thermal energy \n     facility is a facility placed in service after the date of \n     enactment and before January 1, 2009 that uses free flowing \n     ocean water derived from tidal currents, ocean currents, \n     waves, or estuary currents, ocean thermal energy, or free \n     flowing water in rivers, lakes, man-made channels, or streams \n     to produce electricity. However, a qualifying facility does \n     not include any facility that includes impoundment structures \n     or a small irrigation power facility.\n     Equalization of credit period for all qualifying renewable \n         resources\n       The provision extends the credit period from five years to \n     10 years for electricity produced from qualifying open-loop \n     biomass facilities (including agricultural livestock waste \n     nutrient facilities), geothermal facilities, solar \n     facilities, small irrigation power facilities, landfill gas \n     facilities, and trash combustion facilities placed in service \n     after the date of enactment. The provision also provides that \n     for electricity produced from the energy resources newly \n     qualified under the bill--fuel cells, hydropower, and wave, \n     current, tidal, and ocean thermal energy--the credit period \n     is 10 years.\n     Clarification of units added to pre-existing trash combustion \n         facilities\n       The provision clarifies that a qualifying trash combustion \n     facility includes a new unit, placed in service after October \n     22, 2004, that increases electricity production capacity at \n     an existing trash combustion facility. A new unit generally \n     would include a new burner/boiler and turbine. The new unit \n     may share certain common equipment, such as trash handling \n     equipment, with other pre-existing units at the same \n     facility. Electricity produced at a new unit of an existing \n     facility qualifies for the production credit only to the \n     extent of the increased amount of electricity produced at the \n     entire facility.\n     Taxation of cooperatives and their patrons\n       The Senate amendment allows eligible cooperatives to elect \n     to pass any portion of the credit through to their patrons. \n     An eligible cooperative is defined as a cooperative \n     organization that is owned more than 50 percent by \n     agricultural producers or entities owned by agricultural \n     producers.\n       Under the Senate amendment, the credit may be apportioned \n     among patrons eligible to share in patronage dividends on the \n     basis of the quantity or value of business done with or for \n     such patrons for the taxable year. The election must be made \n     on a timely filed return for the taxable year, and once made, \n     is irrevocable for such taxable year.\n       The amount of the credit apportioned to patrons is not \n     included in the organization's credit for the taxable year of \n     the organization. The amount of the credit apportioned to a \n     patron is included in the taxable year the patron with or \n     within which the taxable year of the organization ends. If \n     the amount of the credit for any taxable year is less than \n     the amount of the credit shown on the cooperative's return \n     for such taxable year, an amount equal to the excess of the \n     reduction in the credit over the amount not apportioned to \n     patrons for the taxable year is treated as an increase in the \n     cooperative's tax. The increase is not treated as tax imposed \n     for purposes of determining the amount of any tax credit.\n       Effective date.--The provision generally is effective on \n     the date of enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     modifications.\n     Extension of placed-in-service date for qualifying facilities\n       The conference agreement extends the placed-in-service date \n     by two years (through December 31, 2007) for the following \n     qualifying facilities: wind facilities; closed-loop biomass \n     facilities (including a facility co-firing the closed-loop \n     biomass with coal, other biomass, or coal and other biomass); \n     open-loop biomass facilities; geothermal facilities; small \n     irrigation power facilities; landfill gas facilities; and \n     trash combustion facilities. The conference agreement does \n     not alter the terminating placed-in-service date for solar \n     facilities (December 31, 2005) or refined coal facilities \n     (December 31, 2008).\n     New qualifying energy resources\n       The conference agreement adds two new qualifying energy \n     resources: hydropower; and Indian coal.\n       Hydropower\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     respect to hydropower.\n       Indian coal\n       The conference agreement adds Indian coal as a new energy \n     source. The taxpayer may claim a credit for sales of coal to \n     an unrelated third party from a qualified facility for the \n     seven- year period beginning on January 1, 2006, and ending \n     after December 31, 2012. The value of the credit is $1.50 per \n     ton for the first four years of the seven-year period and \n     $2.00 per ton for the last three years of the seven-year \n     period. The credit amounts are indexed for inflation. A \n     qualified Indian coal facility is a facility that produces \n     coal from reserves that on June 14, 2005, were owned by a \n     Federally recognized tribe of Indians or were held in trust \n     by the United States for a tribe or its members.\n     Equalization of credit period for all qualifying renewable \n         resources\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     respect to equalization of the credit period for qualifying \n     open-loop biomass facilities (including agricultural \n     livestock waste nutrient facilities), geothermal facilities, \n     solar facilities, small irrigation power facilities, landfill \n     gas facilities, trash combustion facilities, and hydropower \n     facilities. The conference agreement provides a seven-year \n     credit period for Indian coal facilities, as explained above.\n     Clarification of units added to pre-existing trash combustion \n         facilities\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     respect to clarification of units added to pre-existing trash \n     combustion facilities.\n     Taxation of cooperatives and their patrons\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     respect to the taxation of cooperatives and their patrons.\n       Effective date.--The provision generally is effective on \n     the date of enactment. With respect to the taxation of \n     cooperatives and their patrons, the provision applies to \n     taxable years ending after the date of enactment.\n     10. Clean renewable energy bonds (sec. 1504 of the Senate \n         amendment, sec. 1303 of the conference agreement, and new \n         sec. 54 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present law\n\n     Tax-exempt bonds\n       Interest on State and local governmental bonds generally is \n     excluded from gross income for Federal income tax purposes if \n     the proceeds of the bonds are used to finance direct \n     activities of these governmental units or if the bonds are \n     repaid with revenues of the governmental units. Subject to \n     certain restrictions, activities that can be financed with \n     these tax-exempt bonds include electric power facilities \n     (i.e., generation, transmission, distribution, and \n     retailing).\n       Generally, interest on State or local government bonds to \n     finance activities of private persons (``private activity \n     bonds'') is taxable unless a specific exception is contained \n     in the Code. The term ``private person'' generally includes \n     the Federal Government and all other individuals and entities \n     other than States or local governments. The Code includes \n     exceptions permitting States or local governments to act as \n     conduits providing tax-exempt financing for certain private \n     activities. In most cases, the aggregate volume of these tax-\n     exempt private activity bonds is restricted by annual \n     aggregate volume limits imposed on bonds issued by issuers \n     within each State. For calendar year 2005, the State volume \n     cap is the greater of $80 per resident or $239 million. The \n     Code imposes several additional restrictions on tax-exempt \n     private activity bonds that do not apply to bonds for \n     governmental activities.\n       The tax exemption for State and local bonds also does not \n     apply to any arbitrage bond. An arbitrage bond is defined as \n     any bond that is part of an issue if any proceeds of the \n     issue are reasonably expected to be used (or intentionally \n     are used) to acquire higher yielding investments or to \n     replace funds that are used to acquire higher yielding \n     investments. In general, arbitrage profits may be earned only \n     during specified periods (e.g., defined ``temporary \n     periods'') before funds are needed for the purpose of the \n     borrowing or on specified types of investments\n\n[[Page S9123]]\n\n     (e.g., ``reasonably required reserve or replacement funds''). \n     Subject to limited exceptions, investment profits that are \n     earned during these periods or on such investments must be \n     rebated to the Federal government.\n       An issuer must file with the IRS certain information in \n     order for a bond issue to be tax-exempt. Generally, this \n     information return is required to be filed no later the 15th \n     day of the second month after the close of the calendar \n     quarter in which the bonds were issued.\n     Qualified zone academy bonds\n       As an alternative to traditional tax-exempt bonds, States \n     and local governments may issue ``qualified zone academy \n     bonds.'' ``Qualified zone academy bonds'' are defined as any \n     bond issued by a State or local government, provided that (1) \n     at least 95 percent of the proceeds are used for the purpose \n     of renovating, providing equipment to, developing course \n     materials for use at, or training teachers and other school \n     personnel in a ``qualified zone academy'' and (2) private \n     entities have promised to contribute to the qualified zone \n     academy certain equipment, technical assistance or training, \n     employee services, or other property or services with a value \n     equal to at least 10 percent of the bond proceeds. A school \n     is a ``qualified zone academy'' if (1) the school is a public \n     school that provides education and training below the college \n     level, (2) the school operates a special academic program in \n     cooperation with businesses to enhance the academic \n     curriculum and increase graduation and employment rates, and \n     (3) either (a) the school is located in an empowerment zone \n     or enterprise community designated under the Code, or (b) it \n     is reasonably expected that at least 35 percent of the \n     students at the school will be eligible for free or reduced-\n     cost lunches under the school lunch program established under \n     the National School Lunch Act.\n       Financial institutions that hold qualified zone academy \n     bonds are entitled to a nonrefundable tax credit in an amount \n     equal to a credit rate multiplied by the face amount of the \n     bond. The Treasury Department sets the credit rate at a rate \n     estimated to allow issuance of qualified zone academy bonds \n     without discount and without interest cost to the issuer. The \n     credit is includable in gross income (as if it were a taxable \n     interest payment on the bond), and may be claimed against \n     regular income tax and AMT liability. The maximum term of the \n     bond is determined by the Treasury Department, so that the \n     present value of the obligation to repay the bond is 50 \n     percent of the face value of the bond.\n       There is an annual limitation of $400 million on the amount \n     of qualified zone academy bonds that may be issued in \n     calendar years 1998 through 2005. The $400 million aggregate \n     bond cap is allocated each year to the States according to \n     their respective populations of individuals below the poverty \n     line. Each State, in turn, allocates the credit authority to \n     qualified zone academies within such State.\n     Tax credits for production of electricity from renewable \n         sources\n       An income tax credit is allowed for the production of \n     electricity from qualified facilities sold by the taxpayer to \n     an unrelated person. The base amount of the credit is 1.5 \n     cents per kilowatt-hour (indexed for inflation) of \n     electricity produced. The amount of the credit is 1.9 cents \n     per kilowatt-hour for 2005. A taxpayer may claim credit for \n     the 10-year period commencing with the date the qualified \n     facility is placed in service. The credit is reduced for \n     grants, tax-exempt bonds, subsidized energy financing, and \n     other credits. The amount of credit a taxpayer may claim is \n     phased out as the market price of electricity (or refined \n     coal in the case of or refined coal production credit) \n     exceeds certain threshold levels.\n       Qualified facilities comprise wind energy facilities, \n     closed-loop biomass facilities, open-loop biomass (including \n     agricultural livestock waste nutrients) facilities, \n     geothermal energy facilities, solar energy facilities, small \n     irrigation power facilities, landfill gas facilities, and \n     trash combustion facilities. In addition, an income tax \n     credit is allowed for the production of refined coal.\n       For purposes of the credit, qualified facilities must be \n     placed in service by certain dates. However, with the \n     exception of qualifying refined coal facilities, in no event \n     may qualifying facilities be placed in service after December \n     31, 2005.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision creates a new category of tax credit bonds: \n     Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (``CREBs''). CREBs are defined \n     as any bond issued by a qualified issuer if, in addition to \n     the requirements discussed below, 95 percent or more of the \n     proceeds of such bonds are used to finance capital \n     expenditures incurred by qualified borrowers for facilities \n     that qualify for the tax credit under section 45 (``qualified \n     projects''), without regard to the placed-in-service date \n     requirements of that section.\n       Like qualified zone academy bonds, CREBs are not interest-\n     bearing obligations. Rather, the taxpayer holding CREBs on a \n     credit allowance date would be entitled to a tax credit. The \n     amount of the credit is determined by multiplying the bond's \n     credit rate by the face amount on the holder's bond. The \n     credit rate on the bonds is determined by the Secretary and \n     is to be a rate that permits issuance of CREBs without \n     discount and interest cost to the qualified issuer. The \n     credit accrues quarterly and is includible in gross income \n     (as if it were an interest payment on the bond), and can be \n     claimed against regular income tax liability and alternative \n     minimum tax liability.\n       The provision also imposes a maximum maturity limitation on \n     any CREBs. The maximum maturity is the term which the \n     Secretary estimates will result in the present value of the \n     obligation to repay the principal on a CREBs being equal to \n     50 percent of the face amount of such bond. Moreover, the \n     provision requires level amortization of CREBs during the \n     period such bonds are outstanding.\n       For purposes of the provision, ``qualified issuers'' \n     include (1) governmental bodies (including Indian tribal \n     governments); (2) the Tennessee Valley Authority; (3) mutual \n     or cooperative electric companies (described in section \n     501(c)(12) or section 1381(a)(2)(C), or a not-for-profit \n     electric utility which has received a loan or guarantee under \n     the Rural Electrification Act); and (4) clean energy bond \n     lenders. A clean energy bond lender means a cooperative which \n     is owned by, or has outstanding loans to, 100 or more \n     cooperative electric companies and is in existence on \n     February 1, 2002. The term ``qualified borrower'' includes a \n     governmental body, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and a \n     mutual or cooperative electric company.\n       Under the provision, CREBs are subject to the arbitrage \n     requirements of section 148 that apply to traditional tax-\n     exempt bonds. Principles under section 148 and the \n     regulations thereunder shall apply for purposes of \n     determining the yield restriction and arbitrage rebate \n     requirements applicable to CREBs. For example, for arbitrage \n     purposes, the yield on an issue of CREBs is computed by \n     taking into account all payments of interest, if any, on such \n     bonds, i.e., whether the bonds are issued at par, premium, or \n     discount. However, for purposes of determining yield, the \n     amount of the credit allowed to a taxpayer holding CREBs is \n     not treated as interest, although such credit amount is \n     treated as interest income to the taxpayer.\n       In addition, to qualify as CREBs, the qualified issuer must \n     reasonably expect to and actually spend 95 percent or more of \n     the proceeds of such bonds on qualified projects within the \n     five-year period that begins on the date of issuance. To the \n     extent less than 95 percent of the proceeds are used to \n     finance qualified projects during the five-year spending \n     period, bonds will continue to qualify as CREBs if unspent \n     proceeds are used within 90 days from the end of such five-\n     year period to redeem any ``nonqualified bonds.'' For these \n     purposes, the amount of nonqualified bonds is to be \n     determined in the same manner as Treasury regulations under \n     section 142. In addition, the provision provides that the \n     five-year spending period may be extended by the Secretary \n     upon the qualified issuer's request.\n       Unlike qualified zone academy bonds, the provision requires \n     issuers of CREBs to report issuance to the IRS in a manner \n     similar to the information returns required for tax-exempt \n     bonds. Under the provision, there is a national limitation of \n     $1 billion of CREBs that the Secretary may allocate, in the \n     aggregate, to qualified projects. The authority to issue \n     CREBs expires December 31, 2008.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for bonds \n     issued after December 31, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     modifications. Under the conference agreement, the term \n     ``qualified issuers'' includes (1) governmental bodies \n     (including Indian tribal governments); (2) mutual or \n     cooperative electric companies (described in section \n     501(c)(12) or section 1381(a)(2)(C), or a not-for-profit \n     electric utility which has received a loan or guarantee under \n     the Rural Electrification Act); and (3) clean energy bond \n     lenders. The term ``qualified borrower'' includes a \n     governmental body (including an Indian tribal government) and \n     a mutual or cooperative electric company.\n       Under the conference agreement, there is a national \n     limitation of $800 million of CREBs that the Secretary may \n     allocate, in the aggregate, to qualified projects. Qualified \n     projects are any ``qualified facilities'' within the meaning \n     of section 45 (without regard to the placed-in-service date \n     requirements of that section), other than Indian coal \n     production facilities. In addition, the conference agreement \n     provides that the authority to issue CREBs expires December \n     31, 2007. However, the Secretary shall not allocate more than \n     $500 million of CREBs to finance qualified projects for \n     qualified borrowers that are governmental bodies (as defined \n     under the conference agreement).\n     11. Treatment of income of certain electric cooperatives \n         (sec. 1505 of the Senate amendment, sec. 1304 of the \n         conference agreement, and sec. 501(c)(12) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, an entity must be operated on a \n     cooperative basis in order to be treated as a cooperative for \n     Federal income tax purposes. Although not defined by statute \n     or regulation, the two principal criteria for determining \n     whether an entity is operating on a cooperative basis are: \n     (1) ownership of the cooperative by persons who patronize the \n     cooperative; and (2) return of earnings to patrons in \n     proportion to their patronage. The Internal Revenue Service \n     requires that cooperatives must operate under\n\n[[Page S9124]]\n\n     the following principles: (1) subordination of capital in \n     control over the cooperative undertaking and in ownership of \n     the financial benefits from ownership; (2) democratic control \n     by the members of the cooperative; (3) vesting in and \n     allocation among the members of all excess of operating \n     revenues over the expenses incurred to generate revenues in \n     proportion to their participation in the cooperative \n     (patronage); and (4) operation at cost (not operating for \n     profit or below cost).\n       In general, cooperative members are those who participate \n     in the management of the cooperative and who share in \n     patronage capital. As described below, income from the sale \n     of electric energy by an electric cooperative may be member \n     or non-member income to the cooperative, depending on the \n     membership status of the purchaser. A municipal corporation \n     may be a member of a cooperative.\n       For Federal income tax purposes, a cooperative generally \n     computes its income as if it were a taxable corporation, with \n     one exception--the cooperative may exclude from its taxable \n     income distributions of patronage dividends. In general, \n     patronage dividends are the profits of the cooperative that \n     are rebated to its patrons pursuant to a pre-existing \n     obligation of the cooperative to do so. The rebate must be \n     made in some equitable fashion on the basis of the quantity \n     or value of business done with the cooperative.\n       Except for tax-exempt farmers' cooperatives, cooperatives \n     that are subject to the cooperative tax rules of subchapter T \n     of the Code are permitted a deduction for patronage dividends \n     from their taxable income only to the extent of net income \n     that is derived from transactions with patrons who are \n     members of the cooperative. The availability of such \n     deductions from taxable income has the effect of allowing the \n     cooperative to be treated like a conduit with respect to \n     profits derived from transactions with patrons who are \n     members of the cooperative.\n       Cooperatives that qualify as tax-exempt farmers' \n     cooperatives are permitted to exclude patronage dividends \n     from their taxable income to the extent of all net income, \n     including net income that is derived from transactions with \n     patrons who are not members of the cooperative, provided the \n     value of transactions with patrons who are not members of the \n     cooperative does not exceed the value of transactions with \n     patrons who are members of the cooperative.\n     Taxation of electric cooperatives exempt from subchapter T\n       In general, the cooperative tax rules of subchapter T apply \n     to any corporation operating on a cooperative basis (except \n     mutual savings banks, insurance companies, other tax-exempt \n     organizations, and certain utilities), including tax-exempt \n     farmers' cooperatives (described in sec. 521(b)). However, \n     subchapter T does not apply to an organization that is \n     ``engaged in furnishing electric energy, or providing \n     telephone service, to persons in rural areas.'' Instead, \n     electric cooperatives are taxed under rules that were \n     generally applicable to cooperatives prior to the enactment \n     of subchapter T in 1962. Under these rules, an electric \n     cooperative can exclude patronage dividends from taxable \n     income to the extent of all net income of the cooperative, \n     including net income derived from transactions with patrons \n     who are not members of the cooperative.\n     Tax exemption of rural electric cooperatives\n       Section 501(c)(12) provides an income tax exemption for \n     rural electric cooperatives if at least 85 percent of the \n     cooperative's income consists of amounts collected from \n     members for the sole purpose of meeting losses and expenses \n     of providing service to its members. The IRS takes the \n     position that rural electric cooperatives also must comply \n     with the fundamental cooperative principles described above \n     in order to qualify for tax exemption under section \n     501(c)(12). The 85-percent test is determined without taking \n     into account any income from: (1) qualified pole rentals; (2) \n     open access electric energy transmission services; (3) open \n     access electric energy distribution services; (4) any nuclear \n     decommissioning transaction; (5) any asset exchange or \n     conversion transaction.\n       Income from open access transactions\n       Income received or accrued by a rural electric cooperative \n     (other than income received or accrued directly or indirectly \n     from a member of the cooperative) from the provision or sale \n     of electric energy transmission services or ancillary \n     services on a nondiscriminatory open access basis under an \n     open access transmission tariff approved or accepted by FERC \n     or under an independent transmission provider agreement \n     approved or accepted by FERC (including an agreement \n     providing for the transfer of control--but not ownership--of \n     transmission facilities) is excluded in determining whether a \n     rural electric cooperative satisfies the 85-percent test for \n     tax exemption under section 501(c)(12).\n       In addition, income is excluded for purposes of the 85-\n     percent test if it is received or accrued by a rural electric \n     cooperative (other than income received or accrued directly \n     or indirectly from a member of the cooperative) from the \n     provision or sale of electric energy distribution services or \n     ancillary services, provided such services are provided on a \n     nondiscriminatory open access basis to distribute electric \n     energy not owned by the cooperative: (1) to end-users who are \n     served by distribution facilities not owned by the \n     cooperative or any of its members; or (2) generated by a \n     generation facility that is not owned or leased by the \n     cooperative or any of its members and that is directly \n     connected to distribution facilities owned by the cooperative \n     or any of its members.\n       The exclusion for income from open access transactions does \n     not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006.\n       Income from nuclear decommissioning transactions\n       Income received or accrued by a rural electric cooperative \n     from any ``nuclear decommissioning transaction'' also is \n     excluded in determining whether a rural electric cooperative \n     satisfies the 85-percent test for tax exemption under section \n     501(c)(12). The term ``nuclear decommissioning transaction'' \n     is defined as--\n       1. any transfer into a trust, fund, or instrument \n     established to pay any nuclear decommissioning costs if the \n     transfer is in connection with the transfer of the \n     cooperative's interest in a nuclear powerplant or nuclear \n     powerplant unit;\n       2. any distribution from a trust, fund, or instrument \n     established to pay any nuclear decommissioning costs; or\n       3. any earnings from a trust, fund, or instrument \n     established to pay any nuclear decommissioning costs.\n       The exclusion for income from nuclear decommissioning \n     transactions does not apply to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2006.\n       Income from asset exchange or conversion transactions\n       Gain realized by a tax-exempt rural electric cooperative \n     from a voluntary exchange or involuntary conversion of \n     certain property is excluded in determining whether a rural \n     electric cooperative satisfies the 85-percent test for tax \n     exemption under section 501(c)(12). This provision only \n     applies to the extent that: (1) the gain would qualify for \n     deferred recognition under section 1031 (relating to \n     exchanges of property held for productive use or investment) \n     or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions); and \n     (2) the replacement property that is acquired by the \n     cooperative pursuant to section 1031 or section 1033 (as the \n     case may be) constitutes property that is used, or to be \n     used, for the purpose of generating, transmitting, \n     distributing, or selling electricity or natural gas.\n       The exclusion for income from asset exchange or conversion \n     transactions does not apply to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2006.\n     Treatment of income from load loss transactions\n       Tax-exempt rural electric cooperatives\n       Under present law, income received or accrued by a tax-\n     exempt rural electric cooperative from a ``load loss \n     transaction'' is treated under section 501(c)(12) as income \n     collected from members for the sole purpose of meeting losses \n     and expenses of providing service to its members. Therefore, \n     income from load loss transactions is treated as member \n     income in determining whether a rural electric cooperative \n     satisfies the 85-percent test for tax exemption under section \n     501(c)(12). In addition, income from load loss transactions \n     does not cause a tax-exempt electric cooperative to fail to \n     be treated for Federal income tax purposes as a mutual or \n     cooperative company under the fundamental cooperative \n     principles described above.\n       The term ``load loss transaction'' is generally defined as \n     any wholesale or retail sale of electric energy (other than \n     to a member of the cooperative) to the extent that the \n     aggregate amount of such sales during a seven-year period \n     beginning with the ``start-up year'' does not exceed the \n     reduction in the amount of sales of electric energy during \n     such period by the cooperative to members. The ``start-up \n     year'' is defined as the first year that the cooperative \n     offers nondiscriminatory open access or, if later and at the \n     election of the cooperative, 2004.\n       Present law also excludes income received or accrued by \n     rural electric cooperatives from load loss transactions from \n     the tax on unrelated trade or business income.\n       The special rule for income received or accrued by a tax-\n     exempt rural electric cooperative from a load loss \n     transaction does not apply to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2006.\n       Taxable electric cooperatives\n       The receipt or accrual of income from load loss \n     transactions by taxable electric cooperatives is treated as \n     income from patrons who are members of the cooperative. Thus, \n     income from a load loss transaction is excludible from the \n     taxable income of a taxable electric cooperative if the \n     cooperative distributes such income pursuant to a pre-\n     existing contract to distribute the income to a patron who is \n     not a member of the cooperative. In addition, income from \n     load loss transactions does not cause a taxable electric \n     cooperative to fail to be treated for Federal income tax \n     purposes as a mutual or cooperative company under the \n     fundamental cooperative principles described above.\n       The special rule for income received or accrued by a \n     taxable electric cooperative from a load loss transaction \n     does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2006.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment eliminates the sunset date for the \n     rules excluding income received or accrued by tax-exempt \n     rural electric cooperatives from open access electric energy \n     transmission or distribution services,\n\n[[Page S9125]]\n\n     any nuclear decommissioning transaction, and any asset \n     exchange or conversion transaction for purposes of the 85-\n     percent test under section 501(c)(12). The provision also \n     eliminates the sunset date for the rule that allows income \n     from load loss transactions to be treated as member income in \n     determining whether a rural electric cooperative satisfies \n     the 85-percent test. In addition, the provision eliminates \n     the sunset date for the rule that permits taxable electric \n     cooperatives to treat the receipt or accrual of income from \n     load loss transactions as income from patrons who are members \n     of the cooperative.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.\n     12. Dispositions of transmission property to implement FERC \n         restructuring policy (sec. 1506 of the Senate amendment, \n         sec. 1305 of the conference agreement, and sec. 451 of \n         the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Generally, a taxpayer selling property recognizes gain to \n     the extent the sales price (and any other consideration \n     received) exceeds the seller's basis in the property. The \n     recognized gain is subject to current income tax unless the \n     gain is deferred or not recognized under a special tax \n     provision.\n       One such special tax provision permits taxpayers to elect \n     to recognize gain from qualifying electric transmission \n     transactions ratably over an eight-year period beginning in \n     the year of sale if the amount realized from such sale is \n     used to purchase exempt utility property within the \n     applicable period (the ``reinvestment property''). If the \n     amount realized exceeds the amount used to purchase \n     reinvestment property, any realized gain is recognized to the \n     extent of such excess in the year of the qualifying electric \n     transmission transaction.\n       A qualifying electric transmission transaction is the sale \n     or other disposition of property used by the taxpayer in the \n     trade or business of providing electric transmission \n     services, or an ownership interest in such an entity, to an \n     independent transmission company prior to January 1, 2007. In \n     general, an independent transmission company is defined as: \n     (1) an independent transmission provider approved by the \n     FERC; (2) a person (i) who the FERC determines under section \n     203 of the Federal Power Act (or by declaratory order) is not \n     a ``market participant'' and (ii) whose transmission \n     facilities are placed under the operational control of a \n     FERC-approved independent transmission provider before the \n     close of the period specified in such authorization, but not \n     later than January 1, 2007; or (3) in the case of facilities \n     subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission \n     of Texas, (i) a person which is approved by that Commission \n     as consistent with Texas State law regarding an independent \n     transmission organization, or (ii) a political subdivision, \n     or affiliate thereof, whose transmission facilities are under \n     the operational control of an organization described in (i).\n       Exempt utility property is defined as: (1) property used in \n     the trade or business of generating, transmitting, \n     distributing, or selling electricity or producing, \n     transmitting, distributing, or selling natural gas, or (2) \n     stock in a controlled corporation whose principal trade or \n     business consists of the activities described in (1).\n       If a taxpayer is a member of an affiliated group of \n     corporations filing a consolidated return, the reinvestment \n     property may be purchased by any member of the affiliated \n     group (in lieu of the taxpayer).\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment provision extends the treatment under \n     the present-law deferral provision to sales or dispositions \n     to an independent transmission company prior to January 1, \n     2008.\n       Effective date.--The Senate amendment provision is \n     effective for transactions occurring after the date of \n     enactment. However, because the provision is an extension of \n     a present law provision which expires on December 31, 2006, \n     only transactions occurring after December 31, 2006 and prior \n     to January 1, 2008 will be affected.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.\n     13. Credit for production from advanced nuclear power \n         facilities (sec. 1507 of the Senate amendment, sec. 1306 \n         of the conference agreement, and new sec. 45J of the \n         Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       An income tax credit is allowed for production of \n     electricity from qualified facilities sold by the taxpayer to \n     an unrelated person (sec. 45). Qualified facilities comprise \n     wind energy facilities, ``closed-loop'' biomass facilities, \n     open-loop biomass (including agricultural livestock waste \n     nutrients) facilities, geothermal energy facilities, solar \n     energy facilities, small irrigation power facilities, \n     landfill gas facilities, and trash combustion facilities. The \n     base amount of the credit is 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour \n     (indexed for inflation) of electricity produced. The amount \n     of the credit is 1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for 2005. \n     However, electricity produced at open-loop biomass, small \n     irrigation power, and municipal solid waste facilities \n     receives only 50 percent of the credit, or 0.9 cents per \n     kilowatt-hour for 2005. Generally, wind and closed-loop \n     biomass facilities may claim this credit for 10 years from \n     the placed-in-service date of the facility. Other qualified \n     facilities may claim the credit for only five years from the \n     placed-in-service date.\n       Present law does not provide a credit for electricity \n     produced at advanced nuclear power facilities.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision permits a taxpayer producing electricity at a \n     qualifying advanced nuclear power facility to claim a credit \n     equal to 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced \n     for the eight-year period starting when the facility is \n     placed in service. The aggregate amount of credit that a \n     taxpayer may claim in any year during the eight-year period \n     is subject to limitation based on allocated capacity and an \n     annual limitation as described below.\n       A qualifying advanced nuclear facility is an advanced \n     nuclear facility for which the taxpayer has received an \n     allocation of megawatt capacity from the Secretary and is \n     placed in service before January 1, 2021. The taxpayer may \n     only claim credit for production of electricity equal to the \n     ratio of the allocated capacity that the taxpayer receives \n     from the Secretary to the rated nameplate capacity of the \n     taxpayer's facility. For example, if the taxpayer receives \n     an allocation of 750 megawatts of capacity from the \n     Secretary and the taxpayer's facility has a rated \n     nameplate capacity of 1,000 megawatts, then the taxpayer \n     may claim three-quarters of the otherwise allowable \n     credit, or 1.35 cents per kilowatt-hour, for each \n     kilowatt-hour of electricity produced at the facility \n     (subject to the annual limitation described below). The \n     Secretary may allocate up to 6,000 megawatts of capacity.\n       A taxpayer operating a qualified facility may claim no more \n     than $125 million in tax credits per 1,000 megawatts of \n     allocated capacity in any one year of the eight-year credit \n     period. If the taxpayer operates a 1,350 megawatt rated \n     nameplate capacity system and has received an allocation from \n     the Secretary for 1,350 megawatts of capacity eligible for \n     the credit, the taxpayer's annual limitation on credits that \n     may be claimed is equal to 1.35 times $125 million, or \n     $168.75 million. If the taxpayer operates a facility with a \n     nameplate rated capacity of 1,350 megawatts, but has received \n     an allocation from the Secretary for 750 megawatts of credit \n     eligible capacity, then the two limitations apply such that \n     the taxpayer may claim a credit equal to 1.35 cents per \n     kilowatt-hour of electricity produced (as described above) \n     subject to an annual credit limitation of $93.75 million in \n     credits (three-quarters of $125 million).\n       An advanced nuclear facility is any nuclear facility for \n     the production of electricity, the reactor design for which \n     was approved after 1993 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \n     For this purpose, a qualifying advanced nuclear facility does \n     not include any facility for which a substantially similar \n     design for a facility of comparable capacity was approved \n     before 1994.\n       In addition, the credit allowable to the taxpayer is \n     reduced by reason of grants, tax-exempt bonds, subsidized \n     energy financing, and other credits, but such reduction \n     cannot exceed 50 percent of the otherwise allowable credit. \n     The credit is treated as part of the general business credit.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to electricity \n     produced in taxable years beginning after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.\n     14. Credit for investment in clean coal facilities (sec. 1508 \n         of the Senate amendment, sec. 1307 of the conference \n         agreement, and new secs. 48A and 48B of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law does not provide an investment credit for \n     electricity production facilities property that uses coal as \n     a fuel or for the gasification of coal or other materials. \n     However, a nonrefundable, 10-percent investment tax credit \n     (``energy credit'') is allowed for the cost of new property \n     that is equipment (1) that uses solar energy to generate \n     electricity, to heat or cool a structure, or to provide solar \n     process heat, or (2) that is used to produce, distribute, or \n     use energy derived from a geothermal deposit, but only, in \n     the case of electricity generated by geothermal power, up to \n     the electric transmission stage (sec. 48). The energy credit \n     is a component of the general business credit (sec. \n     38(b)(1)).\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision creates two new 20-percent investment tax \n     credits. Both credits are available only to projects \n     certified by the Secretary of Treasury, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Energy. Certifications are issued using a \n     competitive bidding process.\n       With respect to the first investment tax credit, the \n     provision establishes a 10-year program to produce 7,500 \n     megawatts of power generation capacity using integrated \n     gasification combined cycle (``IGCC'') and other advanced \n     coal-based electricity generation technologies. Qualified \n     projects must be economically feasible and use the \n     appropriate clean coal technologies. The Secretary of\n\n[[Page S9126]]\n\n     Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, must \n     allocate up to 4,125 megawatts of power generation capacity \n     to credit-eligible projects using IGCC technology. The \n     remaining 3,375 megawatts of power generation capacity must \n     be allocated to credit-eligible projects that use other \n     advanced coal-based technologies.\n       In determining which projects to certify that use IGCC \n     technology, the Secretary must allocate power generation \n     capacity in relatively equal amounts to projects that use \n     bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, and lignite as primary \n     feedstock. In addition, the Secretary must give high priority \n     to projects which include greenhouse gas capture capability, \n     increased by-product utilization, and other benefits.\n       With respect to the second investment tax credit, the \n     provision authorizes the certification of certain \n     gasification projects. Qualified gasification projects \n     convert coal, petroleum residue, biomass, or other materials \n     recovered for their energy or feedstock value into a \n     synthesis gas composed primarily of carbon monoxide and \n     hydrogen for direct use or subsequent chemical or physical \n     conversion. Under the provision, certified gasification \n     projects are eligible for the new 20 percent investment tax \n     credit. The total qualified investment which may be certified \n     as eligible for credit under the gasification program may not \n     exceed $4 billion. In addition, the Secretary may certify a \n     maximum of $1 billion in qualified investment as eligible for \n     credit with respect to any single project.\n       Effective date.--The credits apply to periods after the \n     date of enactment, under rules similar to the rules of \n     section 48(m) (as in effect before its repeal).\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     modifications. Under the conference agreement, the Secretary \n     may allocate investment credits for projects using IGCC and \n     other advanced coal-based technologies based on the amount \n     invested, rather than on megawatts of power generation \n     capacity. The Secretary may allocate $800 million of credits \n     to IGCC projects and $500 million of credits to projects \n     using other advanced coal-based technologies.\n       Under the agreement, the credit available to IGCC projects \n     remains 20 percent of qualified investments; however, the \n     credit for other advanced coal-based projects is reduced to \n     15 percent of qualified investments. With respect to IGCC \n     projects, the conference agreement narrows the definition of \n     credit-eligible investments to include only investments in \n     property associated with the gasification of coal, including \n     any coal handling and gas separation equipment. Thus, \n     investments in equipment that could operate by drawing fuel \n     directly from a natural gas pipeline do not qualify for the \n     credit.\n       The conference agreement retains the 20 percent investment \n     credit for certified gasification projects. The agreement, \n     however, reduces the total amount of gasification credits \n     allocable by the Secretary to $350 million. A maximum of $650 \n     million of credit-eligible investment may be allocated to any \n     single gasification project. The conference agreement also \n     clarifies that only property which is part of a qualifying \n     gasification project and necessary for the gasification \n     technology of such project is eligible for the gasification \n     credit.\n     15. Clean energy coal bonds (sec. 1509 of the Senate \n         amendment)\n\n\n                              Present law\n\n     Tax-exempt bonds\n       Interest on State and local governmental bonds generally is \n     excluded from gross income for Federal income tax purposes if \n     the proceeds of the bonds are used to finance direct \n     activities of these governmental units or if the bonds are \n     repaid with revenues of the governmental units. Subject to \n     certain restrictions, activities that can be financed with \n     these tax-exempt bonds include electric power facilities \n     (i.e., generation, transmission, distribution, and \n     retailing).\n       Generally, interest on State or local government bonds to \n     finance activities of private persons (``private activity \n     bonds'') is taxable unless a specific exception is contained \n     in the Code. The term ``private person'' generally includes \n     the Federal Government and all other individuals and entities \n     other than States or local governments. The Code includes \n     exceptions permitting States or local governments to act as \n     conduits providing tax-exempt financing for certain private \n     activities. In most cases, the aggregate volume of these tax-\n     exempt private activity bonds is restricted by annual \n     aggregate volume limits imposed on bonds issued by issuers \n     within each State. For calendar year 2005, the State volume \n     cap is the greater of $80 per resident or $239 million. The \n     Code imposes several additional restrictions on tax-exempt \n     private activity bonds that do not apply to bonds for \n     governmental activities.\n       The tax exemption for State and local bonds also does not \n     apply to any arbitrage bond. An arbitrage bond is defined as \n     any bond that is part of an issue if any proceeds of the \n     issue are reasonably expected to be used (or intentionally \n     are used) to acquire higher yielding investments or to \n     replace funds that are used to acquire higher yielding \n     investments. In general, arbitrage profits may be earned only \n     during specified periods (e.g., defined ``temporary \n     periods'') before funds are needed for the purpose of the \n     borrowing or on specified types of investments (e.g., \n     ``reasonably required reserve or replacement funds''). \n     Subject to limited exceptions, investment profits that are \n     earned during these periods or on such investments must be \n     rebated to the Federal Government.\n       An issuer must file with the IRS certain information in \n     order for a bond issue to be tax-exempt. Generally, this \n     information return is required to be filed no later than the \n     15th day of the second month after the close of the calendar \n     quarter in which the bonds were issued.\n     Qualified zone academy bonds\n       As an alternative to traditional tax-exempt bonds, States \n     and local governments may issue ``qualified zone academy \n     bonds.'' ``Qualified zone academy bonds'' are defined as any \n     bond issued by a State or local government, provided that (1) \n     at least 95 percent of the proceeds are used for the purpose \n     of renovating, providing equipment to, developing course \n     materials for use at, or training teachers and other school \n     personnel in a ``qualified zone academy'' and (2) private \n     entities have promised to contribute to the qualified zone \n     academy certain equipment, technical assistance or training, \n     employee services, or other property or services with a value \n     equal to at least 10 percent of the bond proceeds. A school \n     is a ``qualified zone academy'' if (1) the school is a public \n     school that provides education and training below the college \n     level, (2) the school operates a special academic program in \n     cooperation with businesses to enhance the academic \n     curriculum and increase graduation and employment rates, and \n     (3) either (a) the school is located in an empowerment zone \n     or enterprise community designated under the Code, or (b) it \n     is reasonably expected that at least 35 percent of the \n     students at the school will be eligible for free or reduced-\n     cost lunches under the school lunch program established under \n     the National School Lunch Act.\n       Financial institutions that hold qualified zone academy \n     bonds are entitled to a nonrefundable tax credit in an amount \n     equal to a credit rate multiplied by the face amount of the \n     bond. The Treasury Department sets the credit rate at a rate \n     estimated to allow issuance of qualified zone academy bonds \n     without discount and without interest cost to the issuer. The \n     credit is includable in gross income (as if it were a taxable \n     interest payment on the bond), and may be claimed against \n     regular income tax and AMT liability. The maximum term of the \n     bond is determined by the Treasury Department, so that the \n     present value of the obligation to repay the bond is 50 \n     percent of the face value of the bond.\n       There is an annual limitation of $400 million on the amount \n     of qualified zone academy bonds that may be issued in \n     calendar years 1998 through 2005. The $400 million aggregate \n     bond cap is allocated each year to the States according to \n     their respective populations of individuals below the poverty \n     line. Each State, in turn, allocates the credit authority to \n     qualified zone academies within such State.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision creates a new category of tax credit bonds: \n     Clean Energy Coal Bonds (``ClECos''). ClECos are defined as \n     any bond issued by a qualified issuer if, in addition to \n     the requirements discussed below, 95 percent or more of \n     the proceeds of such bonds are used to finance capital \n     expenditures incurred by qualified borrowers for \n     ``certified coal property.'' Certified coal property is \n     defined as any property that is part of a qualifying \n     advanced coal project certified by the Secretary.\n       Like qualified zone academy bonds, ClECos are not interest-\n     bearing obligations. Rather, the taxpayer holding a ClECos on \n     a credit allowance date would be entitled to a tax credit. \n     The amount of the credit is determined by multiplying the \n     bond's credit rate by the face amount on the holder's bond. \n     The credit rate on the bonds is determined by the Secretary \n     and is to be a rate that permits issuance of ClECos without \n     discount and interest cost to the qualified issuer. The \n     credit accrues quarterly and is includible in gross income \n     (as if it were an interest payment on the bond), and can be \n     claimed against regular income tax liability and alternative \n     minimum tax liability.\n       For purposes of the provision, ``qualified issuers'' \n     include (1) governmental bodies; (2) the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority; (3) mutual or cooperative electric companies \n     (described in section 501(c)(12) or section 1381(a)(2)(C), or \n     a not-for-profit electric utility which has received a loan \n     or guarantee under the Rural Electrification Act); and (4) \n     clean energy bond lenders. A clean energy bond lender means a \n     cooperative which is owned by, or has outstanding loans to, \n     100 or more cooperative electric companies and is in \n     existence on February 1, 2002. The term ``qualified \n     borrower'' includes a governmental body, the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority, and a mutual or cooperative electric company.\n       Under the provision, ClECos are subject to the arbitrage \n     requirements of section 148 that apply to traditional tax-\n     exempt bonds. In addition, to qualify as ClECos, the \n     qualified issuer must reasonably expect to and actually spend \n     95 percent or more of the proceeds of such bonds on certified \n     coal property within the five-year period that begins on the \n     date of issuance. To the extent less than 95 percent of the \n     proceeds are used to finance qualified projects during the \n     five- year spending period, bonds will continue to qualify as \n     ClECos if unspent proceeds are used\n\n[[Page S9127]]\n\n     within 90 days from the end of such five-year period to \n     redeem any ``nonqualified bonds.'' For these purposes, the \n     amount of nonqualified bonds is to be determined in the same \n     manner as Treasury regulations under section 142. In \n     addition, the provision provides that the five-year spending \n     period may be extended by the Secretary upon the qualified \n     issuer's request.\n       The provision also imposes a maximum maturity limitation on \n     any ClECos. The maximum maturity is the term which the \n     Secretary estimates will result in the present value of the \n     obligation to repay the principal on a ClECos being equal to \n     50 percent of the face amount of such bond. Moreover, the \n     provision requires level amortization of ClECos during the \n     period such bonds are outstanding.\n       Unlike qualified zone academy bonds, the provision requires \n     issuers of ClECos to report issuance to the IRS in a manner \n     similar to the information returns required for tax-exempt \n     bonds. Under the provision, there is a national limitation of \n     $1 billion of ClECos that the Secretary may allocate, in the \n     aggregate, to certified coal property projects. The authority \n     to issue ClECos expires December 31, 2010.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for bonds \n     issued after December 31, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     16. Credit for investment in clean coke/cogeneration \n         manufacturing facilities (sec. 1511 of the Senate \n         amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law does not provide a credit for investment in \n     clean coke/cogeneration manufacturing facilities property.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision provides a 20-percent investment tax credit \n     for qualified investments in clean coke/cogeneration \n     facilities property. The provision defines clean coke/\n     cogeneration manufacturing facilities property as depreciable \n     real and tangible personal property located in the United \n     States that meets certain emission standards and is used for \n     the manufacture of metallurgical coke or for the production \n     of steam or electricity from waste heat generated during the \n     production of metallurgical coke.\n       The qualified investment for any taxable year is the basis \n     of each coke/cogeneration facilities property placed in \n     service by the taxpayer during such taxable year. The \n     provision excludes the credit from the basis adjustment rules \n     for investment credit property set out in section 50(c) of \n     the Code. Under the basis adjustment rules, the basis in \n     investment credit property is generally reduced by the amount \n     of the investment credit.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to periods after \n     December 31, 2004, and before January 1, 2010, under rules \n     similar to the rules of section 48(m) (as in effect before \n     its repeal).\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     17. Temporary expensing for equipment used in the refining of \n         liquid fuels (sec. 1512 of the Senate amendment, sec. \n         1323 of the conference agreement, and new sec. 179C of \n         the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Depreciation of refinery assets\n       Under present law, depreciation allowances for property \n     used in a trade or business generally are determined under \n     the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (``MACRS'') of \n     section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under MACRS, \n     petroleum refining assets are depreciated for regular tax \n     purposes over a 10-year recovery period using the double \n     declining balance method. Petroleum refining assets are \n     assets used for distillation, fractionation, and catalytic \n     cracking of crude petroleum into gasoline and its other \n     components. Present law also provides a special expensing \n     rule for small refiners for capital costs incurred in \n     complying with Environmental Protection Agency sulfur \n     regulations.\n     Taxation of cooperatives and their patrons\n       For Federal income tax purposes, a cooperative generally \n     computes its income as if it were a taxable corporation, with \n     one exception--the cooperative may exclude from its taxable \n     income distributions of patronage dividends. Generally, \n     cooperatives that are subject to the cooperative tax rules of \n     subchapter T of the Code are permitted a deduction for \n     patronage dividends from their taxable income only to the \n     extent of net income that is derived from transactions with \n     patrons who are members of the cooperative. The availability \n     of such deductions from taxable income has the effect of \n     allowing the cooperative to be treated like a conduit with \n     respect to profits derived from transactions with patrons who \n     are members of the cooperative.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment provision provides a temporary \n     election to expense qualified refinery property. Qualified \n     refinery property includes assets, located in the United \n     States, used in the refining of liquid fuels: (1) with \n     respect to the construction of which there is a binding \n     construction contract before January 1, 2008; (2) which are \n     placed in service before January 1, 2012; (3) which increase \n     the capacity of an existing refinery by at least five percent \n     or increase the percentage of total throughput attributable \n     to qualified fuels (as defined in present law section 29(c), \n     which is redesignated as section 45K(c) by section 1322(a)(1) \n     of the Act) such that it equals or exceeds 25 percent; and \n     (4) which meet all applicable environmental laws in effect \n     when the property is placed in service.\n       The expensing election is not available with respect to \n     identifiable refinery property built solely to comply with \n     Federally mandated projects or consent decrees. For example, \n     a taxpayer may not elect to expense the cost of a scrubber, \n     even if the scrubber is installed as part of a larger \n     project, if the scrubber does not increase throughput or \n     increased capacity to accommodate qualified fuels and is \n     necessary for the refinery to comply with the Clean Air Act. \n     This exclusion applies regardless of whether the mandate or \n     consent decree addresses environmental concerns with respect \n     to the refinery itself or the refined fuels.\n       The Senate amendment provision allows cooperative \n     organizations to pass through to the owners of such \n     organizations the expensing deduction for qualified refinery \n     property. To the extent the deduction is passed through to \n     owners, the cooperative is denied deductions it would \n     otherwise be entitled with respect to qualified refinery \n     property.\n       As a condition of eligibility for the expensing of \n     equipment used in the refining of liquid fuels, the Senate \n     amendment provision provides that a refinery must report to \n     the IRS concerning its refinery operations (e.g. production \n     and output).\n       Effective date.--The Senate amendment provision is \n     effective for property placed in service after the date of \n     enactment, the original use of which begins with the \n     taxpayer, provided the property was not subject to a binding \n     contract for construction on or before June 14, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, with \n     the following modifications. Under the conference agreement, \n     the expensing election is limited to 50% of the taxpayer's \n     qualifying expenditures. The remaining 50% is recovered as \n     under present law.\n       Under the conference agreement, the five percent capacity \n     requirement refers to the output capacity of the refinery, as \n     measured by the volume of finished products other than \n     asphalt and lube oil, rather than input capacity, as measured \n     by rated capacity.\n       The conference agreement includes a clarification that the \n     expensing election is not available with respect to \n     identifiable refinery property built solely to comply with \n     consent decrees or projects mandated by Federal, State, or \n     local governments.\n       Finally, an exception to the original use requirement is \n     provided for property which would meet the requirement but \n     for a sale-leaseback transaction within the first three \n     months after the property is originally placed in service.\n       Under the conference agreement, a cooperative organization \n     electing to pass the expensing deduction through to its \n     owners must make such an election on the tax return for the \n     taxable year to which the deduction relates. Once made, the \n     election is irrevocable. Moreover, the organization making \n     the election must provide cooperative owners receiving an \n     allocation of the deduction written notice of the amount of \n     such allocation.\n     18. Allow pass through to owners of deduction for capital \n         costs incurred by small refiner cooperative in complying \n         with Environmental Protection Agency sulfur regulations \n         (sec. 1513 of the Senate amendment, sec. 1324 of the \n         conference agreement, and sec. 179B of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Expensing and credit for small refiners\n       Taxpayers generally may recover the costs of investments in \n     refinery property through annual depreciation deductions. In \n     addition, the Code permits small business refiners to \n     immediately deduct as an expense up to 75 percent of the \n     costs paid or incurred for the purpose of complying with the \n     Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''). Costs qualifying \n     for the deduction are those costs paid or incurred with \n     respect to any facility of a small business refiner during \n     the period beginning on January 1, 2003 and ending on the \n     earlier of the date that is one year after the date on \n     which the taxpayer must comply with the applicable EPA \n     regulations or December 31, 2009.\n       The Code also provides that a small business refiner may \n     claim credit equal to five cents per gallon for each gallon \n     of low sulfur diesel fuel produced during the taxable year \n     that is in compliance with the Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur \n     Control Requirements. The total production credit claimed by \n     the taxpayer is limited to 25 percent of the capital costs \n     incurred to come into compliance with the EPA diesel fuel \n     requirements. As with the deduction permitted under present \n     law, costs qualifying for the credit are those costs paid or \n     incurred with respect to any facility of a small business \n     refiner during the period beginning on January 1, 2003 and \n     ending on the earlier of the date that is one year after the \n     date on which the taxpayer must comply with the applicable \n     EPA regulations or December 31, 2009. The taxpayer's basis in \n     property with respect to which the credit applies\n\n[[Page S9128]]\n\n     is reduced by the amount of production credit claimed.\n       For these purposes a small business refiner is a taxpayer \n     who is within the business of refining petroleum products \n     employs not more than 1,500 employees directly in refining \n     and has less than 205,000 barrels per day (average) of total \n     refinery capacity. The deduction is reduced, pro rata, for \n     taxpayers with capacity in excess of 155,000 barrels per day.\n       In the case of a qualifying small business refiner that is \n     owned by a cooperative, the cooperative is allowed to elect \n     to pass any production credits to patrons of the \n     organization. Present law does not permit cooperatives to \n     pass through to members the deduction permitted for the costs \n     paid or incurred for the purpose of complying with the \n     Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements.\n     Taxation of cooperatives and their patrons\n       For Federal income tax purposes, a cooperative generally \n     computes its income as if it were a taxable corporation, with \n     one exception--the cooperative may exclude from its taxable \n     income distributions of patronage dividends. In general, \n     patronage dividends are the profits of the cooperative that \n     are rebated to its patrons pursuant to a pre-existing \n     obligation of the cooperative to do so. The rebate must be \n     made in some equitable fashion on the basis of the quantity \n     or value of business done with the cooperative.\n       Except for tax-exempt farmers' cooperatives, cooperatives \n     that are subject to the cooperative tax rules of subchapter T \n     of the Code are permitted a deduction for patronage dividends \n     from their taxable income only to the extent of net income \n     that is derived from transactions with patrons who are \n     members of the cooperative. The availability of such \n     deductions from taxable income has the effect of allowing the \n     cooperative to be treated like a conduit with respect to \n     profits derived from transactions with patrons who are \n     members of the cooperative.\n       Cooperatives that qualify as tax-exempt farmers' \n     cooperatives are permitted to exclude patronage dividends \n     from their taxable income to the extent of all net income, \n     including net income that is derived from transactions with \n     patrons who are not members of the cooperative, provided the \n     value of transactions with patrons who are not members of the \n     cooperative does not exceed the value of transactions with \n     patrons who are members of the cooperative.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment allows cooperatives to pass through to \n     their owners the deduction permitted for costs paid or \n     incurred for the purpose of complying with the Highway Diesel \n     Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements. To the extent the deduction \n     is passed through to owners, the cooperative is denied \n     deductions it would otherwise be entitled with respect to \n     costs attributable to complying with the Highway Diesel Fuel \n     Sulfur Control Requirements.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective as if included \n     in the amendments made by section 338(a) of the American Jobs \n     Creation Act of 2004.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     modifications. The conference agreement clarifies the manner \n     in which a cooperative organization may elect to pass through \n     to cooperative owners the deduction for costs paid or \n     incurred for the purpose of complying with the Highway Diesel \n     Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements. Specifically, the election \n     must be made on the tax return of the organization for the \n     taxable year to which the deduction relates. Once made, the \n     election is irrevocable. Moreover, the organization making \n     such an election must provide cooperative owners receiving an \n     allocation of the deduction written notice of the amount of \n     such allocation. The written notice must be provided by the \n     due date for the tax return on which the election is made.\n     19. Modification of enhanced oil recovery credit (sec. 1514 \n         of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Taxpayers may claim a credit equal to 15 percent of \n     enhanced oil recovery (``EOR'') costs (sec. 43). Qualified \n     EOR costs include the following costs associated with an EOR \n     project: (1) amounts paid for depreciable tangible property; \n     (2) intangible drilling and development expenses; (3) \n     tertiary injectant expenses; and (4) construction costs for \n     certain Alaskan natural gas treatment facilities.\n       The EOR credit is ratably reduced over a $6 phase-out range \n     when the reference price for domestic crude oil exceeds $28 \n     per barrel (adjusted for inflation after 1991). The reference \n     price is determined based on the annual average price of \n     domestic crude oil for the calendar year preceding the \n     calendar year in which the taxable year begins (sec. \n     29(d)(2)(C)).\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision modifies the EOR credit to increase the \n     credit rate to 20 percent with respect to any new EOR project \n     or substantial expansion of an existing EOR project that \n     occurs after December 31, 2005, and uses carbon dioxide \n     flooding or injection as an oil recovery method. The \n     increased credit is available only for qualified EOR projects \n     that use carbon dioxide that is (1) from an industrial source \n     or (2) separated from natural gas and natural gas liquids at \n     a natural gas processing plant.\n       The provision also expands the definition of a qualified \n     EOR project to include qualified deep gas well projects. A \n     qualified deep gas well project is defined as any project \n     located in the United States which involves the production of \n     natural gas from onshore formations deeper than 20,000 feet. \n     Under the provision, the credit for qualified deep gas well \n     projects phases out as crude oil prices increase using the \n     same formula applicable to other EOR projects.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to costs paid or \n     incurred in taxable years ending after December 31, 2005, but \n     terminates for costs paid or incurred after December 31, \n     2009.\n\n\n                          conference agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n\n                 B. MISCELLANEOUS ENERGY TAX INCENTIVES\n\n     1. Credit for residential energy efficient property (sec. \n         1311 of the House bill, sec. 1527 of the Senate \n         amendment, sec. 1335 of the conference agreement, and new \n         sec. 25D of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       A taxpayer may exclude from income the value of any subsidy \n     provided by a public utility for the purchase or installation \n     of an energy conservation measure. An energy conservation \n     measure means any installation or modification primarily \n     designed to reduce consumption of electricity or natural gas \n     or to improve the management of energy demand with respect to \n     a dwelling unit (sec. 136).\n       There is no present-law credit for residential solar hot \n     water, photovoltaic, or fuel cell property.\n\n\n                               house bill\n\n       The provision provides a personal tax credit for the \n     purchase of qualified photovoltaic property and qualified \n     solar water heating property that is used exclusively for \n     purposes other than heating swimming pools and hot tubs. The \n     credit is equal to 15 percent of qualified investment up to a \n     maximum credit of $2,000 for solar water heating property and \n     $2,000 for rooftop photovoltaic property. The provision also \n     provides a 15-percent personal tax credit for the purchase of \n     qualified fuel cell power plants. The credit may not exceed \n     $500 for each 0.5 kilowatt of capacity. The credit is \n     nonrefundable. The taxpayer's basis in the property is \n     reduced by the amount of the credit.\n       Qualifying solar water heating property is property that \n     heats water for use in a dwelling unit if at least half of \n     the energy used by such property for such purpose is derived \n     from the sun. Qualified photovoltaic property is property \n     that uses solar energy to generate electricity for use in a \n     dwelling unit. A qualified fuel cell power plant is an \n     integrated system comprised of a fuel cell stack assembly and \n     associated balance of plant components that converts a fuel \n     into electricity using electrochemical means, and which has \n     an electricity-only generation efficiency of greater than 30 \n     percent.\n       To qualify for the credit, the property must be installed \n     on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in the \n     United States and used as a residence by the taxpayer. If \n     less than 80 percent of the use of an item is for nonbusiness \n     purposes, only that portion of the expenditures for such item \n     which is properly allocable to use for nonbusines purposes \n     shall be taken into account. Certain equipment safety \n     requirements need to be met to qualify for the credit. \n     Special proration rules apply in the case of jointly owned \n     property, condominiums, and tenant-stockholders in \n     cooperative housing corporations.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to expenditures made \n     after the date of enactment in taxable years ending before \n     January 1, 2008.\n\n\n                            senate amendment\n\n       The provision provides a personal tax credit for the \n     purchase of qualified photovoltaic property and qualified \n     solar water heating property that is used exclusively for \n     purposes other than heating swimming pools and hot tubs. The \n     credit is equal to 30 percent of qualifying expenditures, \n     with a maximum credit for each of these systems of property \n     of $2,000. The provision also provides a 30 percent credit \n     for the purchase of qualified fuel cell power plants. The \n     credit for any fuel cell may not exceed $500 for each 0.5 \n     kilowatt of capacity.\n       Qualifying solar water heating property means an \n     expenditure for property to heat water for use in a dwelling \n     unit located in the United States and used as a residence if \n     at least half of the energy used by such property for such \n     purpose is derived from the sun. Qualified photovoltaic \n     property is property that uses solar energy to generate \n     electricity for use in a dwelling unit. A qualified fuel cell \n     power plant is an integrated system comprised of a fuel cell \n     stack assembly and associated balance of plant components \n     that (1) converts a fuel into electricity using \n     electrochemical means, (2) has an electricity-only generation \n     efficiency of greater than 30 percent, and (3) generates at \n     least 0.5 kilowatts of electricity. The qualified fuel cell \n     power plant must be installed on or in connection with a \n     dwelling unit located in the United States and used by the \n     taxpayer as a principal residence.\n\n[[Page S9129]]\n\n       The credit is nonrefundable, and the depreciable basis of \n     the property is reduced by the amount of the credit. \n     Expenditures for labor costs allocable to onsite preparation, \n     assembly, or original installation of property eligible for \n     the credit are eligible expenditures.\n       Certain equipment safety requirements need to be met to \n     qualify for the credit. Special proration rules apply in the \n     case of jointly owned property, condominiums, and tenant-\n     stockholders in cooperative housing corporations. If less \n     than 80 percent of the property is used for nonbusiness \n     purposes, only that portion of expenditures that is used for \n     nonbusiness purposes is taken into account.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to property placed in \n     service after December 31, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2010.\n\n\n                          conference agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, but \n     only for property placed in service prior to January 1, 2008.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to property placed in \n     service after December 31, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2008.\n     2. Credit for business installation of qualified fuel cells \n         and stationary microturbine power plants (sec. 1528 of \n         the Senate amendment, sec. 1336 of the conference \n         agreement, and sec. 48 of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       A 10-percent business energy investment tax credit is \n     allowed for the cost of new property that is equipment (1) \n     that uses solar energy to generate electricity, to heat or \n     cool a structure, or to provide solar process heat, or (2) \n     used to produce, distribute, or use energy derived from a \n     geothermal deposit, but only, in the case of electricity \n     generated by geothermal power, up to the electric \n     transmission stage.\n       The business energy investment tax credit is a component of \n     the general business credit. The general business credit \n     generally may not exceed the excess of the taxpayer's net \n     income tax over the greater of (1) the tentative minimum tax \n     or (2) 25 percent of net regular tax liability in excess of \n     $25,000. A general business credit in excess of the tax \n     limitation generally may be carried back one year and carried \n     forward up to 20 years.\n       There is no present-law credit for fuel cell or \n     microturbine power plant property.\n\n\n                               house bill\n\n       The provision provides a 15-percent credit for the purchase \n     of qualified fuel cell power plants for businesses. The \n     credit is part of the business energy investment tax credit. \n     A qualified fuel cell power plant is an integrated system \n     comprised of a fuel cell stack assembly and associated \n     balance of plant components that converts a fuel into \n     electricity using electrochemical means, and which has an \n     electricity-only generation efficiency of greater than 30 \n     percent. The credit may not exceed $500 for each 0.5 kilowatt \n     of capacity. The taxpayer's basis in the property is reduced \n     by the amount of the credit claimed.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to property placed \n     in service after April 11, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, \n     under rules similar to rules of section 48(m) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (as in effect on the day before the date \n     of enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990).\n\n\n                            senate amendment\n\n       The provision provides a 30 percent business energy credit \n     for the purchase of qualified fuel cell power plants for \n     businesses. A qualified fuel cell power plant is an \n     integrated system composed of a fuel cell stack assembly and \n     associated balance of plant components that (1) converts a \n     fuel into electricity using electrochemical means, (2) has an \n     electricity-only generation efficiency of greater than 30 \n     percent, and (3) generates at least 0.5 kilowatts of \n     electricity. The credit for any fuel cell may not exceed $500 \n     for each 0.5 kilowatts of capacity.\n       Additionally, the provision provides a 10-percent credit \n     for the purchase of qualifying stationary microturbine power \n     plants. A qualified stationary microturbine power plant is an \n     integrated system comprised of a gas turbine engine, a \n     combustor, a recuperator or regenerator, a generator or \n     alternator, and associated balance of plant components that \n     converts a fuel into electricity and thermal energy. Such \n     system also includes all secondary components located between \n     the existing infrastructure for fuel delivery and the \n     existing infrastructure for power distribution, including \n     equipment and controls for meeting relevant power standards, \n     such as voltage, frequency and power factors. Such system \n     must have an electricity-only generation efficiency of not \n     less that 26 percent at International Standard Organization \n     conditions and a capacity of less than 2,000 kilowatts. The \n     credit is limited to the lesser of 10 percent of the basis of \n     the property or $200 for each kilowatt of capacity.\n       Additionally, for purposes of the fuel cell and \n     microturbine credits, and only in the case of \n     telecommunications companies, the provision removes the \n     present-law section 48 restriction that would prevent \n     telecommunication companies from claiming the new credit due \n     to their status as public utilities.\n       The credit is nonrefundable. The taxpayer's basis in the \n     property is reduced by the amount of the credit claimed.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to periods after \n     December 31, 2005 and before January 1, 2010 (January 1, 2009 \n     in the case of micro turbines), for property placed in \n     service in taxable years ending after December 31, 2005, \n     under rules similar to rules of section 48(m) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (as in effect on the day before the date \n     of enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990).\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, but \n     only for periods before January 1, 2008.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to periods after \n     December 31, 2005 and before January 1, 2008, for property \n     placed in service in taxable years ending after December 31, \n     2005, under rules similar to rules of section 48(m) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as in effect on the day before \n     the date of enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of \n     1990).\n     3.

Diesel-water fuel emulsion (sec. 1313 of the House bill, \n         sec. 1343 of the conference agreement, and sec. 4081 of \n         the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A 24.3-cents-per-gallon excise tax is imposed on diesel \n     fuel to finance the Highway Trust Fund. Gasoline and most \n     special motor fuels are subject to tax at 18.3 cents per \n     gallon for the Trust Fund.\n       The tax rate for certain special motor fuels is determined, \n     on an energy equivalent basis, as follows:\n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiquefied petroleum gas (propane).........  13.6 cents per gallon\nLiquefied natural gas.....................  11.9 cents per gallon\nMethanol derived from natural gas.........  9.15 cents per gallon\nCompressed natural gas....................  48.54 cents per MCF\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       No special tax rate is provided for diesel fuel blended \n     with water to form a diesel-water fuel emulsion.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       A special tax rate of 19.7 cents per gallon is provided for \n     diesel fuel blended with water into a diesel-water fuel \n     emulsion to reflect the reduced Btu content per gallon \n     resulting from the water. Emulsion fuels eligible for the \n     special rate must consist of not more than 83.1 percent \n     diesel (and other minor chemical additives to enhance \n     combustion) and at least 16.9 percent water. The emulsion \n     addition must be registered by a United States manufacturer \n     with the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to section \n     211 of the Clean Air Act (as in effect on\n\n[[Page S9130]]\n\n     March 31, 2003). A refund of the difference between the \n     regular rate (24.3 cents per gallon) and the incentive rate \n     (19.7 cents per gallon) is available to the extent tax-paid \n     diesel is used to produce a qualifying emulsion diesel fuel. \n     Anyone who separates the diesel fuel from the diesel-water \n     fuel emulsion on which a reduced rate of tax was imposed is \n     treated as a refiner of the fuel and is liable for the \n     difference between the amount of tax on the latest removal of \n     the separated fuel and the amount of tax that was imposed \n     upon the pre-mixture removal.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on January 1, \n     2006.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House bill except the \n     diesel-water emulsion fuels eligible for the special rate \n     must consist of least 14 percent water. In addition, the \n     person claiming entitlement to the special rate of tax must \n     be registered with the Secretary. The conference agreement \n     clarifies that claims for refund based on the incentive rate \n     may be filed quarterly if such person can claim at least \n     $750. If the person cannot claim at least $750 at the end of \n     quarter, the amount can be carried over to the next quarter \n     to determine if the person can claim at least $750. If the \n     person cannot claim at least $750 at the end of the taxable \n     year, the person must claim a credit on the person's income \n     tax return.\n     5. Amortization of delay rental payments (sec. 1314 of the \n         House bill)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law generally requires costs associated with \n     inventory and property held for resale to be capitalized \n     rather than currently deducted as they are incurred (sec. \n     263). Oil and gas producers typically contract for mineral \n     production in exchange for royalty payments. If mineral \n     production is delayed, these contracts provide for ``delay \n     rental payments'' as a condition of their extension. The \n     Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the \n     uniform capitalization rules of section 263A require delay \n     rental payments to be capitalized.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       The provision allows delay rental payments incurred in \n     connection with the development of oil or gas within the \n     United States to be amortized over two years. In the case of \n     abandoned property, remaining basis may no longer be \n     recovered in the year of abandonment of a property as all \n     basis is recovered over the two-year amortization period.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to amounts paid or \n     incurred in taxable years beginning after the date of \n     enactment. No inference is intended from the prospective \n     effective date of this provision as to the proper treatment \n     of pre-effective date delay rental payments.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the House \n     provision.\n     6. Amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures \n         (sec. 1315 of the House bill, sec. 1329 of the conference \n         agreement, and sec. 167 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Geological and geophysical expenditures (``G costs'') are \n     costs incurred by a taxpayer for the purpose of obtaining and \n     accumulating data that will serve as the basis for the \n     acquisition and retention of mineral properties by taxpayers \n     exploring for minerals. A key issue with respect to the tax \n     treatment of such expenditures is whether or not they are \n     capital in nature. Capital expenditures are not currently \n     deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses, but \n     are allocated to the cost of the property.\n       Courts have held that G costs are capital, and therefore \n     are allocable to the cost of the property acquired or \n     retained. The costs attributable to such exploration are \n     allocable to the cost of the property acquired or retained. \n     As described further below, IRS administrative rulings have \n     provided further guidance regarding the definition and proper \n     tax treatment of G costs.\n     Revenue Ruling 77-188\n       In Revenue Ruling 77-188 (hereinafter referred to as the \n     ``1977 ruling''), the IRS provided guidance regarding the \n     proper tax treatment of G costs. The ruling describes a \n     typical geological and geophysical exploration program as \n     containing the following elements:\n       It is customary in the search for mineral producing \n     properties for a taxpayer to conduct an exploration program \n     in one or more identifiable project areas. Each project area \n     encompasses a territory that the taxpayer determines can be \n     explored advantageously in a single integrated operation. \n     This determination is made after analyzing certain variables \n     such as (1) the size and topography of the project area to be \n     explored, (2) the existing information available with respect \n     to the project area and nearby areas, and (3) the quantity of \n     equipment, the number of personnel, and the amount of money \n     available to conduct a reasonable exploration program over \n     the project area.\n       The taxpayer selects a specific project area from which \n     geological and geophysical data are desired and conducts a \n     reconnaissance-type survey utilizing various geological and \n     geophysical exploration techniques. These techniques are \n     designed to yield data that will afford a basis for \n     identifying specific geological features with sufficient \n     mineral potential to merit further exploration.\n       Each separable, noncontiguous portion of the original \n     project area in which such a specific geological feature is \n     identified is a separate ``area of interest.'' The original \n     project area is subdivided into as many small projects as \n     there are areas of interest located and identified within the \n     original project area. If the circumstances permit a detailed \n     exploratory survey to be conducted without an initial \n     reconnaissance-type survey, the project area and the area of \n     interest will be coextensive.\n       The taxpayer seeks to further define the geological \n     features identified by the prior reconnaissance-type surveys \n     by additional, more detailed, exploratory surveys conducted \n     with respect to each area of interest. For this purpose, the \n     taxpayer engages in more intensive geological and geophysical \n     exploration employing methods that are designed to yield \n     sufficiently accurate sub-surface data to afford a basis for \n     a decision to acquire or retain properties within or adjacent \n     to a particular area of interest or to abandon the entire \n     area of interest as unworthy of development by mine or well.\n       The 1977 ruling provides that if, on the basis of data \n     obtained from the preliminary geological and geophysical \n     exploration operations, only one area of interest is located \n     and identified within the original project area, then the \n     entire expenditure for those exploratory operations is to be \n     allocated to that one area of interest and thus capitalized \n     into the depletable basis of that area of interest. On the \n     other hand, if two or more areas of interest are located and \n     identified within the original project area, the entire \n     expenditure for the exploratory operations is to be allocated \n     equally among the various areas of interest.\n       If no areas of interest are located and identified by the \n     taxpayer within the original project area, then the 1977 \n     ruling states that the entire amount of the G costs related \n     to the exploration is deductible as a loss under section 165. \n     The loss is claimed in the taxable year in which that \n     particular project area is abandoned as a potential source of \n     mineral production.\n       A taxpayer may acquire or retain a property within or \n     adjacent to an area of interest, based on data obtained from \n     a detailed survey that does not relate exclusively to any \n     discrete property within a particular area of interest. \n     Generally, under the 1977 ruling, the taxpayer allocates the \n     entire amount of G costs to the acquired or retained \n     property as a capital cost under section 263(a). If more than \n     one property is acquired, it is proper to determine the \n     amount of the G costs allocable to each such property by \n     allocating the entire amount of the costs among the \n     properties on the basis of comparative acreage.\n       If, however, no property is acquired or retained within or \n     adjacent to that area of interest, the entire amount of the \n     G costs allocable to the area of interest is deductible as \n     a loss under section 165 for the taxable year in which such \n     area of interest is abandoned as a potential source of \n     mineral production.\n       In 1983, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 83-105, which \n     elaborates on the positions set forth in the 1977 ruling by \n     setting forth seven factual situations and applying the \n     principles of the 1977 ruling to those situations. In \n     addition, Revenue Ruling 83-105 explains what constitutes \n     ``abandonment as a potential source of mineral production.''\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       The provision allows geological and geophysical amounts \n     incurred in connection with oil and gas exploration in the \n     United States to be amortized over two years. In the case of \n     abandoned property, remaining basis may no longer be \n     recovered in the year of abandonment of a property as all \n     basis is recovered over the two-year amortization period.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for geological \n     and geophysical costs paid or incurred in taxable years \n     beginning after the date of enactment. No inference is \n     intended from the prospective effective date of this \n     provision as to the proper treatment of pre-effective date \n     geological and geophysical costs.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House bill.\n     7. Alternative technology vehicle credits (sec. 1316 of the \n         House bill, sec. 1553 of the Senate amendment, secs. 1341 \n         and 1348 of the conference agreement, sec. 179A of the \n         Code, and new sec. 30B of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Certain costs of qualified clean-fuel vehicle may be \n     expensed and deducted when such property is placed in service \n     (sec. 179A). Qualified clean-fuel vehicle property includes \n     motor vehicles that use certain clean-burning fuels (natural \n     gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, \n     hydrogen, electricity and any other fuel at least 85 percent \n     of which is methanol, ethanol, any other alcohol or ether). \n     The maximum amount of the deduction is $50,000 for a truck or \n     van with a\n\n[[Page S9131]]\n\n     gross vehicle weight over 26,000 pounds or a bus with seating \n     capacities of at least 20 adults; $5,000 in the case of a \n     truck or van with a gross vehicle weight between 10,000 and \n     26,000 pounds; and $2,000 in the case of any other motor \n     vehicle. Qualified electric vehicles do not qualify for the \n     clean-fuel vehicle deduction. The deduction is reduced to 25 \n     percent of the otherwise allowable deduction in 2006 and is \n     unavailable for purchases after December 31, 2006.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       The House bill provides a credit for each new qualified \n     advanced lean-burn technology motor vehicle placed in service \n     by the taxpayer during the taxable year. The amount of the \n     credit for any vehicle is the sum of an amount for fuel \n     efficiency and an amount for conservation. The amount for \n     fuel efficiency is based on a comparison of the fuel \n     efficiency of the vehicle compared to the Environmental \n     Protection Agency's 2000 model year city fuel economy for a \n     vehicle in the same inertia weight class. The amount for \n     conservation is based on the qualifying vehicle's estimated \n     lifetime fuel savings compared to the same 2000 model year \n     standard.\n       Table 2, below, shows the credit amount for fuel efficiency \n     of a qualified advanced lean- burn technology motor vehicle.\n\nTABLE 2.--FUEL EFFICIENCY CREDIT AMOUNT FOR QUALIFIED ADVANCED LEAN-BURN\n                        TECHNOLOGY MOTOR VEHICLES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              If Fuel Economy of the Vehicle Is:\n    Credit Amount    ---------------------------------------------------\n                              at least                but less than\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n$500................  125% of base fuel         150% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n1,000...............  150% of base fuel         175% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n1,500...............  175% of base fuel         200% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n2,000...............  200% of base fuel         225% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n2,500...............  225% of base fuel         250% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n3,000...............               250% of base fuel economy\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The credit amount for conservation of a qualified advanced \n     lean burn technology vehicle is computed as follows. The \n     vehicle is assumed to be driven 120,000 miles over its life. \n     The 120,000 miles of lifetime mileage is divided by the fuel \n     economy rating of the vehicle. The 120,000 miles of lifetime \n     mileage also is divided by the 2000 model year city economy \n     for a vehicle in the same inertia weight class. The \n     difference is the lifetime fuel savings. If the vehicle \n     achieves a lifetime motor fuel savings between 1,500 and \n     2,500 gallons of fuel, the credit amount for the vehicle is \n     $250. If the vehicle achieves a lifetime fuel savings of at \n     least 2,500 gallons of motor fuel, the credit amount is $500.\n       The base fuel economy is the 2000 model year city fuel \n     economy for vehicles by inertia weight class by vehicle type. \n     The ``vehicle inertia weight class'' is that defined in \n     regulations prescribed by the Environmental Protection Agency \n     for purposes of Title II of the Clean Air Act. A qualifying \n     advanced lean-burn technology motor vehicle means a motor \n     vehicle the original use of which commences with the \n     taxpayer, powered by an internal combustion engine that is \n     designed to operate primarily using more air than is \n     necessary for complete combustion of the fuel and \n     incorporates direct injection, that uses only diesel fuel (as \n     defined in section 4083(a)(3)), has sufficient fuel economy \n     to qualify for the credit, and meets the Environmental \n     Protection Agency's Tier II bin 8 emissions standards. In \n     addition, in order to qualify for a credit, a vehicle must be \n     in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Clean Air \n     Act and the motor vehicle safety provisions.\n       In general, the credit is allowed to the vehicle owner, \n     including the lessor of a vehicle subject to a lease. If the \n     use of the vehicle is described in paragraph (3) or (4) of \n     section 50(b) (relating to use by tax-exempts, governments, \n     and foreign persons) and is not subject to a lease, the \n     seller of the vehicle may claim the credit so long the seller \n     clearly discloses to the user in a document the amount that \n     is allowable as a credit. A vehicle must be used \n     predominantly in the United States to qualify for the credit.\n       The provision permits the credit to offset both the regular \n     tax and the alternative minimum tax. Credits in excess of \n     this limitation may be carried forward for up to 20 years; \n     credits may not be carried back to earlier years.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for property \n     placed in service after the date of enactment and before \n     January 1, 2008.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n     Alternative motor vehicle credits\n       The Senate amendment provides a credit for each new \n     qualified fuel cell vehicle, each new qualified hybrid motor \n     vehicle, and each new qualified alternative fuel motor \n     vehicle placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable \n     year.\n       In general, the credit is allowed to the vehicle owner, \n     including the lessor of a vehicle subject to a lease. If the \n     use of the vehicle is described in paragraphs (3) or (4) of \n     section 50(b) (relating to use by tax-exempts, governments, \n     and foreign persons) and is not subject to a lease, the \n     seller of the vehicle may claim the credit so long as the \n     seller clearly discloses to the user in a document the amount \n     that is allowable as a credit. A vehicle must be used \n     predominantly in the United States to qualify for the credit.\n       Any deduction otherwise allowable under section 179A is \n     reduced by the amount of the credit allowable.\n       The provision permits the credit to offset the excess of \n     the regular tax (reduced by certain credits) over the \n     alternative minimum tax. Credits in excess of this limitation \n     may be carried back for up to three years and forward for up \n     to 20 years; credits may not be carried back to taxable years \n     beginning before the date of enactment and credits for \n     vehicles used for personal use may not be carried back.\n       Fuel cell vehicles\n       A qualifying fuel cell vehicle is a motor vehicle that is \n     propelled by power derived from one or more cells which \n     convert chemical energy directly into electricity by \n     combining oxygen with hydrogen fuel which is stored on board \n     the vehicle and may or may not require reformation prior to \n     use. The amount of credit for the purchase of a fuel cell \n     vehicle is determined by a base credit amount that depends \n     upon the weight class of the vehicle and, in the case of \n     automobiles or light trucks, an additional credit amount that \n     depends upon the rated fuel economy of the vehicle compared \n     to a base fuel economy. For these purposes the base fuel \n     economy is the 2002 model year city fuel economy rating for \n     vehicles of various weight classes (see below). Table 3, \n     below, shows the proposed base credit amounts.\n\n           TABLE 3.--BASE CREDIT AMOUNT FOR FUEL CELL VEHICLES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Vehicle Gross Weight Rating in Pounds            Credit Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVehicle  8,500.......................................             $8,000\n8,500 < vehicle  14,000..............................            $10,000\n14,000 < vehicle  26,000.............................            $20,000\n26,000 < vehicle.....................................            $40,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In the case of a fuel cell vehicle weighing less than 8,500 \n     pounds and placed in service after December 31, 2009, the \n     $8,000 amount in Table 3, above is reduced to $4,000.\n       Table 4, below, shows the proposed additional credits for \n     passenger automobiles or light trucks.\n\n           Table 4.--CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING FUEL CELL VEHICLES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                         If Fuel Economy of the Fuel Cell Vehicle Is:\n       Credit        ---------------------------------------------------\n                              At least                but less than\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n$1,000..............  150% of base fuel         175% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n1,500...............  175% of base fuel         200% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n2,000...............  200% of base fuel         225% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n2,500...............  225% of base fuel         250% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n3,000...............  250% of base fuel         275% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n3,500...............  275% of base fuel         300% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n4,000...............               300% of base fuel economy\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Hybrid motor vehicles\n       A qualifying hybrid vehicle is a motor vehicle that draws \n     propulsion energy from on- board sources of stored energy \n     which include both an internal combustion engine or heat \n     engine using combustible fuel and a rechargeable energy \n     storage system (e.g., batteries). A qualifying hybrid motor \n     vehicle must be placed in service before January 1, 2010.\n       In the case of an automobile or light truck (vehicles \n     weighing 8,500 pounds or less), the amount of credit for the \n     purchase of a hybrid vehicle varies with the rated fuel \n     economy of the vehicle compared to a 2002 model year. A \n     qualifying hybrid automobile or light truck must have a \n     maximum available power from the rechargeable energy \n     storage system of at least five percent. In addition, the \n     vehicle must meet or exceed certain EPA emissions \n     standards. For a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight \n     rating of 8,500 pounds or less the applicable emissions \n     standards are the Bin 5 Tier II emissions standards.\n       Table 5, below, shows the fuel economy credit available to \n     a hybrid passenger automobile or light truck whose fuel \n     economy (on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis) exceeds that \n     of a base fuel economy.\n\n                      Table 5.--Fuel Economy Credit\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                         If Fuel Economy of the Fuel Cell Vehicle Is:\n       Credit        ---------------------------------------------------\n                              At least                but less than\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n$400................  125% of base fuel         150% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n800.................  150% of base fuel         175% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n1,200...............  175% of base fuel         200% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n1,600...............  200% of base fuel         225% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n2,000...............  225% of base fuel         250% of base fuel\n                       economy.                  economy\n2,400...............               250% of base fuel economy\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In the case of a qualifying hybrid motor vehicle weighing \n     more than 8,500 pounds, the amount of credit is determined by \n     the estimated increase in fuel economy and the incremental \n     cost of the hybrid vehicle compared to a comparable vehicle \n     powered solely by a gasoline or diesel internal combustion \n     engine and that is comparable in weight, size, and use of the \n     vehicle. For a vehicle that achieves a fuel economy increase \n     of at least 30 percent but less than 40 percent, the credit \n     is equal to 20 percent of the incremental cost of the hybrid \n     vehicle. For a vehicle that achieves a fuel economy increase \n     of at least 40 percent but less than 50 percent, the credit \n     is equal to 30 percent of the incremental cost of the hybrid \n     vehicle. For a vehicle that achieves a fuel economy increase \n     of 50 percent or more, the credit is equal to 40 percent of \n     the incremental cost of the hybrid vehicle.\n       The credit is subject to certain maximum applicable \n     incremental cost amounts. For a qualifying hybrid motor \n     vehicle weighing more than 8,500 pounds but not more than \n     14,000 pounds, the maximum allowable incremental cost amount \n     is $7,500. For a qualifying hybrid motor vehicle weighing \n     more than 14,000 pounds but not more than 26,000 pounds, the \n     maximum allowable incremental cost amount is $15,000. For a \n     qualifying hybrid motor vehicle weighing more than 26,000\n\n[[Page S9132]]\n\n     pounds, the maximum allowable incremental cost amount is \n     $30,000.\n       A qualifying hybrid motor vehicle weighing more than 8,500 \n     pounds but not more than 14,000 pounds must have a maximum \n     available power from the rechargeable energy storage system \n     of at least 10 percent. A qualifying hybrid vehicle weighing \n     more than 14,000 pounds must have a maximum available power \n     from the rechargeable energy storage system of at least 15 \n     percent.\n       Alternative fuel vehicle\n       The credit for the purchase of a new alternative fuel \n     vehicle would be 50 percent of the incremental cost of such \n     vehicle, plus an additional 30 percent if the vehicle meets \n     certain emissions standards, but not more than between $4,000 \n     and $32,000 depending upon the weight of the vehicle.

For a vehicle with a gross vehicle \n     weight rating greater than 6,000 pounds and less than or \n     equal to 8,500 pounds, the applicable emissions standards are \n     the Bin 8 Tier II emissions standards. A qualifying advanced \n     lean burn technology motor vehicle must be placed in service \n     before January 1, 2011.\n       Limitation on number of qualified hybrid and advanced lean-\n           burn technology motor vehicles eligible for the credit\n       The conference agreement imposes a limitation on the number \n     of qualified hybrid motor vehicles and advanced lean-burn \n     technology motor vehicles sold by each manufacturer of such \n     vehicles that are eligible for the credit. Taxpayers may \n     claim the full amount of the allowable credit up to the end \n     of the first calendar quarter after the quarter in which the \n     manufacturer records its sale of the 60,000th hybrid and \n     advanced lean-burn technology motor vehicle. Taxpayers may \n     claim one half of the otherwise allowable credit during the \n     two calendar quarters subsequent to the first quarter after \n     the manufacturer has recorded its 60,000th such sale. In the \n     third and fourth calendar quarters subsequent to the first \n     quarter after the manufacturer has recorded its 60,000th such \n     sale, the taxpayer may claim one quarter of the otherwise \n     allowable credit.\n       Thus, summing the sales of qualifying hybrid motor vehicles \n     of all weight classes and all sales of qualifying advanced \n     lean-burn technology motor vehicles, if a manufacturer \n     records the sale of its 60,000th in February of 2007, \n     taxpayers purchasing such vehicles from the manufacturer may \n     claim the full amount of the credit on their purchases of \n     qualifying vehicles through June 30, 2007. For the period \n     July 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, taxpayers may claim \n     one half of the otherwise allowable credit on purchases of \n     qualifying vehicles of the manufacturer. For the period \n     January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2008, taxpayers may claim \n     one quarter of the otherwise allowable credit on the \n     purchases of qualifying vehicles of the manufacturer. After \n     June 30, 2008, no credit may be claimed for purchases of \n     hybrid motor vehicles or advanced lean-burn technology motor \n     vehicles sold by the manufacturer.\n\n[[Page S9133]]\n\n       Hybrid vehicles that are medium and heavy trucks\n       In the case of a qualifying hybrid motor vehicle weighing \n     more than 8,500 pounds, the conference agreement follows the \n     Senate amendment.\n     Other rules\n       The portion of the credit attributable to vehicles of a \n     character subject to an allowance for depreciation is treated \n     as a portion of the general business credit; the remainder of \n     the credit is allowable to the extent of the excess of the \n     regular tax (reduced by certain other credits) over the \n     alternative minimum tax for the taxable year.\n     Termination of Code section 179A\n       The conference agreement provides that section 179A sunsets \n     after December 31, 2005.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to vehicles placed \n     in service after December 31, 2005, in the case of qualified \n     fuel cell motor vehicles, before January 1, 2015; in the case \n     of qualified hybrid motor vehicles that are automobiles and \n     light trucks and in the case of advanced lean-burn technology \n     vehicles, before January 1, 2011; in the case of qualified \n     hybrid motor vehicles that medium and heavy trucks, before \n     January 1, 2010; and in the case of qualified alternative \n     fuel motor vehicles, before January 1, 2011.\n     8.

The provision also modifies present law to \n     provide for a credit equal to the lesser of $1,500 or 10 \n     percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail price of \n     certain vehicles that conform to the Motor Vehicle Safety \n     Standard 500. For all other electric vehicles, Table 10, \n     below describes the credit.\n\n       TABLE 10.--CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Vehicle Gross Weight Rating in Pounds            Credit Amount\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVehicle  8,500.......................................             $4,000\n8,500 < vehicle  14,000..............................             10,000\n14,000 < vehicle  26,000.............................             20,000\n26,000 < vehicle.....................................             40,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       If an electric vehicle weighing not more than 8,500 pounds \n     has an estimated driving range of at least 100 miles on a \n     single charge of the vehicle's batteries or if it is capable \n     of a payload capacity of at least 1,000 pounds, then the \n     credit amount in Table 10 is $6,000.\n       In general, the credit is allowed to the vehicle owner, \n     including the lessor of a vehicle subject to a lease. If the \n     use of the vehicle is described in paragraph (3) or (4) of \n     section 50(b) (relating to use by tax-exempts, governments, \n     and foreign persons) and is not subject to a lease, the \n     seller of the vehicle may claim the credit so long the seller \n     clearly discloses to the user in a document the amount that \n     is allowable as a credit. A vehicle must be used \n     predominantly in the United States to qualify for the credit.\n       The provision permits the credit to offset the excess of \n     the regular tax (reduced by certain credits) over the \n     alternative minimum tax. Credits in excess of this limitation \n     may be carried back for up to three years and forward for up \n     to 20 years; credits may not be carried back to taxable years \n     beginning before the date of enactment and credits for \n     vehicles used for personal use may not be carried back.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for property \n     placed in service after the date of enactment and before \n     January 1, 2010.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     9. Credit for installation of alternative fuel refueling \n         property (sec. 1533 of the Senate amendment, sec. 1342 of \n         the conference agreement, and new sec. 30C of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Clean-fuel vehicle refueling property may be expensed and \n     deducted when such property is placed in service (sec. 179A). \n     Clean-fuel vehicle refueling property comprises property for \n     the storage or dispensing of a clean-burning fuel, if the \n     storage or dispensing is the point at which the fuel is \n     delivered into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle. Clean-\n     fuel vehicle refueling property also includes property for \n     the recharging of electric vehicles, but only if the \n     property is located at a point where the electric vehicle \n     is recharged. Up to $100,000 of such property at each \n     location owned by the taxpayer may be expensed with \n     respect to that location. The deduction is unavailable for \n     costs incurred after December 31, 2006.\n       For the purpose of sec. 179A clean fuels comprise natural \n     gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, \n     hydrogen, electricity, and any other fuel at least 85 percent \n     of which is methanol, ethanol, or any other alcohol or ether.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision permits taxpayers to claim a 50-percent \n     credit for the cost of installing clean-fuel vehicle \n     refueling property to be used in a trade or business of the \n     taxpayer or installed at the principal residence of the \n     taxpayer. In the case of retail clean-fuel vehicle refueling \n     property the allowable credit may not exceed $30,000. In the \n     case of residential clean-fuel vehicle refueling property the \n     allowable credit may not exceed $1,000.\n       Under the provision clean fuels are any fuel at least 85 \n     percent of the volume of which consists of ethanol, natural \n     gas, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied \n     petroleum gas, and hydrogen and any mixture of diesel fuel \n     and biodiesel containing at least 20 percent biodiesel.\n       The taxpayer's basis in the property is reduced by the \n     amount of the credit and the taxpayer may not claim \n     deductions under section 179A with respect to property for \n     which the credit is claimed. In the case of refueling \n     property installed on property owned or used by a tax-exempt \n     person, the taxpayer that installs the property may claim the \n     credit. To be eligible for the credit, the property must be \n     placed in service before January 1, 2010. The credit \n     allowable in the taxable year cannot exceed the difference \n     between the taxpayer's regular tax (reduced by certain other \n     credits) and the taxpayer's tentative minimum tax. The \n     taxpayer may carry forward unused credits for 20 years.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for property \n     placed in service December 31, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     modifications. The conference agreement provides that the \n     credit rate is 30 percent rather than 50 percent.\n       The portion of the credit attributable to property of a \n     character subject to an allowance for depreciation is treated \n     as a portion of the general business credit; the remainder of \n     the credit is allowable to the extent of the excess of the \n     regular tax (reduced by certain other credits) over the \n     alternative minimum tax for the taxable year.\n       The conference agreement provides that the credit may not \n     be claimed for property placed in service after December 31, \n     2007.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for property \n     placed in service December 31, 2005 and before January 1, \n     2008.\n     10. Volumetric excise tax credit for alternative fuels (sec. \n         1534 of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A 24.3-cents-per-gallon excise tax is imposed on diesel \n     fuel to finance the Highway Trust Fund. Gasoline and most \n     special motor fuels are subject to tax at 18.3 cents per \n     gallon for the Trust Fund. The statutory rates for certain \n     special motor fuels are determined on an energy equivalent \n     basis, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiquefied petroleum gas (propane).........  13.6 cents per gallon\nLiquefied natural gas.....................  11.9 cents per gallon\nMethanol derived from petroleum or natural  9.15 cents per gallon\n gas.\nCompressed natural gas....................  48.54 cents per MCF\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Under section 4041, tax is imposed on special motor fuels \n     (any liquid other than gas oil, fuel oil or any product \n     taxable under section 4081) when there is a taxable sale by \n     any person to an owner, lessee or other operator of a motor \n     vehicle or motorboat, for use as fuel in the motor vehicle or \n     motorboat or used by any person as a fuel in a motor vehicle \n     or motorboat unless there was a prior taxable sale. No excise \n     tax credit is provided for the sale or use of those fuels.\n       Liquid hydrogen is a special motor fuel for purposes of the \n     tax on special motor fuels and is subject to a tax of 18.3 \n     cents per gallon. Compressed hydrogen gas used or sold as a \n     fuel is not subject to tax.\n       Prior to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, gasohol \n     and gasoline to be blended into gasohol was taxed at a \n     reduced rate based on the amount of ethanol contained in the \n     mixture (e.g., 10 percent, 7.7 percent or 5.5 percent alcohol \n     in the mixture). The Act eliminated reduced rates of excise \n     tax for most alcohol-blended fuels. In place of the reduced \n     rates, the Act amended the Code to create two new excise tax \n     credits: the alcohol fuel mixture credit and the biodiesel \n     mixture credit. The sum of these credits may be taken against \n     the tax imposed on taxable fuels (by section 4081). A person \n     may also file a claim for payment equal to the amount of \n     these credits for biodiesel or alcohol used to produce an \n     eligible mixture. The credits and payments are paid out of \n     the General Fund. If the alcohol is ethanol with a proof of \n     190 or greater, the credit or payment amount is 51 cents per \n     gallon. For agri-biodiesel, the credit or payment amount is \n     $1.00 per gallon; for biodiesel other than agri-biodiesel, \n     the credit or payment amount is 50 cents per gallon. Under \n     the Code's coordination rules, a claim may be taken only \n     once with respect to any particular gallon of alcohol or \n     biodiesel.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       Under the Senate amendment, the liquefied petroleum gas, \n     and P Series fuels (as defined by the Secretary of Energy \n     under 42\n\n[[Page S9134]]\n\n     U.S.C. sec. 13211(2)) are taxed at 18.3 cents per gallon \n     under section 4041. Compressed natural gas is taxed at 18.3 \n     cents per energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline. \n     Liquefied natural gas, any liquid fuel derived from coal \n     (other than ethanol or methanol) and liquid hydrocarbons \n     derived from biomass are taxed at 24.3 cents per gallon under \n     section 4041. Under the provision, hydrogen (whether in \n     liquid or gas form) is exempt from the tax imposed by section \n     4041; however, persons selling hydrogen as fuel are required \n     to register with the Secretary. Collectively, these fuels \n     (including hydrogen) are referred to as ``alternative \n     fuels.''\n       In addition, the Senate amendment creates two new excise \n     tax credits, the alternative fuel credit, and the alternative \n     fuel mixture credit. The credits are allowed against section \n     4041 liability. The alternative fuel credit is 50 cents per \n     gallon of alternative fuel or gasoline gallon equivalents of \n     nonliquid alternative fuel sold by the taxpayer for use as a \n     motor fuel in a highway vehicle. The alternative fuel mixture \n     credit is 50 cents per gallon of alternative fuel used in \n     producing an alternative fuel mixture for sale or use in a \n     trade or business of the taxpayer. The mixture must be sold \n     by the taxpayer for use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or \n     used by the taxpayer for use as a fuel in a highway vehicle. \n     Liquid fuel derived from coal would only qualify for the \n     credits if derived from the Fisher-Tropsch process. The \n     credits generally expire after September 30, 2009. The \n     provision also allows persons to file a claim for payment \n     equal to the amount of the alternative fuel credit and \n     alternative fuel mixture credits. These payment provisions \n     generally also expire after September 30, 2009. With respect \n     to hydrogen, the credit and payment provisions expire after \n     December 31, 2014. Both credits and payments are made out of \n     the General Fund. Under coordination rules, a claim for \n     payment or credit may only be taken once with respect to any \n     particular gallon or gasoline-gallon equivalent of \n     alternative fuel.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for any sale, \n     use or removal for any period after September 30, 2006.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     11. Extend excise tax provisions and income tax credit for \n         biodiesel and create similar incentives for renewable \n         diesel (sec. 1535 of the Senate amendment, secs. 1344 and \n         1346 of the conference agreement, and secs. 40A, 6426 and \n         6427 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Biodiesel income tax credit\n       Overview\n       The Code provides an income tax credit for biodiesel and \n     qualified biodiesel mixtures, the biodiesel fuels credit.\\80\\ \n     The biodiesel fuels credit is the sum of the biodiesel \n     mixture credit plus the biodiesel credit and is treated as a \n     general business credit. The amount of the biodiesel fuels \n     credit is includable in gross income. The biodiesel fuels \n     credit is coordinated to take into account benefits from the \n     biodiesel excise tax credit and payment provisions discussed \n     below. The credit may not be carried back to a taxable year \n     ending before or on December 31, 2004. The provision does not \n     apply to fuel sold or used after December 31, 2006.\n       Biodiesel is monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids \n     derived from plant or animal matter that meet (1) the \n     registration requirements established by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency under section 211 of the Clean Air Act and \n     (2) the requirements of the American Society of Testing and \n     Materials D6751. Agri-biodiesel is biodiesel derived solely \n     from virgin oils including oils from corn, soybeans, \n     sunflower seeds, cottonseeds, canola, crambe, rapeseeds, \n     safflowers, flaxseeds, rice bran, mustard seeds, or animal \n     fats.\n       Biodiesel may be taken into account for purposes of the \n     credit only if the taxpayer obtains a certification (in such \n     form and manner as prescribed by the Secretary) from the \n     producer or importer of the biodiesel which identifies the \n     product produced and the percentage of the biodiesel and \n     agri-biodiesel in the product.\n       Biodiesel mixture credit\n       The biodiesel mixture credit is 50 cents for each gallon of \n     biodiesel used by the taxpayer in the production of a \n     qualified biodiesel mixture. For agri-biodiesel, the credit \n     is $1.00 per gallon. A qualified biodiesel mixture is a \n     mixture of biodiesel and diesel fuel that is (1) sold by the \n     taxpayer producing such mixture to any person for use as a \n     fuel, or (2) is used as a fuel by the taxpayer producing such \n     mixture. The sale or use must be in the trade or business of \n     the taxpayer and is to be taken into account for the taxable \n     year in which such sale or use occurs. No credit is allowed \n     with respect to any casual off-farm production of a qualified \n     biodiesel mixture.\n       Biodiesel credit\n       The biodiesel credit is 50 cents for each gallon of \n     biodiesel which is not in a mixture with diesel fuel (100 \n     percent biodiesel or B-100) and which during the taxable year \n     is (1) used by the taxpayer as a fuel in a trade or business \n     or (2) sold by the taxpayer at retail to a person and placed \n     in the fuel tank of such person's vehicle. For agri-\n     biodiesel, the credit is $1.00 per gallon.\n     Biodiesel mixture excise tax credit\n       The Code also provides an excise tax credit for biodiesel \n     mixtures.\\81\\ The credit is 50 cents for each gallon of \n     biodiesel used by the taxpayer in producing a biodiesel \n     mixture for sale or use in a trade or business of the \n     taxpayer. In the case of agri-biodiesel, the credit is $1.00 \n     per gallon. A biodiesel mixture is a mixture of biodiesel and \n     diesel fuel that (1) is sold by the taxpayer producing such \n     mixture to any person for use as a fuel, or (2) is used as a \n     fuel by the taxpayer producing such mixture. No credit is \n     allowed unless the taxpayer obtains a certification (in \n     such form and manner as prescribed by the Secretary) from \n     the producer of the biodiesel that identifies the product \n     produced and the percentage of biodiesel and agri-\n     biodiesel in the product.\n       The credit is not available for any sale or use for any \n     period after December 31, 2006. This excise tax credit is \n     coordinated with the income tax credit for biodiesel such \n     that credit for the same biodiesel cannot be claimed for both \n     income and excise tax purposes.\n     Payments with respect to biodiesel fuel mixtures\n       If any person produces a biodiesel fuel mixture in such \n     person's trade or business, the Secretary is to pay such \n     person an amount equal to the biodiesel mixture credit. To \n     the extent the biodiesel fuel mixture credit exceeds the \n     section 4081 liability of a person, the Secretary is to pay \n     such person an amount equal to the biodiesel fuel mixture \n     credit with respect to such mixture. Thus, if the person has \n     no section 4081 liability, the credit is refundable. The \n     payment provision does not apply with respect to biodiesel \n     fuel mixtures sold or used after December 31, 2006.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment extends the income tax credit, excise \n     tax credit, and payment provisions through December 31, 2010.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement extends the income tax credit, \n     excise tax credit, and payment provisions through December \n     31, 2008. The conference agreement also creates a similar \n     income tax credit, excise tax credit and payment system for \n     renewable diesel; however, there is no credit for small \n     producers of renewable diesel. Renewable diesel means diesel \n     fuel derived from biomass (as defined in section 29(c)(3), \n     thus excluding petroleum oil, natural gas, coal, or any \n     product thereof) using a thermal depolymerization process. \n     Renewable diesel must meet the requirements of the American \n     Society of Testing and Materials D975 or D396, and meet the \n     registration requirements for fuels and fuel additives \n     established by the Environmental Protection Agency under \n     section 211 of the Clean Air Act (42 USC 7545). The amount of \n     the credit for renewable diesel is $1.00 per gallon. In \n     addition, all producers of renewable diesel must be \n     registered with the Secretary.\n       Effective date.--The extension of incentives is effective \n     on the date of enactment.

An energy conservation \n     measure means any installation or modification primarily \n     designed to reduce consumption of electricity or natural gas \n     or to improve the management of energy demand with respect to \n     a dwelling unit (sec. 136).\n       There is no present law credit for energy efficiency \n     improvements to existing homes.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       The provision provides a 20-percent credit for the purchase \n     of qualified energy efficiency improvements to existing \n     homes. The maximum credit for a taxpayer with respect to the \n     same dwelling for all taxable years is $2,000. A qualified \n     energy efficiency improvement is any energy efficiency \n     building envelope component that meets or exceeds the \n     prescriptive criteria for such a component established by the \n     2000 International Energy Conservation Code as supplemented \n     and as in effect on the date of enactment (or, in the case of \n     metal roofs with appropriate pigmented coatings, meets the \n     Energy Star program requirements), and (1) that is installed \n     in or on a dwelling located in the United States; (2) owned \n     and used by the taxpayer as the taxpayer's principal \n     residence; (3) the original use of which commences with the \n     taxpayer; and (4) such component reasonably can be expected \n     to remain in use for at least five years. The credit is \n     nonrefundable.\n       Building envelope components are: (1) insulation materials \n     or systems which are specifically and primarily designed to \n     reduce the heat loss or gain for a dwelling; (2) exterior \n     windows (including skylights) and doors; and (3) metal roofs \n     with appropriate pigmented coatings which are specifically \n     and primarily designed to reduce the heat loss or gain for a \n     dwelling.\n       The taxpayer's basis in the property is reduced by the \n     amount of the credit. Special rules apply in the case of \n     condominiums and tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing \n     corporations.\n       In the case of expenditures that exceed $1,000, certain \n     certification requirements\n\n[[Page S9135]]\n\n     must be met in order to qualify for the credit.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for qualified \n     energy efficiency improvements installed after the date of \n     enactment and before January 1, 2008.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision provides a personal tax credit equal to the \n     greater of (1) the total of the allowable credits for the \n     purchase of certain property, or (2) the credit with respect \n     to a highly energy-efficient principal residence.\n       The allowable credit for the purchase of certain property \n     is (1) $50 for each advanced main air circulating fan, (2) \n     $150 for each qualified natural gas, propane, or oil furnace \n     or hot water boiler, and (3) $300 for each item of qualified \n     energy efficient property.\n       An advanced main air circulating fan is a fan used in a \n     natural gas, propane, or oil furnace originally placed in \n     service by the taxpayer during the taxable year, and which \n     has an annual electricity use of no more than two percent of \n     the total annual energy use of the furnace (as determined in \n     the standard Department of Energy test procedures).\n       A qualified natural gas, propane, or oil furnace or hot \n     water boiler is a natural gas, propane, or oil furnace or hot \n     water boiler with an annual fuel utilization efficiency rate \n     of at least 95.\n       Qualified energy-efficient property is: (1) an electric \n     heat pump water heater which yields an energy factor of at \n     least 2.0 in the standard Department of Energy test \n     procedure, (2) an electric heat pump which has a heating \n     seasonal performance factor (HSPF) of at least 9, a seasonal \n     energy efficiency ratio (SEER) of at least 15, and an energy \n     efficiency ratio (EER) of at least 13, (3) a geothermal heat \n     pump which (i) in the case of a closed loop product, has an \n     energy efficiency ratio (EER) of at least 14.1 and a heating \n     coefficient of performance (COP) of at least 3.3, (ii) in the \n     case of an open loop product, has an energy efficiency ratio \n     (EER) of at least 16.2 and a heating coefficient of \n     performance (COP) of at least 3.6, and (iii) in the case of a \n     direct expansion (DX) product, has an energy efficiency ratio \n     (EER) of at least 15 and a heating coefficient of performance \n     (COP) of at least 3.5, (4) a central air conditioner which \n     has a seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) of at least 15 \n     and an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of at least 13, and (5) \n     a natural gas, propane, or oil water heater which has an \n     energy factor of at least 0.80.\n       The credit with respect to a highly energy-efficient \n     principal residence is $2,000 if the principal residence \n     achieves a 50 percent reduction in energy costs relative to \n     the original condition of the building. In the case of a new \n     home, the original condition of the building is deemed to be \n     a home constructed in accordance with the standards of \n     chapter 4 of the 2003 International Energy Conservation Code \n     as in effect (including supplements) on the date of \n     enactment, and for which and any applicable Federal minimum \n     efficiency standards for equipment are met. In the case of a \n     principal residence that achieves a reduction in energy costs \n     between 20 and 50 percent, the allowable credit is $4,000 \n     times the percentage reduction. No credit is allowed in the \n     case of energy cost savings of less than 20 percent.\n       The residence must be located in the United States, and, in \n     the case of a new residence, not be acquired from a \n     contractor eligible for a credit for the production of a new \n     energy efficient home under Code section 45K (as added by the \n     bill).\n       If a credit is allowed under Code section 25D (as added by \n     the bill) relating to residential solar, photovoltaic and \n     fuel cell property, for the purpose of measuring energy \n     efficiency improvements under this provision, the original \n     condition of the home, or the comparable building in the case \n     of a new home, is determined assuming the building contains \n     the property for which the credit is allowed. Additionally, \n     if a credit is allowed under this provision for any \n     expenditure, the increase in the basis of the property that \n     would result from such expenditure is reduced by the amount \n     of the credit.\n       In order to be eligible for the credit, the residence's \n     energy savings must be demonstrated by performance-based \n     compliance and be certified according to regulations \n     established by the Secretary that follow various rules and \n     procedures, including the use of computer software based on \n     the 2005 California Residential Alternative Calculation \n     Method Approval Manual. The determination of compliance may \n     be provided by a local building regulatory authority, a \n     utility, a manufactured home production inspection primary \n     inspection agency (IPIA), or an accredited home energy rating \n     system provider. All providers shall be accredited, or \n     otherwise authorized to use approved energy performance \n     measurement methods, by the Residential Energy Services \n     Network (RESNET).\n       Special proration rules apply in the case of jointly owned \n     property, condominiums, and tenant-stockholders in \n     cooperative housing corporations. Certain restrictions and \n     limitations apply with respect to property financed by \n     subsidized energy financing or obtained through grant \n     programs. If less than 80 percent of the property is used for \n     nonbusiness purposes, only that portion of expenditures that \n     is used for nonbusiness purposes is taken into account. If a \n     credit is allowed under this provision with respect to any \n     property, the basis of such property is reduced by the amount \n     of the credit so allowed.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to property placed in \n     service after December 31, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2009.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House bill and the \n     Senate amendment with modifications.

Energy efficient commercial buildings deduction (sec. \n         1521 of the Senate amendment sec. 1331 of the conference \n         agreement, and new sec. 179D of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       No special deduction is provided for expenses incurred for \n     energy-efficient commercial building property.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n     In general\n       The provision provides a deduction equal to energy-\n     efficient commercial building property expenditures made by \n     the taxpayer. Energy-efficient commercial building property \n     expenditures is defined as property (1) which is installed on \n     or in any building located in the United States that is \n     within the scope of Standard 90.1-2001 of the American \n     Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning \n     Engineers and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North \n     America (``ASHRAE/IESNA''), (2) which is installed as part of \n     (i) the interior lighting systems, (ii) the heating, cooling, \n     ventilation, and hot water systems, or (iii) the building \n     envelope, and (3) which is certified as being installed as \n     part of a plan designed to reduce the total annual energy and \n     power costs with respect to the interior lighting systems, \n     heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water systems of the \n     building by 50 percent or more in comparison to a reference \n     building which meets the minimum requirements of Standard \n     90.1-2001 (as in effect on April 2, 2003). The deduction is \n     limited to an amount equal to $2.25 per square foot of the \n     property for which such expenditures are made. The deduction \n     is allowed in the year in which the property is placed in \n     service.\n       Certain certification requirements must be met in order to \n     qualify for the deduction. The Secretary, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of Energy, will promulgate regulations \n     that describe methods of calculating and verifying energy and \n     power costs using qualified computer software based on the \n     provisions of the 2005 California Nonresidential Alternative \n     Calculation Method Approval Manual or, in the case of \n     residential property, the 2005 California Residential \n     Alternative Calculation Method Approval Manual.\n       The Committee intends that the methods for calculation be \n     fuel neutral, such that the same energy efficiency features \n     qualify a building for the deduction under this provision \n     regardless of whether the heating source is a gas or oil \n     furnace or boiler or an electric heat pump. The Committee \n     also intends that the calculation methods provide appropriate \n     calculated energy savings for design methods and technologies \n     not otherwise credited in either Standard 90.1-2001 or in the \n     2005 California Nonresidential Alternative Calculation Method \n     Approval Manual, including the following: (i) Natural \n     ventilation (ii) Evaporative cooling (iii) Automatic lighting \n     controls such as occupancy sensors, photocells, and \n     timeclocks( iv) Daylighting (v) Designs utilizing semi-\n     conditioned spaces which maintain adequate comfort conditions \n     without air conditioning or without heating (vi) Improved fan \n     system efficiency, including reductions in static pressure \n     (vii) Advanced unloading mechanisms for mechanical cooling, \n     such as multiple or variable speed compressors (viii) On-site \n     generation of electricity, including combined heat and power \n     systems, fuel cells, and renewable energy generation such as \n     solar energy (ix) Wiring with lower energy losses than wiring \n     satisfying Standard 90.1-2001 requirements for building power \n     distribution systems. The calculation methods may take into \n     account the extent of commissioning in the building, and \n     allow the taxpayer to take into account measured performance \n     which exceeds typical performance\n       The Secretary shall prescribe procedures for the inspection \n     and testing for compliance of buildings that are comparable, \n     given the difference between commercial and residential \n     buildings, to the requirements in the\n\n[[Page S9136]]\n\n     Mortgage Industry National Accreditation Procedures for Home \n     Energy Rating Systems. Individuals qualified to determine \n     compliance shall only be those recognized by one or more \n     organizations certified by the Secretary for such purposes.\n       For energy-efficient commercial building property \n     expenditures made by a public entity, such as public schools, \n     the Secretary shall promulgate regulations that allow the \n     deduction to be allocated to the person primarily responsible \n     for designing the property in lieu of the public entity.\n       If a deduction is allowed under this section, the basis of \n     the property shall be reduced by the amount of the deduction. \n     Additionally, if a deduction is allowed for business energy \n     property under section 1523 of the Senate amendment, or an \n     individual credit for nonbusiness energy property or \n     principal residence is allowed under section 1524 of the \n     Senate amendment, then with respect to property for which a \n     deduction under this provision may be claimed, the annual \n     energy and power costs of the reference building is to be \n     determined assuming the reference building contains the \n     property for which the deduction or credit has been allowed, \n     and any cost of such property taken into account under those \n     other provisions of the bill cannot be taken into account \n     under this provision.\n     Partial allowance of deduction\n       In the case of a building that does not meet the overall \n     building requirement of a 50-percent energy savings, a \n     partial deduction is allowed with respect to each separate \n     building system that comprises energy efficient property and \n     which is certified by a qualified professional as meeting or \n     exceeding the applicable system-specific savings targets \n     established by the Secretary of the Treasury. The applicable \n     system-specific savings targets to be established by the \n     Secretary are those that would result in a total annual \n     energy savings with respect to the whole building of 50 \n     percent, if each of the separate systems met the system \n     specific target. The separate building systems are (1) the \n     interior lighting system, (2) the heating, cooling, \n     ventilation and hot water systems, and (3) the building \n     envelope. The maximum allowable deduction is $0.75 per square \n     foot for each separate system.\n       In the case of system-specific partial deductions, in \n     general no deduction is allowed until the Secretary \n     establishes system-specific targets. However, in the case of \n     lighting system retrofits, until such time as the Secretary \n     issues final regulations, the system-specific energy savings \n     target for the lighting system is deemed to be met by a \n     reduction in Lighting Power Density of 40 percent (50 percent \n     in the case of a warehouse) of the minimum requirements in \n     Table 9.3.1.1 or Table 9.3.1.2 of ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-\n     2001. Also, in the case of a lighting system that reduces \n     lighting power density by 25 percent, a partial deduction of \n     37.5 cents per square foot is allowed. A pro-rated partial \n     deduction is allowed in the case of a lighting system that \n     reduces lighting power density between 25 percent and 40 \n     percent. Certain lighting level and lighting control \n     requirements must also be met in order to qualify for the \n     partial lighting deductions.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for property \n     placed in service after the date of enactment and prior to \n     January 1, 2010.\n\n\n                          conference agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     modifications. The conference agreement provides that the \n     deduction amount is reduced to $1.80 per square foot, and \n     that the partial deduction for building subsystems is reduced \n     to $0.60 per square foot. The conference agreement also \n     modifies the effective date.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for property \n     placed in service after December 31, 2005 and prior to \n     January 1, 2008.\n     14.

The Committee intends that the building envelope \n     component means insulation materials or system specifically \n     and primarily designed to reduce heat loss or gain, exterior \n     windows (including skylights), doors, and any duct sealing \n     and infiltration reduction measures.\n       Manufactured homes that conform to federal manufactured \n     home construction and safety standards are eligible for the \n     credit provided all the criteria for the credit are met. \n     Manufactured homes certified by a method prescribed by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under \n     the Energy Star Labeled Homes program are eligible for the \n     $1,000 credit provided criteria (1) and (2), above, are met.\n       The credit is part of the general business credit. No \n     credits attributable to energy efficient homes can be carried \n     back to any taxable year ending on or before the effective \n     date of the credit.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to homes whose \n     construction is substantially completed after the date of \n     enactment, and which are purchased during the period \n     beginning on the date of enactment and ending on December 31, \n     2009 (December 31, 2007 in the case of the $1,000 credit).\n\n\n                          conference agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with \n     modifications. The conference agreement provides that the \n     credit related to homes meeting the 30-percent efficiency \n     standard applies only to manufactured homes. The conference \n     agreement also modifies the effective date.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to homes whose \n     construction is substantially completed after December 31, \n     2005, and which are purchased after December 31, 2005 and \n     prior to January 1, 2008.\n     16. Energy credit for combined heat and power system property \n         (sec. 1525 of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       A nonrefundable, 10-percent business energy credit is \n     allowed for the cost of new property that is equipment (1) \n     that uses solar energy to generate electricity, to heat or \n     cool a structure, or to provide solar process heat, or (2) \n     used to produce, distribute, or use energy derived from a \n     geothermal deposit, but only, in the case of electricity \n     generated by geothermal power, up to the electric \n     transmission stage.\n       The business energy tax credits are components of the \n     general business credit (sec. 38(b)(1)). The business energy \n     tax credits, when combined with all other components of the \n     general business credit, generally may not exceed for any \n     taxable year the excess of the taxpayer's net income tax over \n     the greater of (1) 25 percent of net regular tax liability \n     above $25,000 or (2) the tentative minimum tax. For credits \n     arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997, \n     an unused general business credit generally may be carried \n     back one year and carried forward 20 years (sec. 39).\n       A taxpayer may exclude from income the value of any subsidy \n     provided by a public utility for the purchase or installation \n     of an energy conservation measure. An energy conservation \n     measure means any installation or modification primarily \n     designed to reduce consumption of electricity or natural gas \n     or to improve the management of energy demand with respect to \n     a dwelling unit (sec. 136).\n       There is no present-law credit for combined heat and power \n     (``CHP'') property.\n\n\n                               house bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            senate amendment\n\n       The provision provides a 10-percent credit for the purchase \n     of CHP property.\n       CHP property is property: (1) that uses the same energy \n     source for the simultaneous or sequential generation of \n     electrical power, mechanical shaft power, or both, in \n     combination with the generation of steam or other forms of \n     useful thermal energy (including heating and cooling \n     applications); (2) that has an electrical capacity of not \n     more than 15 megawatts or a mechanical energy capacity of no \n     more than 2000 horsepower or an equivalent combination of \n     electrical and mechanical energy capacities; (3) that \n     produces at least 20 percent of its total useful energy in \n     the form of thermal energy that is not used to produce \n     electrical or mechanical power, and produces at least 20 \n     percent of its total useful energy in the form of electrical \n     or mechanical power (or a combination thereof); and (4) the \n     energy efficiency percentage of which exceeds 60 percent. CHP \n     property does not include property used to transport the \n     energy source to the generating facility or to distribute \n     energy produced by the facility.\n       Additionally, the provision provides that systems whose \n     fuel source is at least 90 percent bagasse and that would \n     qualify for the credit but for the failure to meet the \n     efficiency standard are eligible for a credit that is reduced \n     in proportion to the degree to which the system fails to meet \n     the efficiency standard. For example, a system that would \n     otherwise be required to meet the 60-percent efficiency \n     standard, but which only achieves 30-percent efficiency, \n     would be permitted a credit equal to one-half of the \n     otherwise allowable credit (i.e., a 5-percent credit).\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to periods after the \n     date of enactment in taxable years ending after the date of \n     enactment, for property placed in service before January 1, \n     2008, under rules similar to rules of section 48(m) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as in effect on the day before \n     the date of enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of \n     1990).\n\n\n                          conference agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     17. Energy efficient appliances (sec. 1526 of the Senate \n         amendment, sec. 1334 of the conference agreement, and new \n         sec. 45M of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       There is no present-law credit for the manufacture of \n     energy-efficient appliances.\n\n\n                               house bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            senate amendment\n\n       The provision provides a credit for the eligible production \n     of certain energy-efficient dishwashers, clothes washers and \n     refrigerators.\n       The credit for dishwashers applies to dishwashers produced \n     in 2006 and 2007 that meet the Energy Star standards for \n     2007. The credit amount equals $3 multiplied by the \n     percentage by which the efficiency of the 2007 standards (not \n     yet known) exceeds that of the 2005 standards. The credit may \n     not exceed $100 per dishwasher.\n       The credit for clothes washers equals (1) $50 for clothes \n     washers manufactured in 2005 that have a modified energy \n     factor (MEF) of at least 1.42, (2) $100 for clothes washers \n     manufactured in 2005-2007 that meet the requirements of the \n     Energy Star program which are in effect for clothes washers \n     in 2007, or (3) the minimum of (i) $200 or (ii) $10 \n     multiplied by the average of the energy and water savings \n     percentages of the 2010 Energy Star standards relative to the \n     2007 Energy Star standards, for clothes washers manufactured \n     in 2008-2010 that meet the requirements of the Energy Star \n     program which are in effect for clothes washers in 2010.\n       The credit for refrigerators is based on energy savings and \n     year of manufacture. The energy savings are determined \n     relative to the energy conservation standards promulgated by \n     the Department of Energy that took effect on July 1, 2001. \n     Refrigerators that achieve a 15 to 20 percent energy saving \n     and that are manufactured in 2005 or 2006 receive a $75 \n     credit. Refrigerators that achieve a 20 to 25 percent energy \n     saving receive a (i) $125 credit if manufactured in 2005-\n     2007, or (ii) $100 credit if manufactured in 2008. \n     Refrigerators that achieve at least a 25 percent energy \n     saving receive a (i) $175 credit if manufactured in 2005-\n     2007, or (ii) $150 credit if manufactured in 2008-2010.\n       Appliances eligible for the credit include only those that \n     exceed the average amount of production from the 3 prior \n     calendar years for each category of appliance. In the case of \n     refrigerators, eligible production is production that exceeds \n     110 percent of the average amount of production from the 3 \n     prior calendar years. Proration rules apply in the case of \n     credits for 2005 production.\n       A dishwasher is any a residential dishwasher subject to the \n     energy conservation standards established by the Department \n     of Energy. A refrigerator must be an automatic defrost \n     refrigerator-freezer with an internal volume of at least 16.5 \n     cubic feet to qualify for the credit. A clothes washer is any \n     residential clothes washer, including a residential style \n     coin operated washer, that satisfies the relevant efficiency \n     standard.\n       The taxpayer may not claim credits in excess of $75 million \n     for all taxable years, and may not claim credits in excess of \n     $20 million with respect to clothes washers eligible for the \n     $50 credit and refrigerators eligible for the $75 credit. A \n     taxpayer may elect to increase the $20 million limitation \n     described above to $25 million provided that the aggregate \n     amount of credits with respect to such appliances, plus \n     refrigerators eligible for the $100 and $125 credits, is \n     limited to $50 million for all taxable years.\n       Additionally, the credit allowed in a taxable year for all \n     appliances may not exceed two percent of the average annual \n     gross receipts of the taxpayer for the three taxable years \n     preceding the taxable year in which the credit is determined.\n       The credit is part of the general business credit.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to appliances produced \n     after the date of enactment and prior to January 1, 2011 \n     (January 1, 2008, in the case of dishwashers).\n\n\n                          conference agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, but \n     only with respect to the provisions that cover production \n     after December 31, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2008.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to appliances produced \n     after December 31, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2008.\n\n              C. Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Provisions\n\n     1. Allow nonbusiness energy credits against the alternative \n         minimum tax (sec. 1321 of the House bill)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law imposes an alternative minimum tax on \n     individuals in an amount equal to the excess of the tentative \n     minimum tax over the regular tax liability. The tentative \n     minimum tax is an amount equal to specified rates of tax \n     imposed on the excess of the alternative minimum taxable \n     income over an exemption amount.\n\n[[Page S9138]]\n\n       Generally, for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2005, nonrefundable personal credits may not exceed the \n     excess of the regular tax liability over the tentative \n     minimum tax.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       The provision allows the personal energy credits added by \n     the House bill to offset both the regular tax and the \n     alternative minimum tax.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2005.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not contain the House bill \n     provision.\n     2. Allow certain business energy credits against the \n         alternative minimum tax (sec. 1322 of the House bill and \n         sec. 1548(c) of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law imposes an alternative minimum tax on \n     individuals and corporations in an amount equal to the excess \n     of the tentative minimum tax over the regular tax liability. \n     The tentative minimum tax is an amount equal to specified \n     rates of tax imposed on the excess of the alternative minimum \n     taxable income over an exemption amount.\n       Generally, the general business credit may not exceed the \n     excess of the regular tax liability over the tentative \n     minimum tax (or, if greater, 25 percent of so much of the \n     regular tax liability as exceeds $25,000). Amounts in excess \n     of this limitation generally may be carried back one year and \n     forward 20 years. In applying the tax limitation to certain \n     business energy credits, the tentative minimum tax is treated \n     as being zero. These credits include the alcohol fuels credit \n     and the section 45 credit for electricity produced from a \n     facility (placed in service after October 22, 2004) during \n     the first four years of production beginning on the date the \n     facility is placed in service.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       The House bill expands the list of business energy credits \n     for which the tentative minimum tax is treated as being zero \n     to include (i) the low sulfur diesel fuel production credit, \n     (ii) the marginal oil and gas well production credit, (iii) \n     the portion of the investment credit attributable to \n     qualified fuel cells, and (iv) for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, the \n     enhanced oil recovery credit.\n       Effective date.--The provision generally applies to credits \n     determined for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2005. In the case of the credit for qualified fuel cells, the \n     provision applies for taxable years ending after April 11, \n     2005.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment expands the list of business energy \n     credits for which the tentative minimum tax is treated as \n     being zero to include the credit for production of coal owned \n     by Indian tribes.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective as if included \n     in the provision allowing the credit.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not expand the list of \n     business energy credits for which the tentative minimum tax \n     is treated as being zero.\n\n                  D. Additional Energy Tax Incentives\n\n     1. Ten-year recovery period for underground natural gas \n         storage facilities and cushion gas (sec. 1541 of the \n         Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, depreciation allowances for property \n     used in a trade or business generally are determined under \n     the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (``MACRS''). \n     Under MACRS, natural gas storage facilities and related \n     equipment have a class life of 22 years and a recovery period \n     of 15 years.\n       Cushion gas is the minimum volume of natural gas necessary \n     to provide the pressure to facilitate the flow of gas from a \n     storage reservoir to a pipeline. Recoverable cushion gas will \n     be available for sale or other use upon abandonment of the \n     storage reservoir, while nonrecoverable cushion gas will \n     become obsolete with that abandonment. Under present law, the \n     tax treatment of cushion gas depends on whether such gas is \n     recoverable. The quantity of cushion gas that is recoverable \n     is not subject to depreciation because it is not subject to \n     exhaustion, wear, tear, or obsolescence. Conversely, non-\n     recoverable cushion gas is subject to obsolescence and is \n     therefore subject to tax depreciation. The depreciable life \n     of non-recoverable cushion gas is also 15 years.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment reclassifies underground natural gas \n     storage facilities and nonrecoverable cushion gas as 10-year \n     MACRS property. The present law treatment of recoverable \n     cushion gas remains unchanged.\n       Effective date.--The Senate amendment provision applies to \n     property placed in service after the date of enactment, the \n     original use of which commences with the taxpayer.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     2. Modify research credit for research relating to energy \n         (sec. 1542 of the Senate amendment, sec. 1351 of the \n         conference agreement, and sec. 41 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     General rule\n       Section 41 provides for a research tax credit equal to 20 \n     percent of the amount by which a taxpayer's qualified \n     research expenses for a taxable year exceed its base amount \n     for that year. The research tax credit is scheduled to expire \n     and generally will not apply to amounts paid or incurred \n     after December 31, 2005.\n       A 20-percent research tax credit also applies to the excess \n     of (1) 100 percent of corporate cash expenses (including \n     grants or contributions) paid for basic research conducted by \n     universities (and certain nonprofit scientific research \n     organizations) over (2) the sum of (a) the greater of two \n     minimum basic research floors plus (b) an amount reflecting \n     any decrease in nonresearch giving to universities by the \n     corporation as compared to such giving during a fixed-base \n     period, as adjusted for inflation. This separate credit \n     computation is commonly referred to as the university basic \n     research credit (see sec. 41(e)).\n     Alternative incremental research credit regime\n       Taxpayers are allowed to elect an alternative incremental \n     research credit regime. If a taxpayer elects to be subject to \n     this alternative regime, the taxpayer is assigned a three-\n     tiered fixed-base percentage (that is lower than the fixed-\n     base percentage otherwise applicable under present law) and \n     the credit rate likewise is reduced. Under the alternative \n     credit regime, a credit rate of 2.65 percent applies to the \n     extent that a taxpayer's current-year research expenses \n     exceed a base amount computed by using a fixed-base \n     percentage of one percent (i.e., the base amount equals one \n     percent of the taxpayer's average gross receipts for the four \n     preceding years) but do not exceed a base amount computed by \n     using a fixed-base percentage of 1.5 percent. A credit rate \n     of 3.2 percent applies to the extent that a taxpayer's \n     current-year research expenses exceed a base amount computed \n     by using a fixed-base percentage of 1.5 percent but do not \n     exceed a base amount computed by using a fixed-base \n     percentage of two percent. A credit rate of 3.75 percent \n     applies to the extent that a taxpayer's current-year research \n     expenses exceed a base amount computed by using a fixed-base \n     percentage of two percent. An election to be subject to this \n     alternative incremental credit regime may be made for any \n     taxable year beginning after June 30, 1996, and such an \n     election applies to that taxable year and all subsequent \n     years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary of the \n     Treasury.\n     Eligible expenses\n       Qualified research expenses eligible for the research tax \n     credit consist of: (1) in-house expenses of the taxpayer for \n     wages and supplies attributable to qualified research; (2) \n     certain time-sharing costs for computer use in qualified \n     research; and (3) 65 percent of amounts paid or incurred by \n     the taxpayer to certain other persons for qualified research \n     conducted on the taxpayer's behalf (so-called contract \n     research expenses). In the case of amounts paid to a research \n     consortium, 75 percent of amounts paid for qualified research \n     is treated as qualified research expenses eligible for the \n     research credit (rather than 65 percent under the general \n     rule) if (1) such research consortium is a tax-exempt \n     organization that is described in section 501(c)(3) (other \n     than a private foundation) or section 501(c)(6) and is \n     organized and operated primarily to conduct scientific \n     research, and (2) such qualified research is conducted by the \n     consortium on behalf of the taxpayer and one or more persons \n     not related to the taxpayer.\n       To be eligible for the credit, the research must not only \n     satisfy the requirements of present-law section 174 for the \n     deduction for research expenses, but must be undertaken for \n     the purpose of discovering information that is technological \n     in nature, the application of which is intended to be useful \n     in the development of a new or improved business component \n     of the taxpayer, and substantially all of the activities \n     of which must constitute elements of a process of \n     experimentation for functional aspects, performance, \n     reliability, or quality of a business component.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision modifies the present-law research credit as \n     it applies to qualified energy research. In particular, the \n     provision provides that the taxpayer may claim a credit equal \n     to 20 percent of the taxpayer's expenditures on qualified \n     energy research undertaken by an energy research consortium. \n     The amount of credit claimed is determined only by regard to \n     such expenditures by the taxpayer within the taxable year. \n     Unlike the general rule for the research credit, the 20-\n     percent credit for research by an energy research consortium \n     applies to all such expenditures, not only those in excess of \n     a base amount however determined. An energy research \n     consortium is a qualified research consortium as under \n     present law that also is organized and operated primarily to \n     conduct energy research and development in the public \n     interest and to which at least five unrelated persons paid, \n     or incurred amounts, to such organization within the calendar \n     year. In addition, to be a qualified energy research \n     consortium no single person shall pay or\n\n[[Page S9139]]\n\n     incur more than 50 percent of the total amounts received by \n     the research consortium during the calendar year.\n       The provision also provides that 100 percent of amounts \n     paid or incurred by the taxpayer to eligible small \n     businesses, universities, and Federal for qualified energy \n     research would constitute qualified research expenses as \n     contract research expenses, rather than 65 percent of \n     qualified research expenditures allowed under present law. An \n     eligible small business for this purpose is a business in \n     which the taxpayer does not own a 50 percent or greater \n     interest and the business has employed, on average, 500 or \n     fewer employees in the two preceding calendar years.\n       Qualified energy research expenditures are expenditures \n     that would otherwise qualify for the research credit under \n     present law and relate to the production, supply, and \n     conservation of energy, including otherwise qualifying \n     research expenditures related to alternative energy sources \n     or the use of alternative energy sources. For example, \n     research relating to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would \n     qualify under this provision, if the research expenditures \n     otherwise satisfy the criteria of present-law sec. 41. \n     Likewise, otherwise qualifying research undertaken to improve \n     the energy-efficiency of lighting would qualify under this \n     provision.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for amounts \n     paid or incurred after the date of enactment in taxable years \n     ending after such date.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.\n     3. Small agri-biodiesel producer credit (sec. 1543 of the \n         Senate amendment, sec. 1345 of the conference agreement, \n         and sec. 40A of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Biodiesel income tax credit\n       The Code provides an income tax credit for biodiesel and \n     qualified biodiesel mixtures, the biodiesel fuels credit. The \n     biodiesel fuels credit is the sum of the biodiesel mixture \n     credit plus the biodiesel credit and is treated as a general \n     business credit. The amount of the biodiesel fuels credit is \n     includable in gross income. The biodiesel fuels credit is \n     coordinated to take into account benefits from the biodiesel \n     excise tax credit and payment provisions created by the Act. \n     The credit may not be carried back to a taxable year ending \n     before or on December 31, 2004. The provision does not apply \n     to fuel sold or used after December 31, 2006.\n       Biodiesel is monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids \n     derived from plant or animal matter that meet (1) the \n     registration requirements established by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency under section 211 of the Clean Air Act and \n     (2) the requirements of the American Society of Testing and \n     Materials D6751. Agri-biodiesel is biodiesel derived solely \n     from virgin oils including oils from corn, soybeans, \n     sunflower seeds, cottonseeds, canola, crambe, rapeseeds, \n     safflowers, flaxseeds, rice bran, mustard seeds, or animal \n     fats.\n       Biodiesel may be taken into account for purposes of the \n     credit only if the taxpayer obtains a certification (in such \n     form and manner as prescribed by the Secretary) from the \n     producer or importer of the biodiesel which identifies the \n     product produced and the percentage of the biodiesel and \n     agri-biodiesel in the product.\n       The biodiesel income tax credit does not contain any \n     incentives for small producers.\n     Small ethanol producer credit\n       Present law provides several tax benefits for ethanol and \n     methanol produced from renewable sources that are used as a \n     motor fuel or that are blended with other fuels (e.g., \n     gasoline) for such a use. In the case of ethanol, a separate \n     10-cents-per-gallon credit for up to 15 million gallons per \n     year for small producers, defined generally as persons whose \n     production does not exceed 15 million gallons per year and \n     whose production capacity does not exceed 30 million gallons \n     per year. The ethanol must (1) be sold by such producer to \n     another person (a) for use by such other person in the \n     production of al qualified alcohol fuel mixture in such \n     person's trade or business (other than casual off-farm \n     production), (b) for use by such other person as a fuel in a \n     trade or business, or, (c) who sells such ethanol at retail \n     to another person and places such ethanol in the fuel tank of \n     such other person; or (2) used by the producer for any \n     purpose described in (a), (b), or (c). A cooperative may pass \n     through the small ethanol producer credit to its patrons. The \n     alcohol fuels tax credits are includible in income. This \n     credit may be used to offset alternative minimum tax \n     liability. The credit is a treated as a general business \n     credit, subject to the ordering rules and carryforward/\n     carryback rules that apply to business credits generally. The \n     alcohol fuels tax credit is scheduled to expire after \n     December 31, 2010.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment adds to the biodiesel fuels credit a \n     small agri-biodiesel producer credit. The credit is a 10-\n     cents-per-gallon credit for up to 15 million gallons of agri-\n     biodiesel produced by small producers, defined generally as \n     persons whose agri-biodiesel production capacity does not \n     exceed 60 million gallons per year. The agri-biodiesel must \n     (1) be sold by such producer to another person (a) for use by \n     such other person in the production of a qualified biodiesel \n     mixture in such person's trade or business (other than casual \n     off-farm production), (b) for use by such other person as a \n     fuel in a trade or business, or, (c) who sells such agri-\n     biodiesel at retail to another person and places such ethanol \n     in the fuel tank of such other person; or (2) used by the \n     producer for any purpose described in (a), (b), or (c).\n       Like the small ethanol producer credit, cooperatives may \n     elect to pass through any portion of the small agri-biodiesel \n     producer credits to its patrons. The credit is apportioned \n     pro rata among patrons of the cooperative on the basis of the \n     quantity or value of the business done with or for such \n     patrons for the taxable year. An election to pass through the \n     credit is made on a timely filed return for the taxable year \n     and is irrevocable for such taxable year.\n       The amount of the credit not apportioned to patrons is \n     included in the organization's credit for the taxable year of \n     the organization. The amount of the credit apportioned to \n     patrons is to be included in the patron's credit for the \n     first taxable year of each patron ending on or after the last \n     day of the payment period for the taxable year of the \n     organization, or, if earlier, for the taxable year of each \n     patron ending on or after the date on which the patron \n     receives notice from the cooperative of the apportionment.\n       If the amount of the cooperative's credit for a taxable \n     year is less than the amount of the credit shown on the \n     organization's tax return for such taxable year, an amount \n     equal to the excess of the reduction in the credit over the \n     amount not apportioned to patrons for the taxable year is \n     treated as an increase in the cooperative's tax. The increase \n     is not treated as tax imposed for purposes of determining the \n     amount of any tax credit or for purposes of the alternative \n     minimum tax.\n       The credit sunsets after December 31, 2010, along with the \n     other biodiesel incentives as extended under the Senate \n     amendment.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable \n     years ending after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment \n     except the credit sunsets after December 31, 2008.\n     4. Modifications to small ethanol producer credit (sec. 1544 \n         of the Senate amendment, sec. 1347 of the conference \n         agreement, and sec. 40 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law provides several tax benefits for ethanol and \n     methanol that are used as a fuel or that are blended with \n     other fuels (e.g., gasoline) for such a use. For example, the \n     Code provides an income tax credit for alcohol and alcohol-\n     blended fuels. In the case of ethanol, the Code provides an \n     additional 10-cents-per-gallon credit for small producers, \n     defined generally as persons whose production capacity does \n     not exceed 30 million gallons per year.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment increases the limit on production \n     capacity for small ethanol producers from 30 million gallons \n     to 60 million gallons per year.\n       The Senate amendment also provides that an election to pass \n     the small ethanol producer credit through to cooperative \n     patrons is not valid unless the cooperative provides patrons \n     timely written notice of the apportionment of the credit. \n     Under the Senate amendment, notice is timely if mailed to \n     patrons during the payment period described in section \n     1382(d) of the Code.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable \n     years ending after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment.\n     5. Credit for equipment for processing or sorting materials \n         gathered through recycling (sec. 1545 of the Senate \n         amendment and sec. 1353 of the conference agreement)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There is no present law credit for equipment for processing \n     or sorting materials gathered through recycling.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision provides a 15-percent business tax credit for \n     the cost of qualified recycling equipment placed in service \n     or leased by the taxpayer. Qualified recycling equipment is \n     equipment, including connecting piping, (1) that is employed \n     in sorting or processing residential and commercial qualified \n     recyclable materials (any packaging or printed material \n     which is glass, paper, plastic, steel, or aluminum \n     generated by an individual or business) for the purpose of \n     converting such materials for use in manufacturing \n     tangible consumer products, including packaging, or (2) \n     whose primary purpose is the shredding and processing of \n     any electronic waste, including any cathode ray tube, flat \n     panel screen, or similar video display device with a \n     screen size greater than four inches measured diagonally, \n     or a central processing unit.\n       Qualified recycling equipment does not include rolling \n     stock or other equipment used to transport recyclable \n     materials. Materials\n\n[[Page S9140]]\n\n     that are not packaging or printed material, such as tires or \n     scrap metal from junked automobiles, are not qualified \n     recyclable materials, and thus equipment used to process such \n     materials are not qualified recycling equipment.\n       For the purposes of (1), qualified recycling equipment \n     includes equipment that is utilized at commercial or public \n     venues, including recycling collection centers, where the \n     equipment is utilized to sort or process qualified recyclable \n     materials for such purpose. For the purpose of (2), only the \n     cost of each piece of equipment as exceeds $400,000 is \n     eligible for the credit.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to amounts paid or \n     incurred during the taxable year for qualified recycling \n     equipment placed in service or leased in taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision. The conference agreement directs the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary \n     of Energy, to conduct a study to determine and quantify the \n     energy savings achieved through the recycling of glass, \n     paper, plastic, steel, aluminum, and electronic devices, and \n     to identify tax incentives that would encourage recycling of \n     such material. The study is to be submitted to Congress \n     within one year of the date of enactment.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n     6. Five-year carryback of net operating losses for certain \n         electric utility companies (sec. 1546 of the Senate \n         amendment, sec. 1311 of the conference agreement, and \n         sec. 172 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A net operating loss (``NOL'') is, generally, the amount by \n     which a taxpayer's allowable deductions exceed the taxpayer's \n     gross income. A carryback of an NOL generally results in the \n     refund of Federal income tax for the carryback year. A \n     carryover of an NOL reduces Federal income tax for the \n     carryover year.\n       In general, an NOL may be carried back two years and \n     carried over 20 years to offset taxable income in such years. \n     Under present-law ordering rules, NOLs generally are first \n     applied to the earliest of the taxable years to which the \n     loss may be carried.\n       Different rules apply with respect to NOLs arising in \n     certain circumstances. For example, a three-year carryback \n     applies with respect to NOLs (1) arising from casualty or \n     theft losses of individuals, or (2) attributable to \n     Presidentially declared disasters for taxpayers engaged in a \n     farming business or a small business. A five-year carryback \n     period applies to NOLs from a farming loss (regardless of \n     whether the loss was incurred in a Presidentially declared \n     disaster area). Special rules also apply to real estate \n     investment trusts (no carryback), specified liability losses \n     (10-year carryback), and excess interest losses (no carryback \n     to any year preceding a corporate equity reduction \n     transaction).\n       Section 202 of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act \n     of 2002 (``JCWAA'') provided a temporary extension of the \n     general NOL carryback period to five years (from two years) \n     for NOLs arising in taxable years ending in 2001 and 2002. In \n     addition, the five-year carryback period applies to NOLs from \n     these years that qualify under present law for a three- year \n     carryback period (i.e., NOLs arising from casualty or theft \n     losses of individuals or attributable to certain \n     Presidentially declared disaster areas).\n       A taxpayer can elect to forgo the five-year carryback \n     period. The election to forgo the five-year carryback period \n     is made in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury and must be made by the due date of the return \n     (including extensions) for the year of the loss. The election \n     is irrevocable. If a taxpayer elects to forgo the five-year \n     carryback period, then the losses are subject to the rules \n     that otherwise would apply under section 172 absent the \n     provision.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment provides a temporary extension of the \n     NOL carryback period to five years for NOLs of certain \n     electric utility companies arising in taxable years ending in \n     2003, 2004, and 2005 (``eligible NOLs''). Regardless of the \n     taxable year in which an eligible NOL arose, refund claims \n     resulting from the extended carryback period can be made \n     during any taxable year ending after December 31, 2005, and \n     before January 1, 2009. However, the amount of the refund \n     claimed during any one taxable year may not exceed the amount \n     of the electric utility company's investment in electric \n     transmission property and pollution control facilities \n     (``qualifying investment'') in the preceding taxable year. \n     The present-law NOL carryover ordering rules apply. Taxpayers \n     may elect to forgo the five-year carryback period provided \n     under the provision if an election is filed before January 1, \n     2009.\n       Effective date.--The Senate amendment provision is \n     effective for refund claims resulting from net operating \n     losses generated in taxable years ending in 2003, 2004, and \n     2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, with \n     the following modifications. The conference agreement \n     provides an election for certain electric utility companies \n     to extend the carryback period to five years for a portion of \n     NOLs arising in 2003, 2004, and 2005 (``loss years''). The \n     election may be made during any taxable year ending \n     after December 31, 2005, and before January 1, 2009 \n     (``election years''). An electing taxpayer must specify to \n     which loss year the election applies.\n       The portion of the loss year NOL to which the election may \n     apply is limited to 20 percent of the amount of the \n     taxpayer's qualifying investment in the taxable year prior to \n     the year in which the election is made (the ``qualifying \n     investment limitation''). Rules similar to those applicable \n     to specified liability losses apply, and any remaining \n     portion of the loss year NOL remains subject to the present \n     law NOL carryover rules. Only one election may be made in any \n     election year, and elections may not be made for more than \n     one election year beginning in the same calendar year. Thus, \n     for example, a taxpayer with two short taxable years \n     beginning in calendar year 2006 is eligible to make an \n     election under this provision in only one of those two short \n     taxable years. Once an election has been made with respect to \n     a loss year, no subsequent election is available with respect \n     to that loss year.\n       For purposes of calculating interest on overpayments, any \n     overpayment resulting from a five-year NOL carryback elected \n     under this provision is deemed not to have been made prior to \n     the filing date for the taxable year in which the election is \n     made. The statute of limitations for refund claims, and that \n     for assessment of deficiencies, are also extended.\n       An election under this provision is made in such manner as \n     the Secretary may prescribe. However, the conferees expect \n     that the filing of a refund claim will be considered \n     sufficient for making the election, provided that the \n     taxpayer attaches to the refund claim a statement specifying \n     the election year, the loss year, and the amount of \n     qualifying investment in electric transmission property and \n     pollution control facilities in the preceding taxable year.\n       Under the conference agreement, an investment in electric \n     transmission property qualifies if it is a capital \n     expenditure made by the taxpayer which is attributable to \n     electric transmission property used by the taxpayer in the \n     transmission at 69 or more kilovolts of electricity for sale.\n       An investment in pollution control equipment qualifies if \n     it is a capital expenditure, made by an electric utility \n     company (as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act \n     as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the \n     provision), which is attributable to a facility which will \n     qualify as a certified pollution control facility, generally \n     as defined under section 169(d)(1) but without regard to the \n     requirements therein that the facility be new or that it be \n     used in connection with a plant or other property in \n     operation before January 1, 1976.\n       The conferees recognize that a significant amount of time \n     may be required between the date of a capital expenditure for \n     electric transmission property or pollution control equipment \n     and the date the property is placed in service. Accordingly, \n     there is no requirement that the transmission property or \n     pollution control facilities be placed in service in the year \n     in which the capital expenditures are incurred. However, it \n     is intended that qualifying investment under the provision \n     includes only capital expenditures to which the taxpayer is \n     committed and with respect to property which the taxpayer \n     intends to ultimately place in service in the taxpayer's \n     trade or business. Under the conference agreement, capital \n     expenditures which, at the taxpayer's option, are refundable \n     or subject to material modification in a manner which would \n     not meet the requirements of the provision, may not be taken \n     into account. For example, if a taxpayer makes a cash deposit \n     with respect to a contract for the purchase of electric \n     transmission property, and the contract contains an option \n     (or there is otherwise an understanding) under which the \n     taxpayer may subsequently apply the deposit to the purchase \n     of equipment other than electric transmission property, the \n     deposit is not included in the taxpayer's qualifying \n     investment. This rule is intended as an anti-abuse rule and \n     should be interpreted to prevent a taxpayer from taking into \n     account capital expenditures to which the taxpayer is not \n     permanently committed.\n       Effective date.--The conference agreement provision is \n     effective for elections made in taxable years ending after \n     December 31, 2005, and before January 1, 2009, with respect \n     to net operating losses arising in taxable years ending in \n     2003, 2004, and 2005.\n     7. Qualifying pollution control equipment credit (sec. 1547 \n         of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There is no tax credit for investment in pollution control \n     equipment. An investment credit is available for investment \n     in certain energy property.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment provides an investment credit for \n     qualifying pollution control equipment. The credit is an \n     amount equal to 15 percent of the basis of qualifying \n     pollution control equipment placed in service at a qualifying \n     facility during the taxable year. Qualifying pollution \n     control equipment means any technology that is installed in \n     or on a qualifying facility to reduce air emissions of any \n     pollutant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency \n     under the\n\n[[Page S9141]]\n\n     Clean Air Act, including thermal oxidizers, scrubber systems, \n     vapor recovery systems, low nitric oxide burners, flair \n     systems, bag houses, cyclones, and continuous emission \n     monitoring systems. A qualifying facility is a facility that \n     produces not less than 1,000,000 gallons of ethanol during \n     the taxable year. For depreciation purposes, the basis of \n     qualifying pollution control equipment is reduced by 50 \n     percent of the amount of the credit.\n       In the case of property constructed over a period of two or \n     more years, a taxpayer may elect to claim the credit on the \n     basis of qualified progress expenditures made during the \n     period of construction before the property is completed and \n     placed in service.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to periods after the \n     date of enactment in accordance with the transitional rules \n     set forth in 48(m) (as in effect before its repeal).\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     8. Credit for production of coal owned by Indian tribes (sec. \n         1548 of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law provides two income tax incentives for \n     businesses operating within Indian reservations: (1) \n     accelerated depreciation with respect to certain non-gaming \n     property used in a trade or business within an Indian \n     reservation (sec. 168(j)); and (2) a nonrefundable income \n     tax credit to employers on the first $20,000 of qualified \n     wages and health care costs paid to certain members of \n     Indian tribes (or their spouses) who work on or near an \n     Indian reservation and who earn less than $30,000 per year \n     (adjusted for inflation beginning in 1993) (sec. 45A). \n     Both credits expire after December 31, 2005.\n       Present law does not provide a credit for the production of \n     coal from coal reserves owned by an Indian tribe.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The provision establishes a credit for ``Indian coal'' sold \n     to an unrelated person. Indian coal is defined as coal \n     produced from coal reserves that on June 14, 2005, were owned \n     by a Federally recognized tribe of Indians or are held in \n     trust by the United States for a tribe or its members.\n       The amount of the credit equals $1.50 per ton for coal sold \n     in 2006 through 2009 and $2.00 per ton for coal sold after \n     2009. The credit is indexed for inflation after 2006, is part \n     of the general business credit (sec. 38), and is allowed \n     against the alternative minimum tax.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to Indian coal sold \n     after December 31, 2005, and before January 1, 2013.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement generally follows the Senate \n     amendment with some modifications. Under the conference \n     agreement, the credit for Indian coal is added by modifying \n     Code section 45, rather than by amending Code section 38 and \n     creating new Code section 45N. As a result, some technical \n     aspects of the credit are changed. These technical aspects \n     are described in section A.9. of this report along with \n     descriptions of other modifications to Code section 45.\n     9.

In general, a non-\n     compliant wood stove is any wood stove purchased prior to \n     June 30, 1992. Stoves produced after June 30, 1992 must \n     comply with EPA's Standards of Performance for Residential \n     Wood Heaters. The credit is only available for replacements \n     that occur in areas designated by the EPA as nonattainment \n     areas for particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in \n     diameter or nonattainment areas for particulate matter less \n     than 10 micrometers in diameter.\n       Effective date.--The credit applies to solid fuel burning \n     stoves purchased after the date of enactment and before \n     January 1, 2009.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     10. Exemption for bulk beds from excise tax on retail sale of \n         heavy trucks and trailers (sec. 1550 of the Senate \n         amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Code imposes a 12-percent excise tax on the first \n     retail sale of heavy trucks and trailers (chassis and \n     bodies). Under present law, the tax on the first retail sale \n     of automobile truck bodies does not apply to any body \n     primarily designed: (1) to process or prepare seed, feed, or \n     fertilizer for use on farms; (2) to haul feed, seed, or \n     fertilizer to and on farms; (3) to spread feed, seed, or \n     fertilizer on farms; (4) to load or unload feed, seed, or \n     fertilizer on farms; or (5) for any combination of the \n     foregoing.\n       The IRS has issued various rulings in this area. In Revenue \n     Ruling 69-579, the IRS found that a truck body used primarily \n     for hauling animal and poultry feed to and unloading it on \n     farms qualified for exemption because the built-in equipment \n     was elaborate and expensive. Thus, the IRS concluded that the \n     nature of the unloading systems made it impractical to \n     purchase the bodies for use other than in hauling feed, seed, \n     or fertilizer to and unloading it on farms.\n       In 1975, the IRS ruled as not exempt a dump truck designed \n     for and used primarily in hauling grain and sugar beets from \n     the field to points on or off the farm but which may also be \n     used to haul feed or fertilizer from a distribution point \n     over the highway to the farm. The ruling concluded that \n     bodies that are used for the general hauling of feed, seed, \n     or fertilizer over the highway are subject to the tax unless \n     they have specific features that indicate they are primarily \n     designed to haul feed, seed, or fertilizer to and on farms. \n     In this case, although feed and fertilizer were among the \n     commodities that the dump truck could be used for, it did not \n     have specific features to indicate that it was primarily \n     designed to haul feed, seed, or fertilizer to and on farms.\n       In 1990, the IRS issued a technical advice memorandum \n     (``the 1990 TAM'') that concluded that a type of truck bought \n     by farmers to haul seed potatoes, sugar beets, grain, and \n     other farm products qualified for exemption. Each model had a \n     full-length, powered conveyor belt that was designed to \n     support and unload the cargo; a powered rear discharge door \n     to control the discharge rate of the cargo; and a standard \n     universal motor mount to which an electric drive could be \n     mounted. In that ruling, the IRS noted the special unloading \n     equipment was elaborate and expensive, added substantially to \n     the cost and weight of each body, and limited its load-\n     carrying capabilities.\n       In 1999, the IRS revoked the 1990 TAM prospectively, noting \n     that the exemption was not intended to cover truck bodies \n     designed for general use, even if capable of hauling feed, \n     seed, or fertilizer to and on farms. The IRS noted that the \n     sales literature indicated that the body was designed to be \n     versatile for hauling potatoes, beets, and small grains. The \n     IRS also observed that unlike the bodies described in Rev. \n     Rul. 69-579, which would not be purchased for use other than \n     in hauling feed, seed, or fertilizer, the bodies at issue are \n     designed for general hauling of farm cargo. Further, the IRS \n     found that the presence of a conveyor belt was equally useful \n     for unloading a crop at market as it is for unloading feed, \n     etc. on a farm. Thus, the IRS concluded that the truck body \n     was not primarily designed for an exempt purpose.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment exempts bulk beds used for \n     transporting farm crops to and on farms from the excise tax \n     on the retail sale of heavy trucks and trailers if sold to a \n     person who certifies to the seller that such person is \n     actively engaged in the trade or business of farming and the \n     primary use of the bulk bed is to haul to and on farms farm \n     crops grown in connection with such trade or business. The \n     Senate amendment provides for the recapture of the tax from \n     the purchaser upon resale of within two years of the first \n     retail sale, or if such purchaser makes substantial nonexempt \n     use of the article.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for sales after \n     September 30, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     11.

Revenue Raising Provisions\n\n     1. Treatment of kerosene for use in aviation (sec. 1561 of \n         the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       In general, aviation-grade kerosene is taxed at a rate of \n     21.8 cents per gallon upon removal of such fuel from a \n     refinery or terminal (or entry into the United States) and on \n     the sale of such fuel to any unregistered person unless there \n     was a prior taxable removal or entry of such fuel. Aviation-\n     grade kerosene may be removed at a reduced rate, either 4.3 \n     or zero cents per gallon, if the aviation fuel is removed \n     directly into the fuel tank of an aircraft for use in \n     commercial aviation or for a use that is exempt from the tax \n     imposed by section 4041(c) (other than by reason of a prior \n     imposition of tax), or is removed or entered as part of an \n     exempt bulk transfer. These taxes are credited to the Airport \n     and Airway Trust Fund. If taxed aviation-grade kerosene is \n     used for a nontaxable use, a claim for credit or refund may \n     be made. Such claims are paid from the Airport and Airway \n     Trust Fund to the general fund of the Treasury. All other \n     removals and entries of kerosene used for surface \n     transportation are taxed at the diesel tax rate of 24.3 cents \n     per gallon, and these taxes are credited to the Highway Trust \n     Fund. If aviation-grade kerosene is taxed upon removal or \n     entry but fraudulently diverted for surface transportation, \n     the taxes remain in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, and \n     the Highway Trust Fund is not credited for the taxes on such \n     fuel.\n       A special rule of present law addresses whether a removal \n     from a refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon may be treated \n     as a removal from a terminal for purposes of determining \n     whether aviation-grade kerosene is removed directly into the \n     wing of an aircraft for use in commercial aviation, and so \n     eligible for the 4.3 cents per gallon rate. For the special \n     rule to apply, a qualifying truck, tanker, or tank wagon must \n     be loaded with aviation-grade kerosene from a terminal: (1) \n     that is located within a secured area of an airport, and (2) \n     from which no vehicle licensed for highway use is loaded with \n     aviation fuel, except in exigent circumstances identified by \n     the Secretary in regulations. In order to qualify for the \n     special rule, a refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon must: \n     (1) be loaded with fuel for delivery only into aircraft at \n     the airport where the terminal is located; (2) have storage \n     tanks, hose, and coupling equipment designed and used for the \n     purposes of fueling aircraft; (3) not be registered for \n     highway use; and (4) be operated by the terminal operator \n     (who operates the terminal rack from which the fuel is \n     unloaded) or by a person that makes a daily accounting to \n     such terminal operator of each delivery of fuel from such \n     truck, tanker, or tank wagon.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment imposes the kerosene tax rate of 24.3 \n     cents per gallon upon the entry or removal of aviation-grade \n     kerosene and on the sale of such fuel to any unregistered \n     person unless there was a prior taxable removal or entry of \n     the fuel. In general, the present law reduced rates for \n     removals of aviation-grade kerosene directly into the fuel \n     tank of an aircraft apply. In addition, under the provision, \n     the rate of tax is 21.8 cents per gallon if kerosene is \n     removed (1) directly into the fuel tank of an aircraft for \n     use in aviation other than commercial aviation and (2) from \n     refueler trucks, tankers, and tank wagons that are loaded \n     with fuel from a terminal that is located in an airport, \n     without regard to whether the terminal is located in a \n     secured area of the airport, as long as all the other \n     requirements of the present law special rule related to such \n     trucks, tankers, and wagons are met. The provision clarifies \n     that the rate of tax upon removal of kerosene is zero if the \n     removal is from a refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon that \n     meets all of the requirements of present law, including the \n     security requirement, the kerosene is delivered directly into \n     the fuel tank of an aircraft, and the kerosene is exempt from \n     the tax imposed by section 4041(c) (other than by prior \n     imposition of tax).\n\n[[Page S9143]]\n\n       The Senate amendment provides that amounts may be claimed \n     as credits or refunds for kerosene that is taxed at the 24.3 \n     cents per gallon rate and used for aviation purposes. If \n     kerosene is used for noncommercial aviation, the amount is \n     2.5 cents; if kerosene is used for commercial aviation, the \n     amount is 20 cents; if kerosene is used for a use that is \n     exempt from tax (as determined under present law), the amount \n     is 24.3 cents. Present law rules with respect to claims \n     apply, except for claims with respect to kerosene used in \n     noncommercial aviation, which are payable to the ultimate \n     vendor only. To be eligible to receive a payment, a vendor \n     must be registered and must show either that the price of the \n     fuel did not include the tax and the tax was not collected \n     from the purchaser, the amount of tax was repaid to the \n     ultimate purchaser, or the written consent of the purchaser \n     to the making of the claim was filed with the Secretary.\n       Under the Senate amendment, all taxes collected at the 24.3 \n     cents per gallon rate (under section 4081) initially are \n     credited to the Highway Trust Fund. The provision requires \n     the Secretary to transfer at least monthly from the Highway \n     Trust Fund into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund amounts \n     equivalent to 21.8 cents per gallon for claims made with \n     respect to kerosene used for noncommercial aviation purposes \n     and 4.3 cents per gallon for claims made with respect to \n     kerosene used for commercial aviation purposes. The provision \n     requires that transfers be made on the basis of estimates by \n     the Secretary, with proper adjustments to be made \n     subsequently to the extent prior estimates were in excess of \n     or less than the amounts required to be transferred. \n     Transfers are required to be made with respect to taxes \n     received on or after October 1, 2005, and before October 1, \n     2011. The provision provides that the Airport and Airway \n     Trust Fund does not make payments with respect to kerosene \n     that is taxed at the 24.3 cents per gallon rate and used for \n     aviation purposes.\n       Effective date.--The Senate amendment is effective for \n     fuels or liquids removed, entered, or sold after September \n     30, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     2. Repeal of ultimate vendor refund claims with respect to \n         farming (sec. 1562 of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general--ultimate purchaser refunds for nontaxable uses\n       In general, the Code provides that if diesel fuel or \n     kerosene on which tax has been imposed is used by any person \n     in a nontaxable use, the Secretary is to refund (without \n     interest) to the ultimate purchaser the amount of tax \n     imposed. The refund is made to the ultimate purchaser of the \n     taxed fuel by either income tax credit or refund payment. Not \n     more than one claim may be filed by any person with respect \n     to fuel used during its taxable year. However, there are \n     exceptions to this rule.\n       An ultimate purchaser may make a claim for a refund payment \n     for any quarter of a taxable year for which the purchaser can \n     claim at least $750. If the purchaser cannot claim at least \n     $750 at the end of quarter, the amount can be carried over to \n     the next quarter to determine if the purchaser can claim at \n     least $750. If the purchaser cannot claim at least $750 at \n     the end of the taxable year, the purchaser must claim a \n     credit on the person's income tax return.\n       As discussed below, these ultimate purchaser refund rules \n     do not apply to diesel fuel or kerosene used on a farm. The \n     Code precludes the ultimate purchaser from claiming a refund \n     for such use. Instead, the refund claims are made by \n     registered vendors as described below.\n     Special vendor rule for use on a farm for farming purposes\n       In the case of diesel fuel or kerosene used on a farm for \n     farming purposes, refund payments are paid to the ultimate, \n     registered vendors (``registered ultimate vendor'') of such \n     fuels. Thus a registered ultimate vendor that sells undyed \n     diesel fuel or undyed kerosene to any of the following may \n     make a claim for refund: (1) the owner, tenant, operator of a \n     farm for use by that person on a farm for farming purposes; \n     and (2) a person other than the owner, tenant, or operator of \n     a farm for use by that person on a farm in connection with \n     cultivating, raising or harvesting. The registered ultimate \n     vendor is the only person who may make the claim with respect \n     to diesel fuel or kerosene used on a farm for farming \n     purposes. The purchaser of the fuel cannot make the claim for \n     refund.\n       Registered ultimate vendors may make weekly claims if the \n     claim is at least $200 ($100 or more in the case of \n     kerosene). If not paid within 45 days (20 days for an \n     electronic claim), the Secretary is to pay interest on the \n     claim.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment repeals ultimate vendor refund claims \n     in the case of diesel fuel or kerosene used on a farm for \n     farming purposes. Thus, refunds for taxed diesel fuel or \n     kerosene used on a farm for farming purposes would be paid to \n     the ultimate purchaser under the rules applicable to \n     nontaxable uses of diesel fuel or kerosene.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for sales after \n     September 30, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     3. Refunds of excise taxes on exempt sales of taxable fuel by \n         credit card (sec. 1563 of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under the rules in effect prior to 2005, in the case of \n     gasoline on which tax had been paid and sold to a State or \n     local government, to a nonprofit educational organization, \n     for supplies for vessels or aircraft, for export, or for the \n     production of special fuels, the wholesale distributor that \n     sold such gasoline was treated as the only person who paid \n     the tax and thereby was the proper claimant for a credit or \n     refund of the tax paid. A ``wholesale distributor'' included \n     any person, other than an importer or producer, who sold \n     gasoline to producers, retailers, or to users who purchased \n     in bulk quantities and accepted delivery into bulk storage \n     tanks. A wholesale distributor also included any person who \n     made retail sales of gasoline at 10 or more retail motor fuel \n     outlets.\n       Under a special administrative exception to these rules, a \n     sale of gasoline charged on an oil company credit card issued \n     to an exempt person described above is not considered a \n     direct sale by the person actually selling the gasoline to \n     the ultimate purchaser if the seller receives a reimbursement \n     of the tax from the oil company (or indirectly through an \n     intermediate vendor). Thus, the person that actually paid the \n     tax, in most cases the oil company, is treated as the only \n     person eligible to make the refund claim.\n       The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (``AJCA'') modified \n     the pre-existing statutory rules with respect to certain \n     sales. Under AJCA, if a registered ultimate vendor purchases \n     any gasoline on which tax has been paid and sells such \n     gasoline to a State or local government or to a nonprofit \n     educational organization, for its exclusive use, such \n     ultimate vendor is treated as the only person who paid the \n     tax and thereby is the proper claimant for a credit or refund \n     of the tax paid. However, AJCA did not change the special \n     administrative oil company credit card rule described above.\n       In addition, under AJCA, refund claims made by such an \n     ultimate vendor may be filed for any period of at least one \n     week for which $200 or more is payable. Any such claim must \n     be filed on or before the last day of the first quarter \n     following the earliest quarter included in the claim. The \n     Secretary must pay interest on refunds unpaid after 45 days. \n     If the refund claim was filed by electronic means, and the \n     ultimate vendor has certified to the Secretary for the most \n     recent quarter of the taxable year that all ultimate \n     purchasers of the vendor are certified for highway exempt use \n     as a State or local government or a nonprofit educational \n     organization, refunds unpaid after 20 days must be paid with \n     interest.\n       In the case of diesel fuel or kerosene used in a nontaxable \n     use, the ultimate purchaser is generally the only person \n     entitled to claim a refund of excise tax. However, in the \n     case of diesel fuel or kerosene used on a farm for farming \n     purposes or by a State or local government, aviation-grade \n     kerosene, and certain nonaviation-grade kerosene, an ultimate \n     vendor may claim the refund if the ultimate vendor is \n     registered and bears the tax (or receives the written consent \n     of the ultimate purchaser to claim the refund).\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment replaces the oil company credit card \n     rule with a new set of rules applicable to certain credit \n     card sales. The new rules apply to all taxable fuels. Under \n     the Senate amendment, if a purchase of taxable fuel is made \n     by means of a credit card issued to an ultimate purchaser \n     that is either a State or local government or, in the case of \n     gasoline, a nonprofit educational organization, for its \n     exclusive use, a credit card issuer who is registered and who \n     extends such credit to the ultimate purchaser with respect to \n     such purchase shall be the only person entitled to apply for \n     a credit or refund if the following two conditions are met: \n     (1) such registered person has not collected the amount of \n     the tax from the purchaser, or has obtained the written \n     consent of the ultimate purchaser to the allowance of the \n     credit or refund; and (2) such registered person has either \n     repaid or agreed to repay the amount of the tax to the \n     ultimate vendor, has obtained the written consent of the \n     ultimate vendor to the allowance of the credit or refund, or \n     has otherwise made arrangements that directly or indirectly \n     provide the ultimate vendor with reimbursement of such tax. \n     It is anticipated that such indirect arrangements may consist \n     of the contractual undertaking of the relevant oil company to \n     the credit card issuer that it will pay the amount of the tax \n     to the ultimate vendor, and the corresponding contractual \n     undertaking of the oil company to the ultimate vendor.\n       If a credit card issuer is not registered, or if either \n     condition (1) or (2) described above is not met (or if the \n     ultimate purchaser is not exempt), then the credit card \n     issuer is required to collect an amount equal to the tax from \n     the ultimate purchaser and only an (exempt) ultimate \n     purchaser may claim a credit or payment from the IRS. Thus, \n     tax-paid fuel shall not be sold tax free to an exempt entity \n     by means of a credit card unless the credit card issuer is \n     registered. An unregistered credit card issuer that does not\n\n[[Page S9144]]\n\n     collect an amount equal to the tax from the exempt entity is \n     liable for present-law penalties for failure to register.\n       A credit card issuer entitled to claim a refund under the \n     provision is responsible for collecting and supplying all the \n     appropriate documentation currently required from ultimate \n     vendors. The present-law refund amount and timing rules \n     applicable to ultimate vendors, including the special rules \n     for electronic claims, apply to refunds to credit card \n     issuers under the provision.\n       The Senate amendment also conforms present-law penalty \n     provisions to the new rules.\n       The Senate amendment does not change the present-law rules \n     applicable to non-credit card purchases.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for sales after \n     December 31, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     4. Recertification of exempt status (sec. 1564 of the Senate \n         amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       If gasoline is sold to any person for an exempt use, an \n     ultimate purchaser that has borne the tax is entitled to \n     claim a refund. However, a registered ultimate vendor is the \n     appropriate person to claim a refund of Federal excise taxes \n     on gasoline sold to a State or local government or to a \n     nonprofit educational organization.\n       In general, in order to claim a refund of Federal excise \n     taxes on gasoline (and on other articles subject to \n     manufacturers excise taxes under Chapter 32 of the Code) sold \n     to a State or local government or to a nonprofit educational \n     organization, for its exclusive use, a claimant must submit a \n     statement indicating that it possesses evidence of the exempt \n     use giving rise to the overpayment of tax. Such evidence \n     consists of a certificate executed and signed by the ultimate \n     purchaser, and must identify the article, show the name and \n     address of the ultimate purchaser, and state the exempt use \n     made or to be made of the article. In the case where the \n     certificate sets forth the use to be made of the article, \n     rather than its actual use, it must show that the ultimate \n     purchaser has agreed to notify the claimant if the article is \n     not in fact used as specified in the certificate.\n       However, if the article to which the claim relates has \n     passed through a chain of sales from the claimant to the \n     ultimate purchaser, a certificate executed and signed by the \n     ultimate vendor is sufficient to document the exempt use. The \n     ultimate vendor certificate must contain the exempt sales \n     information, and a statement that it possesses the ultimate \n     purchaser certificates and will forward them to the claimant \n     within three years from the date of the statement. An \n     ultimate vendor statement may be made covering no more than \n     12 consecutive calendar quarters.\n       In general, an ultimate purchaser is the proper party to \n     claim a refund of Federal excise tax on diesel fuel or \n     kerosene used by any person in a nontaxable use. However, in \n     the case of diesel or kerosene used by a State or local \n     government, the ultimate vendor is the proper person if such \n     vendor is registered and has borne the tax (or receives the \n     written consent of the ultimate purchaser to claim the \n     refund). A registered ultimate vendor claiming a refund under \n     this provision must provide a statement that it has in its \n     possession an unexpired exemption certificate of the \n     purchaser and that the claimant has no reason to believe any \n     information in the certificate is false.\n       A State or local government includes any political \n     subdivision of a State, or the District of Columbia. A \n     nonprofit educational organization means an educational \n     organization which normally maintains a regular faculty and \n     curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of \n     pupils or students in attendance at the place where its \n     educational activities are regularly carried on, and which \n     either is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) or is a \n     school operated as an activity of an organization described \n     in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from income tax under \n     section 501(a).\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       Under the Senate amendment, additional documentation \n     requirements are imposed with respect to purchases of taxable \n     fuel and certain other articles on a nontaxable basis by \n     State or local governments and nonprofit educational \n     organizations and with respect to refunds or credits by any \n     person with respect to such purchases. The Senate amendment \n     covers Federal excise taxes on sales of liquids for use as a \n     fuel (including taxable fuels), compressed natural gas \n     (except if sold for use on school buses or intracity buses), \n     heavy trucks and trailers, recreational equipment (bows and \n     arrows, sport fishing equipment and firearms), and tires \n     (except for tires sold for use on qualified buses). The \n     Senate amendment does not cover Federal excise taxes on sales \n     of coal and vaccines.\n       In addition to present-law documentation requirements, in \n     order for a State or local governmental entity to claim \n     exemption from tax on sales of such covered articles, or for \n     any person to claim a credit or refund based upon the State \n     or local governmental status of the purchaser of such \n     articles, the State must certify that the article is sold to \n     a State or local government for the exclusive use of a State \n     or local government. In the case of articles sold to a \n     qualified volunteer fire department, as defined in section \n     150(e)(2), the State must so certify, and the article must be \n     sold for the exclusive use of the qualified volunteer fire \n     department.\n       In order for a nonprofit educational organization to claim \n     exemption from tax on such articles, or for any person to \n     claim a credit or refund of tax on such articles based upon \n     the nonprofit educational status of an organization, the \n     State in which such organization is providing educational \n     services must certify that such organization is in good \n     standing.\n       For purposes of this provision, an Indian tribal government \n     is treated as a State. Consequently, it is intended that the \n     applicable Indian tribal government will provide the \n     certifications under this provision.\n       It is intended that the certifications required under this \n     provision will be provided by exempt purchasers to the refund \n     claimants (in addition to documentation required under \n     present law), and that the IRS may require that such \n     certifications be submitted as part of the claims. The \n     Secretary may prescribe forms for such certifications.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for all sales \n     after December 31, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     5. Reregistration in event of change in ownership (sec. 1565 \n         of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Blenders, enterers, pipeline operators, position holders, \n     refiners, terminal operators, and vessel operators are \n     required to register with the Secretary with respect to fuels \n     taxes imposed by sections 4041(a)(1) and 4081. An assessable \n     penalty for failure to register is $10,000 for each initial \n     failure, plus $1,000 per day that the failure continues. A \n     non-assessable penalty for failure to register is $10,000. A \n     criminal penalty of $10,000, or imprisonment of not more than \n     five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution \n     also applies to a failure to register and to certain false \n     statements made in connection with a registration \n     application. Treasury regulations require that a registrant \n     notify the Secretary of any change (such as a change in \n     ownership) in the information a registrant submitted in \n     connection with its application for registration within 10 \n     days of the change. The Secretary has the discretion to \n     revoke the registration of a noncompliant registrant.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment requires that upon a change in \n     ownership of a registrant, the registrant must reregister \n     with the Secretary, as provided by the Secretary. A change in \n     ownership means that after a transaction (or series of \n     related transactions), more than 50 percent of the ownership \n     interests in, or assets of, a registrant are held by persons \n     other than persons (or persons related thereto) who held more \n     than 50 percent of such interests or assets before the \n     transaction (or series of related transactions). The \n     provision does not apply to a company, the stock of which is \n     regularly traded on an established securities market. The \n     penalties for failure to reregister are the same as the \n     present law penalties for failure to register. The provision \n     applies to changes in ownership occurring prior to, on, or \n     after the date of enactment.\n       Effective date.--The Senate amendment is effective for \n     actions or failures to act after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     6. Registration of operators of deep-draft vessels (sec. 1566 \n         of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Blenders, enterers, pipeline operators, position holders, \n     refiners, terminal operators, and vessel operators are \n     required to register with the Secretary with respect to fuels \n     taxes imposed by sections 4041(a)(1) and 4081. Treasury \n     regulations define a vessel operator as any person that \n     operates a vessel within the bulk transfer/terminal system, \n     excluding deep-draft ocean-going vessels. Accordingly, \n     operators of deep-draft ocean-going vessels are not required \n     to register. A deep-draft ocean-going vessel is a vessel that \n     is designed primarily for use on the high seas that has a \n     draft of more than 12 feet.\n       An assessable penalty for failure to register is $10,000 \n     for each initial failure, plus $1,000 per day that the \n     failure continues. A non-assessable penalty for failure to \n     register is $10,000. A criminal penalty of $10,000, or \n     imprisonment of not more than five years, or both, together \n     with the costs of prosecution also applies to a failure to \n     register and to certain false statements made in connection \n     with a registration application.\n       In general, gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene (``taxable \n     fuel'') are taxed upon removal from a refinery or a terminal. \n     Tax also is imposed on the entry into the United States of \n     any taxable fuel for consumption, use, or warehousing. The \n     tax does not apply to any removal or entry of a taxable fuel \n     transferred in bulk (a ``bulk transfer'') by pipeline or \n     vessel to a terminal or refinery if the person removing or \n     entering the taxable fuel, the operator of such pipeline or \n     vessel, and the operator of such terminal or refinery\n\n[[Page S9145]]\n\n     are registered with the Secretary as required by section \n     4101. Transfer to an unregistered party subjects the transfer \n     to tax.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       Under the Senate amendment, an operator of deep-draft \n     ocean-going vessel is required to register with the Secretary \n     unless such operator uses such vessel exclusively for \n     purposes of the entry of taxable fuel. If a deep-draft ocean-\n     going vessel is used as part of a bulk transfer, the operator \n     of such vessel must be registered in order for the bulk \n     transfer exemption to apply, except with respect to the entry \n     of taxable fuel, in which case, registration is not required.\n       Effective date.--The Senate amendment is effective on the \n     date of enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     7. Reconciliation of on-loaded cargo to entered cargo (sec. \n         1567 of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Trade Act of 2002 directed the Secretary to promulgate \n     regulations pertaining to the electronic transmission to the \n     Bureau of Customs and Border Patrol (``Customs'') of \n     information pertaining to cargo destined for importation into \n     the United States or exportation from the United States, \n     prior to such importation or exportation. The Department of \n     the Treasury issued final regulations on October 31, 2002. \n     The regulations require the advance and accurate presentation \n     of certain manifest information prior to lading at the \n     foreign port and encourage the presentation of this \n     information electronically. Customs must receive from the \n     carrier the vessel's Cargo Declaration (Customs Form 1302) or \n     the electronic equivalent within 24 hours before such cargo \n     is laden aboard the vessel at the foreign port.\n       Certain carriers of bulk cargo, however, are exempt from \n     these filing requirements. Such bulk cargo includes that \n     composed of free flowing articles such as oil, grain, coal, \n     ore and the like, which can be pumped or run through a chute \n     or handled by dumping. Thus, taxable fuels are not required \n     to file the Cargo Declaration within 24 hours before such \n     cargo is laden aboard the vessel at the foreign port. Instead \n     the Cargo Declaration must be filed within 24 hours prior \n     arrival in the United States.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment provides that not later than one year \n     after the date of enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security, together with the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, is to establish an electronic data interchange \n     system through which Customs shall transmit to the Internal \n     Revenue Service information pertaining to cargoes of taxable \n     fuels (as defined in section 4083) that Customs has obtained \n     electronically under its regulations adopted to carry out the \n     Trade Act of 2002 requirement. For this purpose, not later \n     than one year after the date of enactment, all filers of \n     required cargo information for such taxable fuels, as \n     defined, must provide such information to Customs through its \n     approved electronic data interchange system.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective upon date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     8. Gasoline blend stocks and kerosene (sec. 1568 of the \n         Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       A ``taxable fuel'' is gasoline, diesel fuel (including any \n     liquid, other than gasoline, which is suitable for use as a \n     fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle or train), and \n     kerosene. An excise tax is imposed upon (1) the removal of \n     any taxable fuel from a refinery or terminal, (2) the entry \n     of any taxable fuel into the United States, or (3) the sale \n     of any taxable fuel to any person who is not registered with \n     the IRS to receive untaxed fuel, unless there was a prior \n     taxable removal or entry. The tax does not apply to any \n     removal or entry of taxable fuel transferred in bulk to a \n     terminal or refinery if the person removing or entering the \n     taxable fuel, the operator of such pipeline or vessel, and \n     the operator of such terminal or refinery are registered with \n     the Secretary.\n     Gasoline blend stocks\n       Definition\n       Under the regulations, ``gasoline'' includes all products \n     commonly or commercially known or sold as gasoline and are \n     suitable for use as a motor fuel, and that have an octane \n     rating of 75 or more. Gasoline also includes, to the extent \n     provided in regulations, gasoline blend stocks and products \n     commonly used as additives in gasoline. By regulation, the \n     Treasury has identified certain products as gasoline blend \n     stocks, however, the term ``gasoline blend stocks'' does not \n     include any product that cannot be blended into gasoline \n     without further processing or fractionation (``off-spec \n     gasoline'').\n       Gasoline blend stock exemptions\n       If certain conditions are met, the removal, entry, or sale \n     of gasoline blend stocks is not taxable. Generally, the \n     exemption from tax applies if a gasoline blend stock (1) is \n     not used to produce finished gasoline (2) is received at an \n     approved terminal or refinery, or (3) in bulk transfer to an \n     industrial user.\n       Gasoline blend stocks not used to produce finished \n     gasoline.--Pursuant to Treasury regulation, no tax is imposed \n     on nonbulk removals from a terminal or refinery, or nonbulk \n     entries into the United States of any gasoline blend stocks \n     if (1) the person liable for the tax is a taxable fuel \n     registrant, and (2) such person does not use the gasoline \n     blend stocks to produce finished gasoline. In connection with \n     a sale, no tax is imposed on the nonbulk removal or entry if \n     (1) the person liable for the tax is a gasoline registrant \n     and (2) at the time of sale such party has an unexpired \n     certificate from the buyer, and has no reason to believe any \n     information in the certificate is false.\n       Any sale (or resale) of a gasoline blend stock that was not \n     subject to tax on nonbulk removal or entry is taxable unless \n     the seller has an unexpired certificate from the buyer and \n     has no reason to believe that any information in the \n     certificate is false.\n       The certificate to be provided by a buyer of gasoline blend \n     stocks contains a statement that the gasoline blend stocks \n     covered by the certificate will not be used to produce \n     finished gasoline, identifies the type (or types of blend \n     stocks) covered by the certificate and provides that the \n     buyer will not claim a credit or refund for any gasoline \n     covered by the certificate. The certificate is signed under \n     penalties of perjury by a person with authority to bind the \n     buyer. The certificate expires on the earliest of one year \n     from the effective date of the certificate, the date a new \n     certificate is provided to the seller or the date the seller \n     is notified by the IRS or the buyer that the buyer's right to \n     provide a certificate has been withdrawn.\n       Gasoline blend stocks received at an approved terminal or \n     refinery.--Treasury regulations provide that tax is not \n     imposed on the removal or entry of gasoline blend stocks that \n     are received at a terminal or refinery if the person liable \n     for tax is a taxable fuel registrant, has an unexpired \n     notification certificate from the operator of the terminal or \n     refinery where the gasoline blend stocks are received; and \n     has no reason to believe that any information in the \n     certificate is false. A notification certificate is used to \n     notify another person of the taxable fuel registrant's \n     registration status.\n       Bulk transfer to an industrial user.--Tax is not imposed if \n     upon removal of the gasoline blend stocks from a pipeline or \n     vessel, the gasoline blend stocks are received by a taxable \n     fuel registrant that is an industrial user. An industrial \n     user means any person that receives gasoline blend stocks by \n     bulk transfer for its own use in the manufacture of any \n     product other than finished gasoline.\n       Refunds or credits for tax imposed on gasoline blend stocks \n           not used for producing gasoline\n       If any gasoline blend stock or additive is not used by a \n     person to produce gasoline and that person establishes that \n     the ultimate use of the gasoline blend stock or additive is \n     not used to produce gasoline, then the Secretary is to pay \n     (without interest) to such person, an amount equal to the \n     aggregate amount of tax imposed on such person with respect \n     to such gasoline or blend stock.\n       If gasoline is used in an off-highway business use, the \n     ultimate purchaser of the gasoline is entitled to a credit or \n     refund for the excise taxes imposed on the fuel. ``Off-\n     highway business use'' means any use by a person in a trade \n     or business of such person otherwise than as a fuel in a \n     highway vehicle that meets certain requirements. Gasoline for \n     this purpose includes gasoline blend stocks.\n       The Code also provides for a refund of tax for tax-paid \n     fuel sold to a subsequent manufacturer or producer if the \n     subsequent manufacturer or producer uses the fuel, for \n     nonfuel purposes, as a material in the manufacture or \n     production of any other article manufactured or produced by \n     him.\n     Kerosene\n       Definition of kerosene\n       By regulation, kerosene is defined as the kerosene \n     described in ASTM Specification D 3699 (No. 1-K and No. 2-K), \n     ASTM Specification D 1655 (kerosene-type jet fuel), and \n     military specifications MIL-DTL-5624T (Grade JP-5) and MIL-\n     DTL-83133E (Grade JP-8). Kerosene does not include any liquid \n     that is an excluded liquid.\n       An ``excluded liquid'' is (1) any liquid that contains less \n     than four percent normal paraffins, or (2) any liquid that \n     has a distillation range of 125 degrees Fahrenheit or less, \n     sulfur content of 10 ppm or less, and minimum color of +27 \n     Saybolt. These liquids are commonly known as ``mineral \n     spirits'' and are obtained by distillation of crude oil. \n     Mineral spirits are used for a wide variety of purposes, such \n     as in dry-cleaning fluids, paint thinners, varnishes, \n     photocopy toners, inks, adhesives, and as general purpose \n     cleaners and degreasers.\n       Exemptions\n       Diesel fuel and kerosene that is to be used for a \n     nontaxable purpose will not be taxed upon removal from the \n     terminal if it is dyed to indicate its nontaxable purpose. \n     Kerosene received by pipeline or vessel to satisfy a \n     feedstock purpose is exempt from the dyeing requirement. \n     Pursuant to Treasury regulations, nonbulk removals of \n     kerosene for a feedstock purpose by a registered feedstock \n     user also are exempt. The person receiving the kerosene must \n     be registered with the IRS and provide a certificate noting \n     that the kerosene will be used for a feedstock purpose\n\n[[Page S9146]]\n\n     in order for the exemption to apply. Pursuant to the \n     Treasury regulations, tax also does not apply upon the \n     removal or entry of kerosene if the person otherwise \n     liable for tax is a taxable fuel registrant and such \n     person uses the kerosene for a feedstock purpose.\n       ``Feedstock purpose'' means the use of kerosene for nonfuel \n     purposes in the manufacture or production of any substance \n     (other than gasoline, diesel fuel or special fuels subject to \n     tax). Thus, for example, kerosene is used for a feedstock \n     purpose when it is used as an ingredient in the production of \n     paint and is not used for a feedstock purpose when it is used \n     to power machinery at a factory where paint is produced.\n       Refunds and payments for nontaxable uses of kerosene\n       If tax-paid kerosene is used by any person in a nontaxable \n     use, the Secretary is required to pay (without interest) to \n     the ultimate purchaser of such fuel an amount equal to the \n     aggregate amount of tax imposed on such fuel. For this \n     purpose, a nontaxable use is any use which is exempt from the \n     tax imposed by section 4041(a)(1) other than by reason of \n     prior imposition of tax. Claims relating to kerosene used on \n     a farm for farming purposes and by a State are made by \n     registered ultimate vendors. Claims relating to undyed \n     kerosene sold from a blocked pump or sold for blending with \n     heating oil to be used during periods of extreme or \n     unseasonable cold are also made by registered ultimate \n     vendors. Special rules apply with respect to aviation-grade \n     kerosene.\n       The Code also provides for a refund of tax for tax-paid \n     fuel sold to a subsequent manufacturer or producer if the \n     subsequent manufacturer or producer uses the fuel, for \n     nonfuel purposes, as a material in the manufacture or \n     production of any other article manufactured or produced by \n     him.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n     Gasoline blend stocks\n       The Senate amendment partially repeals exemptions provided \n     in Treas. Reg. sec. 48.4081-4, which, under certain \n     conditions, exempts from tax gasoline blend stocks that are \n     not used to produce finished gasoline or that are received at \n     an approved terminal or refinery. Under the Senate amendment, \n     tax is imposed on all nonbulk entries and removals of \n     gasoline blend stocks, regardless of whether they will be \n     used to produce finished gasoline or received at an approved \n     terminal or refinery. The Senate amendment does not change \n     the exemption for bulk transfers to registered industrial \n     users.\n     Kerosene and mineral spirits\n       The Senate amendment requires that with respect to fuel \n     entered or removed after September 30, 2005, the Secretary \n     shall not exclude mineral spirits from the definition of \n     kerosene. Thus, for entries and removals after September 30, \n     2005, mineral spirits are taxed and exempt from tax in the \n     same manner as kerosene.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for fuel \n     removed or entered after September 30, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     9. Nonapplication of export exemption to delivery of fuel to \n         motor vehicles removed from United States (sec. 1569 of \n         the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A ``taxable fuel'' is gasoline, diesel fuel (including any \n     liquid, other than gasoline, which is suitable for use as a \n     fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle or train), and \n     kerosene. An excise tax is imposed upon (1) the removal of \n     any taxable fuel from a refinery or terminal, (2) the entry \n     of any taxable fuel into the United States, or (3) the sale \n     of any taxable fuel to any person who is not registered with \n     the IRS to receive untaxed fuel, unless there was a prior \n     taxable removal or entry. The tax does not apply to any \n     removal or entry of taxable fuel transferred in bulk to a \n     terminal or refinery if the person removing or entering the \n     taxable fuel, the operator of such pipeline or vessel, and \n     the operator of such terminal or refinery are registered with \n     the Secretary.\n       Special provisions under the Code provide for a refund of \n     tax to any person who sells gasoline to another for \n     exportation. Section 6421(c) provides ``If gasoline is sold \n     to any person for any purpose described in paragraph (2), \n     (3), (4), or (5) of section 4221(a), the Secretary shall pay \n     (without interest) to such person an amount equal to the \n     product of the number of gallons so sold multiplied by the \n     rate at which tax was imposed on such gasoline by section \n     4081.'' Section 4221 provides, in pertinent part, ``Under \n     regulations prescribed by the Secretary, no tax shall be \n     imposed under this chapter . . . on the sale by the \n     manufacturer. . . of an article . . . for export, or for \n     resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export. . . \n     but only if such exportation or use is to occur before any \n     other use . . .''\n       It is the IRS administrative position that the exemption \n     from manufacturers excise tax by reason of exportation does \n     not apply to the sale of motor fuel pumped into a fuel tank \n     of a vehicle that is to be driven, or shipped, directly out \n     of the United States.\n       A duty-free sales facility that meets certain conditions \n     may sell and deliver for export from the customs territory of \n     the United States duty-free merchandise. Duty-free \n     merchandise is merchandise sold by a duty-free sales facility \n     on which neither Federal duty nor Federal tax has been \n     assessed pending exportation from the customs territory of \n     the United States. The statutes covering duty-free facilities \n     do not contain any limitation on what goods may qualify for \n     duty-free treatment.\n       The issue of whether fuel sold from a duty-free facility \n     and placed into the tank of an automobile that is then driven \n     out of the country is exported fuel has been litigated in \n     the courts. The cases involved the same operator of a \n     duty-free facility seeking a refund of excise tax. The \n     facility is near the Canadian border and is configured in \n     such a way that anyone leaving the facility must depart \n     the United States and enter into Canada. Both the Federal \n     Circuit and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals are in \n     accord with the IRS position and ruled that the operator \n     of the duty-free facility did not have standing to pursue \n     a claim for refund.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment reaffirms the long-standing IRS \n     position taken in Rev. Rul. 69-150 and restates present law \n     by amending the Code definition of export to exclude the \n     delivery of a taxable fuel into a fuel tank of a motor \n     vehicle that is shipped or driven out of the United States. \n     It also imposes a tax on the sale of taxable fuel at a duty-\n     free sales enterprise unless there was a prior taxable \n     removal, or entry of such fuel.\n       Effective date.--The provision applies to sales or \n     deliveries made after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     10. Impose assessable penalty on dealers of adulterated fuel \n         (sec. 1570 of the Senate amendment)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene are taxable fuels. \n     Diesel fuel is defined as (1) any liquid (other than \n     gasoline) which is suitable for use as a fuel in a diesel-\n     powered highway vehicle or a diesel powered train, (2) \n     transmix, and (3) diesel fuel blend stocks identified by the \n     Secretary. As a defense to Federal and State excise tax \n     liability, some taxpayers have contended that certain diesel \n     fuel mixtures or additives do not meet the requirements of \n     (1) above because they are not approved as additives or \n     mixtures by the EPA. In addition, under present law, untaxed \n     fuel additives, including certain contaminants, may displace \n     taxed diesel fuel in a mixture.\n       The Code provides that any person who, in connection with a \n     sale or lease (or offer for sale or lease) of an article, \n     knowingly makes any false statement ascribing a particular \n     part of the price of the article to a tax imposed by the \n     United States, or intended to lead any person to believe that \n     any part of the price consists of such a tax, is guilty of a \n     misdemeanor. Another Code provision provides that any person \n     who has in his custody or possession any article on which \n     taxes are imposed by law, for the purpose of selling the \n     article in fraud of the internal revenue laws or with design \n     to avoid payment of the taxes thereon, is liable for ``a \n     penalty of $500 or not less than double the amount of taxes \n     fraudulently attempted to be evaded.''\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment adds a new assessable penalty. Any \n     person other than a retailer who knowingly transfers for \n     resale, sells for resale, or holds out for resale for use in \n     a diesel-powered highway vehicle (or train) any liquid that \n     does not meet applicable EPA regulations (as defined in \n     section 45H(c)(3)) is subject to a penalty of $10,000 for \n     each such transfer, sale or holding out for resale, in \n     addition to the tax on such liquid, if any. Any retailer who \n     knowingly holds out for sale (other than for resale) any such \n     liquid, is subject to a $10,000 penalty for each such holding \n     out for sale, in addition to the tax on such liquid, if any.\n       The penalty is dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for any \n     transfer, sale, or holding out for sale or resale occurring \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement does not include the Senate \n     amendment provision.\n     11.

The tax was effective only if the \n     unobligated balance in the Fund was less than $1 billion. \n     Taxes received were credited to the Oil Spill Liability Trust \n     Fund. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is used for several \n     purposes, including the payment of costs for responding to \n     and removing oil spills.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n[[Page S9147]]\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment reinstates the Oil Spill Liability \n     Trust Fund tax.

The taxes are deposited in the Leaking \n     Underground Storage Tank (``LUST'') Trust Fund. The tax \n     expires on October 1, 2005.\n       Diesel fuel and kerosene that is to be used for a \n     nontaxable purpose will not be taxed upon removal from the \n     terminal if it is dyed to indicate its nontaxable purpose.\n       The Code requires the LUST Trust Fund to reimburse the \n     General Fund for certain refund and credit claims related to \n     the nontaxable use of fuel (only to the extent attributable \n     to the LUST Trust fund financing rate).\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       Under the Senate amendment, the LUST Trust Fund tax is \n     extended at the current rate through September 30, 2011. \n     Further, all fuel, including dyed fuel, is subject to the \n     LUST tax and no refund or claim for payment in the case of \n     otherwise nontaxable use (other than exports) is permitted \n     for such fuel. Under the provision, the LUST Trust Fund is no \n     longer required to reimburse the General Fund for claims and \n     credits related to the nontaxable use of fuel.\n       Effective date.--The provision is generally effective for \n     fuel entered, removed or sold after September 30, 2005.

Biasply tires and \n     super single tires are taxed at a rate of 4.725 cents for \n     each 10 pounds of rated load capacity exceeding 3,500 pounds. \n     A super single tire is a single tire greater than 13 inches \n     in cross section width designed to replace two tires in a \n     dual fitment.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment subjects super single tires to a tax \n     of 8 cents per 10 pounds of excess rated load capacity over \n     3,500 pounds. It redefines super single tire to be a single \n     tire greater than 17.5 inches in cross section width designed \n     to replace two tires in a dual fitment.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective for sales after \n     September 30, 2005.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The conference agreement clarifies that the definition of \n     super single tire does not include tires designed to serve as \n     steering tires. It is understood that steering axles are not \n     equipped with a dual fitment. Therefore, tires classified as \n     steering tires are not ``designed to replace two tires in a \n     dual fitment.'' To the extent there is any perceived \n     ambiguity in the present law definition, the conferees wish \n     to clarify that steering tires are not included within the \n     definition of super single tire eligible for the special rate \n     of tax. Under the conference agreement, a ``super single \n     tire'' is a single tire greater than 13 inches in cross \n     section width designed to replace two tires in a dual \n     fitment, but such term does not include any tire designed for \n     steering.\n       With respect to the one-year period beginning on January 1, \n     2006, the IRS is required to report to the Congress on the \n     amount of tax collected during such period for each class of \n     taxable tire (e.g. biasply, super single, or other) and the \n     number of tires in each such class on which tax is imposed \n     during such period. The report must be submitted no later \n     than July 1, 2007. The IRS is directed to revise the Form \n     720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, to collect the \n     information necessary to prepare the report. The report is \n     also to include total tire tax collections for an equivalent \n     one-year period preceding the date of enactment of the \n     American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.\n       Effective date.--The provision regarding the definition of \n     a super single tire is effective as if included in section \n     869 of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The study \n     requirement is effective on the date of enactment.\n     14. Modify recapture of section 197 amortization (sec. 1363 \n         of the conference agreement and sec. 1245 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Taxpayers are entitled to recover the cost of amortizable \n     section 197 intangibles using the straight-line method of \n     amortization over a uniform life of fifteen years. With \n     certain exceptions, amortizable section 197 intangibles \n     generally are purchased intangibles held by a taxpayer in the \n     conduct of a business.\n       Gain on the sale of depreciable property must be recaptured \n     as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation deductions \n     previously claimed, and the recapture amount is computed \n     separately for each item of property. Section 197 \n     intangibles, because they are treated as property of a \n     character subject to the allowance for depreciation, are \n     subject to these recapture rules.\n\n\n                               House Bill\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       No provision.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       Under the conference agreement, if multiple section 197 \n     intangibles are sold (or otherwise disposed of) in a single \n     transaction or series of transactions, the seller must \n     calculate recapture as if all of the section 197 intangibles \n     were a single asset. Thus, any gain on the sale (or other \n     disposition) of the intangibles is recaptured as ordinary \n     income to the extent of ordinary depreciation deductions \n     previously claimed on any of the section 197 intangibles.\n       The following example illustrates present law and the \n     conference agreement:\n       Example.--In year 1, a taxpayer acquires two section 197 \n     intangible assets for a total of $45. Asset A is assigned a \n     cost basis of $15 and asset B is assigned a cost basis of \n     $30. The allocation is irrelevant for amortization purposes, \n     as the taxpayer will be entitled to a total of $3 per year \n     ($45 divided by 15 years).\n       In year 6, the basis of A is $10 and the basis of B is $20. \n     Taxpayer sells the assets for an aggregate sale price of $45, \n     resulting in gain of $15. The character of this gain depends \n     on the recapture amount, which depends in turn on the \n     relative sales prices of the individual assets. Taxpayer has \n     claimed $5 of amortization, and therefore has $5 of recapture \n     potential, with respect to A. Taxpayer has claimed $10 of \n     amortization, and therefore has $10 of recapture potential, \n     with respect to B.\n       Under present law, if the sale proceeds are allocated $15 \n     to A and $30 to B, the gain on assets A and B will be $5 and \n     $10, respectively. These amounts match the recapture \n     potential for each asset, so the full amount of the gain will \n     be recaptured as ordinary income. However, if the sale \n     proceeds instead are allocated $25 to A and $20 to B, the \n     full $15 gain will be recognized with respect to A, and only \n     $5 (full recapture potential with respect to A) will be \n     recaptured as ordinary income. The remaining $10 of gain \n     attributable to A will be treated as capital gain. No gain \n     (and thus no recapture) will be recognized with respect to \n     Asset B, and only $5 of the $15 recapture potential is \n     recognized.\n       Under the conference agreement, the taxpayer calculates \n     recapture as if assets A and B were a single asset. For \n     purposes of the calculation, the proceeds are $45 and the \n     gain is $15. Because a total of $15 of amortization has been \n     claimed with respect to assets A and B, the full $15 gain is \n     recaptured as ordinary income.\n       Effective date.--The conference agreement is effective for \n     dispositions of property after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                       F. Tax Complexity Analysis\n\n       Section 4022(b) of the Internal Revenue Service Reform and \n     Restructuring Act of 1998 (the ``IRS Reform Act'') requires \n     the Joint Committee on Taxation (in consultation with the \n     Internal Revenue Service and the Department of the Treasury) \n     to provide a tax complexity analysis. The complexity analysis \n     is required for all legislation reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Finance, the House Committee on Ways and Means, \n     or any committee of conference if the legislation includes a \n     provision that directly or indirectly amends the Internal \n     Revenue Code (the ``Code'') and has widespread applicability \n     to individuals or small businesses.\n       The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has determined \n     that a complexity analysis is not required under section \n     4022(b) of the IRS Reform Act because the bill contains no \n     provisions that have ``widespread applicability'' to \n     individuals or small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9147-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9147-S9148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Jason Montefering\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

He was a member of \nthe 3rd Armored Cavalry Division, and was killed when an improvised \nexplosive device, IED, detonated near his military vehicle in Baghdad.\n  A graduate of Parkston High School, Staff Sergeant Montefering was \nserving his second tour of duty in Iraq. He will be remembered as a \nhard worker who was always ready to get his hands dirty, according to \nhis former employer. While in high school, Jason worked part time at \nMurtha Repair in Parkston. Owner John Murtha remarked that Jason \n``would sweep up and then help the mechanics. All of the guys liked \nworking with him. He was a real good kid.''\n  Staff Sergeant Montefering is the 11th servicemember from South \nDakota killed during hostilities in Iraq. He served our country with \nhonor and died a hero defending it. My thoughts and prayers are with \nhis family during this difficult time, as well as all those who have \nloved ones serving overseas.\n  I commend Staff Sergeant Montefering's commitment to his family, his \nNation, and his community. Without question, his dedication to helping \nothers will serve as his greatest legacy, and our Nation is a far \nbetter place because of Staff Sergeant Montefering's contributions.\n  I join all South Dakotans in expressing my sympathies to the friends \nand family of Staff Sergeant Montefering. I know he will be deeply \nmissed, but his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                      Sergeant Jason T. Palmerton\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof SGT Jason T. Palmerton of Auburn, NE, a Green Beret in the U.S. \nArmy. Sergeant Palmerton was killed by small arms fire while on foot \npatrol on July 23 in Qal'eh-Yegaz, Afghanistan. He was 25 years old.\n  Sergeant Palmerton was born in Hamburg, IA, and grew up in Nebraska. \nHe graduated from Auburn High School in 1998 and enlisted in the Army \nin 2002. Sergeant Palmerton was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 3rd \nSpecial Forces Group based in Fort Bragg, NC, and had been in \nAfghanistan for 6 weeks. He had learned Arabic and was working as a \ncommunications specialist. Sergeant Palmerton will be remembered as a \nloyal soldier who had a strong sense of duty, honor, and love of \ncountry. Thousands of brave Americans like Sergeant Palmerton are \ncurrently serving in Afghanistan.\n  Sergeant Palmerton is survived by his mother Denise Brown, of Auburn; \nfather Steve Palmerton of Norman, OK; sisters, Elizabeth Schlange of \nAuburn, Amanda Palmerton of Omaha and Chelsea Palmerton of Norman; \ngrandparents, Herman and Alice Moenning of Lincoln, and Thomas \nPalmerton of Brownville; and fiance Shelley Austin of North Carolina. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time. America \nis proud of Sergeant Palmerton's heroic service and mourns his loss.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SGT \nJason T.

Mr. President, on Monday I offered an amendment that \nwould prohibit cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of \npersons under the custody or control of the U.S. Government. I was \npleased that Senators Warner, Graham, and Collins joined as original \ncosponsors, and Senators Chafee and Alexander have also joined as \ncosponsors.\n  After I offered the amendment, I agreed to modify it at the manager's \nrequest to include a Presidential waiver--section (b) of the pending \namendment.

When the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the Defense authorization bill, I will either modify \nthe pending amendment, seek action on the second-degree amendment, or \nsimply file a new amendment without the waiver.

Mr. President, on May 26, 2005, I introduced with my \ncolleague Senator Durbin the Pet Animal Welfare Statute of 2005, or \nPAWS. PAWS amends the Animal Welfare Act to strengthen the Secretary of \nAgriculture's authority to deal with the problems of substandard animal \ndealers.\n  I want to make clear to our colleagues and the public that we believe \nthe vast majority of animal dealers are conscientious persons who make \nevery effort to treat their animals humanely and to comply with the \nlaw. But, unfortunately, there are some animal dealers who do not care \nproperly for their animals and who seek to profit at the expense of the \nanimals and the public. They exploit the weaknesses and loopholes in \nthe current law to evade or ignore basic standards for the care and \ncondition of animals. These substandard dealers give the entire pet \nindustry a black eye, all the while preying upon the public. It is \nthese unscrupulous animal dealers at which PAWS is targeted.\n  PAWS strengthens the Secretary of Agriculture's authority to deal \nwith substandard animal dealers by making four important improvements \nto the Animal Welfare Act. First, it will bring under coverage of the \nAnimal Welfare Act high volume dealers who are in every respect like \nthose dealers currently regulated, but are evading regulation because \nthey sell animals exclusively at retail. PAWS will continue to exempt \nreal retail pet stores, and will add a new exemption for small dealers \nand hobby and show breeders. Second, PAWS will help the Secretary of \nAgriculture identify persons not complying with the law by requiring \nthose who acquire animals for resale to keep records of the source from \nwhom the animals are acquired and make these records available to the \nSecretary upon request. Third, PAWS will create an incentive for \ndealers to quickly correct serious problems by giving the Secretary \nauthority to temporarily suspend dealers' licenses for up to 60 days if \na violation is placing the health of an animal in imminent danger. \nFinally, PAWS will strengthen the authority of the Secretary to obtain \ninjunctions to shut down dealers who fail to comply with the law.\n  The marketplace for animals has changed dramatically since the 1970s \nwhen the current animal dealer provisions of the act were written. At \nthat time only retail pet stores and small hobby and show breeders sold \npet animals, so regulating wholesale sellers and exempting persons who \nsold animals at retail and were regulated by the market made some \nsense. With the advent of the internet, mass national marketing \nchannels, and mass importation of puppies for resale, there are a large \nnumber of unregulated dealers who are in every respect identical to the \ndealers regulated by the act, except that they evade regulation by \nselling exclusively at retail. By regulating these high volume retail \nsellers, we will assure that they meet the same standards for the \nhumane care and treatment of animals that breeders and brokers selling \nat wholesale have been meeting for 30 years.\n  PAWS defines the term ``retail pet store'' so that only real retail \npet stores are exempt, where customers can see the animals and the \nconditions where they are kept. PAWS also adds a specific exemption for \nsmall dealers and hobby and show breeders. Only persons who sell more \nthan 25 dogs per year would be regulated. In addition, breeders who \nsell dogs and cats from fewer than 7 litters a year bred or raised on \ntheir own premises, or fewer than 25 dogs and cats per year bred or \nraised on their own premises, which ever is greater, would be exempt. \nFor example, if an irish setter breeder has 6 litters that average 6 \npuppies each for a total of 36 puppies, they can sell them without \nbeing regulated. If a toy\n\n[[Page S9149]]\n\nbreeder has 10 litters that average only 2 puppies each for a total of \n20 puppies, they can sell them without being regulated. These breeders \ncould also sell 25 or fewer other dogs a year not bred or raised on \ntheir own premises such as stud puppies or puppies from coownerships, \nwithout being regulated. I firmly believe that the sport and hobby of \nbreeding and raising dogs and cats should not be a federally regulated \nactivity. PAWS will, for the first time, put an explicit exemption into \nthe Animal Welfare Act to protect small hobby and show breeders from \nregulation.\n  Some persons who sell dogs for hunting purposes have expressed a \nconcern that PAWS will bring them under regulation. The current Animal \nWelfare Act already covers persons who sell hunting dogs, and has for \nalmost 30 years. They are regulated on the same basis as those who sell \ndogs for pets. PAWS will continue to regulate sellers of hunting dogs \non the same basis as those who sell dogs as pets. Only high volume \nsellers who exceed the exemptions set forth in PAWS will be subject to \nregulation.\n  Some rescue and shelter organizations have expressed concern that \nbecause they often charge an adoption fee to those who adopt the dogs \nthey place, these organizations will fall within the definition of \n``dealers'' in PAWS and be regulated. True rescue and shelter \norganizations who do not sell dogs or cats in commerce, for profit, \nwill not be brought under regulation by PAWS, whether or not they are \nformally incorporated as not for profit organizations.\n  Some high volume dealers in cats and dogs who will be brought under \ncoverage of the Animal Welfare Act by PAWS, but who are still small \nenough that they breed and raise dogs or cats in essentially a \nresidential environment, have expressed concern that they will be \nforced to build kennels and catteries and will no longer be able to \nraise animals in a residential environment. There is nothing in PAWS, \nor in the current Animal Welfare Act, that precludes persons from \nbreeding and raising animals in a residential setting, provided the \nanimals are properly housed and cared for. In implementing PAWS, the \nSecretary of Agriculture will have to assure that the animal care \nregulations take into account breeders and dealers who conduct their \noperations in a residential setting.\n  I want to make clear that PAWS is a very different piece of \nlegislation than the bills that Senator Durbin and I have introduced in \nprevious Congresses. PAWS does not require or justify creating any new \nanimal care standards, like our previous legislation did. It focuses \nonly on bringing under regulation high volume commercial dealers \ncurrently evading regulation and on strengthening the Secretary of \nAgriculture's ability to identify and bring into compliance high volume \ndealers who are not in compliance with existing law or, as a last \nresort, shut them down.\n  Senator Durbin and I in the Senate, along with our colleagues \nRepresentatives Gerlach and Farr who have introduced PAWS in the House \nof Representatives, consulted with a broad array of animal interest and \nanimal welfare groups in creating PAWS. We believe that the enactment \nof PAWS will be a major milestone in the history of animal protection \nin the United States. We are delighted that it has brought together \nanimal interest groups and animal welfare groups that in the past have \noften been on opposite sides of animal legislation, including our own \npast bills. Having said that, no legislation is perfect when \nintroduced. As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee's \nSubcommittee on Research, Nutrition and General Legislation, which has \njurisdiction over PAWS, I intend to convene a hearing and mark-up of \nPAWS shortly after the August recess to make technical corrections, and \nto clarify some of the bill's language to better reflect our intentions \nas set forth in this statement.\n  PAWS is not intended to restrict breeding or impose a hardship on \nrescue and shelter organizations. PAWS specifically recognizes the \nimportance of protecting small breeders and the noncommercial purebred \ndog and cat fancy from Federal regulation. My family and I purchased \nour beloved German shepherd dog Schatzie from a small breeder. We and \nSchatzie raised a litter of puppies in our own home last year, and \nfully understand the hard work and commitment that it requires. I also \nknow that most commercial breeders are dedicated to their profession \nand to their animals. I believe that PAWS will protect small hobby and \nshow breeders and the vast majority of compliant commercial breeders as \nwell as the public from those breeders and brokers who evade or fail to \ncomply with the law. And, most importantly, it will protect the animals \nthemselves. I urge my colleagues and all those in the animal welfare \ncommunity to join us in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9149-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9149-S9150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with great joy to congratulate \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, on its 75th anniversary. \nThrough its tireless work on behalf of this Nation's veterans, VA has \ncertainly lived up to the words of the great President Abraham Lincoln, \n``To care for him who shall have borne the battle and his widow, and \nhis orphan.'' During its first 75 years, VA has done much to benefit \nnot only veterans and their families but also the nation as a whole.\n  On June 22, 1944, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the \nMontgomery GI bill into public law. Since then, the GI bill has been \nupdated and modernized several times. This far-reaching legislation has \nhelped improve the lives of over 20 million veterans through \neducational programs, home loan guarantees, unemployment compensation, \nand other benefits. It is estimated that over the lifetime of the \naverage veteran, the U.S. Treasury receives two to eight times the \nincome tax from the average veteran than was spent on the veteran's GI \nbill benefits. The GI bill is undoubtedly one of the most important \npieces of legislation in this Nation's great history.\n  VA has also established a legacy of first rate health care for our \nveterans. A recent study by the RAND Corporation found that VA outpaces \nprivate health care systems in delivering care to patients. RAND \nobserved that VA patients were more likely to receive recommended \nhealth services than patients using a private provider. The study also \nconcluded that VA patients consistently receive better care across the \nboard, including screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.\n  Additionally, VA's Medical and Prosthetics Research Program has led \nto substantial advances in prosthetics, traumatic injury, post \ntraumatic stress disorder, as well as many other areas that have helped \nour veterans over the years. This research has also led to discoveries \nin medicine that effect both veterans and the general population, such \nas cancer, aging, mental illness, and heart disease. In fact, past VA \nresearch projects have resulted in the first successful kidney \ntransplant performed in the U.S., as well as the development of the \ncardiac pacemaker, a vaccine for hepatitis, and the CAT and MRI scans.\n  Another function of VA is overseeing our National Cemetery System. VA \nhas helped create and manage a network of Federal and State cemeteries \nthat provides deceased veterans with a respectful and peaceful final \nresting place.\n  The far-reaching accomplishments that I briefly highlighted are just \na few cornerstones of the Department's legacy. With the current \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, we appreciate even more \nthe quality work that VA does for our veterans. And the current \noperations should also be a reminder to VA and Congress of the burdens \nour veterans face because of their sacrifices to protect our freedoms \nand liberties.\n  I am extremely proud of the work VA has done, and I hope that through \ngreater cooperation between Congress and the administration, we can \nexpand upon VA's legacy and address the current needs of our veterans. \nI must also highlight the dedication of the staff that has worked at VA \nover the years. An agency as massive as VA would cease to function \nwithout quality leadership and staff. Many of VA's staff have a deep \nand passionate commitment to providing quality health care and benefits \nfor our veterans.\n  Our Nation's veterans and servicemembers deserve nothing less than \ntop quality health care and benefits. I am sure that Congress and VA \ncan work together to fulfill this obligation. Once again, I \ncongratulate VA on 75 years of service to our veterans.\n\n[[Page S9150]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9149-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9149-S9150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

The study also \nconcluded that VA patients consistently receive better care across the \nboard, including screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.\n  Additionally, VA's Medical and Prosthetics Research Program has led \nto substantial advances in prosthetics, traumatic injury, post \ntraumatic stress disorder, as well as many other areas that have helped \nour veterans over the years. This research has also led to discoveries \nin medicine that effect both veterans and the general population, such \nas cancer, aging, mental illness, and heart disease. In fact, past VA \nresearch projects have resulted in the first successful kidney \ntransplant performed in the U.S., as well as the development of the \ncardiac pacemaker, a vaccine for hepatitis, and the CAT and MRI scans.\n  Another function of VA is overseeing our National Cemetery System. VA \nhas helped create and manage a network of Federal and State cemeteries \nthat provides deceased veterans with a respectful and peaceful final \nresting place.\n  The far-reaching accomplishments that I briefly highlighted are just \na few cornerstones of the Department's legacy. With the current \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, we appreciate even more \nthe quality work that VA does for our veterans. And the current \noperations should also be a reminder to VA and Congress of the burdens \nour veterans face because of their sacrifices to protect our freedoms \nand liberties.\n  I am extremely proud of the work VA has done, and I hope that through \ngreater cooperation between Congress and the administration, we can \nexpand upon VA's legacy and address the current needs of our veterans. \nI must also highlight the dedication of the staff that has worked at VA \nover the years. An agency as massive as VA would cease to function \nwithout quality leadership and staff. Many of VA's staff have a deep \nand passionate commitment to providing quality health care and benefits \nfor our veterans.\n  Our Nation's veterans and servicemembers deserve nothing less than \ntop quality health care and benefits. I am sure that Congress and VA \ncan work together to fulfill this obligation. Once again, I \ncongratulate VA on 75 years of service to our veterans.\n\n[[Page S9150]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9150-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HONORING THE LIFE OF ELVIN OREN CRAIG\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to honor the life of a special \nIdahoan who is also the father of my colleague from Idaho, Senator \nLarry Craig. Elvin Oren Craig, who passed away last week, left many \nlegacies and will be missed by many people. In Idaho, he served as a \nlifelong advocate for Idaho agriculture, and a leader in Washington \nCounty, Midvale and Weiser. He also was very active in his local VFW \nPost in Midvale, ID. At 87 years old, he had remained active despite a \ndiagnosis of prostate cancer. In fact, he worked until only about 6 \nmonths ago when he decided it might be time to let up a little bit. \nElvin Craig's legacy also lives on in my colleague and in Senator \nCraig's consistent and honorable service to Idahoans over his years in \npublic office. I know that Elvin was proud of his son's service to \nIdaho and the country--first in the Idaho State Senate, then in the \nU.S. House of Representatives, and now in the U.S. Senate.\n  Elvin's family and friends know of his community service and his \npersistent commitment over many years to Idaho's farmers and ranchers \nand his own family. He worked hard while maintaining his sense of \nhumor. His full life was an outstanding example of what it means to be \nan Idahoan. I am pleased to pay tribute to a remarkable man, Elvin Oren \nCraig, and to share my condolences to my friend, Larry Craig, and his \nfamily upon the passing of a great man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9150-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould withhold United States contributions to the United Nations if the \nU.N. interferes with the second amendment rights guaranteed by our \nConstitution.\n  The U.N. has no business interfering with the second amendment rights \nguaranteed by our Constitution. That is why I am introducing \nlegislation to safeguard our citizens against any potential \ninfringement of their second amendment rights.\n  In July, 2001, the U.N. convened a conference, known as the \n``Conference on the Illicit Trade of Small Arms and Light Weapons in \nAll Its Aspects in July 2001.'' One outcome of the conference was a \nresolution entitled, ``The United Nations Program of Action to Prevent, \nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons \nin All Its Aspects.'' This resolution calls for actions that could \nabridge the second amendment rights of individuals in the United \nStates, including: (1) national registries and tracking lists of legal \nfirearms; (2) the establishment of an international tracking \ncertificate, which could be used to ensure U.N. monitoring of the \nexport, import, transit, stocking, and storage of legal small arms and \nlight weapons; and (3) worldwide record keeping for an indefinite \namount of time on the manufacture, holding, and transfer of small arms \nand light weapons.\n  The U.N. also wishes to establish a system for tracking small arms \nand light weapons. How would they do this? It would be done by forcing \nlegal, licensed gun manufacturer's to create identifiable marks for \neach nation. The gun manufacturer's lists would then be provided to \ninternational authorities on behalf of the U.N.\n  Who would maintain these intrusive lists? Would it be the World \nCustoms Organization, which the U.N. has suggested as a possible \nvehicle? That organization counts Iran, Syria, China, and Cuba among \nits membership. Would all World Customs Organization members have \naccess to such lists? In the event that those with access to such \ninformation abuse or misuse it, what would be the remedy? How would we \nprevent unauthorized persons, perhaps criminals and terrorists, from \nacquiring such information from rogue nations who have declared the \nUnited States an enemy?\n  Some at the U.N. have suggested that tracing certain financial \ntransactions of a legal and law abiding gun industry could be a useful \ntool in tracking firearms. What would such tracing entail? Does the \nU.N. expect to receive private U.S. banking records of a legal and law \nabiding industry?\n  Furthermore, the U.N. has encouraged member States to integrate \nmeasures to control ammunition with regard to small arms, and some \nmembers have expressed a desire to tax international arms sales. The \nU.N. has no legal right or authority to collect a tax from American \ncitizens to further any agenda, especially gun control measures.\n  The U.S. Constitution has guaranteed our citizens the right to keep \nand bear arms. I intend to help protect that right with this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support the Second Amendment \nProtection Act of 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9150-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last year, an African-American transgender woman was brutally beaten, \nraped, and strangled in a San Francisco hotel. The murder is under \ninvestigation and anti-transgender bias has been looked into as a \nmotive.\n  I believe that the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9150-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9150-S9151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month, the debate over the nomination \nof Judge William Pryor to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals included \na discussion of Judge Pryor's call to repeal section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act--the centerpiece of that landmark statute--because, as he \nasserted in congressional testimony, it ``is an affront to federalism \nand an expensive burden that has far outlived its usefulness.'' His \ntestimony demonstrated that Judge Pryor is more concerned with \npreventing an ``affront'' to the States' dignity than with guaranteeing \nall citizens the right to cast an equal vote.\n  In the Republican defense of Judge Pryor, it was suggested that \nCongressman John Lewis, a stalwart leader of the civil rights movement, \nsomehow agreed with Judge Pryor's opposition to section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act because of a statement Congressman Lewis had made about a \nspecific redistricting plan.\n  Congressman Lewis has made clear many times, most recently in a July \n14 letter to me, his disagreement with the views of Judge Pryor and his \nstrong support for the Voting Rights Act--and particularly section 5. \nCongressman Lewis wrote:\n\n       Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act must be renewed. There \n     is a continued, proven need for the pre-clearance provisions \n     of the Voting Rights Act, which ensure that local and state \n     jurisdiction do not develop laws that intentionally or \n     unintentionally discriminate against groups who may have \n     little or no voice in the establishment of those laws.\n\n  His statements of support for one particular redistricting plan in no \nway diminish his commitment to the Voting Rights Act.\n  Congressman Lewis believes, as do I, that the Voting Rights Act is \nour most important protection guaranteeing that no individuals or \ngroups are without a voice in this democracy. As he so eloquently \nnoted:\n\n       The history of the right to vote in America is a history of \n     conflict, of struggling for the right to vote. Many people \n     died trying to protect that right. I was beaten and jailed \n     because I stood up for it. For millions like me, the struggle \n     for the right to vote is not mere history; it is experience. \n     The experience of the last two presidential elections tells \n     us that the struggle is not over and that the special \n     provisions of the Voting Rights Act are still necessary.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Congressman Lewis's letter be printed in \nthe Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n[[Page S9151]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. In contrast, Judge Pryor's statements about section 5 \nreflect a long-discredited view of the Voting Rights Act. Since the \nenactment of the statute in 1965, every Supreme Court case to address \nthe question has rejected the claim that section 5 is an ``affront'' to \nour system of federalism. Whether under Earl Warren, Warren Burger, or \nWilliam Rehnquist, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that \nguaranteeing all citizens the right to cast an equal vote is essential \nto our democracy--no a ``burden'' that has ``outlived its usefulness.''\n  Indeed, Congressman Lewis sponsored a resolution, which is being \nconsidered on the floor of the House today, commemorating the passage \nof the Voting Rights Act 40 years ago this summer. The resolution \nrecalls the struggle for the act's landmark protections--from the \nbrutal suppression of marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, \nAL, on ``Bloody Sunday'' in March 1965, to the passage of the bill by a \nbipartisan Congress months later--and reaffirms its importance. Forty \nyears after President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, \nCongressman Lewis and I remain committed to this essential piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2005.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: During the Senate debate on the \n     nomination of Judge William Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court \n     of Appeals, Senator Saxby Chambliss quoted a few words of my \n     testimony in the case of the State of Georgia v. John \n     Ashcroft, and implied that I agree with Judge Pryor's \n     assessment of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. I take \n     issue with Senator Chambliss's remarks and want to make clear \n     that his reference to my remarks were taken out of context.\n       I regret that my colleague, the senior Senator from \n     Georgia, would use my support of a Georgia redistricting plan \n     to justify the confirmation of Justice William Pryor to the \n     11th Circuit Court of Appeals. I strongly disagree with the \n     views of Judge Pryor and do not think he is fit to serve.\n       I further regret that Senator Chambliss would use my very \n     general statements to suggest that I am not in favor of \n     renewing Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Section 5 of the \n     Voting Rights Act must be renewed. There is a continued, \n     proven need for the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting \n     Rights Act, which ensure that local and state jurisdictions \n     do not develop laws that intentionally or unintentionally \n     discriminate against groups who may have little or no voice \n     in the establishment of those laws.\n       We have come a long way in the last two decades, and \n     certainly have come a long way since the 1960's, however, \n     voting obstacles and disparities still exist for far too many \n     minorities. In Florida in 2000, voters were confused by their \n     ballots, polling equipment broke down, and polls did not open \n     as scheduled. In Ohio in 2004, many people stood in what \n     appeared to be unmovable lines for eight and nine hours \n     trying to exercise their right to vote. There were an \n     inadequate number of voting machines and in some instances, \n     bogus officials were sent to polling stations and were found \n     disseminating misinformation and questioning the choices of \n     voters.\n       As a result of these problems, many Americans were denied \n     the right to vote. These truths continue to demonstrate the \n     importance of the Voting Rights Act to prevent discrimination \n     and to ensure that people are not denied the right to vote. \n     The vote is the most powerful, nonviolent tool that our \n     citizens have in a democratic society, and nothing but \n     nothing should discourage, hamper or interfere with the right \n     of every citizen to cast a vote for the person of their \n     choice.\n       The history of the right to vote in America is a history of \n     conflict, of struggling for the right to vote. Many people \n     died trying to protect that right. I was beaten, and jailed \n     because I stood up for it. For millions like me, the struggle \n     for the right to vote is not mere history; it is experience. \n     The experience of the last two presidential elections tells \n     us that the struggle is not over and that the special \n     provisions of the Voting Rights Act are still necessary. We \n     should not take a step backward, when there is still much to \n     be done to ensure every vote and every voter counts.\n       As we work toward reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, we \n     must move in a deliberative manner, conduct open and adequate \n     hearings, and ensure that we create the appropriate \n     legislative history and factual findings. I look forward to \n     working with you to protect the voting rights of all \n     Americans, by reauthorizing and strengthening the provisions \n     of the Voting Rights Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Lewis,\n     Member of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9151-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9151-S9152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AIR FORCE ACADEMY'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY AND NASA'S RETURN TO FLIGHT.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I today observe two momentous occasions: \nthe Space Shuttle's Return to Flight and the 50th anniversary of the \nU.S. Air Force Academy.\n  Yesterday, at 10:39 a.m. eastern daylight time, the Space Shuttle \nDiscovery safely lifted off from its launch pad at Cape Canaveral, FL. \nIt blasted into orbit carrying seven of our Nation's finest, on a \nmission to resupply the International Space Station, test the Shuttle, \nand resume America's manned exploration of the cosmos.\n  I want to thank NASA's Administrator, Michael Griffin, and the \nthousands of men and women who have worked tirelessly in the wake of \nthe Columbia tragedy to upgrade the safety of our space mission. Their \ncommitment and courage have helped turn our Nation's dreams to the \nheavens and stars once again.\n  Also this month, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the entrance of \nthe first class of cadets to the Air Force Academy.\n  It is fitting that NASA's return to flight occurs at a moment when we \nare reflecting on the Air Force Academy's first half century of \nservice, because the Academy and NASA are two institutions that attract \nthe best men and women in our country. Due to their shared focus on \nflight, the two institutions are forever linked. In fact, two of the \nastronauts guiding the Discovery in orbit overhead right now come from \nthe Air Force Academy.\n  LTC Eileen Collins, a former professor in the Air Force Academy's \nMathematics Department, is currently soaring 122 miles above us as the \ncommander of the Shuttle's return to flight. Raised in public housing \nin upstate New York, Eileen Collins broke through every barrier laid \nbefore her to become the first woman to pilot a Shuttle. When she came \nto the Air Force Academy in 1986 she helped usher in a new era at the \nAcademy, an era where women were allowed to compete and succeed on an \nequal playing field. We in Colorado are very proud that Lieutenant \nColonel Collins' journey to space brought her to the Air Force Academy.\n  Sitting next to Lieutenant Colonel Collins today in the Space Shuttle \nis Discovery's pilot, James Kelly, Air Force Academy class of 1986.\n  James Kelly grew up in the small town of Burlington, IA, where the \nsounds of passing airplanes inspired dreams of spaceflight. The Air \nForce Academy gave James Kelly the tools, training, and opportunity to \ntake to the skies. It gave him, and the thousands of other young men \nand women who have passed through its gates, a mission to serve our \ncountry and the greater good.\n  Astronauts Collins and Kelly represent the best of the Academy they \nrepresent the best of its students and the best of its faculty. They \nremind us that the Academy's proud mission continues to be of \nimmeasurable value to our nation.\n  Yesterday's successful Space Shuttle launch reminds us that despite \nthe challenges that still face the Academy, the institution has, for \nhalf a century, produced some of our finest leaders.\n  The 360 civilians who took the oath on July 12, 1955, to become the \nfirst Air Force Academy cadets built a legacy of leadership that is at \nthe foundation of the institution's mission. Three generations of young \npeople have passed through the Academy and have learned to lead our \nnation in times of war and peace.\n  They live by the Academy's core values, ``integrity first, service \nbeyond self, and excellence in all we do.'' They inspire us all.\n  They inspire us because they are American pioneers like Eileen \nCollins, first in her field.\n  They inspire us because they are represented by the cadet who told me \nhe chose the Academy because, quote, ``the country needs me--our \nfreedoms need my protection.''\n  And the Academy's cadets inspire us because they are leading our \nReturn to Flight, lifting our thoughts from tragedy to the triumphant \npossibilities of space exploration.\n  I congratulate the Air Force Academy, its cadets, staff, and \ngraduates for 50 years of excellence.\n  And along with millions of Americans, I also wish our astronauts a \nsafe voyage and a speedy return.\n\n[[Page S9152]]\n\n  Our prayers are with you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9152-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9152-S9153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE HOWRIGAN FAMILY OF FAIRFIELD, VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the Howrigan \nfamily of Fairfield, VT, who recently celebrated their annual family \nreunion.\n  The Howrigan family is a bedrock of Franklin County and Vermont \nagriculture, and has done much to carry on our State's agricultural \nstewardship tradition.\n  I have known many members of the Howrigan family for years and have \ncome to appreciate the sound counsel on dairy issues and other aspects \nof farm policy.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Howrigan family for their service to \nVermont agriculture and their communities, for they represent the \nfinest tradition of our rural State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a July 24, 2005, Burlington Free Press \narticle featuring and honoring this wonderful Vermont family be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 24, 2005]\n\n                    Howrigans: A Dynasty of Dairying\n\n                           (By Candace Page)\n\n       Fairfield.--When Harold Howrigan's four grandsons crammed \n     into the back seat of their aunt's pickup truck for a road \n     trip last week, Tim Howrigan, 12, couldn't wait to tell the \n     others what he'd heard about a breakthrough in mastitis \n     research.\n       ``The cows that get the new treatment, their calves produce \n     more enzymes'' to prevent the udder infection in dairy cows, \n     he told them. He explained to his 10- and 11-year-old cousins \n     how it's better to keep cows healthy than to have to cure \n     them after they've become sick.\n       In the Howrigan clan, you are never too young to learn the \n     family business.\n       ``It's in the blood,'' says W. Robert Howrigan, 86.\n       Howrigans have been milking cows in Fairfield since their \n     arrival from Ireland's County Tipperary in 1849. One \n     Howrigan, William, and his wife, Margaret, reared 10 children \n     on a 35-cow hill farm in the Depression days. Today, 32 of \n     their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren work \n     farms in Franklin County--a dairy dynasty unique in Vermont.\n       The descendants of William and Margaret milk more than \n     3,000 cows and produce maple syrup from nearly 40,000 taps; \n     their fields, pastures and woods cover 10,000 acres in \n     Fairfield and neighboring towns.\n       More farms--38 of them--ship milk from Fairfield than from \n     any other Vermont town, in part because of the community's \n     high Howrigan count. The family has provided two of Vermont's \n     most influential voices in state and national dairy policy: \n     William's sons, the late state Sen. Francis Howrigan and \n     Harold, 81, a longtime leader of the St. Albans Co-operative \n     Creamery.\n       Howrigans have graduated from Harvard; become nurses, \n     doctors, teachers and lawyers; left Fairfield or Vermont for \n     good. But an extraordinary number of the men, and some of the \n     women, have chosen a farm life like their parents'.\n       They constitute a one-clan countertrend to Vermont's annual \n     loss of family farms in the face of low milk prices, the \n     flight of young people and the attraction of less back-\n     breaking work.\n       ``Saddam Hussein couldn't drive these people off their \n     farms,'' Vermont Agriculture Secretary Steve Kerr says, \n     ``They love farming. You can see that in their faces. And \n     it's not just that they love what they do; they are making \n     money at it.''\n       The sprawling but tight-knit family network has proven \n     fertile ground for growing both success and love of the \n     farming life. Dozens of pairs of Howrigan hands will \n     materialize to help build an uncle's barn, move a cousin's \n     herd or teach the finer points of farming to a sister's \n     child.\n       Kerr could not think of another Vermont farm clan as big \n     and long-lasting as the Howrigans. ``I don't see why what \n     they've got isn't sustainable forever and ever,'' he said.\n       Twelve-year-old Tim Howrigan, for one, knows just what \n     he'll do when he grows up: ``I'll be a cow farmer,'' he said.\n\n\n                            A farm education\n\n       Margaret McCarthy Howrigan bore a child every 18 to 24 \n     months between 1915 and 1933. She made sure 10 children were \n     fed, clothed and washed in a house not reached by electric \n     lines until 1939.\n       A teacher before her marriage to William, she put as high a \n     value on education as her husband put on improving his \n     farmland and tiny herd. Margaret's children would go to high \n     school. Her girls, all five of them, would go to college if \n     they wanted and every one of them did.\n       William's boys were a different case. Yes, they were needed \n     as workers on the farm, but in the Howigran family, farming \n     meant more than the endless repetition of milking cows and \n     cutting hay. A farm was for problem-solving today and \n     improving for tomorrow.\n       As children, the Howrigans helped their father transplant \n     lines of maples along Howrigan Road, build drainage on the \n     roads in their sugarbush to prevent erosion, and turn the \n     piles of stone hauled from their fields into the foundation \n     of an all-weather road.\n       Decades later, Francis, the oldest boy, would put this \n     lesson into words his children still repeat: ``Live as though \n     you're going to die tomorrow, farm as though you're going to \n     live forever.''\n       He and his brothers found challenges for the brain and \n     plenty of stimulation for their entrepreneurial instincts \n     right on the farm. They grew up in a narrow, hill-edged \n     valley but didn't see the farm as confining or constraining.\n       At 17 or 18, Harold built what he thinks was the first \n     mechanical gutter cleaner in Vermont, on assemblage of chains \n     and pulleys and a 5-horsepower motor to haul manure out of \n     the barn.\n       ``I just got tired of shoveling,'' he said last week.\n       In his teens, Francis acquired a drag saw to cut firewood \n     for neighbors. He bought a truck and began hauling milk and \n     hay for other farmers. In his 20s, he rented a nearby place \n     ``on halves'' from a neighboring farmer, paying half the \n     expenses and taxes, keeping half the income. By 32, he owned \n     his first farm. Ultimately, he would accumulate 10 farms and \n     more than 4,000 acres.\n       When Robert, Francis' younger brother, couldn't persuade \n     his father to buy the farm next-door, he borrowed the money \n     to buy it himself. He, too, would acquire additional farms--\n     five in all--to pass on to his sons.\n       Even Tom, who did go to college in his 30s and became a \n     surgeon, continues to live in the house where he was born. At \n     84, he still spends many of his days cutting brush and \n     improving the family woodlot. ``I consider myself a longtime \n     surgeon but a lifetime farmer,'' he said.\n       Some Howrigan sons still prefer to get their education on \n     the farm. The family tells the story of Michael Howrigan, \n     Francis' grandson, who enrolled in college after high school.\n       ``He called home every night. He wasn't homesick. He just \n     couldn't stand not knowing what was happening on the farm,'' \n     said his father, also named Michael. The younger Michael soon \n     quit school and went into partnership with his father in the \n     family business.\n       There's no farming without family among the Howrigans. \n     William's children started at 5 or 6, hauling wood for the \n     stove, feeding calves, scraping the barn, picking bugs off \n     potato plants that yielded 300 bushels a year in the cold \n     valley.\n       A big family also means constant companions--siblings to \n     share chores, play baseball in the pasture or climb the \n     maples on the hill. Most Howrigans grow up sociable, and the \n     pleasures of sociability help make farming attractive.\n       ``It's pretty magical. I have cousins and siblings that are \n     my best friends,'' said Kate Howrigan Baldwin of Burlington, \n     one of 12 children of Francis Howrigan. ``There's an \n     allegiance that is unspoken. You know you are going to help \n     one another and be there for one another. It's not a \n     mandate--it's what you want to do.''\n       Family is the first thing Brendan Schreindorfer mentions \n     when he is explaining how a village boy ended up buying his \n     own milking herd at the age of 24. His mother is a Howrigan--\n     William was his great-grandfather--but his parents did not \n     farm.\n       Instead, Brendan spent his youth tagging along behind his \n     grandfather, Robert, and his uncles and cousins on their big \n     farm north of Fairfield Center.\n       He was determined to become a dairy farmer since he was a \n     child, he said.\n       ``I think it was the fact that everyone was always working \n     together to get something done. People pull together and it \n     pulls you along. It's a family thing, and it never leaves \n     your system once it's there,'' he said.\n       Five years ago, his parents co-signed a note to help him \n     buy his herd. This winter, he borrowed money on his own to \n     purchase a 625-acre farm in Sheldon. (He'd built up equity, \n     but the Howrigan pedigree might have helped him get the loan, \n     he said.)\n       His new place was run down--his cousins helped him with \n     repairs through the winter. He needed to move his herd this \n     spring--a small squadron of Howrigans showed up with trucks \n     and trailers to help.\n       Howrigans help one another bring in hay, harvest corn, fix \n     equipment and build barns. Patrick Howrigan, 54, of Sheldon, \n     raised the rafters of his 200-stall barn in a day, thanks to \n     volunteers led by his brothers and cousins.\n       ``A lot of neighbors helped, but family was the driving \n     force,'' he said.\n\n\n                            love of the land\n\n       Harold Howrigan's air-conditioned pickup truck bounced down \n     a dirt track through one of his fields last week, between \n     rows of corn taller than the cab. He nodded toward a nearby \n     woods. The landowner, he said, had subdivided the land and \n     put in five or six houses.\n       There was the slightest hint of disappointment or \n     disapproval in his tone. Since he bought his first farm in \n     1968, he has acquired more than 1,000 acres, a rolling green \n     landscape of maple woods and productive fields with million-\n     dollar views.\n\n[[Page S9153]]\n\n       ``I've never sold an inch of land. I just don't want to do \n     that,'' he said.\n       If the Howrigan clan has a leader and role model, Harold, \n     at 81, fills the bill. His square face is topped by a puff of \n     white hair, his ruddy complexion crinkled by the weather. \n     It's a face that would look equally at home in a Tipperary \n     pub, a testament to his purely Irish ancestry.\n       Like many of the Howrigan men, he seems gruff and a bit \n     standoffish at first meeting. Howrigans have the ``quiet \n     gene,'' says his niece Kate Baldwin.\n       Over the kitchen table in the farmhouse he shares with his \n     wife, Anne, or on a tour of the land they farm with their \n     three sons, he expands. The gruffness melts into stories of \n     childhood on the farm. He shows a visitor field after \n     hillside field, not saying much, apparently for the pure \n     pleasure of looking at the land and the results of a \n     lifetime's work.\n       Land was ``a treasure,'' he said, to the Irish farmers who \n     immigrated to Fairfield from a country where land ownership \n     was all but impossible for them. That fierce allegiance to \n     one's own acres also runs in the Howrigan line.\n       Even in the hardscrabble days of the Depression, his father \n     treated the land well--planting trees, combing stones from \n     the rocky fields, preventing erosion. ``He never cut a live \n     maple,'' he said.\n       Harold and his sons use the latest technology in their \n     sugarhouse, but they collect sap the way Harold's father did, \n     with hanging buckets and sled-top tanks pulled by five teams \n     of horses.\n       Horses don't require new roads to be cut and are easier on \n     the land. ``There's no substitute for horses gathering sap. \n     They're nicer to work with, they come to you and stop. A \n     tractor won't do that,'' he said.\n       With the other farmers of Fairfield, the Howrigans have \n     created a town perhaps more pastoral than any other in \n     Vermont. From many of Howrigan's hillsides, the view of corn \n     and hayfields and grazing heifers seems to have changed not \n     at all in a hundred years.\n       But does he value his land for its worth in bushels of corn \n     alone? Or does he find it beautiful, as well?\n       ``I think it is beautiful, and I work to keep it that \n     way,'' he said, looking back toward the home farm. ``I \n     treasure it for its value as working land and for its beauty, \n     too.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9153-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              IN RECOGNITION OF DR. H. WESLEY TOWERS, JR.\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr. H. \nWesley Towers Jr. upon his retirement as State Veterinarian after 37 \nyears of dedicated service. He is a man with a kind heart, diverse \ninterests and great abilities. Wesley embodies the best of Delaware.\n  ``Doc,'' as he was fondly known, was born on August 15, 1942 in \nWilmington, DE. He spent much of his youth with his grandfather, the \nfarm manager on E.E. du Pont's Greenville, DE, estate, ``Dogwood.'' He \nloved the country, the farm work, and the animals. When the local \nveterinarian came to tend the livestock, Doc knew what he wanted to be.\n  Doc graduated high school in 1960 from P.S. Dupont, and went on to \nstudy animal and poultry science at the University of Delaware, \ngraduating with honors and distinction in 1964. He spent the next four \nyears at the University of Pennsylvania veterinary school, graduating \nin 1968, and went on to become Delaware's vet almost by chance.\n  After veterinary school, Doc took a job in Kent County as an \napprentice to the State veterinarian. At the same time, Harrington and \nGeorgetown racetracks offered him a temporary night job overseeing \nracehorses. Several weeks later, the track vet had a stroke, leaving \nhim unable to resume race work. The temporary job became a full-time, \nsecond job for Doc. The following year in 1969, the State vet retired \nand Doc was appointed in his place.\n  Doc has the Nation's fourth largest poultry industry to protect, a \nrabies epidemic to police, and race courses to regulate. Containing and \nexcluding contagious and infectious animal and poultry diseases is his \npriority, with public enemy No. 1 being avian flu, a virulent \nrespiratory ailment that devastates poultry. Doc and his team work hard \nat their jobs to ensure that any outbreaks of avian flu are contained.\n  During his time as State vet, Doc has received the Department of \nAgriculture's Employee of the Year award, the University of Delaware's \nWorrilow Award for service to agriculture and Delaware's coveted Award \nfor Excellence and Commitment to State Service. At the University of \nDelaware, Doc is a part of the Agricultural Alumni Association, the \nAlumni Association board, the Career Planning and Placement advisory \ncommittee, the phone-a-thons, and the ``Alumni in the Classroom'' \nprogram.\n  Doc spends much of his free time championing causes in which he \nbelieves. He testifies in SPCA cases, including revelations over local \n``puppy mills.'' He is involved with the racing commissions, the State \nFair Board and the Tri-State Bird Rescue group. In addition, Doc enjoys \ngardening, traveling, hunting, cooking and taking trips to the beach.\n  Doc is married to his college sweetheart, Sarah. The two met in a \nchemistry laboratory at the University of Delaware, and were married on \nJune 25, 1966. They have two children, Laura and David, and four \ngrandchildren, Mark, Annie, Matthew and Davey. Sarah describes her \nhusband over almost forty years as a patient, kind and loving man who \nloves to be around people. He is fortunate to wake up every morning and \ngo to a job that he loves.\n  After retirement, Doc plans to spend his time pursuing his hobbies, \nvolunteering, and most importantly, continuing to raise his beloved \nDelaware blue hens. I rise today to honor Doc and to thank him for the \nfriendship that we share. Through his tireless efforts, Doc has made a \nprofound difference in the lives of thousands and enhanced the quality \nof life for an entire State. Upon his retirement, he will leave behind \na legacy of commitment to public service for both his children and \ngrandchildren and for the generations that will follow. I congratulate \nhim on a truly remarkable and distinguished career. I wish him and his \nfamily only the very best in all that lies ahead for each of \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9153-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE VALUE OF RURAL HEALTH CARE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to pay \ntribute to a group of people whose tireless, dedicated service to those \nin need too often goes unnoticed--North Dakota's and our Nation's \nhealth care providers. As I travel around North Dakota, I frequently \nstop in to visit hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. I am \ncontinually impressed by the quality, compassionate care that I see \nbeing provided by doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, and \nother medical staff, as well as by the administrative and support \nstaff.\n  Rural America depends on its small town hospitals, its tertiary \nhospitals, on physicians and nurses, nursing homes, those who provide \nemergency ambulance services, and many others to provide a seamless \nsystem of care. There are a range of challenges facing rural health \nsystems, from difficulty recruiting and retaining staff and inadequate \nreimbursement to rising costs and reams of paperwork to fill out. \nDespite these challenges, our health care providers do an admirable job \nremaining focused on providing quality care.\n  Our hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics are also important engines \ndriving North Dakota's economy. Health services account for 8 percent \nof North Dakota's gross State product. And health care providers are \noften among the largest employers in a rural community, representing \nabout 15 percent of direct and secondary employment.\n  In short, a strong health care system is an important part of our \nrural infrastructure, and the people who make up that system have my \ndeep respect and thanks. Over the years, we have determined that rural \nelectric service, rural telephone service, an interstate highway system \nthrough rural areas, and rural mail delivery, to name a few services, \nmake us a better, more unified nation. The same is true of rural health \ncare, and I will continue fighting for policies that reflect rural \nhealth care as a strong national priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9153-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9153-S9154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING HOME DEPOT\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the Home \nDepot for the support, employment, and assistance it provides to the \nmen and women of our active duty Armed Forces, Reserves and National \nGuard and their families.\n  Beginning with its founding by Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank and \ncontinuing under CEO and President Bob Nardelli, the Home Depot has \nalways been a great corporate citizen. Nothing\n\n[[Page S9154]]\n\nexemplifies the company's commitment more than its support of our \nveterans and their families.\n  In the years 2003 and 2004 combined the Home Depot hired 25,000 \nveterans, and was recognized by G. I. Jobs magazine as America's No. 1 \nmilitary-friendly employer. In 2004, the company launched Operation \nCareer Front with the departments of Defense, Labor, and Veterans \nAffairs to provide career opportunities to military personnel and their \nspouses.\n  Since the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our Nation \nhas depended on our military Reserves and National Guard in waging the \nwar on terror, and no American company has been a bigger supporter of \nthe Reserves and Guard than the Home Depot. In March of 2003 the \ncompany enhanced its military leave policy to provide active duty \nassociates with full pay and an extension of their health benefits.\n  In April 2003 the Home Depot launched Project Homefront, donating \nmore than 1 million hours of volunteer service and $1 million to help \nrepair the homes of deployed military families. In September of 2004 \nthe National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserves \npresented the Home Depot with its Freedom Award.\n  In June of this year the company established a program for returning \nveterans to provide associates with the critical resources needed for a \nsmooth transition back to work.\n  For all these reasons and so many more, Home Depot was recognized \nthis year by the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation and the \nPartnership for Public Service with awards for leadership and \ndistinguished service to America's veterans.\n  I am very proud to recognize CEO Bob Nardelli and the men and women \nof Home Depot for their leadership in employing and assisting America's \nactive duty and veteran military personnel and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9154-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN WALTON\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nMr. John Walton, 58, an Arkansas native and Wal-Mart heir who on June \n28, was killed when his aircraft crashed on landing outside of Jackson, \nWY.\n  John lived a varied and interesting life. John was born on October 8, \n1946, the second oldest son of Sam and Helen Walton of Bentonville, AR. \nHe attended high school in Bentonville and began his undergraduate \nstudies at the College of Wooster in Wooster, OH.\n  As a young college student during the Vietnam era, John enlisted in \nthe Army and volunteered for combat as a medic with the Green Berets. \nDuring his time in Vietnam, he was often in firefights with the enemy \nand performed heroically as a part of his special operations unit. He \nwas awarded the Silver Star for saving the lives of several members of \nhis unit while under enemy fire.\n  After returning from Vietnam, John pursued a variety of interests, \nincluding working as a crop duster in the 1970s and building boats in \nthe 1980s. He had a passion for all things mechanical and was an avid \nmotorcyclist and pilot.\n  More recently, John took a great interest in education. He took $67 \nmillion of Walton Foundation money and founded the Children's \nScholarship Fund. Scholarships from the fund have benefitted 67,000 \nchildren. He, along with his family, also made the largest contribution \nto a public college when they gave a $300 million gift to the \nUniversity of Arkansas.\n  Our condolences and prayers go out to John's wife Christy of Jackson \nHole, WY; to his son, Luke, and to his mother Helen; as well as to his \nsiblings Rob, Jim, and Alice.\n  John's life exhibited his commitment to his country in so many ways. \nHe defended his country on the battlefields of Vietnam and he invested \nin his country by funding a better education for thousands of children. \nI am sure the entire Senate will join with me to honor the life of John \nWalton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9154-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF GARY L. NEALE\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I call to the attention of my \ncolleagues the retirement of a pillar of the energy industry for many \nyears in my home State of Indiana, Mr. Gary L. Neale. On June 30, 2005, \nMr. Neale stepped down from his post of chief executive officer of \nNiSource Inc.\n  Prior to bringing his talents and dedicated work ethic to Northwest \nIndiana, Mr. Neale earned both his B.A. and M.B.A. from the University \nof Washington. In addition to this impressive education, he also took \ntime to broaden his experiences by serving his country as an officer in \nthe U.S. Navy. Mr. Neale remains not only an astute student but also a \nvalued teacher contributing articles to Business Week, Harvard Business \nReview, and Public Utilities Fortnightly.\n  Supplementing his impressive academic and military careers, Mr. Neale \nbecame a consistent force in the energy industry in Indiana and \nnationally. Before joining NiSource in 1989, Mr. Neale was chairman, \npresident and executive officer of Planmetrics Inc., an energy industry \nmanagement consulting firm, for 17 years. Additionally, he held \nmanagement positions at Wells Fargo Bank and Kaiser Industries.\n  Mr. Neale has displayed tremendous leadership in multiple capacities. \nHe has served as chairman of both the American Gas Association and the \nNorth American Electric Reliability Council. He was appointed to the \nU.S. Department of Energy's National Petroleum Council and also the \nDepartment's Electricity Advisory Board. Mr. Neale graciously accepted \nthe appointment of the Governor of Indiana to serve on our State's \nEconomic Development Council, Energy Policy Forum and Clean Air \nAdvisory Committee. He headed the Northwest Indiana Americans with \nDisabilities Act Advisory Board and the Lake Area United Way Campaign. \nMr. Neale also sits on the boards of directors of Associated Electric & \nGas Insurance Services Limited, AEGIS, Modine Manufacturing Company, \nChicago Bridge and Iron Company, and Valparaiso University.\n  As he begins this new chapter in his life, I simply wanted to \nhighlight a few of Mr. Neale's extensive accomplishments. I am pleased \nto have this opportunity to join his wife Sandy, two children, five \ngrandchildren, and many friends and colleagues in congratulating him on \na fine career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9154-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9154-S9155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JACKSON T. STEPHENS\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \nlegendary Arkansan. Jackson ``Jack'' Stephens was a businessman, \nfinancier, and philanthropist whose work has touched the lives of \ncountless individuals in and outside of Arkansas, and his contributions \nto the state will live on for generations to come.\n  Described by Scott Ford, CEO of Alltel Corporation, as ``the most \nbrilliant businessperson that the state has ever produced,'' Jack \nStephens has many accomplishments and accolades to his credit. Jack \ngrew up on a farm in Grant County, AR. He attended the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, and soon thereafter he joined his brother Witt's investment \nfirm, which became the financial vehicle for his success over the \nyears. Jack's good business instincts and fabled work ethic led \nStephens, Inc. to the forefront of Arkansas business. The financial \nclout that the Stephens brothers were able to amass allowed Jack to \nplay an essential role in the development of some of Arkansas' most \nsuccessful businesses, including Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, and Alltel \nCorporation. The Stephens name is virtually inseparable from economic \ndevelopment in Arkansas over the last half century, and rightfully so.\n  Jack Stephens was also a philanthropist who truly believed in the \nvalues of charity and community service. His love for the people of \nArkansas led him to invest not only in for-profit ventures to \ncontribute to our State's economic well-being but also in many \nnonprofit causes for the benefit of the people of Arkansas. He helped \nbuild the distinguished Jackson T. Stephens Spine and Neurosciences \nInstitute at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Jack's \nsupport of the arts, health and education also made a notable \ndifference in lives of so many Arkansans.\n  Perhaps one of the best known causes that Jack promoted was related \nto one of his lifetime passions: golf. In 1991 Jack was chosen to be \nchairman of the Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters \ntournament, where he served until 1997. It is here that Jack\n\n[[Page S9155]]\n\ndeveloped the idea of extending his favorite pastime to underprivileged \nyouths. Thanks to his generous support, the First Tee program, with \nlocations in Little Rock and Fort Smith, promotes, character \ndevelopment and life-enhancing values through the game of golf.\n  Jack Stephens' giving spirit will live on in the many institutions he \nhas supported over the years, and his legacy will continue to influence \nthe State of Arkansas for a long time to come. I join all Arkansans in \ngiving thanks for the life of a pioneer businessman and an eternal \nfriend of his fellowman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9155-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the \n90th anniversary of the Lincoln Highway, which was officially routed \nthrough Washington, DC, on July 27, 1915, making it a true national \nhighway. The construction of the highway was not only an important \nmilestone in our Nation's history, but it has also served as a \nsignificant link in the development of Maryland's highway system.\n  The highway was first conceived in 1912, when most roads were little \nmore than deeply rutted wagon trails. But with the rise of the \nautomobile, the need for a transcontinental road had become \nincreasingly apparent and ambitious plans were laid for this enormous \nundertaking.\n  The original proposed route for the highway ran from New York to \nCalifornia, but did not pass through Maryland or the Nation's Capital. \nCOL Robert Harper, who at the time was President of the DC Chamber of \nCommerce and chairman of the Lincoln Highway Feeder Committee, lead a \ncampaign to have the route altered to pass by the Lincoln Memorial. He \napproached Maryland Senator Blair Lee, whose seat I am proud to occupy, \nasking for help in the rerouting of the thoroughfare. Senator Lee wrote \nto President Woodrow Wilson and arranged a meeting between the \nPresident and Colonel Harper. That meeting led President Wilson to \nlobby on behalf of the proposed change in the route.\n  Through the efforts of President Wilson, Senator Lee, and Colonel \nHarper, the President of the Lincoln Highway Association was convinced \nto change the course of the highway so that it could pass through the \nNation's Capital. This change brought additional visitors to both the \nState of Maryland and Washington, DC. In addition, the change preserved \nthe spirit of President Abraham Lincoln and united the west and east \ncoasts of the United States of America.\n  I am pleased to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Lincoln \nHighway a ``Road of Character'' and a ``Perpetual Memorial'' to \nPresident Lincoln which both commemorated a great leader and paved the \nway for the future of transportation in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9155-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF MR. DARYL E. HARMS\n\n   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \ngreat entrepreneur, Mr. Daryl E. Harms. Daryl, who passed away on July \n9, 2005, led a life of great purpose, from his childhood days in \nIllinois to his time as a businessman in Birmingham, AL. As the son of \na farmer, Daryl learned the values of hard work, dedication and \ncommitment, and he utilized these qualities throughout his life to \ndream big, conquer challenging tasks, and carry out innovative ideas.\n  He began his distinguished career, along with his business partner \nTerry W. Johnson, as an industry pioneer in cable television, cellular \ncommunication and home security in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time of \nhis death, he was the chief executive officer of Birmingham-based \nMasada Resource Group. This most recent business venture developed, \npatented and applied new technologies to convert solid wastes to \nrenewable biofuels.\n  Daryl was featured as the Door-to-Door Billionaire in Fortune Small \nBusiness magazine for his keen business sense and ability to transform \na risky venture into success. His fearlessness in business was \nrecognized by all who knew him.\n  While Daryl was focused on his business ventures, he was deeply \ncommitted to his community as well. He served at various times on the \nboards of the Alabama Republican Party, the American Cancer Society, \nMagic Moments, and Prescott House. He had a generous spirit and was \ndetermined to help others not only in his community but throughout the \nState of Alabama.\n  I should also say that Daryl distinguished himself in yet another \nway. He was a devoted family man who cherished his wife and children. \nHe is survived by his wife Clarissa Busby Harms of Birmingham; his \ndaughters Hannah Katherine Harms and Emily Elizabeth Harms of \nBirmingham; his father Walter Edward Harms of Quincy, IL; and his \nbrothers, Don Harms of Ursa, IL and Ken Harms of Sutter, IL. He was \npreceded in death by his mother Pauline Eshom Harms of Quincy, IL.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Mr. Daryl \nE. Harms. Daryl's entrepreneurial spirit and innovative mind \ndistinguishes him as one of American's great businessmen. He will be \ngreatly missed by all who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9155-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9155-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9155-5", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 22.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Patients First Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the current health \n     care liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism \n     for resolving claims of health care liability and \n     compensating injured patients, and is a deterrent to the \n     sharing of information among health care professionals which \n     impedes efforts to improve patient safety and quality of \n     care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals;\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 103. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.\n\n       The time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit \n     shall be 3 years after the date of manifestation of injury or \n     1 year after the claimant discovers, or through the use of \n     reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, \n     whichever occurs first. In no event shall the time for \n     commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after \n     the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of \n     the following:\n       (1) Upon proof of fraud;\n       (2) Intentional concealment; or\n       (3) The presence of a foreign body, which has no \n     therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of \n     the injured person.\n\n     Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the \n     date of the alleged manifestation of injury except that \n     actions by a minor under the full age of 6 years shall be \n     commenced within 3 years of manifestation of injury or prior \n     to the minor's 8th birthday, whichever provides a longer \n     period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for minors for \n     any period during which a parent or guardian and a health \n     care provider or health care organization have committed \n     fraud or collusion in the failure to bring an action on \n     behalf of the injured minor.\n\n     SEC. 104. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.\n\n       (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses \n     in Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, the \n     full amount of a claimant's economic loss may be fully \n     recovered without limitation.\n       (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--In any health care \n     lawsuit, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered may be \n     as much as $250,000, regardless of the number of parties \n     against whom the action is brought or the number of separate \n     claims or actions brought with respect to the same \n     occurrence.\n       (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--In any \n     health care lawsuit, an award for future noneconomic damages \n     shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not \n     be informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. \n     An award for noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall \n     be reduced either before the entry of judgment, or by \n     amendment\n\n[[Page S9162]]\n\n     of the judgment after entry of judgment, and such reduction \n     shall be made before accounting for any other reduction in \n     damages required by law. If separate awards are rendered for \n     past and future noneconomic damages and the combined awards \n     exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be \n     reduced first.\n       (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each \n     party shall be liable for that party's several share of any \n     damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each \n     party shall be liable only for the amount of damages \n     allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party's \n     percentage of responsibility. A separate judgment shall be \n     rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to \n     such party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact \n     shall determine the proportion of responsibility of each \n     party for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. 105. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.\n\n       (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to \n     Claimants.--In any health care lawsuit, the court shall \n     supervise the arrangements for payment of damages to protect \n     against conflicts of interest that may have the effect of \n     reducing the amount of damages awarded that are actually paid \n     to claimants. In particular, in any health care lawsuit in \n     which the attorney for a party claims a financial stake in \n     the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court shall \n     have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage \n     recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to \n     the claimant based upon the interests of justice and \n     principles of equity. In no event shall the total of all \n     contingent fees for representing all claimants in a health \n     care lawsuit exceed the following limits:\n       (1) 40 percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (2) 33\\1/3\\ percent of the next $50,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (3) 25 percent of the next $500,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (4) 15 percent of any amount by which the recovery by the \n     claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.\n       (b) Applicability.--The limitations in subsection (a) shall \n     apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, \n     mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alternative \n     dispute resolution. In a health care lawsuit involving a \n     minor or incompetent person, a court retains the authority to \n     authorize or approve a fee that is less than the maximum \n     permitted under this section.\n       (c) Expert Witnesses.--\n       (1) Requirement.--No individual shall be qualified to \n     testify as an expert witness concerning issues of negligence \n     in any health care lawsuit against a defendant unless such \n     individual--\n       (A) except as required under paragraph (2), is a health \n     care professional who--\n       (i) is appropriately credentialed or licensed in 1 or more \n     States to deliver health care services; and\n       (ii) typically treats the diagnosis or condition or \n     provides the type of treatment under review; and\n       (B) can demonstrate by competent evidence that, as a result \n     of training, education, knowledge, and experience in the \n     evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease or injury \n     which is the subject matter of the lawsuit against the \n     defendant, the individual was substantially familiar with \n     applicable standards of care and practice as they relate to \n     the act or omission which is the subject of the lawsuit on \n     the date of the incident.\n       (2) Physician review.--In a health care lawsuit, if the \n     claim of the plaintiff involved treatment that is recommended \n     or provided by a physician (allopathic or osteopathic), an \n     individual shall not be qualified to be an expert witness \n     under this subsection with respect to issues of negligence \n     concerning such treatment unless such individual is a \n     physician.\n       (3) Specialties and subspecialties.--With respect to a \n     lawsuit described in paragraph (1), a court shall not permit \n     an expert in one medical specialty or subspecialty to testify \n     against a defendant in another medical specialty or \n     subspecialty unless, in addition to a showing of substantial \n     familiarity in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), there is a \n     showing that the standards of care and practice in the two \n     specialty or subspecialty fields are similar.\n       (4) Limitation.--The limitations in this subsection shall \n     not apply to expert witnesses testifying as to the degree or \n     permanency of medical or physical impairment.\n\n     SEC. 106. ADDITIONAL HEALTH BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The amount of any damages received by a \n     claimant in any health care lawsuit shall be reduced by the \n     court by the amount of any collateral source benefits to \n     which the claimant is entitled, less any insurance premiums \n     or other payments made by the claimant (or by the spouse, \n     parent, child, or legal guardian of the claimant) to obtain \n     or secure such benefits.\n       (b) Preservation of Current Law.--Where a payor of \n     collateral source benefits has a right of recovery by \n     reimbursement or subrogation and such right is permitted \n     under Federal or State law, subsection (a) shall not apply.\n       (c) Application of Provision.--This section shall apply to \n     any health care lawsuit that is settled or resolved by a fact \n     finder.\n\n     SEC. 107. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Punitive damages may, if otherwise \n     permitted by applicable State or Federal law, be awarded \n     against any person in a health care lawsuit only if it is \n     proven by clear and convincing evidence that such person \n     acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant, or that \n     such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury \n     that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain \n     to suffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for \n     compensatory damages is rendered against such person, no \n     punitive damages may be awarded with respect to the claim in \n     such lawsuit. No demand for punitive damages shall be \n     included in a health care lawsuit as initially filed. A court \n     may allow a claimant to file an amended pleading for punitive \n     damages only upon a motion by the claimant and after a \n     finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing \n     affidavits or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, \n     that the claimant has established by a substantial \n     probability that the claimant will prevail on the claim for \n     punitive damages. At the request of any party in a health \n     care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a separate \n     proceeding--\n       (1) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (2) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit, the \n     trier of fact shall consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages, if \n     awarded, in a health care lawsuit may be as much as $250,000 \n     or as much as two times the amount of economic damages \n     awarded, whichever is greater. The jury shall not be informed \n     of this limitation.\n       (c) No Penalties for Providers in Compliance With FDA \n     Standards.--A health care provider who prescribes a medical \n     product approved or cleared by the Food and Drug \n     Administration shall not be named as a party to a product \n     liability lawsuit involving such product and shall not be \n     liable to a claimant in a class action lawsuit against the \n     manufacturer, distributor, or seller of such product.\n\n     SEC. 108. AUTHORIZATION OF PAYMENT OF FUTURE DAMAGES TO \n                   CLAIMANTS IN HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any health care lawsuit, if an award of \n     future damages, without reduction to present value, equaling \n     or exceeding $50,000 is made against a party with sufficient \n     insurance or other assets to fund a periodic payment of such \n     a judgment, the court shall, at the request of any party, \n     enter a judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by \n     periodic payments in accordance with the Uniform Periodic \n     Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National \n     Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.\n       (b) Applicability.--This section applies to all actions \n     which have not been first set for trial or retrial before the \n     effective date of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 109.

STATE FLEXIBILITY AND PROTECTION OF STATES' RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Health Care Lawsuits.--The provisions governing health \n     care lawsuits set forth in this subtitle preempt, subject to \n     subsections (b) and (c), State law to the extent that State \n     law prevents the application of any provisions of law \n     established by or under this subtitle.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Patient Safety and \n     Quality Improvement Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 142. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a report \n     entitled To Err is Human that described medical errors as the \n     eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as \n     many as 98,000 people dying as a result of medical errors \n     each year.\n       (2) To address these deaths and injuries due to medical \n     errors, the health care system must identify and learn from \n     such errors so that systems of care can be improved.\n       (3) In their report, the Institute of Medicine called on \n     Congress to provide legal protections with respect to \n     information reported for the purposes of quality improvement \n     and patient safety.\n       (4) The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee of \n     the Senate held 4 hearings in the 106th Congress and 1 \n     hearing in the 107th Congress on patient safety where experts \n     in the field supported the recommendation of the Institute of \n     Medicine for congressional action.\n       (5) Myriad public and private patient safety initiatives \n     have begun. The Quality Interagency Coordination Taskforce \n     has recommended steps to improve patient safety that may be \n     taken by each Federal agency involved in health care and \n     activities relating to these steps are ongoing.\n       (6) The research on patient safety unequivocally calls for \n     a learning environment, rather than a punitive environment, \n     in order to improve patient safety.\n       (7) Voluntary data gathering systems are more supportive \n     than mandatory systems in creating the learning environment \n     referred to in paragraph (6) as stated in the Institute of \n     Medicine's report.\n       (8) Promising patient safety reporting systems have been \n     established throughout the United States and the best ways to \n     structure and use these systems are currently being \n     determined, largely through projects funded by the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality.\n       (9) Many organizations currently collecting patient safety \n     data have expressed a need for legal protections that will \n     allow them to review protected information and collaborate in \n     the development and implementation of patient safety \n     improvement strategies. Currently, the State peer review \n     protections are inadequate to allow the sharing of \n     information to promote patient safety.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to--\n       (1) encourage a culture of safety and quality in the United \n     States health care system by providing for legal protection \n     of information reported voluntarily for the purposes of \n     quality improvement and patient safety; and\n       (2) ensure accountability by raising standards and \n     expectations for continuous quality improvements in patient \n     safety.\n\n     SEC. 143.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING HEALTH DISPARITIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that additional measures are \n     needed to reduce or eliminate disparities in health care \n     related to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and \n     geography that affect access to quality health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 1508. A bill to require Senate candidates to file designations, \nstatements, and reports in electronic form; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will once again introduce with \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, a bill to bring Senate campaigns \ninto the 21st century by requiring that Senate candidates file their \ncampaign finance disclosure reports electronically and that those \nreports be promptly made available to the public. We are very pleased \nto be joined in our effort in this Congress by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran. This step is long overdue, and I \nhope the Senate will act quickly on this legislation.\n  A series of reports by the Campaign Finance Institute have \nhighlighted the anomaly in the election laws that makes it nearly \nimpossible for the public to get access to Senate campaign finance \nreports while most other reports are available on the Internet within \n24 hours of their filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). \nThe Campaign Finance Institute asks a rhetorical question: ``What makes \nthe Senate so special that it exempts itself from a key requirement of \ncampaign finance disclosure that applies to everyone else, including \ncandidates for the House of Representatives and Political Action \nCommittees?''\n  The answer, of course, is nothing. The United States Senate is \nspecial in many ways. I am proud to serve here. But there is no \njustification for not making our campaign finance information as \nreadily accessible to the public as the information filed by House \ncandidates or others.\n  My bill amends the section of the election laws dealing with \nelectronic filing to require reports filed with the Secretary of the \nSenate to be filed electronically and forwarded to the FEC within 24 \nhours. The FEC is required to make available on the Internet within 24 \nhours any filing it receives electronically. So if this bill is \nenacted, electronic versions of Senate reports should be available to \nthe public within 48 hours of their filing. That will be a vast \nimprovement over the current situation, which, according to CFI, \nrequires journalists and interested members of the public to review \ncomputer images of paper-filed copies of reports, and involves a \ncompletely wasteful expenditure of hundreds of thousands of dollars to \nre-enter information into databases that almost every campaign has \navailable in electronic format.\n  The current filing system also means that the detailed coding that \nthe FEC does, which allows for more sophisticated searches and \nanalysis, is completed over a week later for Senate reports than for \nHouse reports. This means that the final disclosure reports covering \nthe first two weeks of October are often not susceptible to detailed \nscrutiny before the election.\n  It is time for the Senate to relinquish its backward attitude toward \ncampaign finance disclosure. I urge the enactment of this simple bill \nthat will make\n\n[[Page S9183]]\n\nour reports subject to the same prompt, public scrutiny as those filed \nby PACs and candidates for the other body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that a commemorative United States \npostage stamp should be issued to promote public awareness of Down \nsyndrome and the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend to \nthe Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued. I am honored to be \njoined by Senator Cornyn in this effort.\n  Down syndrome is a genetic condition usually caused by an error in \ncell division called non-disjunction. Regardless of the type of Down \nsyndrome a person may have, all people with Down syndrome have an \nextra, critical portion of the number 21 chromosome present in all, or \nsome, of their cells. This additional genetic material alters the \ncourse of development and causes the characteristics associated with \nthe syndrome.\n  Down syndrome affects people of all races and economic levels. It is \nthe most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormality, occurring once \nout of every 800 to 1,000 births. In the United States, more than \n350,000 people have Down syndrome. Nearly 5,000 children with Down \nsyndrome are born each year. Because the mortality rate connected with \nDown syndrome is decreasing, the number of individuals with Down \nsyndrome in our society is increasing. Some experts predict that the \nprevalence of individuals with Down syndrome will double in the next 10 \nyears, further increasing the need for public acceptance and education \nabout this genetic condition.\n  I encourage my colleagues to co-sponsor this meaningful resolution \nand assist our efforts to convince the Citizens' Stamp Advisory \nCommittee to recommend the issuance of a postage stamp promoting public \nawareness of Down syndrome.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senate Campaign Disclosure \n     Parity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENATE CANDIDATES REQUIRED TO FILE ELECTION REPORTS \n                   IN ELECTRONIC FORM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 304(a)(11)(D) of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 434(a)(11)(D)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(D) As used in this paragraph, the terms `designation', \n     `statement', or `report' mean a designation, statement or \n     report, respectively, which--\n       ``(i) is required by this Act to be filed with the \n     Commission, or\n       ``(ii) is required under section 302(g) to be filed with \n     the Secretary of the Senate and forwarded by the Secretary to \n     the Commission.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 302(g)(2) of such Act (2 U.S.C. 432(g)(2)) is \n     amended by inserting ``or 1 working day in the case of a \n     designation, statement, or report filed electronically'' \n     after ``2 working days''.\n       (2) Section 304(a)(11)(B) of such Act (2 U.S.C. \n     434(a)(11)(B)) is amended by inserting ``or filed with the \n     Secretary of the Senate under section 302(g)(1) and forwarded \n     to the Commission'' after ``Act''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to any designation, statement, or report required \n     to be filed after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again, I am proud to join my friend \nSenator Feingold as a co-sponsor of legislation that will require \nSenate candidates to file campaign finance reports in electronic form. \nThis bill will finally remove the exemption the Senate has given itself \nfrom an important requirement of campaign finance disclosure laws that \napply to everyone else, including candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and Political Action Committees (PACs).\n  Political committees active in Federal elections must submit their \nquarterly financial reports for disclosure by the Federal Election \nCommission (FEC). Anyone interested can nearly instantaneously download \nthe reports from the FEC website and conduct computer searches to learn \nabout the contributions and expenditures of individual candidates for \nthe House, non-Senate national party committees and PACs. The current \nproblem is that they cannot do the same for Senate candidates and \nparties because of the Senate's insistence on paper rather than \nelectronic filing. The FEC must do more processing of Senate paper \nreports than of House electronic ones. This involves printing or \ncopying the Senate reports, up to 10,000 pages a day at times, hand-\ncoding transactions that cannot be automatically processed, the \nkeypunching the data into the electronic database. House electronic \nreports do not need the same treatment. The end result is that in \ncontrast to the House, information from the Senate paper reports are \noften not available until well after the election has occurred.\n  Because of this problem, it is impossible for voters to be well-\ninformed about the campaign finance information of their Senators and \nSenate candidates. If a voter wants to consider the nature of the \ncampaign finance support received by a Senate candidate and compare \nthat support to Senate legislative votes as a factor in deciding for \nwhom they will cast a vote, they simply cannot do so due to the \nantiquated nature of the reporting system.\n  To address this problem, our legislation requires Senate candidates \nto file their campaign finance reports electronically with the \nSecretary of the Senate. Within 24 hours of receipt of those reports, \nthe Secretary is required to forward those reports to the FEC. The FEC, \nin turn is required to make those reports available on the Internet \nwithin 24 hours as they do other reports. Therefore, electronic \nversions of Senate reports will be available to the public within 48 \nhours of their filing.\n  Electronic reports are not only transmitted instantly but are more \naccurate than paper submissions because software can easily correct \nmistakes. On the other hand, hand entering of data is always prone to \nerror. Furthermore, the data in electronic reports can be rapidly \nsearched via the Internet for answers to specific questions. Voters \nwill no longer have to go through the time consuming process of reading \npages and pages filed by Senate candidates or Senate party committees \nto figure out the major donors and their employers, and the major \nrecipients of campaign spending. Instead, they can downlown a filed \nreport from the FEC website onto their personal computers and quickly \nlocate the information they need. This creates effective public \ndisclosure.\n  The Senate's current failure to provide its constituents with \nelectronically disclosed, timely information is unconscionable. Senate \nfilings should follow the same criteria as other campaign finance \nreports. There must not be a separate standard for the Senate. \nIronically, while they do not currently file electronically, Senators \nand Senate candidates already use electronic software in compiling \ntheir paper reports. If Senators and Senate candidates can use \ntechnology to run their offices and websites, why can't they use it to \nbetter inform their own constituents about how their campaigns are \nfunded? Our constituents have a right to that information.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 1509. A bill to amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to add non-\nhuman primates to the definition of prohibited wildlife species; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Captive \nPrimate Safety Act of 2005''. I am joined by Senators Chafee, Lieberman \nand Lautenburg.\n  Non-human primates in homes and communities pose serious risks to \npublic health and safety. An attack in March of this year on a \nCalifornia man by chimpanzees who escaped their confinement is only one \nexample of how dangerous these animals can be. A 13-year-old girl was \nattacked in West Virginia in May and on July 12th a 20-year-old man was \nattacked by two monkeys in Ohio.\n  Not only can non-human primates cause serious injury, they can spread \npotentially life-threatening illnesses. Since 1975, Federal regulations \nhave forbidden the import of monkeys and other non-human primates as \npets due to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) concerns about diseases \nsuch as\n\n[[Page S9184]]\n\nmonkeypox, yellow fever, Marburg/Ebola disease, tuberculosis, and other \ndiseases not yet known or recognized.\n  Nevertheless, there is still a vigorous trade in these animals, with \nas many as 15,000 primates held in private hands across America \naccording to some estimates. State laws that seek to regulate primates \nas pets are undermined by the interstate commerce of these animals. \nFederal legislation is needed to better support safety regulations of \nthe CDC and the states.\n  Infant primates may seem cute and cooperative, but they inevitably \ngrow larger, stronger, and more aggressive. They may become many times \nstronger than humans and extremely difficult to handle. They can \ninflict serious harm by biting and scratching. Removing their teeth, as \nmany pet owners do, is cruel and not a safeguard against injury. About \n100 people reportedly have been injured by non-human primates over the \npast ten years, including 29 children.\n  This legislation amends the Lacey Act to prohibit transporting \nmonkeys, great apes, (including chimpanzees and orangutans), marmosets, \nlemurs, and other non-human primates across State lines for the pet \ntrade, much like the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, which passed \nunanimously in 2003, did for tigers and other big cats.\n  The legislation is narrowly crafted to get at the heart of the \ndangerous problem of keeping primates as pets. It has no impact on the \ntrade or transportation of animals for federally licensed facilities, \nuniversities or accredited wildlife sanctuaries. It will not affect \nzoos or research facilities. Federal licenses or registration are \nrequired for all commercial activity, such as breeders, dealers, \nresearch institutions, exhibitors, and transporters, therefore, they \nare exempt. The prohibitions in the Lacey Act only apply in other \nsituations, that is, in the pet trade.\n  This legislation is supported by more than 40 groups, including the \nHumane Society of the United States, the American Zoo and Aquarium \nAssociation, the American Veterinary Medical Association, Defenders of \nWildlife and the International Fund for Animal Welfare.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and will work our \npartners in the House to enact the Captives Primate Safety Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1509\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Captive Primate Safety Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADDITION OF NON-HUMAN PRIMATES TO THE DEFINITION OF \n                   PROHIBITED WILDLIFE SPECIES.\n\n       Section 2(g) of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. \n     3371(g)) is amended by inserting ``or any non-human primate'' \n     before the period at the end.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Sarbanes (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Biden, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1512. A bill to grant a Federal charter to Korean War Veterans \nAssociation, Incorporated; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am once again introducing \nlegislation together with Senators Mikulski, Biden, Clinton, Murkowski, \nMurray, Wyden, Lautenberg, Schumer, and Durbin which would grant a \nFederal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association, Incorporated. \nThis legislation, which has passed the Senate in each of the past three \nCongresses, recognizes the 5.7 million Americans who fought and served \nduring the Korean War and honors their sacrifices on behalf of freedom \nand the principles and ideals of our Nation.\n  Today marks the 52nd Anniversary of the signing of the Military \nArmistice Agreement which officially ended armed hostilities on the \nKorean Peninsula. By the time the fighting ended, 8,177 Americans were \nlisted as missing or prisoners of war some of whom are still missing \nand more than 36,000 Americans had died. One hundred and thirty-one \nKorean War Veterans were awarded the Nation's highest commendation for \ncombat bravery, the Medal of Honor. Ninety-four of these soldiers gave \ntheir lives in the process.\n  When the North Korea People's Army swept across the 38th Parallel to \noccupy Seoul, South Korea in June of 1950, members of our Armed Forces \nincluding many from the State of Maryland immediately answered the call \nof the U.N. to repel this forceful invasion. Without hesitation, these \nsoldiers traveled to an unfamiliar corner of the world to join an \nunprecedented multi-national force comprised of 22 countries, and \nrisked their lives to protect freedom. The Americans who led this \ninternational effort were true patriots who fought with remarkable \ncourage. In battles such as Pork Chop Hill, the Inchon Landing, and the \nfrozen Chosin Reservoir, which was fought in temperatures as low as \nfifty-seven degrees below zero, they faced some of the most brutal \ncombat in history.\n  The sacrifices made by these brave individuals are well described by \nan engraving on the Korean War Veterans Memorial, which reads: \n``Freedom is not Free.'' Yet, as a Nation, we have done little more \nthan establish this memorial to publicly acknowledge the bravery of \nthose who fought in the Korean War. The Korean War has been termed by \nmany as the ``Forgotten War.'' Freedom is not free. We owe our Korean \nWar Veterans a debt of gratitude. Granting this Federal charter--at no \ncost to the government--is a small expression of appreciation that we \nas a Nation can offer to these men and women, one which will enable \nthem to work as a unified front to ensure that the ``Forgotten War'' is \nforgotten no more.\n  The Korean War Veterans Association was originally incorporated on \nJune 25, 1985. Since its first annual reunion and memorial service in \nArlington, VA, where its members decided to develop a national focus \nand strong commitment to service, the association has grown \nsubstantially to a membership of over 17,000. A Federal charter would \nallow the Association to continue to grow its mission and further its \ncharitable and benevolent causes. Specifically, it will afford the \nKorean War Veterans' Association the same status as other major \nveterans' organizations and allow it to participate as part of select \ncommittees with other congressionally chartered veterans and military \ngroups. A Federal charter will also accelerate the Association's \n``accreditation'' with the Department of Veterans Affairs which will \nenable its members to assist in processing veterans' claims.\n  The Korean War Veterans have asked for very little in return for \ntheir service and sacrifice. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation and ask that the text of the measure be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1512\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe medicine and drugs limitation on the deduction for medical care; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I rise today to offer a bill that would amend the medical \nand dental expense income tax deduction so that nonprescription or \nover-the-counter drugs would be allowed as a deductible expense for \ntaxpayers who itemize their deductions.\n  Currently, the IRS list of qualifying medical expenses does not \ninclude OTCs; this bill makes them a qualifying medical expense. The \nbill does this by striking the subsection that limits the deduction for \ndrug expenses to prescription drugs and insulin. It also makes it \neasier for people to reach and exceed the 7.5 percent threshold.\n  I believe this bill will be particularly helpful for low income \ntaxpayers and those with high healthcare expenses. Over 5 percent of \ntax filers currently claim the deduction for medical and dental \nexpenses. Additionally, individual taxpayers can also claim the medical \nexpenses of their spouses and dependent children--so pediatric cough \nsyrup bought by parents for their children would be deductible if OTC \nmedical expenses allowed.\n  This bill recognizes that over-the-counter drugs may be a big cost \nfor some individuals and families. In addition, Americans using a \nFlexible Spending Account or Health Savings Account get preferred tax \ntreatment for OTCs, but Americans without them do not. Tax treatment of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs should be equal in this area.\n  I am grateful to Senator Bill Nelson for joining me as a lead sponsor \nof this bill. I am also pleased that Representatives Melissa Hart and \nMike Ross have introduced companion legislation in the House. These \nindividuals understand that reducing the cost of medicine is a goal we \nshould all support. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1514\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``OTC Medicine Tax Fairness \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF MEDICINE AND DRUGS LIMITATION ON DEDUCTION \n                   FOR MEDICAL CARE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to medical, dental, etc., expenses) is \n     amended by striking subsection (b).\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 213(d) of such Code is \n     amended by striking paragraph (3).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleague Senator Jim DeMint as we introduce the OTC Medicine Tax \nFairness Act of 2005.\n  Health care costs are continuing to climb across America and the \nmedical expense deduction is becoming increasingly popular as Americans \nspend more out-of-pocket for health care. The OTC Medicine Tax Fairness \nAct of 2005 is designed to help make medicine more affordable by \nallowing consumers to include over-the-counter, OTC, drugs as a \ndeductible expense for people who itemize their deductions.\n  Under the OTC Medicine Tax Fairness Act of 2005, OTC medicines would \nbe allowed as tax deductible medical expenses. Under current law, \ntaxpayers who itemize income tax deductions may deduct out-of-pocket \nexpenses for medical care not reimbursed by health insurance, provided \nit exceeds 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. Eligible \nexpenses under the tax code currently include non-reimbursed costs for \ndoctor visits, bandages, crutches, acupuncture, chiropractic care, \nhearing\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\naids, and eyeglasses. The code also allows the costs of drugs, but only \nprescription drugs and insulin; OTCs are not included in the deduction \ncurrently. This legislation recognizes that OTC medicines may be a big \ncost for some individuals and families and that tax treatment of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs should be equal in this area.\n  The medical expense deduction is particularly helpful for low income \ntaxpayers with high health care expenses. Taxpayers in the lower income \nbrackets use the medical expense deduction more frequently than higher \nincome earners. According to the IRS website, over 3 million taxpayers \nwith incomes of $20,000 or less used the medical expense deduction in \n2001. This bill would help low income people with high medical expenses \nby allowing them to deduct the cost of OTCs.\n  This legislation would also provide much needed fiscal relief for \nmany seniors. According to U.S. Department of Labor statistics, seniors \npurchase more OTC drugs than any other age group. This bill would help \nthose elderly Floridians, as well as all elderly Americans, who use \nOTCs and take the medical expense deduction.\n  American consumers are currently paying extraordinary prices for \ntheir medications. It is time for Congress to help make medicine more \naffordable. One thing we can do is to make sure that as more drugs \nbecome available without prescriptions that their costs can still be \nincluded in tax- deductible health care expenses. If we can do that, we \nwill have done a great deal.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that my statement be \nincluded in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1515. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to advanced practice nurses and physician assistants \nunder the Medicaid Program; to the committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Medicaid Advanced \nPractice Nurse and Physician Assistants Access Act of 2005.'' This \nlegislation would change Federal law to expand fee-for-service Medicaid \nto include direct payment for services provided by all nurse \npractitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants. It \nwould ensure all nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and \nphysician assistants are recognized as primary care case managers, and \nrequire Medicaid panels to include advanced practice nurses on their \nmanaged care panels.\n  Advanced practice nurses are registered nurses who have attained \nadditional expertise in the clinical management of health conditions. \nTypically, an advanced practice nurse holds a master's degree with \ndidactic and clinical preparation beyond that of the registered nurse. \nThey are employed in clinics, hospitals, and private practices. While \nthere are many titles given to these advanced practice nurses, such as \npediatric nurse practitioners, family nurse practitioners, certified \nnurse midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and clinical \nnurse specialists, our current Medicaid law has not kept up with the \nmultiple specialties and titles of these advanced practitioners, nor \nhas it recognized the critical role physician assistants play in the \ndelivery of primary care.\n  I have been a long-time advocate of advanced practice nurses and \ntheir ability to extend health care services to our most rural and \nunderserved communities. They have improved access to health care in \nHawaii and throughout the United States by their willingness to \npractice in what some providers might see as undesirable locations--the \nextremely rural, frontier, or urban areas. This legislation ensures \nthey are recognized and reimbursed for providing the necessary health \ncare services patients need, and it gives those patients the choice of \nselecting advanced practice nurses and physician assistants as their \nprimary care providers.\n  In 1986, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment released a \nreport requested by the Senate Appropriations Committee. This report, \n``Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, and Certified Nurse \nMidwives: A Policy Analysis,'' found the quality of nurse practitioner \ncare to be as good as or better than care provided by physicians. By \npassing this legislation, we honor the commitment of these frontline \nhealth care professionals by ensuring they receive the respect and \nreimbursement they have earned.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1515\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicaid Advanced Practice \n     Nurses and Physician Assistants Access Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to modify a \nprovision relating to the locations in which class III gaming is \nlawful; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senator DeWine which will close a loophole in the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act (IGRA). By clarifying this statute, a State's right to \nprevent unwanted forms of gambling in the State will be protected.\n  The current laws governing Indian gambling are ambiguous when \noutlining which types of gambling are allowed. The provision in the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, that determines permitted gambling \nactivities defines casino-style gambling as Class III, including slot \nmachines, blackjack, craps, roulette, some lotteries and pari-mutuel \nracing. This class of gambling activity on Indian lands can only be, \nand I quote, ``located in a State that permits such gaming for any \npurpose by any person, organization or entity.''\n  It is unclear whether this means that the statutory language should \nbe read and applied in a class-wide or categorical sense or whether it \nshould be read and applied on an activity-by-activity basis.\n  District and circuit Federal courts have both considered this \nquestion. In 1991, a District Court in Wisconsin ruled that if a State \npermits one type of class III gaming, then all other types of class III \ngaming can be conducted in that State under the IGRA.\n  On the other hand, in 1993 and 1994, the Eighth and Ninth Circuit \nCourts of Appeals construed the language of the\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\nIGRA to mean that class III gaming in a particular State is limited \nunder the Federal law to the specific activities that are permitted \nunder that State's laws.\n  In July 2005, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals revealed that these \nuncertainties continue when it ruled in favor of the Northern Arapaho \ntribe in their efforts to build a casino, with ``Vegas Style'' gambling \nin Wyoming. In this instance, the tribe argued that it is entitled to \noffer full Class III gambling because the State allows casino style \nactivities for social or nonprofit purposes.\n  In Ohio, gambling for commercial purposes is prohibited by the State \nConstitution. However, pari-mutuel racing and lottery are both \npermitted as well as charitable gambling on a very limited and \ncontrolled basis.\n  The bill I am introducing today will clarify that Class III gambling \nunder IGRA applies only on an activity-by-activity basis, rather than \nin a class-wide sense.\n  I have been a long time supporter of a ban on casino gambling and \nhave taken steps to keep casino gambling out of Ohio. As Mayor of \nCleveland and as Governor of Ohio, I worked to inform Ohioans of the \nnegative impact casino gambling has on our families and our economy, \nleading to gambling's defeat at the polls. These initiatives proved to \nbe successful and have kept legalized gambling under control in Ohio.\n  My introduction of this legislation comes at a time when the progress \nwe've made is in danger of being compromised. Across the country, \nIndian tribes are looking to expand gambling and even looking at a \nState like Ohio where gambling is illegal.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3423 which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3423) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act with respect to medical device user fees.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nMedical Device User Fee Stabilization Act of 2005. This legislation \npreserves a valuable program for the review of innovative medical \ntechnologies.\n  This bill, H.R. 3423, is identical to S. 1420, which was reported \nlast week by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. \nIt represents a bipartisan, bicameral compromise that had unanimous \nsupport when it was reported out of the committee. It keeps an \nimportant Government program going, while providing more stability for \nthe industry. We have considered the needs of small and large \nbusinesses, all while ensuring that FDA has enough resources to \nmaintain a high level of effectiveness.\n  This compromise results in an 8.5 percent increase in user fees for \neach of the next 2 years. This is a significant reduction from the 20 \npercent annual increases these companies have been seeing. We have also \nraised the small business threshold more than threefold, from $30 \nmillion to $100 million. This means that additional companies will be \nable to take advantage of reduced fees for the review of new devices. \nThis bill will result in an average increase to FDA of 6 percent in \nuser fee revenues over the next 2 years, which means FDA will be able \nto continue reviewing new devices and will not be forced to lay off \nexperienced FDA staff or wind down a program that has been successful.\n  Finally, this compromise clarifies a provision in the 2002 medical \ndevice law regarding the marking of reprocessed devices. I know that \nthis provision, and any change to it, is controversial. However, we \nhave found a fair way forward. The bill we are considering today would \nrequire reprocessors to mark the device to identify the reprocessor, if \nthe original manufacturer has marked the device. If the original \nmanufacturer has not marked the device, the reprocessor must still mark \nthe device but has more flexibility in how to do so. This is workable, \nand it is even-handed.\n  My colleagues, Senators Burr, DeWine, Mikulski, Dodd and Murray, have \nhad great interest in the medical device user fee program, and I thank \nthem for cosponsoring the Senate bill.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Hatch for his attention and input \ninto\n\n[[Page S9197]]\n\nthis issue. He is a strong defender of the small, entrepreneurial \ncompanies in this industry. We worked together before committee \nconsideration of this bill to address his concerns about the impact of \nuser fees on the innovative companies in his home State of Utah. I \nwelcome his support and cosponsorship of the Senate bill.\n  Of course, I want to thank our staff for laboring so diligently to \nfind a workable, reasonable compromise and doing so under difficult \ntime constraints. In particular, I want to thank Jennifer Hansen, Abby \nKral, Ellen-Marie Whelan, Ben Berwick, Anne Grady, Patricia Knight, and \nPatricia DeLoatche. I also want to thank my committee staff Amy \nMuhlberg and Stephen Northrup.\n  Finally, I must express my deep appreciation and thanks to the \nranking member, Senator Kennedy, and his staff, David Bowen and David \nDorsey, for their hard work and support during this process. We have \nproduced a fair deal, and I urge my colleagues to lend it their strong \nsupport.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3423) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9197-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9197-S9198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FOUNDATION FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I strongly support the Foundation for the \nNational Institutes of Health Improvement Act.\n  The bill makes several improvements in the 1990 law that established \nthe Foundation. Most significantly, it assures the Foundation at least \n$500,000 annually from the NIH to support its administrative and \noperating expenses. The annual allocation is capped at $1.25 million. \nThese funds will enable the Foundation to use its own resources for the \nactual support of projects to strengthen NIH programs, rather than \nraise money for its own expenses. As the bill makes clear, the NIH \nDirector and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs are ex officio members \nof the Foundation's board of directors.\n  Congress established the Foundation in 1990 to raise private funds to \nsupport the research of the NIH. The Foundation has been a remarkable \nsuccess. For every dollar the Foundation received from the NIH in 2003, \nit raised $426 in private funds. Since its creation, it has raised $270 \nmillion, or $68 in private support for every dollar from the NIH.\n  The Foundation is currently managing 37 programs supported by $270 \nmillion generated from private contributions. As one important example, \nthe Edmond J. Safra Family Lodge on the NIH campus gives families of \npatients receiving in-patient treatment at the NIH Clinical Center a \nplace to stay, at no cost to them.\n  In addition, the Foundation has formed partnerships with the NIH to \ndevelop new cancer treatments, to identify biochemical signs of \nosteoarthritis and Alzheimer's Disease, and to build on the promise of \ngenomics. Through a public-private partnership, the Foundation has \nhelped accelerate the sequencing of the mouse genome. It is also \ncollecting private funds to study drugs in children. In 2003, Bill \nGates announced a gift to the Foundation of $200 million over the next \n10 years to support research on global health priorities. Clearly, the \nFoundation's partnership with the NIH will grow productively in the \ncoming years.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to support this legislation, which will \nenable the Foundation to continue its effective support of the work and \nmission of the NIH.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1517, which was introduced \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1517) to permit Women's Business Centers to re-\n     compete for sustainability grants.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this bill that \nwould provide critical funding that is needed to preserve the \noperations of existing Women's Business Centers that currently serve \nwomen entrepreneurs in almost every State and territory.\n  Women-owned businesses breathe new life into our economy, grow at \ntwice the rate of all firms, and create jobs with pace-setting results. \nWith 10.6 million women-owned businesses across the Nation, employing \nmore than 19 million Americans, and generating nearly $2.5 trillion in \nrevenue--indeed, they are nothing short of an economic powerhouse!\n  Part of our job is to make sure that Government programs continue to \nhelp small and women-owned businesses. We can't afford to ignore, or \nreduce, the extraordinary contributions America's business women are \nmaking to our economy, our society, and our future.\n  The Small Business Administration's Women's Business Center has been \na tremendous resource to women-owned businesses across the Nation. \nSince the program was introduced through the Small Business Ownership \nAct of 1988, and made permanent in 1997, Congress has agreed seven \ntimes that this program is critical for women business owners. In fact, \nthe program's unique training and counseling helped clients generate \nmore than $235 million in revenue and create or retain over 6,500 jobs \nin 2003. This program clearly has a record of success, fostering job \ngrowth and providing American small businesses with the opportunity to \nthrive.\n  If we look at the centers that are achieving the greatest impact, it \nis the established centers. The results of their outreach and one-on-\none assistance has made it possible for the Small Business \nAdministration to achieve its goals as it measures the success of the \nproducts and programs offered by these centers.\n  However, 11 of our longest standing Women's Business Centers located \nin California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New \nMexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin now face the possibility of \nclosing their doors. The Federal Government has invested 10 years \nhelping to establish these centers which, in turn, have helped women-\nowned businesses start and existing businesses grow.\n  In accordance with outdated legislation, the SBA plans to award 92 \ncompetitive grants to regular and sustainable women's business centers \nin September with the fiscal year 2005 appropriations. However, our 11 \nlongest standing centers will not be eligible to compete for these \ngrants. This was not the intent of the Senate. Last Congress, the \nSenate agreed to transform the women's business center program into a \n3-year competitive grant program which is reflected in my bill, S. \n1375, The Small Business Administration's 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act of 2003. While the House failed to pass their \nversion of the bill, limited provisions of the bill were included in \nthe fiscal year 2005 Omnibus package. However, the women's business \ncenter provisions, among others, failed to make the omnibus bill and \nthis program now operates under outdated legislation.\n  This emergency legislation temporarily solves this problem and \npreserves our investment by simply making the women's sustainability \ngrant funding available for these 11 existing centers only during \nfiscal year 2005. While we must fix the funding problem in the long-\nrun, we also face a crisis today. With this legislation, existing \ncenters that have been established for the longest period of time would \nbe able to operate without disruption in funding and could continue the \nprograms and services they currently offer. Moreover, this provision \ndoes not require any additional appropriations but only reallocates \ncurrent funds.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I take great pride in the fact that my own State of \nMaine leads the way for women-owned businesses. Today, there are more \nthan 63,000 women-owned firms in Maine, employing over 75,000 Mainers \nand generating more than $9 billion in sales. We must all be committed \nto multiplying that story of success in every State in America.\n  It is our duty to ensure that Americans have the necessary resources \nto start, grow and develop a business. I am committed to resolving the \ntemporary funding crisis through this bill and I am committed to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure the long-term viability of the \nprogram for today's women entrepreneurs and those of tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 216\n\n       Whereas World War II began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi \n     Germany invaded Poland without a declaration of war and then \n     moved, following the surrender of Poland, to invade and \n     occupy Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and \n     Belgium;\n       Whereas following the premeditated invasion by Japan on the \n     United States at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, \n     the United States declared war on Japan and entered World War \n     II on the side of freedom and democracy;\n       Whereas when the fate of the free world was in jeopardy as \n     a direct result of the desire of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi \n     regime for world conquest, the servicemembers of the United \n     States Armed Forces known as the ``Greatest Generation'' \n     assumed the task of freeing the world of Nazism, fascism, and \n     tyranny;\n       Whereas more than 16,000,000 Americans served in the United \n     States Armed Forces during World War II, and millions more \n     supported the war effort at home;\n       Whereas more than 400,000 brave Americans made the ultimate \n     sacrifice during World War II in the name of freedom and in \n     defense of the ideals that the people of the United States \n     hold dear;\n       Whereas units of the United States Army, such as the 1st \n     Infantry Division known as the ``Big Red One'', the 3rd \n     Infantry Division known as the ``Rock of the Marne'', the \n     10th Armored Division known as the ``Tiger Division'', and \n     the ``Flying Tigers'' of the 14th Air Force, valiantly fought \n     to defeat the oppression and tyranny of the Axis Powers;\n       Whereas the great tragedy of World War II was the defining \n     event of the 20th century, when the brave men and women of \n     the United States Armed Forces fought for the common defense \n     of the United States and for the broader causes of peace and \n     freedom from tyranny throughout the world; and\n       Whereas the members of the United States Armed Forces, \n     including the ``Greatest Generation'' of World War II, made \n     sacrifices and displayed bravery and heroism in the name of \n     freedom and democracy throughout the world: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses appreciation to the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces who served during World War II, for--\n\n[[Page S9200]]\n\n       (A) the selfless service of those servicemembers to the \n     United States;\n       (B) restoring freedom to the world; and\n       (C) defeating the elements of evil and oppression;\n       (2) commends the heroism and bravery displayed by the \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who served during \n     World War II, known as the ``Greatest Generation'', in the \n     face of death and severe hardship, and honors those \n     servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice;\n       (3) proudly honors the members of the ``Greatest \n     Generation'' on the occasion of the forthcoming 60th \n     anniversary of the end of World War II, and in conjunction \n     with the ``Greatest Generation Homecoming Weekend'' in \n     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;\n       (4) proudly honors all members of the United States Armed \n     Forces, past and present, who defend the freedom of the \n     United States in times of both war and peace; and\n       (5) commends the participants of the ``Greatest Generation \n     Homecoming Weekend'' that takes place from September 2, 2005 \n     through September 5, 2005 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9200-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL MARINA DAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 198\n\n       Whereas, on May 9, 1945, Europe declared victory over the \n     oppression of the Nazi regime;\n       Whereas, Poland and other countries in Central, Eastern, \n     and Southern Europe soon fell under the oppressive control of \n     the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas for decades the people of Poland struggled \n     heroically for freedom and democracy against that oppression;\n       Whereas, in June 1979, Pope John Paul II, the former \n     Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, returned to Poland, his homeland, and \n     exhorted his countrymen to ``be not afraid'' of the Communist \n     regime;\n       Whereas, in 1980, the Solidarity Trade Union (known in \n     Poland as ``NSZZ Solidarnosc'') was formed in Poland under \n     the leadership of Lech Walesa and during the 1980s the \n     actions of its leadership and members sparked a great social \n     movement committed to promoting fundamental human rights, \n     democracy, and the independence of Poland from the Soviet \n     Union (known as the ``Solidarity Movement'');\n       Whereas, in July and August of 1980, workers in Poland in \n     the shipyards of Gdansk and Szczecin, led by Lech Walesa and \n     other leaders of the Solidarity Trade Union, went on strike \n     to demand greater political freedom;\n       Whereas that strike was carried out in a peaceful and \n     orderly manner;\n       Whereas, in August 1980, the Communist Government of Poland \n     yielded to the 21 demands of the striking workers, including \n     the release of all political prisoners, the broadcasting of \n     religious services on television and radio, and the right to \n     establish independent trade unions;\n       Whereas the Communist Government of Poland introduced \n     martial law in December 1981 in an attempt to block the \n     growing influence of the Solidarity Movement;\n       Whereas the support of the Polish-American community was \n     essential and crucial for the Solidarity Movement to survive \n     and remain active during that difficult time;\n       Whereas the people of the United States were greatly \n     supportive of the efforts of the people of Poland to rid \n     themselves of an oppressive government and people in the \n     United States lit candles in their homes on Christmas Eve \n     1981, to show their solidarity with the people of Poland who \n     were suffering under martial law;\n       Whereas Lech Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1983 for continuing his struggle for freedom in Poland;\n       Whereas the Solidarity Movement persisted underground \n     during the period when martial law was imposed in Poland and \n     emerged in April 1989 as a powerful national movement;\n       Whereas, in February 1989, the Communist Government of \n     Poland agreed to conduct roundtable talks with leaders of the \n     Solidarity Movement;\n       Whereas such talks led to the holding of elections for the \n     National Assembly of Poland in June 1989 in which nearly all \n     open seats were won by candidates supported by the Solidarity \n     Movement, and led to the election of Poland's first Prime \n     Minister during the post-war era who was not a member of the \n     Communist party, Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki;\n       Whereas, the Solidarity Movement ended communism in Poland \n     without bloodshed and inspired Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and \n     other nations to do the same, and the activities of its \n     leaders and members were part of the historic series of \n     events that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, \n     1989;\n       Whereas, on November 15, 1989, Lech Walesa's historic \n     speech before a joint session of Congress, beginning with the \n     words ``We the people'', stirred a standing ovation from the \n     Members of Congress;\n       Whereas, on December 9, 1989, Lech Walesa was elected \n     President of Poland; and\n       Whereas there is a bond of friendship between the United \n     States and Poland, which is a close and invaluable United \n     States ally, a contributing partner in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO), a reliable partner in the war on \n     terrorism, and a key contributor to international efforts in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan: Now, therefore, let it be\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) declares August 31, 2005, to be Solidarity Day in the \n     United States to recognize the 25th anniversary of the \n     establishment in Poland of the Solidarity Trade Union (known \n     in Poland as the ``NSZZ Solidarnosc''), the first free and \n     independent trade union established in the Soviet-dominated \n     countries of Europe;\n       (2) honors the people of Poland who risked their lives to \n     restore liberty in Poland and to return Poland to the \n     democratic community of nations; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to remember \n     the struggle and sacrifice of the people of Poland and that \n     the results of that struggle contributed to the fall of \n     communism and the ultimate end of the Cold War.\n\n                              S. Res. 201\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as AD/HD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological \n     disorder, affecting both children and adults, that can \n     significantly interfere with an individual's ability to \n     regulate activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to \n     tasks in developmentally appropriate ways;\n       Whereas AD/HD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas AD/HD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 percent to 7 percent \n     (2,000,000) of young school-age children and an estimated 4 \n     percent (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and \n     socioeconomic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies clearly indicate that AD/HD runs \n     in families and suggest that genetic inheritance is an \n     important risk factor, with between 10 and 35 percent of \n     children with AD/HD having a first-degree relative with past \n     or present AD/HD, and with approximately 50 percent of \n     parents who had AD/HD having a child with the disorder;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with AD/\n     HD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults with \n     the disorder are diagnosed and less than one-half of children \n     and adults with the disorder are receiving treatment;\n       Whereas poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by AD/HD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association (AMA), the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), \n     the American Psychological Association, the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics (AAP), the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC), and the National Institute of Mental \n     Health, among others, recognize the need for proper \n     diagnosis, education, and treatment of AD/HD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of AD/HD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes to the obstacles preventing diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n       Whereas lack of knowledge, combined with the issue of \n     stigma associated with AD/HD, has a particularly detrimental \n     effect on the diagnosis and treatment of AD/HD;\n       Whereas there is a need to educate health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper and \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of AD/HD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life for the \n     individual can be improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 14, 2005, as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (AD/HD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all people of the United States to find out \n     more about AD/HD and its supporting mental health services, \n     and to seek the appropriate treatment and support, if \n     necessary;\n\n[[Page S9202]]\n\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to-\n       (A) endeavor to raise public awareness about AD/HD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, mental health services dedicated to the purpose \n     of improving the quality of life for children and adults with \n     AD/HD; and\n       (5) calls on Federal, State and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/27/senate-section/article/S9202-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE ENGAGEMENT IN WORLD AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
