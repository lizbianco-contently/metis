Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour for debate equally divided between the managers or their \ndesignees.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for my colleagues who are in the Chamber and \nwant to speak under the half hour that is allotted to us, I will leave \ntime for them. I know Senator Leahy has a matter elsewhere, and I will \nspeak and give him the time next.\n  The committee bill that was reported from the Judiciary Committee on \na bipartisan vote is a bill that virtually all Democrats support. We \nnow are past that piece of legislation and on what we call the Martinez \nsubstitute. Virtually all Democrats support the Martinez substitute. I \nthought yesterday morning we were going today to be able to pass this \nimportant legislation. As I was walking from the caucus we had \nyesterday, Senator Tom Carper of Delaware said: I have to leave early; \nI sure hope we can get something worked out on this. That is how the \nSenate felt yesterday. I sure hoped we could work something out. But as \nthe day went on, things didn't work out as well as we had anticipated.\n  In the Senate, there are different ways of conducting filibusters. \nOne is to have people stand and talk for long periods of time. The \nother is the ability Senators have, if they wish, to filibuster by \nvirtue of amendment.\n  I made a proposal to the distinguished majority leader that we would \nhave the Judiciary Committee do the conferees and have a limited number \nof amendments and move on. Last night, Senator Frist said on the floor \nthat he would have 20 amendments and, as we know from conversations we \nhad on the floor, that was just the beginning. There would be more \namendments. These amendments, of course, would be offered by those who \noppose the Martinez legislation.\n  The majority leader said last night--and I was surprised--that he \nthought he would vote no on cloture on the amendment that he offered. \nCertainly, there could be an argument made, even though I don't think \nit is a good one, that we are going to vote against the substitute \namendment, the Specter legislation, as a result of the fact that the \nminority filed a cloture motion. That is not the case here. The cloture \nmotion that is pending now was filed by the majority leader, he says, \nbecause no amendments have been offered. Why would we reward those who \ndon't like the bill? Why would we reward those who want to kill this \nbill by amendments?\n  I would hope that night has brought change, that night has turned to \nday, and that there will be those on a bipartisan basis who will \nsupport this invocation of cloture. That would be the right thing to \ndo. To do so takes courage, I know, but it would be the right thing to \ndo.\n  Virtually all Democrats support the Martinez legislation. This bill \nis supported by wide-ranging groups: the Catholic bishops, the Chamber \nof Commerce, civil rights groups, human rights groups, La Raza--on and \non with groups that support this legislation. This legislation is good \nlegislation, national security, real security, border security. It \ngives guest workers the opportunity to come to America with dignity. \nTwelve million people would no longer have to live in the shadows.\n  Franklin Roosevelt said it a lot better than I could in 1938, when he \nsaid: My fellow immigrants, remember always that all of us, and you and \nI especially, are descended from immigrants.\n  General George Washington, in a letter in 1783, said:\n  The bosom of America is open to receive not only the opulent and \nrespectable stranger but the oppressed and persecuted of all nations \nand religions whom we shall welcome to a participation of all our \nrights and privileges if, by decent and proprietary conduct, they \nappear to merit the enjoyment.\n  That is what this is all about--Franklin Roosevelt, George \nWashington. Let's vote for cloture and move on, have a day of \ncelebration.\n  I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Vermont, the distinguished \nranking member of this committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic \nleader. I thank him for his statement. I also wish to commend him for \nthe work he has done, both he and the distinguished deputy leader, in \ntrying to bring us to this point. I know how hard the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the committee, has \nworked to pass a bill. I have been proud to work with him.\n  I was encouraged this week that the majority leader and other Senate \nRepublicans moved in our direction--a good direction--by recognizing \nthat we need a solution to the problems posed by having millions of \nundocumented\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\nimmigrants inside our borders. Many of us believe that immigration \nreform, to have any chance to succeed, needs to be comprehensive, with \nstrong enforcement of border security matched with fair and effective \nsteps to bring millions of hard-working people out of the shadows and \nprovide them a path to citizenship and a full measure of America's \npromise.\n  The bill now being proposed by the majority leader is not as \ncomprehensive or as good as that produced by the Judiciary Committee in \nthat it leaves many among us out of the equation and may have the \nperverse effect of driving millions further underground. I thought the \nbipartisan Judiciary Committee bill represented a better balance of \nstrong enforcement of our borders with fair reforms that honored human \ndignity and American values. I will continue to work for a bill and a \nlaw that is fair to all. We all agree that it will be tough on \nsecurity, but it also has to acknowledge our American values and, above \nall, human dignity.\n  The House-passed bill and the original Frist bill were overly \npunitive. But wisely, in our deliberations in the Judiciary Committee \nand in the alternative now being proposed, we have rejected the \ncontroversial provisions that would have exposed those who provide \nhumanitarian relief, medical care, shelter, counseling, and other basic \nservices to the undocumented to possible prosecution under felony alien \nsmuggling provisions. That was a cruel, cruel amendment, and I am glad \nit is gone. You can't tell those who feed the hungry, clothe the naked, \nthose who shelter people, that they are going to become felons for \ndoing so.\n  We rejected the proposal to criminalize mere presence in an \nundocumented status in the United States, which would trap people in a \npermanent underclass. Those provisions understandably sparked \nnationwide protests and are being viewed as anti-Hispanic and anti-\nimmigrant. They are inconsistent with American values. As one who is \nonly one generation from immigrant grandparents, I am glad we removed \nthose.\n  I fear that the arbitrary categorization of people in the current \nproposal is not fair to all. I would not want us to set bureaucratic \nhurdles and arbitrary timeframes that will serve negatively to continue \nan underclass in American and drive people underground. The purpose of \nthe path to citizenship is to bring people into the sunshine of \nAmerican life and into law-abiding status so that they abide by all our \nlaws. That will allow our enforcement resources to be focused on real \nsecurity concerns. Sadly, those across the aisle have refused to \nproceed on the bipartisan Committee bill so this alternative proposal \nis an effort to garner additional support from the Majority Leader and \nothers but it comes at some expense. He opposed the Specter-Leahy-Hagel \namendment but now supports the Frist amendment, which he graciously \ncalled the Hagel-Martinez amendment. The Majority Leader called it a \n``negotiated compromise.''\n  I was not a party to those negotiations. Given the successful \nRepublican opposition and obstruction of the bipartisan Committee bill, \nI have now joined in efforts to improve the Frist amendment and the \nHagel-Martinez amendment. I am working with Senator Obama and Senator \nDurbin to improve that measure.\n  I do not in any way disparage the efforts of my friends from Nebraska \nand Florida. I appreciate their efforts. I know that they had indicated \ntheir support for the bipartisan Committee bill. In fact, a majority of \nSenators supported the bipartisan Committee bill. Rather, they are \ntrying to point a way toward the best possible legislation that can \nachieve not just a majority but a supermajority of support within the \ncurrent Senate.\n  I will support the majority leader's motion for cloture on the motion \nto commit. That will bring the Frist amendment before the Senate, and I \nwill continue to work for bipartisan, comprehensive, smart, tough, and \nfair immigration reform.\n  I was surprised to hear the Majority Leader say last night that he \nwas considering opposing his own motion. We should have invoked cloture \nyesterday on the bipartisan Committee bill. I hope that we do so today \non the Frist motion on the Frist amendment.\n  I appreciate that for those undocumented immigrants who can prove \nthey have been in the U.S. for more than five years, the path to \ncitizenship that we voted out of Committee would still govern. To earn \nstatus and eventual citizenship, the immigrant must undergo background \nchecks, work, pay taxes, pay fines, and learn English. That is not an \namnesty program. The Republican Leader has now reversed his position \nand supports those provisions. That is progress. In addition, the bill \nwe will be considering continues to contain the Ag Jobs bill and the \nDREAM Act, and the amendments the Senate voted to add to the bipartisan \nCommittee bill, including the Bingaman enforcement amendment and the \nAlexander citizenship amendment.\n  Those undocumented immigrants who have been here for two to five \nyears would, under the provisions of the new bill, have to leave the \nU.S. and seek approval to return and to work under a temporary status \nfor four years. They could eventually seek legal permanent status, \nprobably after a total of 8 to 10 years, and only after those who have \n``seniority'' to them by being in the group that has been in the U.S. \nfor more than five years. Thus, this new grouping of people is treated \nunder a combination of rules drawn from a bill introduced by the senior \nSenator from Nebraska and the Kyl-Cornyn bill. Perhaps those who \nnegotiated this scheme will garner the support of Senator Kyl and \nSenator Cornyn and others with whom they have been working.\n  At least, this new categorization preserves a potential pathway to \nregularized status. The test will be whether it is made so onerous by \nits implementation that those in this designated category will come \nforward at all. We will all need to work to make that a reality so that \nthey know that we value them, their families and their hard work.\n  The most recent arrivals, those immigrants after January 1, 2004, are \noffered no special treatment. I was concerned about similar aspects of \nthe Committee bill. There are no incentives to come forward. They are \nmerely told to leave the U.S. and apply for one of the limited visas \nthat will be authorized. They could try to come back as legal temporary \nworkers.\n  If we do not, I worry that the Majority Leader's announcement of a \n``breakthrough'' will have the unintended effect of having created a \nfalse impression and false hopes. I commend him for changing his \nposition over the course of the last week. I am delighted that he and \nothers who had been opposing comprehensive immigration reform with a \npath to citizenship are joining us in the effort. But an announcement \nis not the enactment of a new law. I urge people, especially the \nundocumented, to remember that. We are still a long way from enacting \nfair, comprehensive and humane immigration reform. None has yet passed \nthe Senate. And certainly fair immigration reform has not passed the \nHouse. The cruelest joke of all would be to raise expectations and \nfalse hopes by premature talk of a solution when none has yet been \nachieved, especially if it remains elusive and that promise is not \nfulfilled.\n  So while I am glad that some Republicans have dropped their \nopposition to establishing a path to citizenship for many, I worry that \nmany others may be left behind. I also urge everyone concerned about \nthe lives of those who are undocumented to remain cautious and focused \non enacting a law, and on what it will provide in its final form. It \nwould be wrong to just pass a bill that ends up serving as a false \npromise to those who yearn to be part of the promise of a better life \nthat is America.\n  Our work on immigration reform is a defining moment in our history. \nWe are writing laws that will determine people's lives and what it is \nthat America stands for. I continue to urge the Senate to rise to the \noccasion and act as the conscience of the Nation. I will continue to \nwork on immigration reform so that the laws we enact will be in keeping \nwith the best the Senate can offer the Nation and the best that America \ncan offer to immigrants. I hope that our work will be something that \nwould make my immigrant grandparents proud, and a product that will \nmake our children and grandchildren proud.\n  There will be more rallies around the country next week by thousands \nof people in cities across the United\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\nStates. They know what we Senators now know--our immigration system is \nbroken and we need to fix it. We need to fix it with effective, \ncomprehensive reforms. The question is still open whether the Senate is \ncommitted to making real immigration reform.\n  I have said from the outset that Democratic Senators could not pass a \ngood immigration bill on our own. With fewer than 50 Democratic \nSenators, we will need the support of Republican Senators if the Senate \nis to make progress on this important matter.\n\n  The majority leader had often spoken of allowing two weeks for Senate \ndebate of this important matter. We now approach the end of that work \nperiod. I had hoped we would be farther along. When the Senate did not \ncomplete work on the lobbying reform bill on schedule--because \nRepublicans refused to vote on the port security amendment--it cut into \ntime for this immigration debate. When the majority leader decided to \nbegin the debate with a day of discussion of the Frist bill, we lost \nmore time. We were left then with one week, not two. We have lost time \nthat could have been spent debating and adopting amendments when some \nRepublicans withheld consent from utilizing our usual procedures over \nthe last days. We have endured the false and partisan charges of \nobstruction came from the other side. We have experienced seemingly \nendless quorum calls without debate or action.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his efforts. He has been working \nfor a comprehensive, realistic and fair immigration bill. We still are. \nI regret that over the last several days some tried to make this into a \npartisan fight. I hope that we are now able to draw back together in a \nbipartisan effort to pass a good bill that becomes a good law.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as soon as the distinguished chairman \nfinishes his remarks, I will yield 8 minutes to Senator Durbin, and \nfollowing his statement, 8 minutes to the ranking member, Senator \nKennedy. If a Republican comes in between, that is fine with us. So 8 \nminutes to both Senators Durbin and Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Before the distinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy, \nleaves the floor, I would like his attention for a minute. He has to \nleave because he has other commitments. First, I congratulate him on \nthe work he has done on this bill. I congratulate him on the work he \nhas done in his 31 years in the Senate generally, but especially in the \nlast 15 months, when he and I have worked together on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I wanted to say this while he was still on the floor.\n  As chairman, I am committed to make this immigration bill the No. 1 \npriority of the Judiciary Committee. When we are unable to complete \naction on this bill today, as it now appears, I want everyone to know \nwhen we come back after the recess, this is our No. 1 priority. We \nsucceeded in the Judiciary Committee, where everybody thought we would \nfail. Senator Kennedy was on the committee and Senator Durbin was on \nthe committee. I mention them because they are in the Chamber. We were \ngiven an impossible deadline, but we met it. We met it by having a \nmarathon markup on a Monday, which is unheard of around here--\nespecially a Monday after a recess. We did it by voting 57 times. We \nhad in that marathon markup 14 rollcall votes and 43 voice votes.\n  We had a lot of tough votes, but we finished the bill and we reported \nit to the Senate. We are going to go back to work on this bill because \nif the full Senate cannot find the answer, then the Judiciary Committee \nis going to find the answer. We are going to return to the floor of the \nSenate a bill which I believe the Senate will find acceptable, and we \nwill set forth procedures that I think the full Senate will find \nacceptable. That is the commitment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield a moment on that, I have \ncommended the Senator before for his indefatigable leadership. He \nworked extraordinarily hard. I commit to the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania that on the Democratic side we will continue to work with \nhim on any amount of time he needs in committee. Our committee \ndemonstrated that we can produce a bipartisan bill. We will continue to \nwork with him in any way necessary to finish this. I agree with him \nthat it is important. On this of the aisle, we will continue that work.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished ranking member.\n  Addressing the situation generally as to what we face now on the \nimmigration bill, I think it is most unfortunate, really unacceptable, \nthat the compromise arrangement has fallen through. I believe this \nlegislation is vital for America's interests, vital for our national \nsecurity interests, vital for our economic interests, and vital for our \nhumanitarian interests.\n  The agreement has been decimated, has fallen through, because of \npartisan politics. Regrettably, partisan politics plays too large a \nrole on both sides of the aisle, with Democrats and Republicans, and \nthere is more concern about political advantage in this situation--as \nit is in many situations--than there is on public policy and the public \nwelfare. The procedures for not allowing tough votes, regrettably--that \npractice has been undertaken by both Democrats and Republicans. I have \nbeen in the Senate for 25 years now, and this has been a repeated \npractice which I have noted at least from the past decade and a half. \nIt has occurred even beyond that period of time. Both the Democratic \nand Republican leaders--minority leaders, but mostly leaders--have been \nin the position to do what is called ``fill the tree.''\n\n  Senate procedures are arcane and complicated. I would not begin to \ntry to explain them now. But the conclusion is that you can use the \nrules to avoid having votes come up, if you want to do it. It is called \nfilling the tree. Republicans on this immigration bill have been \nstymied from offering amendments. But at the same time, on other bills, \non prior days, Democrats had been stymied from offering amendments. So \nit is a matter of bipartisan blame.\n  But what is happening is that the public interests are being damaged. \nA very similar situation occurred last year on the filibusters. The \nDemocrats filibustered President Bush's judicial nominees in \nretaliation for tactics employed by Republicans to stymie President \nClinton's nominees from having votes, from coming out of committee or, \nonce out of committee, from having votes on the Senate floor. That \nimpasse, that confrontation on judges, almost threatened to destroy a \nvery vital part of the institution of the Senate, and that is the right \nof unlimited debate. Where the filibusters were used, in my view, \ninappropriately, consideration was given to changing the rules of the \nSenate to change the number of Senators necessary to cut off debate \nfrom 60, which is the current rule, to 51. Fortunately, we were able to \navoid that confrontation.\n  Now as I said to the distinguished minority leader in a private \nconversation, that reason is going to have to prevail, and Democrats \nand Republicans in the Senate are going to have to come together and \nstop this reprehensible practice of denying votes. We are sent here to \nvote. When a bill comes to the floor, as we reported the immigration \nbill out of committee, other Members are entitled to offer amendments \nto see if they can persuade 51 Senators to vote their way or, if \ncloture is necessary, to cut off debate, to see if they can get 60 \nSenators to vote their way, and then to change a committee bill.\n  The committee doesn't speak for the Senate. The committee makes a \nrecommendation. The Senate must speak for itself, in accordance with \nour procedures, with 51 votes to pass amendments or a bill, or 60 votes \nif it involves cutting off debate. But it is totally an unacceptable \npractice to stymie a bill by refusing to give votes. That is what has \nhappened here.\n  In the negotiations between Senator Frist and Senator Reid yesterday, \nSenator Reid said the maximum number of votes that would be permitted \nwas three. I don't think he was concrete on three, but he wasn't going \nto go much beyond three--perhaps, as a suggestion was made, there might \nbe a compromise for six. But on the Republican side, Senators wanted to \noffer a minimum of 20 amendments. An arrangement could not be agreed \nupon and, obviously, Senator Frist could not accept three votes, or \neven six votes. The position was taken to avoid having Democratic \nSenators take tough votes. In committee, Republicans and Democrats took \ntough\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\nvotes--57 votes, with 14 rollcall votes, during a marathon session on \nthat Monday on the markup.\n  It is an open secret that there are many people who do not want to \nhave an immigration bill. I think it is a fair comment--although \nsubject to being refuted--that there is advantage for the Democrats to \nhave only the bill of the House of Representatives before the public, \nwhich provides only for border security, and which doesn't take care of \nthe 11 million undocumented aliens. That bill has provoked massive \nrallies--500,000 people in Los Angeles, 20,000 people reportedly in \nPhoenix, and more rallies are coming. The view is--and I think it is \naccurate--that it is very harmful to the Republican Party to have the \nHispanics in America angry with the Republican position, as taken by \nthe House of Representatives, to have only border security and not have \na program to accommodate the 11 million undocumented aliens.\n  The Senate bill, of course, directs our attention to that bill, and \nthe Judiciary Committee bill has a very rational, humanitarian, \nsensible approach--not amnesty, because there is not forgiveness, \nbecause these undocumented aliens have to pay a fine, have to pay back \ntaxes, have to learn English, have to work for 6 years; they have to \nundertake many conditions in order to be on the citizenship track. With \nrefinements put in by the Judiciary Committee, they are at the end of \nthe line.\n  Then, in order to achieve an accommodation, changes were made on \nsuggestions by Senator Hagel and Senator Martinez to modify that \nproposal, treating those who have been in the country more than 5 years \ndifferently from those who have been here less than 5 years. Frankly, I \npreferred the Judiciary Committee bill; I preferred our bill without \namendments. But people have a right to make amendments. I was prepared \nto accept the compromise that brought into play the ideas of Senators \nHagel and Martinez so we would have a bill. The issue that a legislator \nfaces is not whether it is a bill he would prefer but whether the bill \nis better than the current system. In my mind, there is no doubt that \nhad we moved forward with the compromise that was struck yesterday, it \nwould be a vast improvement over the current system. It would secure \nthe borders. It would provide a rational way to handle the 11 million \nundocumented aliens. It would provide a rational way to handle the \nguest worker situation. And it should have gone forward. It has not \ngone forward because there is political advantage for the Democrats not \nto have an immigration bill, not to take tough votes, to have the \nopprobrium of the House bill, which is objected to by the Hispanic \npopulation, illustrated by the massive rallies, to have that as the \nRepublican position. Contrasted with what would have happened had the \nSenate produced a bill which was bipartisan, which was sponsored by \nRepublicans, then the opprobrium, the edge would have been taken from \nthe House bill.\n\n  So we are going to leave here, by all indications, without having \ncompleted action on the immigration bill or without having come to a \npoint where we would have a definitive list of amendments, to have an \nagreement that on our return from the recess we could, in short order, \nfinish the bill. That is totally unacceptable.\n  Again, I emphasize that the partisanship exists on both sides of the \naisle. When I say the Democrats are wrong on this bill to avoid hard \nvotes, I say simultaneously that we Republicans have been wrong in the \npast to deny Democrats votes on amendments which they wanted to offer. \nThe distinction has been made by some of my colleagues--and I think it \nis accurate--that they have been denied votes in most situations on \nmatters where they are nongermane to the bill.\n  Senator Reid mentioned stem cells, and I agree, we ought to resolve \nthe stem cell issue. I don't know if there was ever a stem cell vote \noffered in a way which would be nongermane, but we ought not take up an \nissue such as stem cells on the Transportation bill, for example.\n  There have been amendments offered by Democrats which were germane. \nThey wanted to offer amendments which were germane, which have been \ndenied.\n  It is my hope that we can come together. I have already talked with \nthe distinguished Democratic leader this morning saying that we ought \nto come to some agreement that neither side will use the technicalities \nat our disposal to deny the other side votes. The Democratic leader has \nbeen very lavish in praise in supporting the work Senator Leahy and I \nhave done. That spirit of accommodation ought to be carried forward to \nthe floor of the Senate when we consider matters such as this \nimmigration bill. For the future, it is my hope that we will come \ntogether and stop this practice of denying votes to the other side.\n  Again, my commitment is to make this immigration bill the first \npriority item for the Judiciary Committee when we return after the \nEaster recess because America needs immigration legislation reform.\n  I inquire as to how much time our side has remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor weary--weary \nafter 2 weeks of working on this historic legislation, both in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and in the back rooms of the Senate Chamber \nand on the Senate floor; weary after a long, sleepless night thinking \nabout how we might have done this better; weary with the knowledge that \nwe come here this morning, having missed a historic opportunity. This \nopportunity is slipping through our hands like grains of sand.\n  It is hard to imagine that we have reached this point when one looks \nat the people of goodwill who have tried to bring this bill to passage \nand completion.\n  I first salute the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It \ntook extraordinary courage for him to vote in favor of the bipartisan \nbill which came to the floor. He stuck with it. I thought he was fair \nin the way he handled his committee, and I thought we produced a good \nwork product which I was proud to support.\n  I salute the Senator from Massachusetts who, for decades, has made \nthis cause, immigration reform, his passion. He has never given up. In \nthe weeks we have spent up to this moment, his strength has been \nremarkable.\n  On the Republican side, Senator McCain, Senator Graham, Senator \nBrownback, Senator DeWine, Senator Martinez, Senator Hagel, and so many \nothers were bound and determined to defy the critics who said we \ncouldn't come to a bipartisan agreement.\n  Yesterday, for one brief moment, one shining moment, we believed we \nhad a bipartisan agreement. Senator Martinez and Senator Hagel worked \nall night and put together an amendment, came to us on the Democratic \nside and said: Can you accept these modifications, and then can we move \nforward together? We agreed. We stood together.\n\n  I think the most dangerous place in America for a politician is the \nfront row of the St. Patrick's Day parade in the city of Chicago. I \nhave been there. I have been pushed and shoved and elbowed aside by men \nand women who follow in the grand Chicago tradition of Dick Butkus and \nBrian Urlacher. But there is a second place I recall as the most \ndangerous for politicians in America, and it was in the press gallery \nyesterday as Senators were preening and priming themselves to appear \nbefore the cameras and announce we have an agreement, we have a bill, \npushing one another aside to get to the microphone so they could \nannounce the success of our efforts.\n  I was there. I stood back and thought: There is plenty of time for \ncongratulations. Let's wait until we have done something before we \ncongratulate ourselves.\n  Sadly, 24 hours have passed. The world has turned, and things have \nchanged.\n  I stand here today uncertain about where the Republican Party of the \nUnited States of America stands on the issue of immigration. I know \nwhere the House Republicans stand. They are very clear. It is a \npunitive, mean-spirited approach to immigration, which most Republicans \nin the Senate have rejected. The idea of charging volunteers, nurses, \nand people of faith who\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\nhelp the poorest among us with a felony if one of those poor people \nhappens to be an undocumented immigrant is the ultimate. That is the \nposition of the House Republicans.\n  For the life of me, I don't know what the position of the Senate \nRepublicans is on immigration. Their leader stood before us yesterday \nand accepted this bipartisan compromise, came before the cameras and \nsaid this was his bill, too. He filed a motion so that we could limit \ndebate and move to final passage of this bill and announced last night \nthat he would vote against his own motion.\n  In the history of the United States, there was a political party \nknown as the mugwumps. They were called mugwumps because people said \nthey had their mug on one side of the face and their wump on the other. \nThat is what I see when I look at the Senate Republican caucus. Where \nare they on immigration?\n  I listened to Senator Sessions who has been open. He opposes \nimmigration reform. He has 15 amendments. He wants to stop this \nprocess, slow it down. I watch as the leadership of the Senate \nRepublican team files before the television cameras rejecting the very \ncompromise their leader has embraced. Where are they? Who are they? And \ndo they believe that the people across America, carefully following \nthis debate because their faith, their future, and their family is at \nstake, are going to ignore the obvious, that in just a few moments, a \nvote will be taken on the floor of the Senate and Senate Republicans \nwill march down and vote against the Senate Republican leader's motion?\n  When it is all said and done, the House Republicans are very clear. \nThey are opposed to immigration reform. They have taken the most \npunitive stand. But where do the Senate Republicans stand? We won't be \nable to tell after this vote. But I will tell you this: The people who \nare following this debate will know that the Senate Republicans did not \nstand for comprehensive immigration reform. There are heroes among \nthem. I have listed some of them, and I will stand by them and defend \nthem to any group because I do believe they are sincerely committed to \nimmigration reform. But when it comes to the majority of that caucus, \nwhen it comes to the leadership on that side, it is impossible to \ndivine what their position is on this critical issue.\n  The saddest part of it is this: Across America, millions of people \nare living in fear, living in the shadows, people who have come to me \nin tears because their children's future is at stake, people who have \ncome to me crying because their mothers came to this country from \nPoland years ago and never filed the right papers and are technically \nillegal. These people wanted us to do something, to achieve something \nin the Senate, and we have failed. We have failed because the Senate \nRepublican leadership will not say to its own membership: There is a \nlimit as to how far you can take us with these debilitating amendments.\n  Last night, the Senate Republican leader said all we want is about 20 \nor so amendments. With 20 amendments and second-degree amendments, we \nwould eat up a week of time just on the Republican amendments, and \nthere is no promise it would end there.\n  This was clearly a moment for the Senate Republican leader to step \nforward, not just at the microphone, but in his own caucus and say that \nwe as a party are going to be counted as to whether we are really for \nthis immigration reform.\n  I think it is time, Mr. President, that we acknowledge the obvious. \nIt is time for us as a nation to have comprehensive immigration reform \nwith enforcement--enforcement on our borders and enforcement in places \nof employment--but also to give a legal pathway to those good people \nwho want to be our fellow citizens, who want to share this dream in \nAmerica.\n  This morning we will not achieve it. And when the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee chairman tells us we will return to this bill when we get \nback from the Easter recess, I don't have much hope that we will either \nhave the time or the will to overcome what we have seen on the floor in \nthe last several days.\n  I will work, put every ounce of my strength into making it a success. \nBut as I stand here today, I think we have allowed this historic \nopportunity to escape us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois has \nconsumed 8 minutes. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is an interesting time on the floor of \nthe Senate. We just heard the most fascinating speech about \nfingerpointing I have heard in decades--fingerpointing from the other \nside that is trying to suggest they are blameless, absolutely without \nblame, because the Senate is stalled in its attempt to gain a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill.\n  This is one Republican Senator who, several years ago, stepped across \nthe aisle and stood with Senator Ted Kennedy in a clear recognition \nthat something had to be done to deal with illegal foreign nationals in \nour country in a just, reasonable, humane, and legal way.\n  To suggest that the Democratic caucus has not had conflict behind \nclosed doors over the last week is, in fact, a false statement because \ntoday we see this veneered front. To suggest that they are without \nblame because the Senate for 1 week has stood still doing nothing \nbecause they would not allow amendments on the comprehensive bill? May \nI say shame on you? I am saying that because the veneer doesn't fit. It \nis paper thin like the front page of the legislation before us.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee worked its will, and it brought forth \na bill to this floor. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best they could do? \nAbsolutely, yes. Did they work hard? You darn bet they did. Does it \nhave all the components in it that we would want for tough border \nsecurity and control to contain our borders, to secure them? It must \nhave that, and it does have that. Because I don't care how good the \nlegislation is that I think I have created with a coalition of over 500 \ngroups of Hispanics and labor and agriculture over the last 5 years, as \ngood as my legislation is, known as AgJOBS, it is not going to work if \nthe border isn't secure. You have to stop the flow of illegals, and we \ndo that. But we don't do it by pointing a finger at all of them and \nsaying: You are all felons. We cause them to earn, in the course of \nyears of hard work, the right to continue to work and, if they choose--\nif they choose--to become an American citizen by another lengthy \nprocess. Is that unfair? Is that irresponsible? It is absolutely not. \nWas that created by Republicans? Yes, it was. By Democrats? Absolutely.\n\n  So let me suggest that when the assistant minority leader stands up \nand says: No, not me, not us, not ours, that simply is not true. Yes, \nthe Republican side is conflicted. Yes, we have differences. Yes, there \nwere amendments. But those amendments, as would be the normal process \non the floor of the Senate after a bill came out of committee, have \nbeen denied by that paper-thin veneer you have just heard this morning \nfrom the other side.\n  Immigration has been and will always be a bipartisan issue. It must \nbe. It should be. Is it to our advantage to make it partisan? \nAbsolutely not. But some are now playing that game, and that in itself \nis most dangerous.\n  I will continue to work with all of my colleagues to resolve this \nissue. It is fundamentally important to America that we do.\n  Yesterday, on the floor of the Senate, I said: America, turn and look \nat yourself in your mirror, and you will find a multiethnic, a \nmultinational image. We as Americans are the phenomenal mosaic of the \nworld, and we are because we have historically had an orderly, \nresponsible immigration policy that didn't point fingers and didn't \nplay partisan politics and worked its will. I must tell you there have \nbeen and there always will be those who got here yesterday who don't \nwant those coming tomorrow. Yet America's great energy is simply that \nwe continue to bring people from around the world who become Americans \nin search of the great American dream, who live under our \nconstitutional structure, who embody it because of the new energy as a \nfree citizen they employ. It is in itself the only Nation in the world \nthat has been able to do that.\n  I say, when I am out in Idaho and around the country, is it possible \nfor you to become Japanese if you are not born one? Absolutely not. Or \nto become an Italian if you are not born one? You\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\ncan't become that. But you can become an American. Why? Because this \ngreat country was never one nationality, never one religion; it was the \nplace the world came to find freedom and to be able to use its \nindividual energies underneath the framework of a constitutional system \nthat established laws.\n  What are we attempting to do here today? We are attempting to clarify \na law, to strengthen a law, to make sure that the wonderful process we \nhave seen throughout our history continues to be orderly and just and \nresponsible.\n  Who is to blame here? The U.S. Senate, the Congress of the United \nStates, when, in 1986, they passed a law about immigration, but they \ndidn't recognize in doing so that they were creating a natural magnet \nand they didn't control the border, dominantly to our south; and then \nagain in 1996 we did the same thing and we didn't control the border. \nThis great economic engine of ours became the magnet for the \ndowntrodden to come to work, to earn a little money, to improve \nthemselves. We took advantage of that, hopefully in a positive way, \nhopefully in a humane way--not always, but we did take advantage of it. \nThen, after 9/11, we awakened to this phenomenal reality that there \nwere millions in our country who were illegal, and some of them were \nbad guys bent to do us harm. Now we are playing political games on the \nfloor as to who is on first and who is on second on this issue. Shame \non us. Because the veneer on the other side is just that: paper thin.\n  This has been and will remain a bipartisan issue, it is an American \nissue, and it is responsible for this Senate to deal with it. It is \nright and proper under our rules that if someone has an amendment in \ndisagreement to what I have done--and now I see my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, who worked with me and introduced into \nthe committee mark a very valuable component as it relates to American \nagriculture. We didn't play the partisan game. We came together because \nshe has in her State and in the great San Joaquin Valley, which is, \nwithout dispute, the greatest agricultural valley in the world, a true \nneed to stabilize and build a legal workforce; and in Idaho, at the \npeak of our labor season, I have anywhere from 25,000 to 30,000 \nillegals. She has more illegals in one county in California working \nthan I have in my entire State. Still, Senator Feinstein and I \nunderstand one thing very appropriately: that what we do must be legal, \nthat American agriculture cannot build its strength on an illegal \nfoundation, and it knows it, too. That is why we have worked with them \nto solve this problem.\n\n  We think that within the committee bill, there is a solution. There \nare some on my side and on the other side who probably disagree with \nthat, and there are amendments over here that would change what Senator \nFeinstein and I have proposed, and that is within the committee mark. I \nthink I can defeat those amendments. I am certainly willing to debate \nthem. It would be appropriate under the rules of the Senate that some \nof those amendments would be offered, but that has been denied. I am \ndisappointed in that.\n  I hope that over the course of the next 2 weeks, calm heads will \nprevail. I hope the idea of finger-pointing goes away. We all have a \nresponsibility here, not only to our home States but to our Nation, to \ndevelop a comprehensive immigration reform policy to secure our borders \nfor the sake of our Nation's security. That is what this Senate has \nattempted to do, and that is what we are now being denied. I don't \nbelieve that is the appropriate position for any of us.\n  Immigration reform has been--let me repeat--and will always be and \nmust be a comprehensive approach, a bipartisan issue where we work \ntogether to resolve what is in itself a major national issue of the \nday. Our citizens have asked that we do this. While they are divided by \nour effort in every way, we attempt to bring together that division in \nwhat we hope is a comprehensive, responsible, legal approach that first \nembodies national security and secondly, and as importantly, though, \nrepresents a balance for our economy, a reasonable and responsible \napproach toward humanity for those who come to work and for those who \nwant to be citizens. In my opinion, that is a responsible position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Chair tell me when I have 2 minutes remaining, \nplease?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at this stage of the whole consideration \nof immigration reform, I wish to mention my friend and colleague, \nSenator McCain, whom I have had the good opportunity to work with--I \nhave worked with many others but particularly with Senator McCain over \nthe last 3 years--in terms of developing a comprehensive approach on \nthis issue.\n  There was a bipartisan group that came together, including members of \nour Judiciary Committee and people who had a particular interest who \nwere outside of our committee. I am very grateful to them and the \nchairman of our committee, Senator Specter, and, as always, a valued \nfriend and also a leader, Senator Leahy. I thank my own leader, Senator \nReid, for all of his good work and counsel and advice. The Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, and Senators Salazar, Menendez, Lieberman, and \nObama have all been good supporters during this period of time.\n  On the other side, Senators Graham, Brownback, DeWine, Martinez, and \nHagel have worked very closely with us.\n  Senator Feinstein has been a person of enormous knowledge, \nunderstanding, and awareness of the range of immigration issues, with \nvery special attention to California, which presents such challenges. \nShe has not only been in this debate and discussion an extraordinary \nally, but to any debate and discussion on immigration and immigration \nreform, she brings a special dimension. She worked with Senator Craig \nin a very strong, bipartisan way in the initial proposal Senator McCain \nand I introduced. We recognized that the AgJOBS bill was enormously \nimportant. It had a few different approaches, but rather than making \nthis issue more complicated, we did not include it. We welcomed it, but \nwe had the leadership of Senator Feinstein and Senator Craig.\n  So this has been a bipartisan effort in trying to bring about \nimmigration reform. I will not review the very powerful and strong \narguments about the border being broken and the need for our focus and \nattention on the border, about our national security interests and \nissues in trying to get it right, and about considering who comes to \nthe United States and who does not come. As to our sense of humanity, I \nwill speak about that for just a few minutes, in terms of how we are \ngoing to treat those who have come here and worked hard, played by the \nrules, who are devoted to their families and their religion, and who \njoin the Armed Forces of our country and serve nobly.\n  So I rise this morning recognizing that the Senate has failed to \nadopt urgently needed immigration reform, and in doing so, we failed in \nour duty to our Nation and our democracy and our American people. We \nonly make progress on issues of civil rights and immigration when we \nhave bipartisanship. We haven't had a great deal of bipartisanship over \nthe recent past. We certainly did on this issue, and that is why it is \ndoubly disappointing and sorrowful that we have missed the opportunity \nat this time. I believe we also failed our immigrant heritage and the \n11 million undocumented workers and families who looked to us for hope.\n\n  Clearly, the obstacles to progress are many, but for those who are \ncommitted to immigration reform, this debate certainly is not over. We \nwill continue, if not today, then tomorrow and in the days ahead \nbecause the battle must go on.\n  As one who has been in the trenches on this issue since I first came \nto the U.S. Senate over 40 years ago and who has been a part of this \neffort to try to put into perspective the enormous magnet of America to \npeople who look to it with hope and opportunity and progress and those \nwho understand that we have to do this in an orderly and rational and \nreasonable and thoughtful way, there is always tension. But we are \nproudly a nation of immigrants, and I certainly believe we have lost an \nimportant chance and opportunity to make important progress on this \nissue.\n\n[[Page S3354]]\n\n  What is at stake is not just our security but our humanity as well. \nWe can't set that aside. We vote today on our security but also on our \nhumanity. We cast a vote on what Congress will do about Sheila, an \nundocumented immigrant originally from Cork, Ireland, who has lived on \nCape Cod for the last 10 years. She left Ireland due to the economic \ndepression. Now her whole life is here in the United States. Her \ncitizen brother is fighting in Iraq. But upon petitioning for her, he \nfound he had a 15- to 20-year wait. Sheila listened to her \ngrandfather's funeral through a cell phone because she wasn't able to \ntravel to Ireland. A talented musician, she has worked and paid taxes \nfor the past decade as a carpet cleaner and a secretary.\n  We vote today about what to do about William, who came to \nMassachusetts 14 years ago from Guatemala to make a better life for his \nfamily. He is a factory worker who has paid taxes for the past 14 \nyears. He has a 7-year-old son, David, with cerebral palsy. David is \nseverely blind, disabled, and can't walk. William is his sole provider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Chair would remind the \nSenator he has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am reminded now, in these last moments, \nCardinal Mahony, the Archbishop of Los Angeles, has been a courageous \nvoice on these issues: Now is a historic moment for our country. We \nneed to come together and enact immigration reform that protects our \nnational security and upholds our basic human rights and dignity. That \nis the challenge before us.\n  Fifty years ago President Kennedy wrote a book called ``A Nation of \nImmigrants.'' In this book--I will just mention a very brief part--he \nwrites:\n\n       In just over 350 years, a nation of nearly 200 million \n     people has grown up, populated almost entirely by persons who \n     either came from other lands or whose forefathers came from \n     other lands. As President Franklin D. Roosevelt reminded a \n     convention of the Daughters of the American Revolution, \n     ``Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I \n     especially, are descended from immigrants and \n     revolutionists.''\n       As Walt Whitman said,\n       ``These States are the amplest poem, Here is not merely a \n     nation but a teeming Nation of Nations.''\n       To know America, then, it is necessary to understand this \n     peculiarly American social revolution. It is necessary to \n     know why over 42 million people gave up their settled lives \n     to start anew in a strange land. We must know how they met \n     the new land and how it met them, and, most important, we \n     must know what these things mean for our present and for our \n     future.\n\n  Those words are as alive today as they were at that time. The \nchallenge is here. We want to give assurances to those who have given \nus great support over this period of time that we are in the battle to \nthe end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am yielding 1 minute of my leader time to \nSenator Feinstein and 1 minute of my leader time to Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer these words on behalf of \nSenator Boxer, my friend and colleague, and myself. Senator Craig said \nit correctly. Senator Boxer and I have more illegal people in one \ncounty than most Senators have in their entire State. Therefore, what \nhappens here is of serious consequence for the people of California and \nfor us as well.\n  We are both going to vote for this motion to commit. We are going to \nvote for it with the hope that the ensuing weeks are going to enable \nsome parts of it to be worked out more clearly.\n  I serve on Judiciary. I serve on the Immigration subcommittee. The \nbeauty of the original McCain-Kennedy legislation was that once you \naccepted that approach, you accepted an approach of balance which was \nsimple and which was able to be carried out.\n  My concern is by developing the three tiers of individuals, as the \nMartinez plan does, that you create a much more complicated scenario in \nterms of enforcement and therefore run the risk that it cannot be \ncarried out well, particularly for those here for less than 2 years--\nwho are in the millions. They simply disappear into the fabric, once \nagain, of America, and you have the same problem all over again.\n  I hope during the 2 weeks cool minds will prevail and that we will be \nable to work on this legislation further. We have been on rather a \nforced march, a forced march in Judiciary to mark up a bill. There have \nbeen more than a half dozen guest worker plans in committee. It has \nbeen a difficult and complicated path.\n  I urge that we come together as one body, that we work together as \none body. I think the lives to be affected by what we do are perhaps \nmore deeply affected than with virtually any other piece of \nlegislation. Both Senator Boxer and I offer our time and our energy to \ntry to help in this.\n  We will vote yes on cloture. It is our hope a majority of this body \nwill do so also.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 20 minutes on \nimmigration.\n  Immersed in the routines of daily life, many people don't make an \nextra effort to track legislation as it winds through Congress. It \nusually takes an issue that hits close to home before it motivates \npeople to take notice.\n  This issue has hit home to many. We have dived into a very passionate \nand emotional debate in the U. S. Senate. Our country was founded by \nimmigrants, and continues to be a Nation of immigrants. We have \nbenefited from the achievements of many new residents. And, today, \npeople in foreign lands want to be a part of this great country.\n  Generation after generation tirelessly pursues the American Dream. We \nshould feel privileged that people love our country and want to become \nAmericans. We are a wonderful nation, and it is evident by the number \nof people who want to come here.\n  But it is hard to empathize with those who thumb their noses at the \nrule of law. Estimates say more than 11 million undocumented immigrants \nalready live in the country. They deliberately bypassed the proper \nchannels and broke our laws to enter the country.\n  We are a nation of laws. Our country was founded on the rule of law. \nAnd now our welcome mat is being trampled on.\n  I am a member of the Judiciary Committee, and I was a part of the 5-\nweek markup session. I voted against the committee bill. But I think we \nmade great strides on the border security and interior enforcement \ntitles.\n  I supported amendments to provide more authority and resources to our \nState and local law enforcement. One of my amendments increased the \nnumber of ICE agents we have in each State. I supported amendments \ndealing with expedited removal and increased detention space.\n  We enhanced border security and increased our manpower to patrol the \nborder. We reformed the L visa program and the Temporary Protected \nStatus program. We addressed the problem with countries which don't \ntake back their illegal citizens by denying them visas.\n  We did a lot of positive things. But these reforms will mean nothing \nif an amnesty in sheep's clothing goes forward.\n  Some say that our enforcement-only approach in 1996 didn't work. Let \nme remind my colleagues that the 1996 bill contained measures that \nstill have not been implemented. The best example is the entry-exit \nsystem. It is not fully operational because Congress and our \nbureaucrats keep delaying its implementation.\n  The compromise before us may contain enforcement measures, but they \nmean nothing if Congress and the administration don't make the \ncommitment to follow through. And our strong enforcement measures are \nworthless if we pardon every illegal alien.\n  I was here in 1986. I voted for the amnesty during the Reagan years. \nI know now that it was a big mistake. I have been here long enough to \nknow the consequences of rewarding illegal behavior.\n  Let me take a moment to raise some concerns about the compromise \nbefore us.\n  The compromise provides for a three-tier system. It puts illegal \naliens into three categories. Those who have been here for 5 years or \nmore automatically get a glide path to citizenship. Those who have been \nhere for 2 to 5 years\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\nhave to go home--at some point in the future--and re-enter through a \nlegal channel. Those who have been here for less than 24 months are \nillegal aliens, and we assume that they will return to their home \ncountry.\n  Some have estimated that there are 7.7 to 8.5 million illegal aliens \nwho have been here for more than 5 years. That is more than 75 percent \nof the illegal population. But that is not all. The compromise says \nthat the family of the illegal alien--their spouses and children--can \nalso apply. It doesn't say that their family has to be in this country. \nIn fact, those back in their home countries are now getting a free pass \nto cross the border. They, too, are on their way to a citizenship.\n  Those in the second tier who are required to go home and re-enter \nthrough a legal channel won't go home. Why would they if their \nneighbors are getting citizenship? They will hold out for their reward. \nThey will wait for Congress to pass another amnesty bill. We are \nsending a bad signal. We are saying some can get amnesty and some \ncannot.\n  I know my colleagues say this isn't amnesty, but it is. I know some \nsay that the alien has to pay their taxes, pay a fine, have worked for \n3 years, and learn English. They say that the aliens are earning their \ncitizenship. I respectfully disagree.\n  Yes, an alien has to pay $2,000 to come out of the shadows. But \nindividuals under 18 don't have to pay. And the fine probably won't \ncover the costs of implementing the program, nor will it cover the \ncosts of a background check.\n  I have said it before, and I repeat is now: $2,000 is chump change. \nThese same people probably paid a smuggler $15,000 to get them across \nthe border. We are selling citizenship.\n  The proponents say that illegal aliens have to pay their taxes. Don't \nlet them fool you. Sure, they have to pay all outstanding Federal and \nSate taxes before their status is adjusted, but they only have to pay \nthe taxes they owe for the 3 years that they are required to work. What \nabout the other years? They have been here for at least 5. What about \nthose under the age of 20 who are exempt from having to work? What if \nthey work? Don't they have to pay their taxes?\n  Another point about this provision on taxes is that it is going to be \na burden on the IRS. As chairman of the Finance Committee, which \noversees the IRS, I can tell you that the taxman is going to have a \ndifficult time verifying whether an individual owes any taxes. It will \nbe impossible for the IRS to truly enforce this because they cannot \naudit every single person in this country. We need to place the burden \non the alien, not the Federal Government. We need to require them to \ncome forward and show us their tax returns.\n  When an alien applies for legal status, they have to prove that they \nhave been working for 3 out of the last 5 years. If an illegal alien \ncan't get their IRS records or an employer to attest to their working, \nthen they can get a friend to attest. They can have anybody on the \nstreet sign a sworn affidavit to attest for them. That is fraud and \ncorruption waiting to happen. Do you think the Federal Government is \ngoing to have time to check out their sources and prove their claims?\n  The proponents of amnesty also say that the alien is not eligible if \nthey do not meet certain health standards. It does not say that one has \nto undergo a medical exam. In fact, those who fall under the second \ntier, who have been here for 2 to 5 years, may be required to take a \nmedical exam.\n  My home State of Iowa is currently dealing with a mumps epidemic. \nSome speculate that the disease was brought over by a foreign student. \nThat is the point of a medical exam. This compromise would place \nheavier burdens on our public health departments because we won't know \nwhat types of diseases these individuals have. They should be required \nto undergo a medical exam at their own expense. We need to require them \nupfront in order to prevent outbreaks of contagious diseases.\n  The English requirement is weak. It is weaker than current \nnaturalization requirements. Under current law, an immigrant has to \ndemonstrate an understanding of the English language and a knowledge of \nthe fundamentals of our history and government. Under this compromise, \nan alien only has to prove that they are pursuing a course of study in \nEnglish, history, and U.S. Government. Anybody could make that claim.\n  The compromise would require the Department of Homeland Security to \ndo a background check on the illegal aliens in the United States. In \nfact, this compromise has placed a time limit on our Federal agents. \nThey have 90 days to complete them. That is unrealistic. It is \npossible. It is a huge burden. And it is a huge expense.\n  Homeland Security will surely try to hurry with these background \nchecks. They will be pressured by Congress to rush them. They will \nrubberstamp applications despite possible gang participation, criminal \nactivity, terrorist ties, and other violations of our laws. This is a \nnational security concern.\n  The compromise before us prohibits the Government from using the \ninformation in an application against an alien. So if an illegal alien \nwrites in their application that they voted, or that they smuggled in \ndrugs, or that they are related to Osama bin Laden, then our Government \ncannot use that information for critical investigations. In fact, the \ncompromise would fine bureaucrats $10,000 if they use the information \nin an application for purposes other than adjudication.\n  But wait--there is more. If an alien has been ordered removed, and is \nsitting in jail ready to be deported, the alien still gets the chance \nto apply for this amnesty. The thousands of illegal aliens with orders \nto leave the country can apply. Their country won't take them back, so \nour country will give them citizenship. That doesn't make sense.\n  Everything that I have spoken about so far is based on the amnesty \nprogram for those who are currently in the United States. I would like \nto express two concerns about the future flow provisions. When we say \nfuture flow we mean those who aren't here but who can apply for legal \nentry through a ``temporary'' guestworker program.\n  First, on day 1 of their entry into the U.S., an employer can sponsor \nthe alien for a green card. If they are not sponsored within 4 years, \nthen the alien can petition for him or herself. Yes, this temporary \nprogram for temporary workers becomes a citizenship program for anybody \nand everybody.\n  Second, there is a numerical limit of 400,000. It is intellectually \ndishonest to say that this is the ceiling. The cap can be increased \nautomatically without congressional approval if the limit is reached. \nIt will never decrease; it can only increase.\n  This compromise will have enormous economic and employment \nimplications for the Nation. If we enact it, we will sell out the \nmiddle class in America. We would also push aside the lower, uneducated \nclass of American citizens.\n  Foreign workers won't have to take low-skilled jobs anymore. They \nwon't be required to do the jobs that Americans supposedly won't do. \nTheir spouses and children will permanently take jobs away. These \naren't temporary workers anymore.\n  What happens when this country goes into recession? Americans will be \nbanging on our door, asking why we did this to them.\n  We are allowing businesses to hire people at lower wages because they \nare illegal, rather than hire Americans at somewhat higher wages. Maybe \nthis country needs to focus more on training and educating our own \npeople, and less on how businesses can make more money by hiring \nillegals. By opening the floodgates for these kinds of low-skilled \nimmigrants, we are taking away opportunities for our own.\n  Businesses have no problems paying under the table or paying lower \nwages. They also don't have problems paying CEOs and executives \nastronomical salaries. There is something wrong with this equation.\n  I have an amendment to create an Employer Verification System. This \namendment, worked out between the Finance and Judiciary Committees, \nwill require employers to check the eligibility of their workers.\n  It will give businesses the tools they need to be compliant with the \nlaw. Right now, the system is voluntary, but it is time to make this \nsystem a staple in the workplace. We will increase worksite enforcement \nand penalties, safeguards and privacy protections.\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\n  But this system needs to be in place if we are going to have a guest \nworker program. Employers are put on notice--we will hold them \naccountable, and we will penalize them if they violate the law.\n  We are taking a huge step here in shaping the future of our country. \nWhat we do here with immigration will impact every aspect of our daily \nlives.\n  An amnesty program for millions of people will increase the fiscal \nburden on our country. It will further strain our health care, \neducation, and infrastructure systems. If these folks are not paying \ntheir taxes, then American citizens will have to pick up the tab. \nAmericans will have to build bigger schools, and pay for the huge \nmedical expenses of these people.\n  So I ask my colleagues to think twice. Read the fine print. Ask \nyourself this: What about fairness? What about those who waited their \nturn in line? What about those who abide by the rules?\n  I know many of my colleagues will support the compromise that was \nagreed to in the last day. I know they are saying to themselves: This \nis better than nothing. We had to do something. I ask my colleagues \nthis: Do you think voting for this without the process of amending and \ndebating is what we were elected to do? Voting for this bill because it \nis supposedly the best thing out there isn't a good enough reason.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I took an oath of office to honor the \nConstitution. I bear a fundamental allegiance to uphold the rule of \nlaw. And that is why I cannot in good conscience support granting legal \nstatus to illegal immigrants who have violated our laws. Lawbreakers \nshould not be rewarded. The compromise sends the wrong message to \nmillions of people around the world. If you vote for this compromise, \nyou obviously don't respect the rule of law.\n  With a wink and a nod, Uncle Sam would turn America's historic \nwelcome mat into a doormat trampled upon by millions and millions of \nillegal immigrants.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I voted in favor of cloture on the \nHagel-Martinez compromise on the immigration bill. I did not like the \nchanges that this compromise made to the Senate Judiciary Committee \nbill, and I would vastly prefer that the Senate pass the committee bill \nintact. But we lost the cloture vote on the committee bill yesterday, \nand I saw this as the only way to move forward with comprehensive \nimmigration reform this year. I remain hopeful that after this coming \nrecess, we will be able to come to some agreement on meaningful, \ncomprehensive reform. This issue is too significant to put off--too \nimportant to our national security, to our economy, and most \nimportantly to the millions of people whose lives will be affected. \nLike so many of my colleagues, I am willing to work on a bipartisan \nbasis to address the critical problems facing our Nation with regard to \nimmigration, just as the Judiciary Committee was able to do.\n  I do want to lay out some of my concerns about the Hagel-Martinez \nsubstitute. But first, I should note that this compromise leaves intact \nmost of the committee bill, including very important provisions like \nthe guest worker program for foreign workers who want to enter the \ncountry in the future for jobs that Americans are not filling, the \nfamily reunification provisions, the AgJOBS title to help agricultural \nworkers, and the DREAM Act to provide higher education opportunities \nfor children who are long-term U.S. residents and came to this country \nillegally through no fault of their own.\n  Nonetheless, the compromise makes some troubling revisions to how we \nwould deal with undocumented individuals who are currently in the \ncountry. I appreciate that Senator Kennedy was able to secure some \nimportant changes to the original Hagel-Martinez proposal that help \nprotect workers, such as stronger wage protections. Those were \nimportant concessions. But I am concerned about the core modification \nthat the compromise makes to the committee bill; that is, treating \ndifferently those people who have been here for more than 5 years and \nthose who entered the country illegally in the last 2 to 5 years. This \napproach is overly complicated and difficult to administer, and it is \nunfair to treat these two categories of people differently.\n  Mr. President, we must enact realistic, comprehensive reform, and I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues toward a solution. I hope that \nwe can accomplish that this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the minority has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Am I correct there is now 4 minutes left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, let me say the bill that came out of the \ncommittee, the Kennedy-McCain bill, was substituted there over the \nSpecter bill. It lurched the bill even further toward amnesty than we \nalready were heading. When it came up for a vote yesterday, it needed \n60 votes to proceed. It got 60 votes against it--only 39 to proceed. It \nwas defeated overwhelmingly.\n  Then they hatched a compromise among Members who already supported \nthe Kennedy bill and they claimed they were producing a compromise that \ncould be supported. But people who should have been involved in that \ncompromise, who worked so hard on this, such as Senator Kyl, Senator \nCornyn, Senator Feinstein, Senator Dorgan, Senator Nelson, and Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison, who is here--I am not aware they were involved in \nit. So they bring that up now and expect us to support it.\n  Ninety-five percent of what was in the bill rejected yesterday is in \nthis one and there is no substantial change in matters of amnesty. In \nfact, with regard to green cards, it increases significantly the number \nthat would be granted over the bill we rejected yesterday. It is an \nunprincipled approach, in my view, and not a well thought out plan.\n  With regard to this question, who will say on the floor of this \nSenate that the enforcement provisions will be carried out and we will \nactually have enforcement on the border? That is why the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Isakson, had a perfectly important amendment. That was \nnot allowed to be voted on. It would at least have taken a strong step \ntoward ensuring that whatever we passed becomes law.\n  Finally, when asked what the cost was, nobody knew until last night \nand we find that the cost of this bill is $29 billion over 5 years. \nNobody had even thought about it. That clearly is a budget-busting \nmatter.\n  This bill is a dead horse, in my view. It should be rejected because \namendments have not been allowed, and it should be rejected most \nimportantly because it does not do what it purports to do.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, no one has been the beneficiary of \nlegal immigration more than this Senator. My wife, who has the \nprivilege of serving in the President's Cabinet, came to this country \nat age 8 not speaking a word of English and has realized the American \ndream and been an important part of my life, obviously, as my partner \nfor a number of years. So I am one Senator who wishes to see a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill pass.\n  But the Hagel-Martinez bill is a lengthy, complicated measure, and it \nwas suggested last night by my good friend, the Democratic leader, that \nsomehow it is extraordinary to request 20 amendments on a bill of this \nmagnitude and complexity.\n  Routinely on bills of this size we have at least this many \namendments. In this Congress alone, for example, we had 21 votes on the \nEnergy bill, 37 votes on the budget resolution, and 31 votes on the \nbankruptcy bill, including a couple of nongermane amendments on minimum \nwage. All of those bills, of course, were arguably complex, but \ncertainly this one is as well.\n  We have been allowed to have only three votes on amendments to this \nbill, and we have been on this bill well in excess of a week. So what \nRepublicans are arguing for today is fairness in the process, the \nroutine, normal way with which we deal with complex legislation here on \nthe floor of the Senate, after which we will produce, hopefully, a \ncomprehensive bill that will be passed on a bipartisan basis. In the \nmeantime, it is my hope and expectation that all Republican Senators \nwill oppose cloture until we are allowed to offer this rather \nreasonable and modest number of amendments--about 20.\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. If the majority agrees here, I will make a brief statement \nand use my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I spoke yesterday about the American \npeople's need for a win on immigration--not the Republicans, not the \nDemocrats. Today we have another chance to give them that win if we \nvote for cloture and move forward on legislation that will protect our \nborders and fix our badly broken immigration system. All of us, \nDemocrats and Republicans--we all need the courage to do what is \nrequired of us now. It is time to move forward on tough and smart \nimmigration reform.\n  The amendment before us does what we need of an immigration bill. An \nimmigration bill will secure our borders, crack down on employers who \nbreak the law, and allow us to find who is living here by giving 12 \nmillion undocumented workers a reason to come out of the darkness, out \nof the shadows, pay a fine, undergo a background check, stay out of \ntrouble, have a job, pay the penalties, and become legal when their \nnumber is called, even though it is many years from now.\n  Americans have demonstrated literally in the streets for a bill like \nthis. They have spoken. It is up to the majority to answer their call. \nIf tough, comprehensive immigration reform fails to move forward, it \nwill be the Republicans' burden to bear. Virtually all Democrats \nsupported the Specter bill that came before the Senate. Virtually all \nDemocrats support the Martinez substitute. So the majority must explain \nto the American people why they are permitting a filibuster of \nimmigration legislation, a filibuster by amendment.\n  On such an important national security issue, this is no place for \nstonewalling and obstruction. Yet that is where we are. We are ready \ntoday to fix our broken immigration system and give Americans the real \nsecurity they deserve. They are looking for a win. They deserve a win. \nWe can do it with a vote to invoke cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a lot of people are asking what happened \nbetween the optimism of yesterday morning that centered on real \nprogress, as people did come around working together, both sides of the \naisle, on a Hagel-Martinez amendment, and this morning where it looks \nas if everything has been obstructed, stopped, stonewalled. There are \ntalks of obstruction from the other side of the aisle. What has \nhappened is no amendments have been allowed by the other side of the \naisle to come to the floor to be debated, to be discussed, to be voted \nupon. Rollcall votes or voice votes--zero over the last 24 hours, where \nthe clear understanding yesterday morning was that we would have an \nopportunity to allow Senators to express themselves on votes.\n  The Democratic leadership has effectively stopped, put a halt to that \ngreat progress that was being made yesterday morning, by not allowing \namendments. Yes, they put a stranglehold on the right of every Senator \nto offer amendments and to have his or her views expressed and acted \nupon. The facts tell the story. Over the last 9 days, on complex issues \nbased on a very good, solid product generated by the Judiciary \nCommittee, about 400 amendments have been filed and only 3 of 400 have \nbeen allowed by the other side of the aisle to come to the floor to be \nvoted upon. Only 3 out of 400. That tells the whole story. In the \nprocess on a bill that is a challenging bill, a large bill, a bill that \nwill affect almost 300 million Americans now and many more in the \nfuture, we have only been allowed to have three votes over the last 9 \ndays.\n  Viewers, I know, ask, people at home ask all the time: How can that \npossibly be, if you have good support and people look as though they \nare working together and all? And the answer is if anything takes \nunanimous consent around here, anything does, the Democratic leadership \ncan effectively stop, put a halt to that debate and amendment process. \nOf 400 amendments, 3 have been considered over the last 9 days. It is a \nprocess that has been broken. It is a process we have to fix if we are \ngoing to be able to address the issues before us, whether it is \nimmigration or other important bills.\n  It has been interesting, listening to some of the comments this \nmorning and last night, and as has been reflected in both the \nDemocratic leader's statements and in mine and others, it is true the \nDemocratic leader--to me this is almost laughable--has said we are \ngoing to dictate who is on the conference committee, the minority \nleader, the Democratic leader, saying we are going to dictate who is on \nthe conference committee. It is absurd. It is laughable. It has never \nbeen done. But it is proposed as if that is even a reasonable proposal \nbefore allowing us to take up amendments and debate them and have them \nvoted upon.\n  I asked unanimous consent last night--because it is frustrating \nhaving 400 amendments over there and in 9 days only being allowed 3 \nvotes--let's take up one of those amendments. That was refused. Let's \ntake up another one. That was refused, my unanimous consent request, \nand a third was refused just to demonstrate--yes, it is frustration, \nand it is the right of the minority to obstruct, but that explains the \ndifference between the optimism moving forward for a solution before we \nbegan the recess and now what is obviously going to occur; that is, we \nare going to have to postpone and delay full consideration of this \nbill.\n\n  The Democratic leader earlier this morning asked: Why aren't we \nallowing these amendments to come forth from the other side? Indeed, \nout of 400, I said: Can't we consider 20 of them at some point in the \nfuture? The answer was no. Why don't we consider amendments? Why are we \nshutting down the amendment process because some Members might not \nagree with everything in that 425-page bill?\n  There are going to be things in there that need to be fixed, \nmodified. There may be some dangerous things in there in many people's \nminds. And to not even allow them to bring them to the floor to debate \nthem is just flat out wrong.\n  I can understand the other side trying to advantage themselves in the \noutcome in their favor, but to shut out all amendments, to say that \nonly 3 of 400 amendments are to be considered is simply wrong. It \nreally does come down to a matter of fairness.\n  I began this debate a week and a half ago saying: Let's have a civil \nprocess, a dignified process. It is an important issue with many \nmillions of people coming across our borders. We need to secure our \nborders. We need to have worksite enforcement and interior enforcement. \nWe need to have a temporary worker program. There are 12 million people \nin the shadows. We need to bring them out.\n  It has effectively been brought to a halt by the other side. It is \nunfair to deny Members on both sides of the aisle the right to express \ntheir voice and have their amendments considered. It is unfair to the \nauthors of the bill and the Judiciary Committee that generated this \nbill.

On this vote, the yeas are 36, the nays are \n62. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to express my dismay regarding \nthe collapse of the Senate's work on border security legislation.\n  As a border State Senator, I know first-hand the need to secure our \ninternational borders because every day I hear from constituents who \nmust deal with illegal entries into our country. We have a crisis on \nour borders and the status quo is not acceptable. We need to address \nthis situation but are not being allowed to because of Democrats' \nrefusal to allow votes on amendments to border security legislation on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Their refusal to allow votes means that my amendments, which are very \nimportant to New Mexico, the southwest border, and the Nation, cannot \nbe considered. Those amendments would have provided for two more \nFederal judges in New Mexico to deal with immigration cases, provided \n250 new deputy U.S. Marshals to transport and guard criminal illegal \naliens, authorized $585 million for land port of entry infrastructure \nand technology, and called for Mexico's cooperation on border security.\n  My amendments are based on needs that are imperative to border \nsecurity. I have been told of the need for new Federal district judges \nin New Mexico by the Chief Judge for the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, the Chief Judge of the New Mexico District, and several other \nFederal district judges in my home State. In fiscal year 2005, more \nthan 1800 immigration cases were filed in the District of New Mexico. \nWe must have more Federal judges to handle this caseload that the \nJudicial Conference has referred to this situation as a ``crisis.'' I \nhave been told of the need for new deputy U.S. Marshals by the U.S. \nMarshal for New Mexico. His deputies are responsible for transporting \nillegal aliens to court and guarding them when they appear in Federal \ndistrict court. I have seen firsthand the need for port of entry \nimprovements in New Mexico, and since I worked with Senator DeConcini \non the last major land port of entry overhaul in 1986, I know that the \ntime has come to again address our land port needs. Lastly, I am \nconvinced that we must have Mexico's cooperation to secure our porous \nsouthwest border, and my amendment\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\nwould have provided a path to secure that cooperation.\n  The refusal of Democrats to allow consideration of these amendments \nis nothing short of irresponsible behavior towards the security of \nAmerica.\n  The Democrats' refusal to limit debate on the majority leader's \nborder security bill today confirms their lack of understanding \nregarding the need for border security. Senator Frist's Securing \nAmerica's Borders Act includes 1,250 new customs and border protection \nofficers, 1,000 new DHS investigative personnel, 1,250 new DHS port of \nentry inspectors, 1,000 new Immigration and customs enforcement \ninspectors, and 2,400 new border patrol agents. The bill authorizes \nfunding for new border security technologies and assets, including new \nunmanned aerial vehicles, vehicle barriers, cameras, sensors, and all-\nweather roads. This bill would have addressed many of our border \nsecurity needs, and I am frustrated that we were not allowed to vote on \nthis bill.\n  As it stands now, we will not see any of the comprehensive border \nsecurity improvements that New Mexico and other States desperately \nneed. I could not be more disappointed.\n  On February 10, 2005, I introduced legislation to create additional \nFederal district judgeships in the State of New Mexico.\n  On November 17, 2005, I introduced the Border Security and \nModernization Act of 2005, S. 2049, with bipartisan support. That bill \ncalls for improvements to our port of entry infrastructure, increased \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, and Department of Justice \npersonnel, new technologies and assets for border security, increased \ndetention capacity, and additional Federal assistance for States.\n  On February 17, 2006, I introduced the Welcoming Immigrants to a \nSecure Homeland Act. That bill calls for an increase in the number of \nDHS personnel who investigate human smuggling laws, employment of \nimmigrants, and immigration fraud and increased penalties for \nviolations of immigration laws. It also creates a new guest worker visa \nthat lets individuals who want to, come to the United States to work. \nLastly, it creates a way to account for the millions of undocumented \naliens residing in the United States without creating an automatic path \nto citizenship.\n  I supported the efforts to jointly address border security and \nimmigration reform legislation, but I am convinced that if we cannot \nagree regarding immigration reform, we must still secure our borders. \nThe President must budget for our border needs, and Congress must \nappropriate for those needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3359-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3359-S3363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF DORRANCE SMITH TO BE AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to comment on what has happened \nover the last 2 weeks on a very important bill--maybe the most \nimportant bill for the future of our country that we will take up this \nyear, and that is immigration reform.\n  I was very disappointed that we were not able to have a vehicle on \nwhich we can have amendments in the normal course of action that we \nhave on the floor of the Senate. I cannot think of a more complicated, \ncomprehensive issue that we could amend and make a better bill that \nwould have the support of the vast majority of the Senate. Yet we have \nspent 2 weeks and were only able to have three amendments.\n  There are many differing views on what to do with the 12 million \nillegal immigrants that are in our country. But I think there is a \nconsensus that we need better control of our borders, that we need \nsecurity measures to know who is in our country, and that we need a \nguest worker permit program that would allow people to come into our \ncountry legally to work and earn a living for their families, \ncontribute to the economy of the United States, and perhaps become \ncitizens, if they decide to, or not become citizens if they wish to \nremain citizens of their home country.\n  However, the issue of what to do with the 12 million people was not \nable to be discussed, debated, or refined on the Senate floor. I think \nthat is a mistake, and I think we have missed a very important \nopportunity. The negotiations got down to allowing 20 amendments--20 \namendments--on one of the most complicated bills that we will take up \nthis year. We take up appropriations bills that have 70 amendments. We \ntake up authorization bills that have 40 amendments. The negotiation \nwas down to allowing 20 amendments, and we were not able to get the \nconsent of the minority to take up 20 amendments to try to refine a \nbill that would allow the Senate to speak with an overwhelming \nmajority, or at least to have all the voices heard so that we could \nstart beginning to craft a bill that would help with an issue in our \ncountry of security and economics.\n  Mr. President, I am very disappointed. I think we have missed an \nopportunity. I hope very much that, as we go home for a 2-week break, \nwe will think about how we can come together, come back here and not \ngive up on having an immigration reform bill that secures our borders, \nthat creates a guest worker program that will be productive for the \nparticipants and for the economy of our country, that will not displace \nAmerican jobs but will welcome the immigrants who seek to come here, as \nwe have done for over 200 years in our country on a regularized basis.\n  I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I know he is \ngoing on to very important work. I hope that we can address this issue \nwhen we return, and I hope the minority will work with the majority not \nto block future amendments that would make this a better bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ENSIGN). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we wish to confine ourselves strictly to \nthe time the joint leadership agreed upon in the event we need recorded \nvotes.\n  Mr. President, Dorrance Smith, the nominee, is designated to be the \nprincipal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on matters relating to \npublic affairs in the media. Mr. Smith is a four-time Emmy Award-\nwinning television producer, a political consultant, and a media \nstrategist who has worked for over 30 years in television and politics. \nHe spent 9 months in Iraq, in the years 2003 and 2004, where he served \nas senior media advisor to the setup at that time.\n\n[[Page S3360]]\n\n  He was responsible for developing a state-of-the-art communications \nfacility in Baghdad for the Coalition Provisional Authority and a \npublic diplomacy strategy for the U.S. Government. In addition, Mr. \nSmith was asked to overhaul certain aspects of the Iraqi media network, \nwhich he did. He was quite successful, such that they had a television \nchannel that was launched on satellite.\n  For those efforts, he was awarded by the Secretary of Defense a medal \nfor exceptional public service.\n  I have met with Mr. Smith on several occasions. I believe him to be \nhighly qualified, and I fully support his nomination.\n  At a full Armed Services Committee hearing on October 25, 2005, and \nlater, at an Executive Session on December 13th, at which Mr. Smith was \npresent, he was questioned about an Op Ed article he wrote that \nappeared in the Wall Street Journal on April 25, 2005, which I also \nattach. In this article, based on his in the trenches experience as \nAmbassador Bremer's Senior Media Advisor in Baghdad, Mr. Smith \nquestioned the practice relied on by major media outlets in the United \nStates of airing video of insurgent attacks supplied by the Arab \nsatellite news channel Al Jazeera. Mr. Smith has clarified his intent \nabout the role of U.S. Networks in his in raising these issues for \ndiscussion and public scrutiny. He has emphasized publicly that he has \nnever written or stated that the United States networks aid and abet \nterrorists. In this regard, I have attached Mr. Smith's response to a \nquestion for the record he provided after the hearing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a biography of Dorrance Smith, and some \nquestions and answers during his nomination hearing be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Dorrance Smith\n\n       Dorrance Smith is a four-time Emmy award winning television \n     producer, political consultant, and media strategist who has \n     worked over 30 years in television and politics.\n       Mr. Smith spent nine months in Iraq in 2003-2004 Senior \n     Media Adviser. He was responsible for developing a state of \n     the art communications facility in Baghdad for the Coalition \n     Provisional Authority and a public diplomacy strategy for the \n     United States government. In addition, Mr. Smith was asked to \n     overhaul the fledgling Iraqi Media Network. By April, 2004 \n     this effort was deemed so successful that the terrestrial \n     channel--AI Iraqiya--was launched on satellite. For his \n     efforts he was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for \n     Exceptional Public Service.\n       A four time Emmy Award winning ABC News and Sports \n     producer, he has held a number of positions at the network, \n     including serving as the first executive producer of ``This \n     Week with David Brinkley.''\n       From 1989 until 1991, Smith was the executive producer of \n     ABC News ``Nightline.'' During his tenure he was responsible \n     for the weeklong ``Nightline'' series originating from South \n     Africa, which covered the release of Nelson Mandela. The \n     broadcasts won an Emmy award. In addition he served as \n     executive producer of the prime time special ``Tragedy at \n     Tiananmen--The Untold Story,'' which was honored with the \n     duPont Columbia University Award, the Overseas Press Club \n     Award and an Emmy. ``Nightline'' also won an Emmy in 1991 for \n     outstanding news coverage of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.\n       Prior to his work on ``Nightline,'' Smith was the executive \n     producer of the number one rated Sunday public affairs \n     program, ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' a post he held \n     from the program's inception in 1981 until 1989. During his \n     tenure the broadcast received the first Joan Barone Award, \n     the George Foster Peabody Award, and was named the Best \n     National TV Interview Discussion Program by the readers of \n     the Washington Journalism Review.\n       In 1991 Smith left ABC News to become Assistant to the \n     President for Media Affairs at the White House. In this \n     capacity Smith handled all television and radio events \n     involving President Bush, members of the White House staff \n     and Cabinet. In addition his office handled all regional \n     media; coordinated media strategy for administration \n     officials seeking confirmation; and organized the debate \n     preparation during the 1992 political campaign.\n       In 2001, Smith was designated by FEMA Director Joe Allbaugh \n     to handle all media following the events of September 11th. \n     In this capacity Smith was responsible for FEMA's media \n     strategy for print, radio and television. Smith organized and \n     distributed the now famous FEMA video feeds from Ground Zero. \n     He reorganized the Public Affairs Office to meet the post \n     September 11th media demands.\n       At ABC News, Smith became executive producer of all weekend \n     news programming in 1980. He was responsible for the \n     production and programming of ``World News Saturday,'' \n     ``World News Sunday,'' ``The Weekend Report,'' and ``The \n     Health Show.''\n       Prior to his weekend assignment. Smith was Washington \n     producer of ABC News' ``The Iran Crises: America Held \n     Hostage.'' He also served as ABC News Senior Producer at the \n     1980 Winter Olympics, the 1984 Winter and Summer Games, and \n     the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.\n       From 1978-1979, Smith served as ABC News' White House \n     producer. Smith joined ABC News as a Washington producer in \n     1977. Previously he was staff assistant to President Gerald \n     Ford.\n       He began his broadcasting career at ABC Sports in 1973 as \n     an assistant to the producer.

Dorrance Smith, Senate Armed Services \n                      Committee, October 25, 2005\n\n  Member: Senator John Warner, Witnesses: Young, Smith, Etter, Bell, \n                                 Smith\n\n                              Question #1\n\n\n                          Arab Satellite News\n\n       Question: 1. Mr. Smith, on April 26, 2005, you wrote an \n     article for the Wall Street Journal titled ``The Enemy on our \n     Airways.'' In the article you stated that ``. . . Al-Jazeera \n     continues to aid and abet the enemy . . .'' Have you ever \n     stated or written that U.S. broadcast networks have aided or \n     abetted terrorists by airing video that first appeared on the \n     Arab satellite news channel? Do you believe this to be the \n     case?\n       Answer: I have never written or stated that the United \n     States networks aid and abet terrorists by airing video that \n     first appeared on the satellite news channel Al-Jazeera. I \n     did write an Op Ed piece in April, 2005 for the Wall Street \n     Journal which raised a number of questions following the \n     airing of hostage video by Al-Jazeera and all 6 U.S. news \n     networks. In that piece I wrote, ``the battle for Iraqi \n     hearts and minds is being fought over satellite T.V. It is a \n     battle we are losing badly. And I wrote, ``As long as Al-\n     Jazeera continues to aid and abet the enemy, as long as we \n     are fighting a war on the ground and in the airwaves, why are \n     we not fighting back against Al-Jazeera . . .''\n       My past experiences running the Iraq Media Network in \n     Baghdad gave me insight into the communications strategy of \n     our enemy. Raising the tactics of the enemy in a newspaper \n     piece was an effort to spur public discourse. I believe the \n     public, the networks and policy makers should examine the \n     tactics of the enemy including providing video to the Arab \n     satellite network with the knowledge that it will be \n     broadcast in the United States as well. Understanding the \n     communications strategy of the enemy is a prerequisite to \n     developing a communications strategy that is effective. In \n     the WSJ, I was not writing as a policy maker or government \n     official, nor was I a candidate for the Public Affairs job at \n     the Pentagon.\n       Newspaper accounts that I believe the U.S. networks aid and \n     abet terrorists are incorrect. When asked at the confirmation \n     hearing ``But you think it's a fair characterization now to \n     say that the networks in the United States aid and abet \n     terrorists by showing that.'' I said, ``No, I do not.'' That \n     is and always has been my belief.\n       I worked in network television for over 22 years and I \n     maintain a professional working relationship with the today. \n     During my nine months with the CPA in Iraq, I worked very \n     closely with U.S. networks to meet their coverage needs. Most \n     recently I was a media consultant to the United States Senate \n     for the Joint Congressional Committee for Inaugural \n     Ceremonies (JCCIC). For four months I represented that \n     institution to the U.S. network pool with the aim of \n     producing the best event for both parties. After the \n     inauguration Tom Shales wrote in the Washington Post, ``ABC's \n     Peter Jennings noted that for the relatively few viewers able \n     to see them in high-definition TV, the images were often \n     ``fabulous.'' Indeed they were.\n       As a network executive I appreciate the difficult decisions \n     facing journalists during wartime especially potential \n     conflicts between journalistic integrity and national \n     security. If confirmed, I look forward to conducting my \n     relationship with U.S. networks in a professional and \n     respectful manner as I did when working in Iraq for nine \n     months and for JCCIC. I also look forward to working closely \n     with this committee on these important issues.\n       Do you agree with these goals?\n       Yes, I support the goals of the Congress in enacting the \n     reforms of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation.\n       Do you anticipate that legislative proposals to amend \n     Goldwater-Nichols may be appropriate? If so, what areas do \n     you believe it might be appropriate to address in these \n     proposals?\n       I am unaware of any need to modify Goldwater-Nichols at \n     this time. If I am confirmed, I will raise any such \n     requirements that I may identify within the Department. The \n     Department would consult closely with Congress, especially \n     this Committee, on any changes that might be appropriate.\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\n                                 Duties\n\n       What is your understanding of the duties and functions of \n     the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security \n     Policy?\n       I understand that, if I am confirmed, my duties as \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security \n     Policy will be to serve as the principal assistant and \n     advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in \n     formulating and implementing national security and defense \n     policy in a wide range of areas, including: nuclear forces; \n     technology security; missile defense; Europe and NATO; \n     Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia; arms control, non-\n     proliferation, and counter-proliferation.\n       Assuming you are confirmed, what duties and functions do \n     you expect that Secretary Rumsfeld would prescribe for you?\n       I would expect Secretary Rumsfeld to look to the Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy to \n     fulfill all the duties assigned to that office under the \n     authorities of the Secretary of Defense and the Under \n     Secretary of Defense for Policy in particular, assistance and \n     advice on the formulation of national security and defense \n     policy in the areas noted in the response to the previous \n     question.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes to speak on the \nnomination of Dorrance Smith to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nPublic Affairs.\n  I oppose this nomination for a very critical reason, which is that \nDorrance Smith has spoken out against the very media in the United \nStates that he would be involved with, engaged in, as the public \naffairs official for the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. Smith has shown in his writing and in his testimony before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee that he believes that our media \nundermines our national security when they perform their legitimate \nrole of providing newsworthy information to the public about what is \ngoing on in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has gone so far as to accuse our \nmajor networks of acting in partnership with al-Qaida.\n  That extreme position is not appropriate for the spokesperson of the \nDepartment of Defense. This is what Mr. Smith said in his April 25, \n2005, article in the Wall Street Journal, entitled ``The Enemy on Our \nAirwaves,'' in which he complained about what he called ``the ongoing \nrelationship between terrorists, Al-Jazeera, and the [major U.S. \ntelevision] networks.'' The basis of this alleged relationship is the \nfact that the networks played video of hostages in Iraq, which Al-\nJazeera allegedly obtained from terrorist sources.\n  The text of Mr. Smith's article leaves little doubt about his belief \nthat the ``enemy on our airwaves'' are our major television networks \nthemselves, all of them--ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, CNN--all of them. Here is \nwhat Mr. Smith said in this article:\n\n       Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and al-Qaida have a \n     partner in Al-Jazeera and, by extension, most networks in the \n     U.S. This partnership is a powerful tool for the terrorists \n     in the war in Iraq.\n\n  That is the view taken by the proposed spokesperson for the \nDepartment of Defense--that our networks are partners with Osama bin \nLaden, the man who orchestrated the slaughter on 9/11.\n  The smear then continues as Mr. Smith raises ``ethics'' issues about \nthe conduct of the media.\n\n       The arrangement between the U.S. networks and Al-Jazeera \n     raises questions of journalistic ethics. Do the U.S. networks \n     know the terms of the relationship that Al-Jazeera has with \n     the terrorists? Do they want to know?\n       What if one of the networks had taken a stand and refused \n     to air the [video of an American hostage] on the grounds that \n     it was aiding and abetting the enemy, and from that point \n     forward it would not be a tool of terrorist propaganda?\n\n  Mr. Smith is entitled to his views. I will defend that right any day \nand any place. But we should not confirm him to represent the \nDepartment of Defense to the very media that he calls a partner with \nour deadly enemy, al-Qaida. That is over the top. It is extreme. It is \nnot the kind of view that should be represented by the Department of \nDefense in their dealings with the media.\n  The Armed Services Committee held a hearing on Mr. Smith's nomination \non October 25, 2005. At that time, I asked Mr. Smith about his \nstatement that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida ``have a partner in Al-\nJazeera and, by extension, most networks in the United States.'' Mr. \nSmith testified that he still believes this statement to be a fair \ncharacterization of the relationship between the networks and al-Qaida. \nHe insisted that ``there is a relationship that exists'' and ``the \nrelationship is a cooperative one.''\n  I pressed him:\n\n       Does this ``relationship'' make the networks partners of \n     our terrorist enemies, as you wrote? Do you really believe \n     this, that they are partners?\n\n  Mr. Smith declined to provide a direct answer to that question.\n  I then asked him about his rhetorical question:\n\n       What if one of the networks had taken a stand and refused \n     to air the [video of an American hostage] on the grounds that \n     it was aiding and abetting the enemy, and that from this \n     point forward it would not be a tool of terrorist propaganda?\n\n  Mr. Smith testified he does not believe that the networks aid and \nabet terrorism by showing film of hostages. He insists that he was \n``raising the point that you never know where this video comes from and \nthat . . . simply because it plays on al-Jazeera does not mean that it \nshould necessarily play on any given network.''\n  That is not being straight with the committee. That is not what his \nquestion clearly implied. There is only one implication from the \nquestion which he wrote, and that is that networks are aiding and \nabetting terrorism by airing this video. So if Mr. Smith does not \nbelieve this to be the case, it appears that Mr. Smith was willing to \nsmear our television networks by implying something that he does not \nactually believe.\n  On December 13, 2005, the committee met with Mr. Smith in executive \nsession to afford him a further opportunity to explain his position. \nAnd while I cannot quote from Mr. Smith's statements in closed session, \nI believe it is fair to say that it was consistent with his testimony \nin open session.\n  Mr. President, the free press in this country is not our enemy. \nFreedom of the press is not only guaranteed in our Bill of Rights, it \nis a fundamental part of what we stand for as a country. Every one of \nus disagrees with stories and characterizations that appear in the \npress from time to time, but to label our networks as partners with \nthose who attacked us on September 11 is over the top, it is extreme, \nit is unacceptable, and it is not the kind of position that is going to \nbe useful for a representative of the DOD with our media.\n  The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs is the primary \nDepartment of Defense official responsible for providing timely and \naccurate information to the press and to the public about the \nactivities of the Department of Defense. A person who believes that the \nU.S. media is the enemy is not the right person for this position. A \nperson who shows a willingness to try to intimidate the press, to try \nto limit or color its cover, is not the right person to serve in this \nposition. That is why I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that our \ndistinguished colleague from Rhode Island will be addressing another \nmatter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, this matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me interject an observation or two, and then I will \nbe happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, the good Senator from Michigan and I have been \npartners on this committee now the 28th year and rarely do we have \nmatters of--particularly with executive positions--difference because \nwe screen them carefully. But on this one, we do. That is the way the \nsystem works.\n  I cannot impress upon my colleagues too strongly several points.\n  One, we did have an executive session, and I shall observe the \nconfidentiality of that session, but I got quite a different impression \nwhen Senator Levin and I largely--I think Senator Reed was present--\ncross-examined Mr. Smith very carefully. I felt he more or less \nacknowledged a better selection of words in hindsight he should have \nmade.\n  In no way do I believe he was trying to smear the press. I think the \nbest evidence I can produce for my colleagues that it wasn't sort of a \nsmear is that, to the best of my knowledge--and I will put the question \nto all Members of the Senate, most particularly my distinguished \nranking member--we did not\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\nreceive--at least I did not--any comments from the media industry, \nindividual stations, or trade associations, or anything else. I think \nthey took this in stride as a 30-year veteran of their profession with \ngreat distinction.\n  Everybody makes an error now and then. Who among us on this floor has \nnot made a public statement that he or she wishes perhaps they had \ncouched in different words?\n  To deny this man the position of the Assistant Secretary for Public \nAffairs, having been nominated by the President of the United States, \nhaving really been personally screened by the Secretary of Defense and \nothers for the position--the Secretary of Defense, with whom I have \ndiscussed this matter, has total confidence in this individual. He has \nbeen performing in an acting capacity in the Department now for some \nperiod of time.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the overall picture, but most \nimportantly, is anybody going to stand up and say: Oh, no, this is what \nthe media industry communicated with me, and for that reason I feel I \nshould oppose the nomination? I don't think that evidence is before us.\n  That industry is tough, tough on itself, and it wants to maintain its \nreputation. The industry, as such, has accepted this as an event which \nhappens to all of us who speak in public life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I stand to support the position of Senator \nLevin with respect to the nomination of Dorrance Smith to be Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Public Affairs. I, too, participated in his \nhearings. I listened to Mr. Smith, and I think he lacks the judgment \nnecessary to be the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs.\n  Senator Levin has quoted the Wall Street Journal op-ed piece. This \nwas not the example of making an offhand statement. This is not the \nsituation where someone was being quizzed and extemporaneously \nsuggested something that later one regrets. This was a very carefully \ncrafted editorial which was sent to the Wall Street Journal for \npublication. In it, Mr. Smith says:\n\n       Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and al Qaeda have a \n     partner in al-Jazeera and, by extension, most networks in the \n     U.S.\n\n  Mr. President, can you think of a more provocative and a more \nincendiary comment, to suggest that anyone is equivalent, by extension, \nto bin Laden and al-Zarqawi? That is essentially what he said about the \nmedia in the United States. I believe it represents extremely poor \njudgment. Perhaps that is why he is getting the job, because we have \nheard before these very loose suggestions that somebody is just like \nZarqawi, somebody is just like that.\n  We also heard coming out of the Department of Defense the notion that \nwe have problems not because of strategic mistakes that have been made, \nwe have problems because the media just doesn't get the story right. \nThis may be part of their approach to the media, but I don't think it \nrepresents the judgment necessary for an individual to discharge the \nresponsibilities of that nature for the United States and the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The other point is that Mr. Smith later went on to say:\n\n       Al-Jazeera continues to broadcast because it reportedly \n     receives $100 million a year from the government of Qatar. \n     Without this subsidy it would be off the air, off the \n     Internet and out of business. So, does Qatar's funding of al-\n     Jazeera constitute state sponsorship of terrorism?\n       As long as al-Jazeera continues to practice in cahoots with \n     terrorists while we are at war, should the U.S. Government \n     maintain normal relations with Qatar?. . . . Should the U.S. \n     not adopt a hard-line position about doing business with \n     Qatar as long as al-Jazeera is doing business with \n     terrorists?\n\n  All of these quotes are from the Wall Street Journal article.\n  I think what he fails to recognize is that Qatar is a major base of \nAmerican military operations in the region. I asked at the hearing if \nhe seriously thinks we ought to break diplomatic relations to Qatar. \nThe answer was rather unsatisfactory, sort of: I was just posing a \nquestion. But these are the kinds of provocative questions that suggest \nhe doesn't have the judgment to do the job.\n  Let me just suggest our involvement with Qatar. Qatar has invested \nover $1 billion to build Al-Udeid Air Base, one of our principal air \noperations in the region. There are 2,200 U.S. air men and women \nstationed today at that airbase. During our operations in Afghanistan, \nthat number was over 4,000.\n  U.S. military flights leave and arrive from Iraq every single day \ngoing into Qatar. All of us on the Armed Services Committee have \ntraveled in Qatar, have stayed in Qatar, have visited with the \nGovernment of Qatar, and to suggest, even rhetorically, that we should \nconsider abandoning our normal relations with Qatar is absurd.\n  This was not some cocktail-party comment where he was just thinking \nout loud; this was a very well-crafted editorial. Again, it just goes \nto my conclusion that he lacks judgment.\n  It is a very intricate arrangement we have with the Government of \nQatar. Yes, they do support al-Jazeera. Al-Jazeera is not an entity \nthat is trying to promote American interests in the region. That is \nclear. But we have to recognize not just the simple black-and-white \ncomic book approaches to policy but the reality of our engagement with \nQatar, their support of our operations, and the essential facilities \nthat are there. Statements such as these are totally, in my mind, \nindefensible and demonstrate a gross lack of judgment. That is not the \nkind of individual we want in a position that is supposedly designed to \ncraft a policy that will, through ideas and engagement, get the people \nof this region to be supportive of the United States and its policies. \nSo I join my colleague in opposing this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know of no other Senator who is going to \nspeak with regard to Mr. Smith.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield? I don't \nknow how much time I used on the previous comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 2 minutes more on Mr. Smith.\n  Mr. President, I have no better friend in the Senate, nor have I ever \nhad a better friend in the Senate than John Warner. I know of no finer \nSenator and no finer gentleman. We have a disagreement on this \nnomination, and we respect each other's points of view.\n  As he has pointed out, we have been partners, and we are partners. \nAnd the use of the word by Mr. Smith, ``partner,'' carries very special \nmeaning. For him to say in writing, in a prepared op-ed piece, that \nOsama bin Laden and al-Qaida have a partner in al-Jazeera and, by \nextension, most networks in the United States--and he rattles them off: \nABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, CNN, and MSNBC--is absolutely indefensible, it is \nextreme, it is over the top, and it is unbecoming somebody who is going \nto be representing the Department of Defense with the media.\n  If any one of us had said this on the Senate floor, that FOX News is \na partner with the people who attacked us on 9/11, we would think that \nperson not only owed FOX an apology but would probably owe every single \nvictim of 9/11 an apology. I find this such an extreme statement. And \nthe use of the term ``partner'' and his defense of that when we pressed \nhim on it I find to be one of the most extreme, irresponsible, and \nreckless kinds of statements anyone can make. Again, I will defend Mr. \nSmith's right to make it; that is not the issue here. He can write any \narticle in the Wall Street Journal or any other paper and I will defend \nhis right to do so. But the issue here is whether someone who has this \nposition--this position--on the issue of whether tapes of al-Jazeera \nshould be played on American television is, it seems to me, the wrong \nrepresentative for our Department of Defense.\n\n  I want to thank my friend from Virginia. As always, he is putting \ndifferences in context. We have very few of them, and when we do have \nthem, we deal with them with great respect for each other and our \npoints of view, and I will always not only admire him for that, but \nalways relish this particular relationship which we have had for so \nmany years.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my long-time friend and good \ncolleague for his thoughtful remarks, and I assure you, I offer the \nsame long-term\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\nfeelings for you. But in this instance, I come back to the simple \nproposition that there is not a one of us who has not at times in our \npublic career uttered or written statements that we wish we could have \nrevised. I felt in executive session he was sufficiently contrite and \nacknowledged that he still has the basic concerns about al-Jazeera, and \nI share those concerns, but a better choice of words might have avoided \nit. Then all of the networks he enumerated, I didn't get any \ncommunications on it from any of them.\n  I suggest at this time, so that we can move and accommodate all of \nour colleagues--and I am very grateful to the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader for allowing these nominations to be acted upon \ntoday. For all Members, last night, I am pleased to say, we voice voted \nthe Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England, so we made good \nprogress in putting into position those persons who have been \ndesignated by the President for the Department of Defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3363-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3363-S3366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF PETER CYRIL WYCHE FLORY TO BE AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF \n                                DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. We now turn to Peter C. W. Flory who became the principal \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security \nAffairs in 2001. In this capacity he serves as the principal assistant \nto the Assistant Secretary of International Security Affairs who is the \nprincipal adviser to the Secretary of Defense on the formulation and \ncoordination of international security strategy and policy for East \nAsia, South Asia, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, Africa, and Latin \nAmerica. I wish to put further facts regarding this distinguished \ngentleman into the Record, but I am very anxious to keep the momentum. \nI think the concern of my colleague can be best expressed by himself \nmomentarily, perhaps not to Mr. Flory himself but to the matter of \nprocess, and that process is an issue that in some respects I share \nwith my distinguished colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how many minutes remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to explain to my colleagues why the \nSenate should not proceed to the nomination of Peter Flory to be the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy.\n  At its core, this is an issue of the executive branch refusing to \nprovide the Senate with documents that are relevant to the confirmation \nproceeding.\n  This issue dates back to the summer of 2003 when I directed the \nminority staff of the Committee on Armed Services to conduct an inquiry \ninto the flawed intelligence prior to the war in Iraq. As part of that \ninquiry, I wrote a request to the Department of Defense in November of \n2003 seeking documents relating to the activities of the Office of \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith concerning Iraq. \nMr. Flory was a part of that office. It took 18 months of struggle to \nget as many documents as I could. I did not receive all the documents \nthat were relevant to the inquiry and which are now relevant to the \nFlory nomination.\n  The Department of Defense has refused to produce key documents \nregarding the efforts of that office to develop and disseminate an \nalternative intelligence assessment which exaggerated the relationship \nbetween Iraq and al-Qaida. That assessment went directly to senior \nadministration policymakers, bypassing the ordinary intelligence \ncommunity procedure. These documents are critical to understanding \nexaggerated statements which were made by senior administration \nofficials that al-Qaida and Iraq were allies, despite the conclusion of \nthe intelligence community that there was no such link between the two.\n  Here is the critical connection between the Feith office and Mr. \nFlory: Mr. Flory worked in the office of Under Secretary Feith at the \ntime the alternative assessment was developed and disseminated. Some of \nthe internal e-mails we have been able to obtain indicate Mr. Flory \nrequested and received briefings on the collection of intelligence from \nthe Iraqi National Congress in December 2002. The INC material should \nhave been evaluated by the intelligence community and filtered through \ntheir screen. Instead, it went to the Feith policy shop, which included \nMr. Flory.\n  Mr. Flory was also a member of Mr. Feith's briefing team which came \nto the Senate in June of 2003 to explain to the Senate Committee on \nArmed Services staff the origins and work of the Office of Special \nPlans and the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation group. Those were the \ntwo entities within Secretary Feith's office that were very much \ninvolved in characterizing the prewar intelligence.\n  In addition to the denial of relevant documents, the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Defense is currently conducting a review \nto determine whether Mr. Feith's office conducted unauthorized, \nunlawful, or inappropriate intelligence activities. We do not know \nwhat, if anything, that review may reveal about the role Mr. Flory may \nhave played in such activities. What we do know is that his name \nappears in a number of relevant documents we have been able to obtain \nso far.\n  Before the Senate proceeds to his nomination, the Defense Department \nshould provide the documents they have previously denied, or resolve \nthe matter in a satisfactory manner, and the inspector general's office \nshould be allowed to complete its investigation of the activities of \nUnder Secretary Feith's office. That investigation may shed additional \nlight on Mr. Flory's activities. It may show absolutely nothing about \nMr. Flory's activities, but we will have to await its conclusion to \nknow.\n  This is not a case of blocking Mr. Flory from occupying the office to \nwhich he has been nominated. I want to emphasize this for our \ncolleagues: Mr. Flory has received a recess appointment. He occupies \nthe office. He is currently serving in the position to which he was \nnominated. So there should be no argument that we need to give up a \nvital institutional right to obtain documents relevant to our carrying \nout of our confirmation function. Again, Mr. Flory occupies the office \nto which he has been nominated. The issue here is whether we are going \nto have access to documents that are relevant or may be relevant to \nthis nomination.\n  I want to provide a little bit of additional background and context \nfor this issue to indicate the seriousness of these matters to this \ninstitution's obligations and responsibilities. In the period before \nthe war, the intelligence community did not find a substantial link \nbetween Iraq and al-Qaida. The intelligence community stated that the \nrelationship ``appears to more closely resemble that of two independent \nactors trying to exploit each other,'' and that ``al-Qaida, including \nbin Laden personally, and Saddam were leery of close cooperation.'' \nNonetheless, senior administration officials alleged at times that Iraq \nand al-Qaida were ``allies'' and that there was a close connection and \ncooperative context between Iraqi officials and members of al-Qaida.\n  How could that happen? How could there be such a disconnect between \nwhat the intelligence community believed and what some of the senior \nadministration officials were saying? For one thing, there is evidence \nthat there was an alternative intelligence assessment, an alternative \nassessment that did not go through the intelligence community or the \nCIA; an alternative assessment that was prepared by Under Secretary \nFeith and his office, and that this was an important source for those \nadministration statements. For example, the Vice President specifically \nstated that an article based on a leaked version of the Feith shop \nanalysis was the ``best source of information'' on this issue. The \nFeith assessment was presented directly to senior administration \nofficials by Secretary Feith, including White House officials, a very \ndifferent assessment from that of the CIA.\n\n  This issue of the alleged Iraq-al-Qaida connection was central to the \nadministration's efforts to make its case for war against Iraq. And \naccording to public opinion polling, more than 60 percent of Americans \nbelieved there was a connection between Saddam and the horrific attacks \nof 9/11, although there has never been any evidence of such a \nconnection. The Feith\n\n[[Page S3364]]\n\noperation product, which bypassed the intelligence community, went \ndirectly to top leaders and, it quite clearly appears, had a major \nimpact on the lives of Americans and on the course of events in Iraq.\n  The process of seeking the relevant documents on this matter from the \nDepartment of Defense has been painfully slow and laborious. I have \nwritten many letters and raised the issue of the Department's \ninsufficient response and slow response on numerous occasions. I have \nalso raised the issue at hearings of the Committee on Armed Services \nwith senior Defense Department officials. I raised it with Mr. Flory at \nhis nomination hearing in July 2004, but the Department was still slow \nto respond. Sometimes the Department of Defense indicated there were no \nadditional documents responsive to my request, only to be followed by \nacknowledgments that there were more documents. Documents were dribbled \nout. It was always a struggle. This chart behind me indicates the list \nof some of the efforts that were made to get documents relating to the \nFeith operation of which Mr. Flory was a part, and some of the \ndocuments that we have been able to receive in which Mr. Flory is \nnamed.\n  I finally met with Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England \nin June of 2005 to discuss the documents I was seeking. Secretary \nEngland was able to provide a large number of additional documents in \nJuly. He also stated at that time they were the last documents the \nDepartment would release, and that there were 58 additional documents \nthe Department would not release. So that is what it came down to: 58 \ndocuments that they have, responsive to my continuing requests, which \nmay--may--like some of the documents we did receive, relate to Mr. \nFlory. We don't know until we get the documents. We have a right to the \ndocuments. The Senate, to the last person, should insist upon relevant \ndocuments. This should be an institutional issue where we all defend \neach other's rights to get documents that are relevant to a \nconfirmation.\n  In late July 2005, I offered to lift my objection to proceeding with \nthe Flory nomination if the administration would simply provide a list \nof the 58 documents they are not going to provide. Just give us the \nlist, together with an indication that the President's senior advisors \nwould recommend that he invoke executive privilege with regard to these \ndocuments, because that is what we were told orally. All we wanted was \nthe accounting, the inventory. We didn't need the substance. Just tell \nus: What are the 58 documents? Who wrote whom on what date? Don't give \nus the substance, we will get along without that, providing you tell us \nthat senior administration officials are going to recommend to the \nPresident that executive privilege be asserted.\n  Defense Department officials, by the way, indicated their willingness \nto do this, but it was the administration that declined to agree.\n  Then Mr. Flory received a recess appointment. So once again, he is in \noffice. By the way, I want to thank my friend from Virginia. He has \ntried on a number of occasions to help me obtain these documents.\n  The administration has had the opportunity to resolve this matter in \na very simple way. It has chosen not to. I offered the compromise which \nI have just outlined that the administration finally rejected.\n  Mr. Flory was a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Feith \noffice. That office produced an alternative intelligence assessment. \nThat is No. 1. That is his connection to the Feith office.\n  Second, he is mentioned in a number of the documents which have been \nmade available, and he participated in briefing the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on behalf of that office, relative to the subject \nmatter we are talking about here today.\n  I have said that I believe the Senate as an institution should insist \non access to documents which may be relevant to a confirmation process. \nThis should not be a partisan issue. We have supported each other's \nrights to documents consistently. As long as I have been here, we have \ndefended each other's rights to access to documents.\n  Senator McCain last year or the year before held up promotions and \ntransfers of senior officers in the Air Force because the Department of \nDefense refused to provide information he sought which was relevant to \na proposed Air Force lease of tanker aircraft. We supported him. He was \nright; he is entitled to that information.\n  We all supported the nominations, or most of us did. But it was the \nway in which he chose to obtain relevant information, and we--I think \nprobably every member of the Armed Services Committee--stood up for his \nright to get documents. That is what this issue is about. Are we as an \ninstitution going to stand up for the right of Senators to get \ndocuments that are relevant to a confirmation process or which may be \nrelevant to a confirmation process? That is the issue here.\n  The issue here is this body and what we have a right to, or whether \nthe executive branch--and I don't care who is in the executive branch, \nDemocrat or Republican--can stiff us, can stonewall us in terms of \nproducing documents that may be relevant to a confirmation process.\n  There is example after example where Senators have taken the position \nthat we should not vote on the confirmation of nominees until documents \nhave been provided. In 1986, Senators said they didn't want to vote on \nthe confirmation of William Rehnquist to be a Supreme Court Justice \nuntil after documents were provided. The administration finally \nprovided the information.\n  Senator Helms in 1991 blocked the nomination of an ambassador until \nhe received State Department cables in which one of Senator Helms' \naides was accused of leaking U.S. intelligence to the Pinochet \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, how much time does Senator Harkin have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Harkin has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. He has indicated his willingness to me, and I ask \nunanimous consent, that I have 3 of those minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will not object, but I wish to advise my colleague a \nnumber of my colleagues are on the tightest of schedules. I am \nproposing, on the conclusion of the debate on Flory, we immediately go \nto an up-or-down vote on Smith followed by a cloture vote on Flory. Is \nthat understood?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the existing unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. If cloture is obtained, will the Senator be willing to \nhave a voice vote on Flory?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If cloture is obtained, I would be willing. I have to make \nsure that is acceptable to others.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will reserve that for the leadership, but as manager \nthat would be my position. I must impress upon colleagues--they are all \nhere, those able to remain for the votes--in order to accommodate a \ngreat many, let us hold rigidly to the time schedules allocated for the \nvotes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was perfectly content to have these votes occur \nimmediately after the recess. I am the last one who wants to hold up \nour colleagues from leaving, and I will abide by the suggestion of the \ngood Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senators Helms, Kennedy, Jeffords, all of us--not all of \nus, many of us at times--have said we should not vote on a nomination \nuntil relevant documents have been obtained by the interested Senator, \nrelevant to that confirmation process. We have supported those Senators \nin getting those documents. It has been an institutional position that \nSenators should be able to get documents that relate to a confirmation \nof a particular nominee.\n  These are documents which relate to this nomination or may relate to \nthis confirmation process. We don't know until we see the documents, \nbut we do know two things, that Mr. Flory was a Principal Deputy \nAssistant Secretary in the Feith office and he was actively involved in \nthe discussions and the matters to which these documents pertain and \nthat he is named in a number of the documents we have been able to \nobtain as being involved in this subject matter. That much we know. \nThat is more than enough, it seems to me, for this body to insist that \nthese documents be made available before we vote on his confirmation.\n  Finally, he is in office now. We are not blocking him from going into \nthat office. He got a recess appointment.\n\n[[Page S3365]]\n\n  To reiterate, there is nothing novel or unique about holding up a \nnomination in order to obtain information that is being withheld by \nexecutive branch officials. This defense of Senate prerogatives goes \nback a long way, probably to our beginning.\n  In 1972, Senator Sam Ervin insisted that the Senate would not vote on \nthe nomination of Richard Kleindienst to be Attorney General until the \nadministration provided information on a deal to drop an antitrust case \nagainst ITT in return for a $400,000 campaign contribution. The \nadministration eventually provided the information and the nomination \nwas confirmed,\n  In 1991, Senator Helms blocked the nomination of George Fleming Jones \nto be U.S. Ambassador to Guyana until he received State Department \ncables in which one of Helms' aides was accused of leaking U.S. \nintelligence to the Pinochet government. The administration eventually \nprovided the information and the nomination was confirmed.\n  In 2004, Senator Jeffords placed a hold on nominations for four top \njobs at the Environmental Protection Agency because of 12 unmet \nrequests for documents over the previous three years. The documents in \nquestion related to the Bush administration's changes to air pollution \nrules.\n  In short, the Senate has a longstanding practice of holding up \nnominations in order to obtain documents relevant to confirmation and \noversight responsibilities. This has been done by Senators of both \nparties, in Senates controlled by both parties, and with \nadministrations controlled by both parties.\n  It is in the interest of the Senate as a whole to uphold our right to \ndocuments. It is at times essential to our obtaining the information we \nneed to do our jobs. All colleagues should protect the right of any \ncolleague to documents relevant to a nominee in a confirmation process.\n  This information that we seek is directly relevant to the nomination \nof Mr. Flory. The entire Senate should, as an institutional matter, \ninsist on access to the relevant information before we act on his \nnomination. We should speak with one Senatorial voice against executive \nbranch stonewalling on access to relevant information.\n  Mr. Flory has received a recess appointment to the position to which \nhe has been nominated. By refusing to act on his nomination until we \nreceive this information, we are not preventing this individual from \ncarrying out his executive duties. On the contrary, it is the Executive \nBranch which is obstructing the Senate's ability to carry out our \nconfirmation responsibilities when they deny us relevant documents.\n  I hope every member of the Senate will stand together to defend the \nright of the Senate to have access to the relevant documents that bear \non this nomination.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, by way of wrapup, Mr. Flory is nominated \nto be Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy.\n  Peter C.W. Flory, by recess appointment on August 2, 2005, became \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy. He \npreviously served from 2001 to the present as the principal assistant \nto the Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs, who is \nthe principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on the formulation \nand coordination of international security strategy and policy for East \nAsia, South Asia, the Middle East and Persian Gulf, Africa, and Latin \nAmerica.\n  From April 1997 to July 2001, Mr. Flory was Chief Investigative \nCounsel and Special Counsel to the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, SSCI. Mr. Flory had responsibility for the People's \nRepublic of China and other regional issues, as well as \ncounterintelligence, covert action, denial and deception, and other \nintelligence oversight matters.\n  An Honors Graduate of McGill University, Mr. Flory received his law \ndegree from Georgetown University Law Center. After working as a \njournalist, he served as a national security advisor to Members of the \nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. From 1989 to 1992, Mr. Flory served as the Special \nAssistant to Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Paul D. Wolfowitz. \nFrom 1992 to 1993, he was an Associate Coordinator for Counter-\nTerrorism in the Department of State with the rank of Deputy Assistant \nSecretary. From 1993 until he joined the SSCI staff in 1997, Mr. Flory \npracticed law with the firm of Hughes, Hubbard & Reed LLP.\n  Mr. Flory speaks German and French. He and his wife Kathleen have six \nchildren, and reside in Nokesville, Virginia.\n  I would simply conclude, this is somewhat of a dilemma for those not \nfollowing it. This man is eminently qualified to discharge the \nresponsibilities to which the President has nominated him. There is no \ndoubt in my mind.\n  I have worked with my colleague. I will continue to work with my \ncolleague. It is no different than other chairmen and ranking members, \nirrespective of party. We are always in a push-pull contest with the \nexecutive branch regarding the documents we need to perform oversight. \nI do not in any way disparage or criticize my colleague's observations. \nI think he is meticulously correct in what he has set forward to the \nChamber. But the problem is, I am not sure this gentleman was party to \nin any way the obstruction of those documents coming forward. Those \ndecisions primarily were made by his superiors. I think it would \npenalize him for actions of superiors, which superiors were acting as \nthey believed in the best interests of the United States, and within \nthe parameters of the time-honored traditions between the executive and \nlegislative branches about the privacy of certain documents.\n  I hope now we could move on. I see my friend, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. Does he have a few concluding words?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, and I apologize for being \ndistracted and not able to hear the Senator, but apparently it was \nannounced already that this would be the last vote today. I think we \nhave to leave it at that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Wait a minute. I must get from my side a clarification on \nthat. My understanding is there were two votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The last two votes today.\n  Mr. WARNER. You said the last vote. Let's be clear.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I apologize. I think the Senator is correct. It has been \nannounced these will be the last two votes, depending on the outcome of \nthe second vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. We could consequently have a voice vote. I doubt if it \nwill be necessary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me see if we can accomplish that. Mr. WARNER. I see \nthe Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I do not intend to take all that time, but I yield myself 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, there are two issues with respect to Mr. \nFlory. The first is access to documents which are necessary for the \nSenate to do its job. We can't formulate policy, we can't draft \nlegislation, we can't properly review the activities of the Department \nof Defense if we are denied critical information. This Defense \nDepartment persistently, constantly denies information of that sort. \nThis is something about which Senator Levin has made the point very \nwell, made the point about his attempts to get information with respect \nto issues that touch on the activities of Mr. Flory and the activities \nof others. Senator Levin has been denied. Without any justification, \nwithout any legal precedent, they simply said we are not giving it to \nyou--and that is outrageous.\n  Frankly, because we have acquiesced in this policy over many years, \nwe have not done our job in the Senate. We allowed this Defense \nDepartment to take military forces to war without a plan for occupation \nbecause we didn't ask--demand that they give us the information in that \nplan. We have done this repeatedly. It has to stop because it has real \nconsequences in the activities of our military and the effect on these \nyoung men and women across the globe. We have to do our job. Our job \nbegins with getting this type of information.\n  It is outrageous that we continue to sit here and literally beg the \nDefense Department to give us information\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\nthat is rightfully ours because of our responsibilities under the \nConstitution to supervise the activities of the Department of Defense. \nThat is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2 is Mr. Flory, by his own job description, was involved \nwith the formulation and coordination of international security \nstrategy and policy for several areas including the Middle East in \n2001. As Senator Levin pointed out, he was part of this team that \ndeveloped this alternate intelligence view--alternate in the sense that \nit was inaccurate, grossly inaccurate.\n  Now we propose to promote him. There are millions of Americans who \nare wondering who planned this operation in Iraq so poorly. And if they \nfind out, it is not to give these individuals a promotion. There is \nreal responsibility here and that is the other point I find very \ndifficult to accept. No one seems to be accountable for palpable \nmistakes that have been made by the Department of Defense in the \nconduct of these operations--not the Secretary of Defense, not the new \nSecretary of State, who was the National Security Advisor--and now we \nare promoting someone who is deeply involved in the Feith operation \nthat created the alternate intelligence view that was at dramatic odds \nwith the intelligence community, with the suggestion that there were \nserious links between Saddam Hussein, al-Qaida, and other terrorist \ngroups.\n  I think on both these points we should not proceed to this \nnomination. We have to have the information necessary to do our jobs. \nIf we do not, we are not doing our jobs. We are not doing our duty. \nToday I hope is an opportunity to focus attention on, No. 1, the fact \nwe need the information from the Department of Defense, and also I \nthink it is about time someone is held in some degree responsible for \nerrors that have been made by the Department of Defense.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields.\n\n\n                  Vote on Nomination of Dorrance Smith\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination of Dorrance Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Dorrance Smith, of Virginia, to be an Assistant Secretary of \nDefense?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, yesterday the American people received the \nshocking news that the Vice President's former chief of staff, Scooter \nLibby, may have acted on direct orders from President Bush when he \nleaked classified intelligence information to reporters. It is an \nunderstatement to say that this is a serious allegation with national \nsecurity consequences. It directly contradicts previous statements made \nby the President. It continues a pattern of misleading America by this \nBush White House. It raises somber and troubling questions about the \nBush administration's candor with Congress and the American people.\n  Today, I come to the floor to request answers on behalf of our \ntroops, their families, and the American people. For years President \nBush has denied knowing about conversations between his top aides and \nWashington reporters, conversations where his aides, like Scooter \nLibby, sought to justify the war in Iraq and discredit the White \nHouse's critics by leaking national security secrets. In fact, \nPresident Bush is on record clearly, in September of 2003, as saying:\n\n       I don't know of anybody in my administration who leaked \n     classified information. If somebody did leak classified \n     information, I'd like to know it, and we'll take appropriate \n     action.\n\n  Yesterday, we found there is much more to the story. According to \ncourt records, President Bush may have personally authorized the very \nleaks he denied knowing anything about. In light of this disturbing \nnews, we need to hear from President Bush which of these is true: His \ncomments in 2003 or the statements made by the Vice President's chief \nof staff. Only the President can put this matter to rest.\n  Harry Truman had on his desk in the Oval Office a plaque. It said: \n``The buck stops here.'' In George Bush's White House, perhaps he \nshould put one that says: The leaks start here.\n  He, the President of the United States, must tell the American people \nwhether President Bush's Oval Office is a place where the buck stops or \nthe leaks start. This is a question he alone must answer, not a \nspokesman, not a statement, only the President of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for his courtesy. I ask unanimous consent to speak this \nafternoon for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3367-4", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3367-S3368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WITHDRAWAL OF U.S. TROOPS FROM IRAQ\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a simple proposition: \nCongress should act like a coequal branch of Government and vote on \nwhether to keep American troops in Iraq for at least 3 more years. Late \nlast month, the President told the American people that it is his \nintent to keep American soldiers in Iraq through the end of his term in \noffice. He has never before made such a sweeping commitment. When the \nSenate voted in October of 2002 to send troops to Iraq, few Americans \nbelieved then that the U.S. military would be in Iraq in 2006, let \nalone 2009 or beyond. Based on what the Bush administration said then, \nAmericans would be justified in thinking that by now Iraq would be free \nand democratic. Based on what the Bush administration said then, \nAmericans would be justified in thinking that by now Iraq would be \nstable and self-supporting. Based on what the Bush administration said \nthen, Americans would be justified in thinking that by now the vast \nmajority of U.S. forces, if not all of them, would be safely back home.\n  Unfortunately, the rosy forecast put out by the White House and the \nPentagon in 2002 perished in the harsh reality of Iraq.\n  The failure to plan for the post-war period has thus far created less \nsecurity for the world, greater heartache for Iraq, and extraordinary \ncosts for America.\n  As of today, neither the American people nor the Congress knows how \nthe President intends to get American troops out of Iraq. Instead, \nvirtually every day, the administration offers a new theory for how \ndiscouraging events on the ground in Iraq are actually positive signs.\n  Here is what is indisputable: 2,348 American soldiers are dead, \n17,469 are injured, and 262 billion taxpayer dollars have been spent.\n  If our troops remain in Iraq for at least 3 more years, how many more \nwill die, how many more will be injured? How many more hundreds of \nbillions of dollars will it cost?\n  By all accounts, the insurgency remains strong and is constantly \nattacking and killing American soldiers, Iraqi soldiers, and Iraqi \ncivilians. Every day there is another bombing, another brutal image on \nthe TV that reflects the chaos that passes for an average day in Iraq.\n  Sectarian violence is rampant. The ethnic strife is so grave that \nShiites and Sunnis living in mixed neighborhoods are fleeing for the \nsafety of ethnic enclaves.\n  In recent months, there have been more and more groups of bodies \nfound--hands bound, shot in the back of the head or beheaded--and many \nIraqis have come to believe that their own Iraqi Interior Ministry is \nparticipating in these death squad-style killings.\n  According to Ambassador Khalilzad, the ``potential is there'' for \nall-out civil war. That, my friends, is an understatement. As former \nPrime Minister Allawi concedes, a low-level civil war is already being \nwaged in Iraq.\n  The so-called ``enduring bases'' that the Pentagon has built in Iraq \ncertainly create the appearance that the Bush administration intends \nfor the United States to occupy Iraq indefinitely, unnecessarily \nfostering ill-will among the Iraqi population and throughout the Arab \nworld.\n  Oil production, household fuel availability, and electricity \nproduction are lower than they were 2 years ago. Iraqis have \nelectricity half of each day. About 32 percent of Iraqis are \nunemployed.\n  The list of problems that plague Iraq goes on and on.\n  Supporters of the war tout the Iraqi forces that are standing up and \ntaking responsibility for security. Yet it has been reported that not a \nsingle Iraqi security force battalion can operate without U.S. \nassistance. The Iraqi police force is plagued by absenteeism and \nmilitia infiltration. The level of incompetence is high enough that \nU.S. forces are reluctant to hand over their best weapons to the \nIraqis.\n\n  You will also hear supporters of the war point to the three elections \nas proof of progress. Yes, there have been elections. But as the \ncurrent impasse makes clear, elections are just the beginning. And \nwhile those elected have been deliberating for the past 3 months, \nunable to reach consensus over the makeup of the new Iraqi Government, \ninsurgents have been exploiting the power vacuum to kill, to maim, and \nto instill terror and fear.\n  Supporters of the war will also point to our reconstruction efforts. \nBut billions of reconstruction dollars have been misused, misspent, or \nlost by American contractors, like Halliburton, and Iraqi ministries, \nincluding the Ministry of Oil.\n\n[[Page S3368]]\n\n  While in Iraq recently, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, I sat down with representatives of the Oil Ministry to \ndiscuss the issue of graft. After I repeatedly pointed to independent \nanalyses documenting the serious corruption problems within the Iraqi \noil sector, the Iraqi officials finally acknowledged that there were \n``small'' problems with graft in this sector. Considering that oil \naccounts for more than 90 percent of the country's revenues, this ought \nto be extremely disturbing to Congress and people all across America.\n  Just as the President made the case to go to war, he owes it to \nCongress and the American people to come to Congress and lay out his \nplan and his budget for achieving a lasting peace in Iraq.\n  Congress owes it to the American people and the institution to vote.\n  If the President refuses to come to Congress in the coming weeks with \nhis plan and his budget to win the peace in Iraq, Congress owes it to \nthe American people to vote up or down on whether to keep American \ntroops in Iraq for at least 3 more years.\n  The President's case for winning the peace in Iraq should address \nthese concerns:\n  First, how the President can help make the Iraqis self-reliant so \nthat they can defeat the deadly insurgency.\n  Second, how the President intends to help Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish \nleaders break the political impasse so that they can form a unity \ngovernment.\n  Third, how the President intends to pull the Iraqi people back from \nthe brink of all-out civil war and the specter of another Rwanda or \nDarfur.\n  Fourth, how the President intends to help rebuild the Iraqi \ninfrastructure and ensure that Iraqis have access to basic services \nlike electricity and clean water.\n  And fifth, how the President intends to bring the troops home from \nIraq.\n  If need be, to be sensitive to national security matters, I would not \nbe averse to the Senate moving into Executive Session to consider \nportions of the President's plan and his budget for securing the peace \nin Iraq.\n  I simply ask the President to come to Congress and describe his plan \nand his budget specifically, and let Congress consider its potential to \nsucceed before the Congress, with its silence, consents to 3 more years \nof very costly involvement in Iraq.\n  The vote I call for today, if held, won't be about cutting-and-\nrunning. It won't be about who comes up with the best spin. It will be \nabout holding the President and Congress accountable. The vote will \nhold the President accountable for presenting a plan and a budget for \nsecuring the peace. And the vote will hold Congress accountable by \nmaking it finally act like a co-equal branch of government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOregon, who has just spoken, for what he has said. I shall read his \nspeech carefully tonight, the Lord willing, the general theme of which \nI am in accordance with. His was a speech that had to be said and ought \nto be said. It was in his words. I might have made it with a change or \ntwo. But we are together, as we were when the Senator and I joined the \nimmortal spirits of the 23 who on that day cast the most important vote \nthat I have ever cast in my 48 years now in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3368-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3368-S3369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              EASTER WEEK\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this Sunday, April 9, is Palm Sunday, thank \nGod. It marks the beginning of the Christian holy week and Easter. The \nSenate will recess today so that Members might celebrate this holy week \nin the home churches, among their families, friends, and constituents. \nBefore we adjourn, I would like to give a little consideration to those \nworld-shaping events of some 2,000 years ago.\n  Whether one counts himself or herself as a Christian of any \ndenomination or a follower of any other faith, one must admit that the \nman, the person, at the center of the Easter celebration was and is a \nfigure of historical import, just as are the founding figures of the \nrest of the world's religions. There are today, by some estimates, \napproximately 2.1 billion Christians of all denominations, more than \nany other religious affiliation, and almost twice as many as those who \ndescribe themselves as secular, nonreligious, agnostic, or atheist--1.1 \nbillion. By way of contrast, there are approximately 1.3 billion \nadherents of Islam and just 14 million of Jesus' Jewish faith. That one \nman's example and teachings have affected so many people so deeply and \nfor so many years is a testament to his faith.\n  On Palm Sunday, a rabbi from Galilee, whom we know best today as \nJesus, made a public entrance into Jerusalem to celebrate the Jewish \nholiday of Passover.\n  In doing so, Jesus surely knew what was in store for Him. He knew--He \nknew--He was a wanted man. He knew He was a wanted man--He knew it--\nmarked for arrest by the civil authorities who feared that He would \nincite a rebellion that would lead to Roman occupation and unprotected \nby religious authorities who feared His teachings and who could not \ncountenance His refusal to deny being more than human. But still He \ncame. Still He came and the people cheered and threw palm leaves, a \nsymbol of triumph and the national symbol of an independent Palestine, \nbefore his path. What a remarkable act of faith. What a remarkable act \nof faith to come willingly to one's tragic end, seeing through the \nsuffering to the miracle of resurrection. The miracle; the miracle of \nresurrection. What a remarkable act of courage, to remain silent and \nsmiling at the people He knew would not or could not aid Him in His \nfinal hours.\n  Some 2,000 years later, those 2.1 billion Christians around the world \ncommemorate Jesus' final entry into Jerusalem by making crosses out of \npalm fronds, combining the triumphant entrance with the lasting image \nof Jesus Christ on the cross.\n  By Thursday, called Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday, Jesus' freedom \nended after His last meal, when He was arrested and imprisoned, \nbetrayed--yes, betrayed--by Judas for 30 pieces of silver. \nForeknowledge could not have made those fateful moments any easier to \nbear. On Good Friday, Christians will solemnly remember His suffering \nand death upon the cross. Candles and lights will be extinguished in \nmemory of His final hours. Good Friday remains a sad, dark day despite \nthe knowledge of His resurrection to leaven the terrible suffering He \nendured.\n  Holy Saturday is a day of vigil, as Christians figuratively keep \nwatch over Christ's tomb and await the glorious resurrection to come. \nAnd Easter Sunday, or Resurrection Sunday, is a joyful, glorious day of \nreaffirmed faith, of promises kept, of hope restored.\n  I read now from the Book of St. Matthew, the 28th chapter, the first \nthrough the seventh verses, the King James version of the Holy Bible:\n\n       In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the \n     first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary \n     to see the sepulchre.\n       And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of \n     the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the \n     stone from the door, and sat upon it.\n       His countenance was like lightening, and his raiment white \n     as snow:\n       And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as \n     dead men.\n       And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not \n     ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\n       He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the \n     place where [Jesus] lay.\n\n  The scriptures say:\n\n       Come, see the place where the Lord lay.\n       And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen \n     from the dead; and, behold, He ``goeth before you into \n     Galilee; there shall ye see Him: Lo, I have told you.''\n\n  For the next 40 days, Christ proved to his followers that He had, \nindeed, risen from the dead. Then He ascended into Heaven, fulfilling \nthe final promise of His wondrous life. As John 3:16 so beautifully \nsummed up the central promise of the Christian faith, ``For God so \nloved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever \nbelieveth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.'' In \nJesus' resurrection and ascension, God offers the greatest and only \nproof of His love and His promise that in death, there is life in \nfaith. That--that, not chocolate bunnies and colorful eggs--is the \ngreat gift of Easter. Its comfort and solace linger on in the soul even \nlonger than chocolate does on the lips. It warms us even more during \nsad times--yes--than does the spring sun after a cold and cheerless \nwinter.\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\n  And so it is because of this great gift, this promise--yes, this \npromise of everlasting life and the heart-searing proof through \nsacrifice that Christianity survived the passing of its founder. Nearly \n2,000 years later, the words and example of the Rabbi from Galilee \nmotivate and support over 2 billion--over 2 billion--people around the \nworld. Governments have tried to stamp Him out, but still He endures in \nthe hearts of His devout followers. Technology has tried to distract \nus, but still His word--yes, his word--beckons. I am sure that whatever \ntrials and tribulations lie ahead, His teachings and faith will offer \ncomfort and hope no matter how bleak the future might appear. In all of \nthe moments of our lives, large and small, joyful and desolate, \ntriumphant and abject, He--yes, He is there at our side with support \nand hope. I do feel for those 1.2 billion people who do not have faith \nto sustain them and give them strength. It is a deep, deep well of \nsupport and nourishment for the weary soul--for the weary soul.\n  Mr. President, I close my speech with the words of Henry Wadsworth \nLongfellow from his poem ``Christus: A Mystery.'' In the poem, Prince \nHenry is speaking to Elsie as they cross the square:\n\n       This is the day, when from the dead our Lord arose; and \n     everywhere, out of their darkness and despair, triumphant \n     over fears and foes, the hearts of his disciples rose, when \n     to the women, standing near, the angel in shining vesture \n     said, ``The Lord is risen; He is not here!'' And, mindful \n     that the day is come, on all the hearths in Christendom the \n     fires are quenched, to be again rekindled from the sun, that \n     high is dancing in the cloudless sky. The churches are all \n     decked with flowers, the salutations among men are but the \n     Angel's words divine, ``Christ is arisen!'' And the bells \n     catch the glad murmur, as it swells, and chant together in \n     their towers. All hearts are glad; and free from care the \n     faces of the people shine. See what a crowd is in the square, \n     gayly and gallantly arrayed!\n\n  Mr. President, let me close--and I hope I have not imposed too long \non the Senate and on my friends who may have been waiting--let me close \nwith these words spoken by William Jennings Bryan in his speech on \nimmortality. Now is the time to think about it. That is what Easter is: \nthe promise of immortality.\n\n       If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold \n     and pulseless heart of the buried acorn, and make it burst \n     forth from its prison walls again in the mighty Oak, will He \n     leave neglected in the Earth the soul of man, who was made in \n     the image of his Creator? If He stoops to give to the \n     rosebush, whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn \n     breeze, the sweet assurance of another springtime, will He \n     withhold all the words of hope from the sons of men when the \n     frosts of winter come? If Matter, mute and inanimate, though \n     changed by the forces of Nature into a multitude of forms, \n     can never die, will the imperial spirit of man suffer \n     annihilation after a brief visit to this tenement of clay?\n\n  No.\n\n       Rather, let us believe that He who, in his apparent \n     prodigality, wastes not the raindrop, the blade of grass, or \n     the evening's sighing zephyr, but makes them all to carry out \n     His eternal plans, has given immortality to the mortal.\n\n  Amen.\n\n\n                in thanks to jay and sharon rockefeller\n\n  Mr. President, at this time of Easter, at this time of rejoicing in \nthe promise of eternal life, I also rejoice in the friendship that I \nshare with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Jay Rockefeller, \nand his lovely wife, Sharon. Jay and Sharon Rockefeller are jewels. \nThey have always opened their doors and their hearts to me and to my \ndarling wife, Erma.\n  For more than 20 years, Jay Rockefeller and I have worked in \npartnership for the people of West Virginia. There have been good times \nand bad; moments of great joy and moments of great hardship. But at \neach turn, we have stood together for our State, the Mountain State, \nWest Virginia, where Mountaineers are always free.\n  In the past few years, when my wife battled against illness, Jay \nRockefeller always took the time to ask about her. He and Sharon always \nwanted to know how Erma was. Stand her side-by-side with Jay, and Erma \nprobably didn't reach his chest. But she had a place in his and \nSharon's heart, just as he and Sharon did in hers.\n  Today, Senator Jay Rockefeller is recovering from back surgery. He \nhas missed some time in the Senate, and we have missed him here. I know \nthat Jay will be back on his feet soon. And, when he walks through the \nSenate door, I shall welcome him with open arms.\n  I wish Senator Jay Rockefeller and his charming wife, Sharon, a most \nblessed Easter, and I thank them for their long and warm friendship \ntoward Erma and me.\n  I thank all Senators, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a little bit of \nsadness in my voice, but also with a lot of happiness about an occasion \nthat is going to be taking place in about 30 minutes at the University \nof Georgia in Athens, GA, where I had hoped to be today, but, \nunfortunately, the business of the Senate required us to stay here. \nToday at 2 o'clock there will be a dedication of the Paul Coverdell \nCenter for Biomedical and Health Sciences at the University of Georgia \nin Athens. This building is going to be named for a man who was not \nonly a close friend of mine, but he was a close political ally.\n  He is a man who served in the Georgia Legislature for almost two \ndecades and served in the U.S. Senate for 8 years, from 1992 to 2000, \nwhen, unfortunately, he died much too early as a result of a very \nsudden illness that he developed.\n  Paul Coverdell was a man of great vision, one of the hardest working \nindividuals I have ever known in my life, and a man who truly believed \nin what was best for his country. He was a man who served, not just in \nthe Senate in Washington, but he also was a director of the Peace Corps \nunder President George Herbert Walker Bush. Today, President Bush and \nMrs. Bush are in Athens to be the keynote speakers at the dedication of \nthis building.\n  Paul Coverdell was a man who really took the Peace Corps to a \ndifferent level. I was very pleased, along with a number of other \nMembers of this body--particularly his close friend, Phil Gramm, the \nformer Senator from Texas--and a number of other individuals who \nattended the dedication ceremony at the Old Executive Office Building \nin 2001, when President George W. Bush announced that we were naming \nthe headquarters of the Peace Corps the Paul D. Coverdell Peace Corps \nHeadquarters Building.\n  Paul had a great vision for biomedical science as well as research, \nso I think it is only fitting that today the building in Athens at the \nUniversity of Georgia be named for him. Were it not for the hard work \nand the vision of another Member of this Senate, Senator Zell Miller, \nwho succeeded Senator Coverdell, that probably would not have happened.\n  While it is sad to think of the fact that Paul is no longer with us, \nfor him to be remembered as he is being remembered today, once again, \non the campus of the University of Georgia, which is my alma mater, \ngives me a great feeling about carrying on the life, the vision, and \nthe hope that Paul Coverdell had for our country.\n  His wife Nancy was very active in Paul's political life. She \ncontinues to be a very vivacious lady today. She happens to serve as \nthe chairman of my military academy appointment committee, and does she \never do a terrific job. She is a great lady in and of herself, but Paul \nCoverdell was a special person.\n  He rose very rapidly in the leadership of the Senate after his \nelection. He became the secretary of the conference and served his \nconference well. He served not only his Republican colleagues well, but \nhe was an individual who, on virtually every occasion when he worked on \nan issue, reached across the aisle to Members on the Democratic side to \nmake sure they were included in the process, and that his ideas and his \nvisions for a greater America would always be shared and there would be \ncooperation with the folks on both sides of the aisle.\n  Today I stand with a little bit of a heavy heart but with a wonderful \nremembrance of a great friend, a man with whom I spent so much time, \ntalking about not only politics. During the\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\n8 years I served in the House, Paul was here in the Senate for most of \nthose years. We had occasion to talk by telephone at least once a week. \nWe made it a point to visit about things that were happening both in \nour State as well as here in Washington.\n  He is a man with whom I also had the opportunity to talk about life \nand about how to not only set examples, as Paul did--and I have always \nsubscribed to but have never reached the level that Paul did--but he is \na man who also just gave you a great feeling about the direction in \nwhich our country was headed.\n  When I had the opportunity to talk with Nancy Coverdell this morning, \nI expressed my significant disappointment in not being there today but, \nthank goodness, she being a wife of a former Member of the Senate, \nunderstood that our life up here is not controlled by our wishes and \ndesires but oftentimes by people on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. President, there has been almost a raging debate \naround here these last couple of days on evaluations of what is taking \nplace in Iraq, where do we stand in this war--almost a war of \nattrition, as I see it.\n  And included in the reports on deaths, killings, this morning we \nheard about an explosion, with suicide bombers detonating a bomb in a \nmosque that killed around 40 people. It is almost a daily thing that we \nhear and see, the horror of families being torn apart by the loss of a \nloved one. Children, men, women, it does not matter. It is just \nuniversal killing and demolition. It is a terrible act to witness.\n  Now we have some different news that has come about to accompany \nthose stories of horror from Iraq. Everybody now knows that the Vice \nPresident's former chief of staff, Scooter Libby, has been indicted as \npart of the investigation into the leak of classified material from the \nWhite House.\n  I remember when this controversy broke. President Bush acted \nincredulous that anyone would leak classified national security \ninformation. In fact, in September 2003, the President said:\n\n       There's just too many leaks, and if there is a leak out of \n     my administration, I want to know who it is.\n\n  But now we find out--I think embarrassingly for the President, \nembarrassingly for the United States--we now find out that the \nPresident himself was ordering a leak of classified material. And he \nleaked that classified information for political reasons. He was trying \nto undo some of the political damage caused by the disclosure that the \nintelligence community did not believe Iraq was trying to purchase \nuranium. There it was: the reason we went to Iraq in the first place, \nand substantial doubts.\n  People who supported that view are now challenging the intelligence \nthat led us there, or at least the intelligence reports we got. Now, \nhere we are, still bogged down in Iraq, with no hope in sight to fix \nthe mess we have caused there.\n  Yesterday, there was debate between two of our colleagues. One was \nSenator Kerry, who served in Vietnam, decorated for that service, the \nother was the Senator from Colorado, who was harsh in his criticism of \nSenator Kerry's speech on Iraq.\n  Now, Senator Kerry and I are both veterans. I am a veteran of World \nWar II, and I served in Europe during the war. His, again, \ndistinguished service in Vietnam is well known. So we are both \nveterans, and we are very interested in the military analysis of the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  The speech of the Senator from Colorado sounded much like White House \ntalking points: short on facts, long on innuendo and fantasy.\n  While politicians in Washington sometimes wear rose-colored glasses \nand fantasize about the situation in Iraq, American troops are dying, \nAmerican troops are wounded. One need only visit Walter Reed Hospital \nto see how serious some of those wounds are. People have lost limbs. \nPeople lose their sight. People suffer very severely from post-\ntraumatic stress, invisible wounds that penetrate, nevertheless, very \ndeeply.\n  I have gone to many memorial services and funerals for young people \nfrom New Jersey who died in Iraq. Seventy-three soldiers from my home \nState of New Jersey have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. As I mentioned, \nI have visited Walter Reed Army Hospital here in Washington several \ntimes, and I have been struck by the incredible resilience and \ndedication to our country of those young Americans, those who want to \nbe able to pick up arms again so they can do their duty. And while \nthese brave men and women put their lives on the line, the \nadministration is simply ignoring reality.\n  Paul Eaton, a former commanding general of the Coalition Military \nAssistance and Training Team, wrote in the New York Times on March 19, \nrecently, that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is--and here I \nquote the Times--``not competent to lead our armed forces.''\n  Eaton further said that Rumsfeld ``has shown himself incompetent \nstrategically, operationally and tactically, and is far more than \nanyone else responsible for what has happened to our important mission \nin Iraq. Mr. Rumsfeld must step down.''\n  This past Sunday on ``Meet The Press,'' retired General Anthony \nZinni, who just published a book, repeated the call for Mr. Rumsfeld to \nresign. General Zinni of the U.S. Marine Corps is a former Commander of \nthe Central Command. He said Secretary Rumsfeld should be held \naccountable for tactical mistakes in Iraq.\n  I had the opportunity the other night to go to a testimonial for \nGeneral Shalikashvili and saw films of him done with former Secretary \nof State Colin Powell, President Clinton--all kinds of testimonials. As \nI looked at General Shalikashvili, I recalled how splendidly he handled \nhis assignment as the Chief of the joint members of the senior staff \nand recalled that he said that in Iraq we would need perhaps 300,000 \ntroops or more. He was right. And we never delivered on that \ncommitment. As a consequence, in many military circles it is believed \nthat lack of force is responsible for some of the problems we currently \nsee.\n\n  Several days after General Zinni spoke, President Bush dismissed \ncalls for Rumsfeld to step down, saying he was ``satisfied'' with his \nperformance.\n  How in the world can the Commander-in-Chief, President Bush, be \nsatisfied with the situation in Iraq? It is chaotic. It is near a civil \nwar. The definition of a ``civil war'' is that people within the same \ncountry are fighting one another. My gosh, it could not be clearer.\n  So how can he be satisfied with Secretary Rumsfeld's miscalculations, \nwith his profound errors in judgment, with his stubborn unwillingness \nto admit mistakes?\n  These mistakes have had tragic consequences--tragic for the nearly \n2,400 American men and women who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, \ntragic for the families they have left behind.\n  To examine the incompetence a little bit further--I have not been in \nIraq in the last couple of years. I was there then, and I met with \ntroops, and they were asking for better body armor. They were asking \nfor better Humvee armor. And it took 2 years to loosen up those \nproducts to protect our troops. How incompetent must one be for the \nPresident not to be up in arms?\n  After my visit, I said I was going to the Defense Department, and \ndid, requesting expedited treatment for these articles that our troops \nneeded to protect themselves and to fight the war fully.\n  We know that most of the claims of the Bush administration in the \nleadup\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\nto war were simply false. The administration claimed there was a \nconnection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. Not true.\n  The Bush administration claimed that there were weapons of mass \ndestruction there. Not true.\n  The Bush administration claimed that the war would cost ``in the \nrange of 50 to 60 billion dollars.'' Not true. The wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, including the next supplemental to be brought before the \nCongress in coming weeks, will total a half a trillion dollars, nearly \n$7 billion a month spent just in Iraq.\n  The Bush administration said before the war the oil revenues from \nIraq could bring ``between 50 and 100 billion [dollars] over the course \nof the next two to three years.'' Not true again.\n  President Bush announced, ``Mission accomplished,'' on May 1, 2003. \nHe lulled the Nation into believing that it was all settled: Families, \nlook forward to your kids coming home. Look forward to families \nrestored. Look forward to fathers and mothers coming back to their \nchildren. He told the Nation that major combat in Iraq was over. Not \ntrue. Ninety percent of the Americans who have died in Iraq have died \nsince combat operations had supposedly ``ended.''\n  The Bush administration claimed that the Iraq insurgency was in its \n``last throes.'' Not true. We know the insurgency has gained strength. \nGeneral Abizaid recently said the number of foreign terrorists \ninfiltrating Iraq has increased.\n  Since the last week of February, sectarian violence and death have \nreached new heights, while electricity production has dropped below \nprewar levels. Unemployment ranges from 30 to 60 percent.\n  The American people do not want their leader to deny reality. They \nwant to hear the truth.\n  People on the floor of the Senate have heard me say it time and time \nagain: I will never understand why the President of the United States \nrefuses to let journalists, photographers, journalists who do \nphotography, come in and take pictures of flag-draped coffins--flag-\ndraped coffins. It is the country's last sign of honoring its dead. \nThey are unable to take pictures of that because they do not want to \ntell the American people the truth about what is happening. It is, in \nmy view, insulting to those families whose loved ones sacrificed their \nlives on the battlefield. Outrageous.\n  They do not want to tell us the truth. What they want to do is tell \nus untruths. Leaking information is inexcusable, when the penalties for \nanyone who leaks that information could be jail time.\n  The President of the United States, President Bush, under the guise \nof releasing the classification of sensitive material, had passed \ninformation, with Vice President Cheney apparently being the person who \nfurnished it, according to Libby, who is now fighting for his freedom. \nSo he is saying things that he can prove, I would imagine; otherwise, \nhe would not dare say it.\n  We are sick and tired of this war. I am not saying what the date is \nthat we have to leave there, but I am saying that the date has passed \nfor the truth, for knowing what is really happening there, for knowing \nwhat our troops and their families can expect.\n  Last week, I went to a return-home function in New Jersey, people who \nhave come back. They were away, some of them, 18 months--little kids \nrunning around who haven't seen their fathers or mothers for that \nperiod of time. It is outrageous. We are in a state of confusion that \ndefies imagination, that we, this country, with all of its might and \nall of its wealth, can't figure out some way to deal with this problem, \nafter having made empty promises about how easy it was going to be--\n``treats and sweets'' was one of the expressions used--totally \nmisunderstanding, not thinking about what it was going to take, not \nonly to fight this war but how do you win it. And winning it means that \nyou go home triumphant. Not so.\n  We see in front of us a situation that reminds us of the sad days of \nVietnam, when we wanted to extricate ourselves and couldn't quite do it \nuntil the pain was so excruciating that the population could no longer \nstand it. We need a leader who sees clearly what is really happening \nand who speaks candidly--we can take bad news; we don't like it, but we \ncan take it--about what is taking place in front of our eyes on \ntelevision and newspapers in our homes. We can take the news. We will \naccept it and fight on to rebuild our strength and our moral conviction \nabout what we are doing. But we need to know the truth on how to do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, before I speak on the subject of \nimmigration, I would like to make a couple of brief remarks, having \nnoted the comments of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey about \nthe difficult military struggle we are in today in Iraq. I wanted to \nmake the observation that the distinguished Senator talked about his \nvery honorable and distinguished service at another time and in another \nstruggle during World War II. He speaks with shock and dismay--and it \nis a subject of great dismay--about the fact that there has been death \nand there are family separations and there are injuries as a result of \nthe great sacrifice our men and women are making today in Iraq with \ngreat valor and distinction which we highly honor, just like he and \nothers did in World War II.\n  The question is, Is it worth it? Are we in this matter of a war over \nthere with a choice to do anything other than success?\n  What I didn't hear from the Senator was a solution, a plan, an idea \nof how he might extricate us from this effort differently. I believe \nthe only way is to pursue it until its conclusion, when it is \nultimately a peaceful and democratic Iraq. To do otherwise would do \ngreat harm to the honor of those who serve and those who have \nsacrificed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3371-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3371-S3372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I turn now to a subject we have been involved in all \nthis week, the subject of immigration. I am very pleased that Leader \nFrist and Chairman Specter have chosen to utilize the product of the \ngood work of Senator Hagel for a number of years, for over 5 years, on \nthis issue of immigration, an effort which I was glad to join in over \nthe last couple of weeks and which now appears to be poised to be the \nbasis of a sensible and reasonable compromise. I am pleased that this \nwill be the vehicle which will be on the Senate floor when we return to \nthis topic sometime in the next month. I am grateful to Senator McCain \nand Senator Kennedy for their leadership on this issue, for all the \nwork they have done. Others who have worked with us on this--Senators \nBrownback, Graham, Salazar, and Lieberman--have all been a huge help as \nwe tried to put together a way in which we can deal better with this \ncomplicated and very much broken down system of immigration.\n  We approach this issue by securing the borders, by dealing with a \nguest worker program, and by recognizing that the 1 million people who \nare in this country living under the radar, in the shadows, need a way \nout, need a way for us to welcome them into the mainstream of American \nlife where they have now been, many of them, living for years and \nyears, contributing, working, making a difference.\n  It does not give them amnesty. It requires a number of steps for them \nto go through. For those who have been here 2 years or less, it does \nnot provide for them a vehicle to remain. For those who have been here \n5 years or less, it requires that they return to a port of entry and \nmake a legal entry into the United States before they can then follow a \npath toward normalized and regularized status.\n  The provisions of this bill have the support and encouragement of a \nlarge majority of the Senate. I hope over the next several days the \nprocedural issues which prevented this matter from being voted upon, \nwhere I believe--and I know Senator Hagel believes--we would have had \nsubstantial majority support, will have a chance to be heard. I am \nstill hopeful and optimistic. It is\n\n[[Page S3372]]\n\ntoo important to the country. It is an issue that deserves a response. \nIt deserves an answer and needs a solution.\n  I am very pleased to be working with the Presiding Officer on this \nissue. I hope in the next few days and weeks we will have an \nopportunity for full, fair debate and then a vote up or down on what is \nsomething of great need so we can engage with the House of \nRepresentatives in a conference committee and final resolution to this \ndifficult issue for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President. I am concerned with the lack of progress \nbeing made in conference on reaching a final agreement on the pension \nbill. To this point, little movement has been made to bridge the \ndifferences between the House and Senate bills.\n  This process does not need to be a partisan one. Throughout \nconsideration of the pension bill, Democrats have worked with \nRepublicans to move forward on pension reform. The Senate, working in a \nbipartisan manner, was able to produce a strong bill that passed by a \nvote of 97 to 2.\n  Democrats are eager to participate in the conference negotiations and \nare committed to enacting a strong pension reform bill. It is my hope \nthat a conference agreement can be completed in a timely manner so that \nthe uncertainty surrounding pensions can be resolved.\n  However, House Republicans seem intent on producing a bill without \nincluding Democrats. That would be unfortunate and is likely to produce \na bill that fails to meet the principles supported by the Democratic \ncaucus.\n  The Senate pension bill was crafted with bipartisan participation, \nand that approach produced a bill that received almost unanimous \nsupport in the Senate. Working together, the conferees can produce a \nconference agreement that would garner an equally strong vote.\n  Attached is a set of principles that our caucus has supported \nthroughout consideration of this important bill. I believe these \nprinciples should be the basis for any agreement reported by the \nconference. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     The conference agreement should include balanced funding \n         rules\n       The conference agreement should strike a proper balance \n     between improving pension funding and keeping these plans an \n     attractive benefit option for employers. While there is a \n     trend away from defined benefit pension plans and this trend \n     is likely to continue, rules should not be enacted that \n     exacerbate this problem.\n       The key is to establish new rules that impose stronger \n     funding requirements while maintaining incentives for \n     employers to continue these plans. The Administration missed \n     the mark on this. Their focus was primarily on the health of \n     the PBGC and the ramifications for the future of defined \n     benefit pension plans were considered collateral damage.\n       Democrats in the Senate share the concern over the PBGC's \n     finances, but they also want help to preserve the traditional \n     defined benefit system.\n     The conference agreement should protect older workers while \n         clarifying the status of cash balance plans\n       As a type of defined benefit pension plan, cash balance \n     plans contain protections for participants that Democrats \n     support.\n       Cash balance plans are insured by the PBGC. They provide \n     greater portability for workers. And they are more easily \n     understood by participants.\n       On the other hand, some companies used conversions to cash \n     balance plans to hide the fact that they were cutting \n     benefits for workers. In some instances older workers saw \n     their future pension accruals frozen for many years as a \n     result of ``wearaway'' provisions of the new plans.\n       Recent court decisions on the legality of cash balance \n     plans have created uncertainty for employers who maintain \n     cash balance plans. Congress should clear up this \n     uncertainty, but Senate Democrats will insist that rules be \n     established to protect older workers.\n     The conference agreement should include targeted relief for \n         troubled industries\n       The airline industry, and more importantly its workers, has \n     faced difficult times the past few years. Those difficulties \n     are likely to continue for some time.\n       In recognition of these difficulties, the Senate bill gives \n     the airlines more time before the new stricter funding rules \n     apply. This idea also has strong support in the House where a \n     motion to instruct the House conferees to accept the Senate \n     provision passed by a vote of 265-158.\n       The conference agreement must include relief to troubled \n     industries.\n     The conference agreement should improve employer-based \n         retirement savings plans\n       The Senate bill includes changes to defined contribution \n     plans that address the problems uncovered as a result of the \n     collapse of Enron.\n       These changes include getting better and timelier \n     information to plan participants and giving participants \n     greater ability to diversify away from employer stock.\n       The Senate bill also includes provisions allowing employers \n     to incorporate automatic enrollment in their plans. The \n     overwhelming evidence suggests that auto enrollment will \n     significantly increase worker participation in DC plans.\n       Many 401(k) plan participants are looking for specific \n     advice on how to invest their plan assets. Employers who \n     would like to provide this to their employers are usually \n     advised not to do so because it could subject the employer to \n     liability for investment losses. The Senate bill provides \n     employers relief from this liability so long as the \n     investment advisors are independent.\n     The conference agreement should include reform of \n         multiemployer pension plans\n       Multiemployer plans are defined benefit plans maintained by \n     two or more employers. One in four pension plan participants \n     are members of multiemployer plans.\n       Employers, employer associations, unions and multiemployer \n     plans have worked together on a package of changes to improve \n     multiemployer plan funding.\n       The conference agreement must include reforms that give \n     these plans the tools they need to address their funding \n     needs.\n     The conference agreement cannot include provisions that \n         undermine patient's rights\n       At the 11th hour the House leadership inserted a special \n     interest provision into the pension bill to benefit the \n     insurance industry.\n       This provision would put insurance companies ahead of \n     injured patients in any claim against wrongdoers.\n     The conference agreement should modernize ERISA without \n         weakening worker protections\n       In the 32 years since ERISA was enacted it has served \n     pension plan participants quite well. The Senate bill makes \n     improvements to these rules while retaining important worker \n     protections.\n       Conferees should be very cautious about going further than \n     the Senate bill.\n       The financial strain facing pension plans makes it even \n     more critical to retain provisions that guard against self \n     dealing and conflicts of interest.\n       Recent scandals involving some mutual fund and other \n     financial services providers highlights that these \n     protections are vital to protecting our current and future \n     retirees.\n     The conference agreement should be fiscally responsible\n       The Senate bill's cost is modest at $12 billion, \n     attributable to the changes made to the funding rules and the \n     cost of the automatic enrollment changes.\n       The House loaded up its pension reform bill with nearly $87 \n     billion in tax cuts over the next ten years.\n       The Savers credit, which helps low- and middle income \n     families save for retirement expires at the end of this year. \n     It certainly should be extended, and is included in the list \n     of expiring provisions that are part of the conference \n     negotiations on the tax reconciliation bill.\n       The House also included permanent extension of the higher \n     contribution limits for 401(k) plans and IRAs that were part \n     of the 2001 tax cut bill. These provisions are popular, but \n     they don't expire for another four years. There are many \n     equally popular tax provisions that have already expired and \n     should be considered first. For example, the research credit, \n     the state and local sales tax deduction, the credit for \n     hiring disadvantaged workers, and the deduction for classroom \n     expenses paid by teachers have all already expired. Before we \n     consider provisions that won't expire for another four years, \n     we need to extend these important items.\n       The remaining tax cuts in the House bill relate to health \n     care. Health care affordability is an important issue, which \n     deserves to be addressed in its own right on a comprehensive \n     basis, not piecemeal as an afterthought to this pension bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3372-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3372-S3373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CFIUS REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to acknowledge \nSenators Shelby and Sarbanes in their\n\n[[Page S3373]]\n\nwork to ensure national security is at the forefront of the critical \nGovernment review process that is triggered when a foreign-owned \ncompany attempts to purchase U.S. companies and assets. At the same \ntime, Senators Shelby and Sarbanes struck a balance that will not \nunnecessarily hinder investment in America.\n  The Dubai Ports fiasco shined a light on a flawed process at the \nCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United States--referred to as \nCFIUS. It raised questions regarding the competence of those in the \nBush administration to review these matters and make decisions about \nthe purchase of strategic U.S. assets. It also raised questions about a \nprocess that did not trigger a full investigation into a transaction \nthat was so important to our national security.\n  Members of Congress, Governors, and even the President found out \nabout the approval only through newspaper reports. Notwithstanding the \nPresident's knee-jerk threats to veto legislation overturning the deal \nand frantic efforts by the Treasury and Homeland Security to justify \nthis sale, the American public is rightly convinced that something \nneeds to be changed about the CFIUS process.\n  First, this process has to place a far greater emphasis on nationa1 \nsecurity. Second, the process has to have more legitimacy--so the \nAmerican public will have confidence that these sales of strategic \nassets get the thorough review they deserve by Government. Third, the \nCFIUS process must require a greater level of accountability from those \nwho administer the program so that we ensure that the process is \nfollowed as designed. Finally, the process must be balanced to ensure \nthat the vast majority of transactions that raise no concerns are not \ninadvertently undermined.\n  The Senate Banking Committee on Thursday voted to report legislation \nunanimously that would reform the CFIUS process. It was a difficult \njob. I commend Senators Shelby and Sarbanes for putting together \nbipartisan, consensus legislation that puts security first, while \nstriking a balance that continues to welcome foreign investment. \nAmerica has benefited a tremendous amount from foreign investment into \nour economy, so I am glad that we have not overreacted to the Bush \nadministration's mistakes and mismanagement in their review of these \nimportant transactions.\n  As with other legislation we deal with, this legislation is not \nperfect.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize several young \npeople who were recently selected by the American Automobile \nAssociation, AAA, to receive the Lifesaver Award for their outstanding \nwork as school safety patrollers.\n  More than 500,000 students in 50,000 schools worldwide participate in \nAAA's School Safety program. These young people have taken on the \nimportant responsibility of making the streets around their schools \nsafer for their classmates. Though their responsibilities are often \nroutine, the patrollers on occasion must place themselves in harm's way \nin order to save lives. Today, I want to recognize four students who \nreceived the AAA Lifesaver Award for selfless and heroic actions while \nfulfilling their duties as patrollers.\n  Nico DelGraco and Mitchell Davis of Simpson Elementary School in \nBridgeport, WV, are the first two recipients of this year's awards. In \nthe second week of November 2005, Nico and Mitchell were watching their \npatrol posts for traffic; a first-grader on his way home from school \nbegan to cross the street. As the student walked just past the center \nof the street, Nico noticed an SUV coming toward the red light that \nshowed no signs of stopping. Nico quickly left his post, took hold of \nthe child, and directed him toward Mitchell. Mitchell then grabbed the \nfirst-grader from Nico and dragged him back toward the sidewalk. No one \nwas injured in the incident.\n  The third AAA Lifesaver Award recipient is Molly Kaiser, a fifth-\ngrade student from Defer Elementary School in Grosse Pointe Park, MI. \nOn the morning of November 9, 2005, Molly pulled a second-grader out of \nthe street as a bus was turning. Molly had tried to verbally caution \nthe student that he was in danger. After this was met with no response, \nshe pulled the student out of the intersection and the path of the \nschool bus that was making its turn. The bus swerved to avoid the child \nand drove on without stopping.\n  The fourth AAA Lifesaver Award recipient is also from the State of \nMichigan. Her name is Emma Elise Binegar, and she is a student at \nMorenci Elementary School in Morenci. On December 9, 2005, Emma quickly \nnoticed that 5-year-old William Leeroy Webster was in danger as he was \ncrossing the street in the path of a fast-approaching car. Emma saved \nhim by pulling him out of the path of a vehicle about 10 feet away.\n  I would like to thank AAA for making the school safety program \npossible. The program has helped save many lives over the years and has \nmade our schools safer for our students. As the stories of the \nLifesaver Award recipients demonstrate, the streets around our schools \nare not safe enough. That is why I have worked for the last 2 years to \ncreate a national Safe Routes to School program, which was adopted as \npart of the Federal transportation bill on July 29, 2005. The $612 \nmillion allotted for the program can now help communities construct new \nbike lanes, pathways, and sidewalks, as well as to launch Safe Routes \neducation and promotion campaigns in elementary and middle schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3373-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3373-S3374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KATAHDIN IRONWORKS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to correct the record \nregarding conservation funding I secured last year under the Forest \nLegacy Program.\n  During debate on the fiscal year 2006 Interior Appropriations Act, I \nworked with Senator Olympia Snowe to obtain $4.5 million to protect \n37,000 acres of forested land in my home state of Maine. I was very \npleased that these crucial resources were allocated for this section of \nthe 100-mile wilderness, which in addition to its natural beauty \nprovides critical habitat to a variety of species, providing vital \nbreeding, feeding, and resting grounds.\n  The site of a long-deserted factory, Katahdin Ironworks, marks the \ngateway to this treasured expanse of wooded land. It was from this \nnotable Piscataquis County landmark that project supporters generated \nthe name ``Katahdin Ironworks Forest Legacy Program'' to refer to this \neffort to protect and preserve this stretch of forest. As the old adage \ngoes, so much is in a name. And this name has sparked unfounded \ncriticism from colleagues and outside interest groups who have jumped \nto the assumption that funding secured for this project was to be \nutilized for the upkeep of an abandoned building. Today, I wish to set \nthe record straight and assure my fellow Senators and other interested \nparties that this highly competitive program funding will be used to \nensure the survival of thousands of acres of precious forest.\n  There are many things that make America great, but it is our \ncommitment to safeguarding our open spaces and wooded lands that make \nus unique as an industrialized Nation. Sadly, the growing trend of \nurban sprawl, along with the increased pressure to exploit our natural \nresources, has placed the survival of these invaluable lands in \njeopardy. General agreement that we must undertake conservation efforts \nto ensure the preservation of these precious natural landscapes for \nfuture generations has lead to the development of conservation programs \nlike Forest Legacy. This initiative has afforded us a needed mechanism \nto facilitate the survival of these lands. Supported by the Wilderness \nSociety, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and other respected \nenvironmental protection groups, the Forest Legacy Program enjoys a \nwide range of support among organizations committed to natural \npreservation causes.\n  Sadly, limited resources preclude our ability to defend all \nendangered wilderness areas through this program, and it thus remains \nappropriately competitive. For this reason, I was extremely\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\npleased that both the President's budget and the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee recognized the importance of maintaining this pristine \nwilderness in my home state, and included funding to protect it through \ntight Forest Legacy Program dollars. In fact, this project was \nrecognized as one of the most meritorious in the country by a \ndistinguished panel of experts at the United States Forest Service.\n  I am hopeful that through increased understanding of the Forest \nLegacy Program and a more accurate depiction of the Katahdin Ironworks \nproject that my colleagues will appropriately recognize and appreciate \nmy commitment to preserving our wooded lands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3374-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3374-S3375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ``MEXICO AND THE MIGRATION PHENOMENON'' DOCUMENT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about the need to pass a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill. In the course of those remarks, \nI described a document signed by all five of Mexico's Presidential \ncandidates in the run-up to this July's Presidential elections in that \ncountry, as well as leaders from every major party in Mexico. That \ndocument makes clear that leaders on both sides of the border \nunderstand that border security is a fundamental necessity. I ask \nunanimous consent that the document, ``Mexico and the Migration \nPhenomenon,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Mexico and the Migration Phenomenon\n\n       In Mexico, as in other countries and regions of the world, \n     migration is a complex and difficult phenomenon to approach. \n     The diverse migration processes of exit, entrance, return and \n     transit of migrants are all present in our country.\n       Given the extent and the characteristics of today's \n     migration phenomenon, which will continue in the immediate \n     future and given the implications that it represents for our \n     country's development, a new vision and a change are \n     necessary in the way Mexican society has approached, thus \n     far, its responsibilities toward the migration phenomenon.\n       Over the last years, the magnitude reached by Mexican \n     migration and its complex effects in the economic and social \n     life of Mexico and the United States, have made the migration \n     phenomenon increasingly important for the national agendas of \n     both countries, and a priority issue in the bilateral agenda.\n       From the outset of the Administration, the government of \n     President Fox put forward a proposal to the Mexican public \n     opinion and to the highest authorities in the United States, \n     regarding a comprehensive plan aimed at dealing with the \n     diverse aspects of migration between the two countries. \n     Mexico based its proposal on the principle of shared \n     responsibility, which acknowledges that both countries must \n     do their share in order to obtain the best results from the \n     bilateral management of the migration phenomenon.\n       In 2001, the governments of both nations intensified the \n     dialogue and set in motion a process of bilateral \n     negotiations with the intent of finding ways to face the \n     multiple challenges and opportunities of the phenomenon; \n     these actions were taken with the objective of establishing a \n     new migration framework between the two countries.\n       However, the terrorist attacks of September 2001 against \n     the United States, criminal acts which were unmistakably \n     deplorable, altered the bilateral agenda on migration. On the \n     one hand, the link between migration and national security--\n     mainly along the shared border--is now an essential issue of \n     that agenda. On the other hand, the participation in the \n     migration debate of varied political actors--especially \n     legislators of both countries--has increased.\n       The debate that is currently taking place in the United \n     States, concerning a possible migration reform, represents an \n     opportunity for Mexico and for the bilateral handling of the \n     phenomenon. It also encourages a deep analysis of the \n     consequences that this process can have for our country and \n     its migration policy.\n       Based on a joint initiative by the Executive Branch and the \n     Senate of Mexico, a group of federal authorities responsible \n     for the management of the migration phenomenon, senators and \n     congressmen, members of the academia, experts in migratory \n     issues, and representatives of civil society organizations, \n     agreed to initiate an effort that seeks to build a national \n     migration policy, founded over shared diagnoses and \n     platforms. Accordingly, the group has held a series of \n     discussions titled Prospects and Design of Platforms for the \n     Construction of a Mexican Migration Policy.\n       The ideas expressed in this document are the result of \n     those discussions. They intend to bring up to date Mexico's \n     migration position and to offer some specific guidance \n     regarding the process of migration reform in the United \n     States.\n\n\n                               principles\n\n       Based on the discussions held, the participants agreed upon \n     the following set of principles that should guide Mexico's \n     migration policy:\n       The migration phenomenon should be fully understood by the \n     Mexican State--society and government--because it demands \n     actions and commitments that respond to the prevailing \n     conditions.\n       The migration phenomenon has international implications \n     that demand from Mexico actions and international \n     commitments--in particular with the neighboring regions and \n     countries--which, in accordance with the spirit of \n     international cooperation, should be guided by the principle \n     or shared responsibility.\n       Mexico's migration policy acknowledges that as long as a \n     large number of Mexicans do not find in their own country an \n     economic and social environment that facilitates their full \n     development and well-being, and that encourages people to \n     stay in the country, conditions for emigrating abroad will \n     exist.\n       Mexico must develop and enforce its migration laws and \n     policy with full respect for the human rights of the migrants \n     and their relatives, notwithstanding their nationality and \n     migration status, as well as respecting the refugee and \n     asylum rights. In accordance with the applicable \n     international instruments.\n       The increased linkage between migration, borders and \n     security on the international level, is a reality present in \n     the relationship with our neighboring countries. Hence, it is \n     necessary to consider those three elements when drawing up \n     migration policies.\n       Mexico is committed to fighting all forms of human \n     smuggling and related criminal activities, to protecting the \n     integrity and safety of persons, and to deepening the \n     appropriate cooperation with the governments of the \n     neighboring countries.\n       The migration processes that prevail in Mexico are \n     regionally articulated--in particular with Central America--\n     and therefore the Mexican migration policy should deepen its \n     regional approach.\n\n\n recommendations regarding the commitments that Mexico should agree on\n\n       Main recommendations considered by the group in order to \n     update Mexico's migration policy:\n       Based on the new regional and international realities \n     regarding immigration, transmigration and emigration, it is \n     necessary to evaluate and to update the present migration \n     policy of the Mexican State, as well as its legal and \n     normative framework, with a timeline of fifteen to twenty \n     years.\n       It is necessary to impel the economical and social \n     development that, among other positive effects, will \n     encourage people to stay in Mexico.\n       If a guest country offers a sufficient number of \n     appropriate visas to cover the biggest possible number of \n     workers and their families, which until now cross the border \n     without documents because of the impossibility of obtaining \n     them. Mexico should be responsible for guaranteeing that each \n     person that decides to leave its territory does so following \n     legal channels.\n       Based on international cooperation, Mexico must strengthen \n     the combat against criminal organizations specialized in \n     migrant smuggling and in the use or false documents, as well \n     as the policies and the legal and normative framework for the \n     prevention and prosecution of human smuggling, especially \n     women and children, and the protection of the victims of that \n     crime.\n       It is necessary to promote the return and adequate \n     reincorporation of migrants and their families to national \n     territory.\n       Mexico's migration policy must be adjusted taking into \n     account the characteristics of our neighboring countries, in \n     order to safeguard the border and to facilitate the legal, \n     safe and orderly flow of people, under the principles of \n     shared responsibility and respect for human rights.\n       Order and security in Mexico's north and south borders must \n     be fortified, with an emphasis on the development of the \n     border regions.\n       Reinforce cooperation with the United States and Canada \n     through the Security and Prosperity Partnership for North \n     America, and with the regional bodies and mechanisms for the \n     treatment of the phenomenon, like the Regional Conference on \n     Migration and the Cumbre Iberoamericana.\n       The review and, if necessary, adjustment of the juridical \n     and institutional framework, in order to adequately respond \n     to the present and the foreseeable conditions of the \n     migration phenomenon; this will require the creation of a \n     specialized inter institutional mechanism of collaboration.\n       The creation of permanent work mechanisms for the Executive \n     and Legislative Branches, with the participation of academic \n     and civil society representatives that allow the development \n     and fulfillment of Mexico's migration agenda.\n\n\n  elements related to a possible migration reform in the United States\n\n       Mexico does not promote undocumented migration and is eager \n     to participate in finding solutions that will help us face \n     the migration phenomenon. Accordingly, the group decided to \n     express certain thoughts about what is the Mexico's position \n     in case a migration reform takes place in the United States:\n       Acknowledging the sovereign right of each country to \n     regulate the entrance of foreigners and the conditions of \n     their stay, it is indispensable to find a solution for the \n     undocumented population that lives in the United States and \n     contributes to the development of the country, so that people \n     can be\n\n[[Page S3375]]\n\n     fully incorporated into their actual communities, with the \n     same rights and duties.\n       Support the proposal of a far-reaching guest workers \n     scheme, which should be one of the parts of a larger process \n     that includes the attention of the undocumented Mexicans that \n     live in the United States.\n       In order for a guest workers program to be viable, Mexico \n     should participate in its design management supervision and \n     evaluation, under the principle of shared responsibility.\n       A scheme aimed to process the legal temporary flow of \n     persons, will allow Mexico and the United States to better \n     combat criminal organizations specialized in the smuggling of \n     migrants and the use of false documents, and to combat, in \n     general, the violence and the insecurity that prevail in the \n     shared border. Likewise, Mexico would be in a better position \n     to exhort potential migrants to abide by the proper rules and \n     to adopt measures in order to reduce undocumented migration.\n       Mexico should conclude the studies that are being conducted \n     to know which tasks will help with the implementation of a \n     guest workers program, regarding the proper management of the \n     supply of potential participants, the establishment of \n     supporting, certification mechanisms, and the supervision and \n     evaluation of its development.\n       Mexico acknowledges that a crucial aspect for the success \n     of a temporary workers program refers to the capacity to \n     guarantee the circular flow of the participants, as well as \n     the development of incentives that encourage migrants to \n     return to our country. Mexico could significantly enhance its \n     tax-preferred housing programs, so that migrants can \n     construct a house in their home communities while they work \n     in the United States.\n       Other mechanisms that should be developed are the \n     establishment of a bilateral medical insurance system to \n     cover migrants and their relatives, as well as the agreement \n     of totalization of pension benefits, which will allow \n     Mexicans working in the United States to collect their \n     pension benefits in Mexico.\n       Mexico could also enhance the programs of its Labor and \n     Social Development Ministries, in order to establish social \n     and working conditions that encourage and ease the return and \n     reincorporation of Mexicans into their home communities.\n       This working group aims to become a permanent body of \n     study, debate and development of public policies for the \n     handling of the migration phenomenon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3375-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF GORDON ENGLAND\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Gordon England \nto the position of Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n  Secretary England has been the Department's problem-solver for the \nlast 5 years. In this brief period of time, he has served as Secretary \nof the Navy, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, \nSecretary of the Navy again, and--after being under consideration to \nserve as Secretary of the Air Force--as Deputy Secretary of Defense. At \nthe request of the Secretary of Defense, he has also taken on such \ncritical jobs as designing the new National Security Personnel System \nand overseeing the review of the status of DOD detainees at Guantanamo.\n  Secretary England has always made himself available for hearings, \nmeetings with Members, and discussions with the wide array of others \nwho have interests and concerns about the operations and activities of \nthe Department of Defense. He is a good listener, open to compromise, \nwilling to take on tough problems--characteristics which are always in \ngreat demand and short supply at DOD.\n  The Deputy Secretary of Defense serves in a position of awesome \nresponsibility. He is the alter ego of the Secretary. In this capacity, \nthe Deputy Secretary plays a key role in determining how our country \nwill face critical national security challenges.\n  At the same time, the Deputy Secretary of Defense has traditionally \nserved as the chief manager of the Defense Department. A wide array of \nmanagement challenges, including financial management, acquisition \nmanagement, and human capital issues, cut across functional areas in \nthe Department to such an extent that no official other than the \nSecretary or the Deputy Secretary has the authority needed to address \nthem.\n  Fortunately, Secretary England brings the kind of strong management \nbackground and commitment to addressing these issues that are needed in \nthe Deputy Secretary position.\n  For the last several months, Secretary England has served as Deputy \nSecretary of Defense under a recess appointment by the President. I \nbelieve that his service to the Department and the Nation over the last \n5 years merit a favorable vote on his nomination by the full Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3375-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          U.S. DECISION ON UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to express my regret that the \nadministration has decided to decline the opportunity for candidacy on \nthe newly formed U.N. Human Rights Council. I supported the creation of \nthe Human Rights Council because I believe that we need to create a \nsystem where human rights abusers are held accountable for the \natrocities they commit. It was for that same reason that there was \noverwhelming international support for the creation of the Human Rights \nCouncil.\n  In choosing not to join the council, the U.S. Government has signaled \nits intention to address worldwide human rights abuses unilaterally. \nThis decision will damage U.S. credibility when weighing in on the \nhuman rights debates of the future and further isolate the United \nStates from multilateral decisions.\n  Human rights abuses should be addressed through an international \nstrategy to ensure that there are internationally agreed-upon standards \nto protect all members of society. I am deeply concerned that the \nadministration's decision will undermine our human rights agenda, \nrather than advance it.\n  I have repeatedly expressed my concern about the approach to the U.N. \ntaken by this administration and am further disappointed by this most \nrecent decision. The U.N. is by no means perfect, but a world without a \nglobal human rights body would be a more dangerous one for people \neverywhere and would serve to undermine fundamental U.S. interests.\n  I urge the administration to reconsider its decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3375-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF EUREKA, CALIFORNIA\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nthe city of Eureka as it prepares to celebrate the 150th anniversary of \nthe city's formation.\n  The city of Eureka has a long history and often parallels \nCalifornia's past. Founded during the time of the gold rush, it became \nan important port city for northern California's logging and commercial \nfishing industries because of its proximity to a rich supply of natural \nresources. Eureka was incorporated on April 18, 1856, and was \ndesignated by the State legislature as the county seat for Humboldt \nCounty.\n  On a more personal note, Eureka is an important part of my family's \nhistory. My mother's family left St. Petersburg during the Russian \nRevolution and traveled by cart through Siberia and boarded a boat \nfinally landing in Eureka.\n  Today, with a population of over 25,000, Eureka is a city on the move \nand the cultural center of the California's north coast region. It is \nthe destination for many people wanting to explore miles of unspoiled \ncoastline and visit the world-famous coastal redwoods that are within \nclose proximity of the city.\n  The city's famed historic architecture has been preserved, earning it \nthe designation as a ``Victorian Seaport.'' The historic Eureka Inn is \ncurrently undergoing renovations that will make it once again the \ncenter of many community events such as the location of the city's \nChristmas celebrations.\n  I congratulate the city of Eureka on your special day and extend my \nregards to all of the citizens who will be celebrating this important \nmilestone in the city's history. You should feel proud of your past, \nand I wish you the very best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3375-4", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3375-S3376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECOGNITION OF ASIL\n\n Mr. KERRY.

Res. 422, which designated \nApril 21, 2006, National and Global Youth Service Day. I was proud to \nbe a cosponsor of this resolution, which we unanimously passed. \nHowever, I am even more proud of the thousands of youth in my native \nColorado who will participate in National Youth Service Day.\n  In Timnath, second graders at Timnath Elementary School are holding a \nschoolwide donation drive. During this drive, they will be collecting \nshampoo, soap, toothpaste, and toothbrushes to be donated to the local \nfood bank to give to individuals in need.\n  In Thornton, volunteer youth are organizing an afternoon of service \nfor frail, disabled, and chronically ill seniors throughout Adams \nCounty by helping them with the maintenance of their homes and gardens. \nThey will clean up yards, garages, and homes, and work to beautify \ntheir community. This valuable service will be performed in conjunction \nwith the local Big Brother/Big Sister program.\n  In Aurora, the Mile High Youth Corps will help the Denver Urban \nGardens fix up their farm. The Denver Urban Gardens is one of the only \norganic farms in the Denver Metro area which offers unique educational \nopportunities and low-cost organic food to people of all economic \nlevels. Youth volunteers will seed, weed, till, paint, plant, fix, \nmend, build, and any other valuable and needed volunteer activities to \nkeep the farm in shape.\n  These are just a few examples of the incredible volunteer efforts \nthat are occurring throughout Colorado. I thank the volunteers, and all \nof the staff and organizers of National Youth Service Day.\n  Speaking directly to the youth participating in National Youth \nService Day, in Colorado and around the world, I commend your service \nand thank you for the positive difference you will make not only in the \nlives of the people you help directly, but for all the people within \nyour neighborhoods and communities.\n  I would also like to remind you that your service and commitment is \nneeded not just for just a few days but year round. I encourage you to \ncarry forth your excitement, energy and goodwill into the future. I \nurge you to turn your sense of civic responsibility into a habit that \nwill last for a lifetime.\n  The youth participating in National Youth Service Day today are our \nfuture doctors, lawyers, police officers, senators, parents, and \ncommunity leaders of tomorrow. Instilling an early sense of service, \ninvolvement and dedication toward the betterment of their neighbors and \ncommunities is essential to continuing the caring and compassionate \ntradition embraced in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3376-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          AMERICAN COMMUNITY SCHOOL AT BEIRUT CENTENNIAL YEAR\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wish to recognize an important \nmilestone for an institution in the Middle East that brings American-\nstyle education to the region.\n  This academic year, the American Community School at Beirut \ncelebrates 100 years of providing quality education in Lebanon. Founded \nin 1905 by a group of American missionary families living in the \ncountry, and supported by the American University of Beirut and Aramco, \nACS was the first American K-12 school to open in Lebanon. An \nindependent, nonprofit, co-educational institution chartered in the \nState of New York, about 1,000 students are now enrolled at the school.\n  ACS aims to provide an American education for Lebanese and \ninternational families. Similar to many schools in the United States, \nthe school's mission clearly states that it: `` . . . seeks to educate \nthe whole person and to lay the foundations for life-long learning . . \n. Students are encouraged to take responsibility for their thoughts, \nwords and actions, to act with honor and purpose, and to make a \ndifference in our diverse, complex global society. . . .'' The school's \nalumni have distinguished themselves in a range of fields, including \nserving the United States government and in Lebanese-American \nrelations.\n  ACS, which appreciates the support of Congress through U.S. Agency \nfor International Development and ASHA grants, starts a new century \nwith a legacy of academic excellence, committed educators, and a \ndedicated community. I congratulate the school on this impressive \nachievement, and extend my best wishes for its next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3376-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3376-S3377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING KENT STATE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT CAROL CARTWRIGHT\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and \ncongratulate Dr. Carol Cartwright who, after 15 outstanding years, is \nset to retire as president of Kent State University in Kent, OH.\n  Kent State was originally founded in 1910 as a teacher-training \nschool. It has a proud history of meeting the evolving needs of \nnortheast Ohio and the Nation, and throughout her time on campus, \nPresident Cartwright worked hard to ensure that this commitment to \nhistory was preserved.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate President \nCartwright on successfully overseeing one of the Nation's largest \nuniversity systems with an annual budget of more than $416.1 million \nand eight campuses serving about 34,000 students from throughout Ohio \nand the Nation, and from more than 90 countries.\n  Dr. Cartwright has earned many distinctions in her tenure at Kent \nState University--she was the first female president of a State \nuniversity in Ohio when she took the helm in 1991 as the university's \n10th president. Her presidency has been marked by innovations that have \nfostered economic growth on the campus and in the community. I am \nespecially thankful for her work to train students for careers in \nunderpopulated fields, and focus on unique courses of study to \naccommodate all students.\n  As a member of the Greater Akron Chamber and the Northeast Ohio \nCouncil on Higher Education; a cochair of the Ohio Technology in \nEducation Committee; the Governor's Commission on Higher Education and \nthe Economy; and the Ohio Business Development Coalition, President \nCartwright worked to ensure that a cooperative relationship between \nstudents and industry was strong on her campus. In fact, she welcomed \nthe Northeast Ohio Trade & Economic Consortium, NEOTEC, an economic \ndevelopment partnership that promotes trade, business, and economic \nopportunities for northeast Ohio to Kent State University's campus to \nfurther students' connection to future employment opportunities.\n  In 2004, the Kent Campus also became the site for NEOTEC's new \nregional International Trade Assistance Center, providing free \ninformation, resources, referrals, and counseling to small businesses, \nand expanded services such as market research. Also, in 2004, a new, \nmarket-driven Division of Regional Development was created to allow \nKent State to serve a much wider constituency, develop mutually \nbeneficial partnerships, and do an even better job of matching faculty \nand staff expertise with northeast Ohio's educational and economic \nneeds. Further, working with the local Small Business Development \nCenter, headquartered in Kent State's College of Business \nAdministration,\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\nstudents are now exposed to real-world experiences while providing \nbusiness and industry with essential new ideas and out-of-the-box \nthinking.\n  These kinds of partnerships and innovations will carry Ohio into the \nnext era of progress and development, and Kent State will be an \nimportant part of that success. Already, 10 start-up companies have \nbeen created in the last 6 years to capitalize on Kent State faculty \nresearch and add to the economic growth in the region. This is real-\nworld research that benefits society, consumers, and the university.\n  Under Carol Cartwright's leadership, Kent State was named by the \nAssociation of University Technology Managers as fourth in the Nation \nfor the number of start-up companies formed per $10 million in research \nspending. Kent State also plays an important leadership role in \nJumpStart Inc., a new organization to help advance technology \ncommercialization and foster economic development in Ohio.\n  Overall, President Cartwright's presidency has been marked by a \ncommitment to developing students who are leaders and experts in \ninnovation and service. Kent State has launched degree programs in \nhigh-demand and emerging fields, including an interdisciplinary \nundergraduate program in biotechnology that is unique in the State of \nOhio; an interdisciplinary bachelor's program in American Sign \nLanguage; a baccalaureate program in paralegal studies; and the first \ngraduate programs in Russian and Japanese at a public university in \nnortheast Ohio. The revolutionary joint doctoral program in biomedicine \nwith the Cleveland Clinic Foundation matches some of America's best and \nbrightest students with world-class medical training opportunities, and \nKent State is a partner in the Nation's only joint, 4-year doctoral \nprogram in audiology.\n  Her commitment to preparing students for the future and working with \nregional economic growth initiatives should be a model for colleges and \nuniversities across the country to emulate.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and commending \nPresident Cartwright on an excellent job of leading Kent State through \nan age of innovation and extraordinary achievement during her tenure. I \nwish her well on her upcoming retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3377-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 2603.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe permissible use of health savings accounts to include premiums for \nnon-group high deductible health plan coverage; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to help \nindividuals, small businesses, and the uninsured afford health \ninsurance coverage. Today, 60 percent of Americans obtain health \ninsurance coverage through their employers. The system of employer-\nsponsored health insurance has long provided coverage to the vast \nmajority of America's workers and their families. However, a \nsignificant number of Americans, particularly those who work for small \nbusinesses, lack access to coverage through the employment-based \nsystem.\n  Employees of small businesses often go uninsured or purchase health \ninsurance coverage on their own because continuing double-digit cost \nincreases and burdensome state regulations are making it difficult for \nsmall employers to offer health insurance coverage.\n  Health insurance is valuable for a number of reasons. People who are \ninsured are protected against uncertain and high medical expenses and \nare more likely to receive needed and appropriate health care. Having \nhealth insurance is also associated with improved health outcomes and \nlower mortality, so employees with health insurance are more likely to \nbe productive workers.\n  Health savings accounts have become an important option for \nindividuals and small businesses who have struggled to afford health \ninsurance coverage.\n  The Affordability in the Individual Market Act, also known as the AIM \nAct, builds on the foundation of a previously passed law that \nestablished Health Savings Accounts. These accounts allow individuals \nwith high-deductible health insurance to set aside money, tax free, up \nto a set limit, to use for routine medical expenses.\n  You can make a contribution to Health Savings Accounts or your \nemployer can make a contribution to the account. If you don't use all \nthe money in a year you can roll it over, tax free, to meet future \nexpenses.\n  Today, individuals trying to build up a nest egg for their retiree \nhealth expenses through a Health Savings Account are not able to use \nthese funds to purchase their health insurance, except under limited \ncircumstances.\n  The AIM Act would expand the definition of what is considered a \n``qualified medical expense'' under the Internal Revenue Code to allow \nindividuals and families who purchase high-deductible health plans on \ntheir own to use their Health Savings Accounts to pay plan premiums. It \nseems completely reasonable to allow these individuals to pay high-\ndeductible health plan premiums with Health Savings Account dollars.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this responsible, \ncommon-sense legislation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am cosponsoring a bill today, along with \nSenator Ensign and Senator Frist, to add another option for individuals \nand families to purchase affordable health insurance.\n  The law currently allows individuals and families to set aside tax-\nfree savings for lifetime healthcare needs in Health Savings Accounts \nthat are combined with a high deductible health insurance plan. This \nhas already made health care more affordable. This important \nlegislation expands on the foundation of Health Savings Accounts by \nallowing individuals and families to use their Health Savings Accounts \nto pay the premiums of their health insurance plans.\n  This is the right thing to do, individuals and families need \naffordable health insurance options. I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Ensign, Senator Frist and me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3380-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3380-S3394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2596. A bill to modify the boundaries for a certain empowerment \nzone designation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Collins to \nintroduce legislation to help reverse the devastating population \ndecline and economic distress that has plagued individuals and \nbusinesses in Aroostook County, the northernmost county in Maine. What \nthe bill does is simple, it will bring all of Aroostook County under \nthe Empowerment Zone (EZ) program. The legislation is identical to a \nbill that we introduced in the 108th Congress and was included in the \nFY 2004 Agriculture Appropriations bill in 2003 as passed by the \nSenate.\n  To fully grasp the importance of this legislation, it is necessary to \nunderstand the unique situation facing the residents of Aroostook \nCounty. ``The County'', as it is called by Mainers, is a vast and \nremote region of Maine. As the northernmost county, it shares more of \nits border with Canada than its neighboring Maine counties. It has the \ndistinction of being the largest county east of the Mississippi River. \nIts geographic isolation is even more acute when considering that the \ncounty's relatively small population of 73,000 people are scattered \nthroughout 6,672 square miles of rural countryside. Aroostook County is \nhome to 71 organized townships, as well as 125 unorganized townships \nmuch of which is forest land and wilderness.\n  As profound as this geographic isolation may seem, it is the economic \nisolation and the recent out-migration that has had the most \ndevastating impact on the region. The economy of northern Maine has a \nhistorical dependence upon its natural resources, particularly forestry \nand agriculture. While these industries served the region well in \nprevious decades, and continue to form the underpinnings of the local \neconomy, many of these sectors have experienced decline and can no \nlonger provide the number and type of quality jobs that residents need.\n  While officials in the region have put forward a Herculean effort to \nredevelop the region, with nearly 1,000 new jobs at the Loring Commerce \nCentre alone, Aroostook County is still experiencing a significant \n``job deficit'', and as a result continues to lose population at an \nalarming rate. Since its peak in 1960, northern Maine's population has \ndeclined by 30 percent. Unfortunately, the Main State Planning Office \npredicts that Aroostook County will continue losing population as more \nworkers leave the area to seek opportunities and higher wages in \nsouthern Maine and the rest of New England.\n  In January 2002, a portion of Aroostook County was one of two regions \nthat received Empowerment Zone status from the USDA for out-migration. \nThe entire county experienced an out-migration of 15 percent from \n86,936 in 1990 to 73,938 in 2000. Moreover, a shocking 40 percent of 15 \nto 29-year-olds left during the last decade.\n  The current zone boundaries were chosen based on the criteria that \nEmpowerment Zones be no larger than 1,000 square miles, and have a \nmaximum population of 30,000 for rural areas. The lines drawn for the \nAroostook County Empowerment Zone were considered to be the most \ninclusive and reasonable given the constraints of the program. It \nshould be noted as well that the boundaries were drawn based on the \n1990 census, making the data significantly outdated at the start and \nincluded the former Loring Air Force Base and its population of nearly \n8,000 people, which had closed nearly 8 years before the designation, \ntaking its military and much of its civilian workforces with it. The \nMaine State Planning Office estimated that the base closure resulted in \nthe loss of 3,494 jobs directly related to the base and\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\nanother 1,751 in associated industry sectors for a total loss of $106.9 \nmillion annual payroll dollars.\n  Some of the most distressed communities that have lost substantial \npopulation are not in the Empowerment Zone, and other communities like \nHoulton literally are divided simply by a road, having one business on \nthe south side of the street with no Empowerment Zone designation look \nout their window to a neighboring business on the north side of the \nstreet with full Empowerment Zone benefits. The economic factors for \nthese communities and for these neighbors are the same as those areas \nwithin the Empowerment Zone. This designation is not meant to cause \ndivisiveness within communities, it is created to augment a partnership \nfor growth and to level the playing field for all Aroostook County \ncommunities who have equally suffered through continuing out migration \nwhether it be in Madawaska or Island Falls.\n  The legislation I am introducing would provide economic development \nopportunities to all reaches of Aroostook County by extending \nEmpowerment Zone status to the entire county. This inclusive approach \nrecognizes that the economic decline and population out-migration are \nissues that the entire region must confront, and, as evidenced by their \nsuccessful Round III EZ application, they are attempting to confront. I \nbelieve the challenges faced by Aroostook County are significant, but \nnot insurmountable. This legislation would make great strides in \nimproving the communities and business in northern Maine, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2596\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF BOUNDARY OF AROOSTOOK COUNTY \n                   EMPOWERMENT ZONE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Aroostook County empowerment zone \n     shall include, in addition to the area designated as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the remaining area of the \n     county not included in such designation, notwithstanding the \n     size requirement of section 1392(a)(3)(A) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 and the population requirements of \n     section 1392(a)(1)(B) of such Code.\n       (b) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) shall take effect as of \n     the effective date of the designation of the Aroostook County \n     empowerment zone by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Olympia Snowe, in introducing legislation that will modify the \nborders of the Aroostook County Empowerment Zone to include the entire \ncounty so that the benefits of Empowerment Zone designation can be \nfully realized in northern Maine.\n  The Department of Agriculture's Empowerment Zone program addresses a \ncomprehensive range of community challenges, including many that have \ntraditionally received little Federal assistance, reflecting the fact \nthat rural problems do not come in standardized packages but can vary \nwidely from one place to another. The Empowerment Zone program \nrepresents a long-term partnership between the Federal Government and \nrural communities so that communities have enough time to implement \nprojects to build the capacity to sustain their development beyond the \nterm of the partnership. An Empowerment Zone designation gives \ndesignated regions potential access to millions of dollars in Federal \ngrants for social services and community redevelopment as well as tax \nrelief.\n  Aroostook County is the largest county east of the Mississippi River. \nYet, despite the impressive character and work ethic of its citizens, \nthe county has fallen on hard times. The 2000 Census indicated a 15-\npercent loss in population since 1990. Loring Air Force Base, which was \nclosed in 1994, also caused an immediate out-migration of 8,500 people \nand a further out-migration of families and businesses that depended on \nLoring for their customer base.\n  In response to these developments, the Northern Maine Development \nCommission and other economic development organizations, the private \nbusiness sector, and community leaders in Aroostook have joined forces \nto stabilize, diversify, and grow the area's economy. They have \nattracted some new industries and jobs. As a native of Aroostook \nCounty, I can attest to the strong community support that will ensure a \nsuccessful partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Designating this region of the United States as an Empowerment Zone \nwill help ensure its future economic prosperity. However, the \nrestriction that the Empowerment Zone be limited to 1,000 square miles \nprevents all of Aroostook's small rural communities from benefiting \nfrom this tremendous program. Aroostook covers some 6,672 square miles \nbut has a population of only 74,000. Including all of the county in the \nEmpowerment Zone will guarantee that parts of the county will not be \nleft behind as economic prosperity returns to the area. It does little \ngood to have a company move from one community to another within the \ncounty simply to take advantage of Empowerment Zone benefits.\n  Senator Snowe and I introduced this legislation during the 108th \nCongress. In fact, we were successful in getting this legislation \npassed in the Senate by attaching it to the fiscal year 2004 \nAgriculture Appropriations bill. Unfortunately, this language was \nremoved during conference negotiations with the House. Senator Snowe \nand I remain committed to bringing the benefits of the Empowerment Zone \ndesignation to all of Aroostook County's residents and will work to \npass this legislation in both Chambers during this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Santorum, \n        Mr. Coburn, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 2599. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to prohibit the confiscation of firearms \nduring certain national emergencies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the \n``Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006'' that would amend \nthe Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to \nprohibit the confiscation of firearms during certain national \nemergencies.\n  The city of New Orleans confiscated more than 1,000 firearms under \nthe misguided policy of a local law enforcement officer. Our Second \nAmendment rights should not be subject to the whims of individuals. My \nbill would prohibit any agency using Federal disaster relief funds from \nseizing firearms or restricting firearm possession, except under \ncircumstances currently applicable under Federal or State law.\n  Our law enforcement officers are under intense pressure to protect \nand serve, and I value their call to duty with great respect. The \n``Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006'' would not prevent \nlaw enforcement from confiscating guns from convicted felons or other \nprohibited persons. Also, it would have no effect on law enforcement \noutside of disaster relief situations.\n  The horrible tragedy that unfolded upon the State of Louisiana was \ncertainly unprecedented. The devastation that occurred will last for \ngenerations, and yet, there is immense hope that our great State of \nLouisiana will shine better than ever before. In the days and nights \nthat followed there were mistakes at all levels of government, and the \nconfiscation of law-abiding citizens' personal protection was one of \nthem.\n  I ask my fellow Senators to support this legislation in the hope that \nin the unfortunate likelihood of another disaster our citizens will be \nable to protect themselves without fear of government intruding upon \nour second amendment rights.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2600. A bill to equalize authorities to provide allowances, \nbenefits, and gratuities to civilian personnel of the United States \nGovernment in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate's time \nto introduce a bill together with Senator Clinton. The bill is to \nequalize authorities to provide allowances, benefits, and gratuities to \ncivilian personnel of the United States Government for their services \nin Iraq and Afghanistan and for other purposes. Throughout the hearings \nof the Armed\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\nServices Committee this year and the appearance of our distinguished \ngroup of witnesses, and based on two--and I say this most respectfully \nand humbly--personal conversations I have had with the President of the \nUnited States and, indeed, the Secretary of State, I very forcefully \nsaid to each that we need to get the entirety of our Federal Government \ninto a greater degree--they have done much--of harness in our overall \nefforts in Iraq and Afghanistan to secure a measure of democracy for \nthe peoples of those countries.\n  For example, the QDR so aptly states that ``success requires unified \nstatecraft: the ability of the U.S. Government to bring to bear all \nelements of national power at home and to work in close cooperation \nwith allies and partners abroad.''\n  General Abizaid, when he appeared before our committee this year, \nstated in his posture statement:\n\n       We need significantly more non-military personnel . . . \n     with expertise in areas such as economic development, civil \n     affairs, agriculture, and law.\n\n  Likewise General Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \niterated much the same message when he appeared before our committee.\n  I commend the President and the Cabinet officers. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record a letter that I sent every Cabinet \nofficer and agency head, asking what they had done thus far and of \ntheir ability to contribute even more.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2006.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: Over the past few months, the \n     President has candidly and frankly explained what is at stake \n     in Iraq. I firmly believe that the success or failure of our \n     efforts in Iraq may ultimately lie at how well the next Iraqi \n     government is prepared to govern. For the past three years, \n     the United States and our coalition partners have helped the \n     Iraqi people prepare for this historic moment of self-\n     governance.\n       Our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan requires coordinated \n     and integrated action among all federal departments and \n     agencies of our government. This mission has revealed that \n     our government is not adequately organized to conduct \n     interagency operations. I am concerned about the slow pace of \n     organizational reform within our civilian departments and \n     agencies to strengthen our interagency process and build \n     operational readiness.\n       In recent months, General Peter Pace, USMC, Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General John P. Abizaid, USA, \n     Commander, United States Central Command, have emphasized the \n     importance of interagency coordination in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. General Abizaid stated in his 2006 posture \n     statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``We need \n     significantly more non-military personnel. . . with expertise \n     in areas such as economic development, civil affairs, \n     agriculture, and law.''\n       Strengthening interagency operations has become the \n     foundation for the current Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). \n     The QDR so aptly states that, ``success requires unified \n     statecraft: the ability of the U.S. Government to bring to \n     bear all elements of national power at home and to work in \n     close cooperation with allies and partners abroad.'' In the \n     years since the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, \n     ``jointness'' has promoted more unified direction and action \n     of our Armed Forces. I now believe the time has come for \n     similar changes to take place elsewhere in our federal \n     government.\n       I commend the President for his leadership in issuing a \n     directive to improve our interagency coordination by signing \n     the National Security Presidential Directive-44, titled \n     ``Management of Interagency Efforts Concerning Reconstruction \n     and Stabilization,'' dated December 7, 2005. I applaud each \n     of the heads of departments and agencies for working together \n     to develop this important and timely directive. Now that the \n     directive has been issued, I am writing to inquire about the \n     plan for its full implementation. In particular, what steps \n     have each federal department or agency taken to implement \n     this directive?\n       I ask for your personal review of the level of support \n     being provided by your department or agency in support of our \n     Nation's objectives in Iraq and Afghanistan. Following this \n     review, I request that you submit a report to me no later \n     than April 10, 2006, on your current and projected activities \n     in both theaters of operations, as well as your efforts in \n     implementing the directive and what additional authorities or \n     resources might be necessary to carry out the \n     responsibilities contained in the directive.\n       I believe it is imperative that we leverage the resident \n     expertise in all federal departments and agencies of our \n     government to address the complex problems facing the \n     emerging democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am prepared \n     to work with the executive branch to sponsor legislation, if \n     necessary, to overcome challenges posed by our current \n     organizational structures and processes that prevent an \n     integrated national response.\n       I look forward to continued consultation on this important \n     subject.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. In my conversations with President Bush and the Cabinet \nofficers and others, there seems to be total support. The \nadministration, at their initiative, asked OMB to draw up the \nlegislation, which I submit today in the form of a bill.\n  I hope this will garner support across the aisle--Senator Clinton has \ncertainly been active in this area, as have others--and that we can \ninclude this on the forthcoming supplemental appropriations bill. The \nurgency is now, absolutely now. Every day it becomes more and more \ncritical in the balance of those people succeeding with their message \nof 11 million on December 15 in Iraq: We want a government, a unified \ngovernment stood up and operating. To do that, this government, \nhopefully, will utilize such assets as we can provide them from across \nthe entire spectrum of our Government. Our troops have done their job \nwith the coalition forces. Their families have borne the brunt of these \nconflicts now for these several years. Now it is time for every \nindividual to step forward and work to make the peace secure in those \nnations so they do not revert back the lands of Iraq and Afghanistan to \nhavens for terrorism and destruction to the free world.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. DeMint):\n  S. 2601. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to improve choices \navailable to Medicare eligible seniors by permitting them to elect \n(instead of regular Medicare benefits) to receive a voucher for a \nhealth savings account, for premiums for a high deductible health \ninsurance plan, or both and by suspending Medicare late enrollment \npenalties between ages 65 and 70; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Health \nCare Choices for Seniors Act. My colleague from Tennessee, \nRepresentative Blackburn, has taken the lead in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I am proud to join with her by introducing this \nbill in the Senate. Our legislation is about giving seniors a new \nhealth insurance option by making it easier for them to create or \ncontinue using a health savings account (HSA) after they reach age 65.\n  A growing number of Americans are using HSAs, which allow individuals \nto save for future medical expenses on a tax-free basis. The money you \nput into an HSA is tax-deductible, the money in your account grows tax-\nfree, balances can be rolled over year-to-year, and you can take money \nout of the account tax-free to pay for a wide range of health care \nexpenses. Plus HSAs are portable--you can take them with you from job \nto job.\n  Many members of the Baby Boom generation are not planning to retire \nat age 65 and want more health care options. But the problem under \ncurrent law is that seniors can't continue using health savings \naccounts after turning 65 because they are penalized if they don't join \nMedicare. The first penalty is that once you join Medicare, you can no \nlonger make tax-free contributions into HSAs. The second penalty is \nthat if you don't join Medicare, you can't collect your Social Security \nbenefits. The third penalty is that if you delay enrollment in Medicare \nto a later age, you have to pay more. So, of course, almost everyone \njoins Medicare when they turn 65 instead of using an HSA for their \nhealth care needs.\n  At a time when health care costs are rising sharply, we need to move \nin the direction of giving Americans more options for getting health \ncoverage at an affordable cost. Rather than forcing people into \nMedicare at age 65, the legislation that I am introducing today would \nmake it easier for seniors to delay joining Medicare and to continue \nusing health savings accounts. First, you could delay joining Medicare \nwithout losing the ability to make tax-free contributions into your \nHSA. Those\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\nwho delay enrollment in Medicare would be eligible for a monthly \nvoucher of up to $200 for an HSA. Second, you could delay joining \nMedicare without losing your Social Security benefits. Third, if you \nuse an HSA, you would not be penalized for putting off joining Medicare \nuntil age 70. With these changes, HSAs would become a real option for \nseniors in Tennessee and throughout the nation.\n  I am a strong supporter of HSAs, which show the promise of holding \ndown health care costs by putting more health care decisions in the \nhands of individual consumers and families. Health savings accounts \nonly became available in January 2004, but they have seen significant \ngrowth in both individual and employer markets. A recent census by \nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans showed that high deductible health \ninsurance plans (HDHPs) offered in conjunction with HSAs covered 3.17 \nmillion people in January 2006, up from 1.03 million in March 2005.\n  This bill is an important step toward giving seniors more options to \nmanage their health care and to allow greater use of health savings \naccounts. I look forward to working with Representative Blackburn to \nbuild support for our legislation in both Chambers of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 2604. A bill to address the forest and watershed emergency in the \nState of Colorado that has been exacerbated by the bark beetle \ninfestation, to provide for the conduct of activities in the State to \nreduce the risk of wildfire and flooding, to promote economically \nhealthy rural communities by reinvigorating the forest products \nindustry in the State, to encourage the use of biomass fuels for \nenergy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today out of concern for the \nWestern United States. The Rocky Mountain West is currently facing a \nvery real threat to one of its most rare and precious resources. Out \nWest there are few things more important than water, and it is this \nvery important and increasingly needed resource that is in peril. This \nthreat was in part brought upon us by a scourge barely larger than my \nfinger tip, the bark beetle. This devious little devil has chewed its \nway through nearly 7,500,000 trees in Colorado. The beetle left these \ndrought weakened trees dead and dying. This threat is exacerbated by \nthe additional 6,300,000 acres of hazardous fuels that have accumulated \nthroughout Colorado.\n  This devastation is concerning enough on its own, but when you \nconsider the fire danger that it has created, and the direct threat \nthat a catastrophic fire would pose to our watersheds, the true weight \nof this situation becomes clear. Much of the precipitation that falls \ninto the forests ultimately finds its way into streams, ponds, rivers \nand lakes. Changes to forested lands caused by fire can have strong and \ndevastating repercussions on the quality and quantity of water in these \nbodies. A forest fire is one big chemical reaction which releases a \nmyriad of chemical elements from forest materials into the ecosystem. \nThese chemicals can be washed or leach into our water systems. Forest \nfires can cause immediate and lasting changes to the chemistry of \nforest water systems, this happens as a result of increases in water \ntemperature and from the smoke and ash created during the burning \nprocess. These effects can last long after the flames have passed, \neffecting water quality for years after the initial fire.\n  Colorado should be called ``the Headwaters State,'' because it is the \norigin point of major rivers flowing both east and west and the source \nof a vast amount of the water of the United States. In fact the \nColorado Rocky Mountains create the headwaters for 4 regional \nwatersheds that eventually supply water to 19 Western States. Should \nthe streams and rivers flowing out of Colorado become choked and \npolluted with ash and debris from a forest fire much of the United \nStates' water supply would be affected.\n  The Federal agencies that manage the majority of the affected areas \nneed to adopt an accelerated pace to reduce the public health and \nsafety risk as soon as possible. To address this I am introducing The \nHeadwater Protection and Restoration Act today that would work to help \nalleviate the pending threat to our Nation's water supply. My \nlegislation takes into consideration the desperate need to create \nhealthy forests in the lands around our Nation's water supply. This \nbill will not only help provide relief from this threat in the short \nterm, but will help to create the necessary infrastructure to ensure \nthat it does not happen again. It will give us a long term solution to \nthis desperate problem. This would be achieved through steady, \njudicious, and effective forest management over time. This displays a \nmuch better and more cost effective strategy than dealing with the \nmanagement of catastrophic events under emergency circumstances. Today \nwe find ourselves poised in a position to take steps to help avert this \npotential disaster before it starts. It is my hope that I will be \njoined by my colleagues here in the Senate to act swiftly on my \nlegislation before it is too late.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Coburn):\n  S. 2606. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake publicly available on the official Medicare Internet site Medicare \npayment rates for frequently reimbursed hospital inpatient procedures, \nhospital outpatient procedures, and physicians' services; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Medicare \nPayment Rate Disclosure Act of 2006. This legislation tackles a key \nproblem facing Americans today--that of rising health-related costs. It \ndoes so by empowering citizens to act as informed consumers when \npurchasing their health care. Countless examples in our Nation's \nhistory demonstrate that the American consumer possesses the ability to \ndrive prices down and quality up by making informed decisions in the \nmarketplace. Yet the cost of health care is not easily accessible to \nthe American consumer, given the nature of our present system.\n  The Medicare Payment Rate Disclosure Act would create price \ntransparency at a consumer level, allowing Americans to choose for \nthemselves health care services that are affordable within their \nregion. This bill ensures that there is one location on the Internet \nwhere either consumers with health savings accounts or who are \nuninsured can go to view the Medicare reimbursement rates for all \ncommon medical procedures and physician visits, region by region. This \ninformation will provide a critical baseline for these individuals to \nassess health care costs.\n  I believe that by removing barriers for health care consumers to \n``own their health care'' and make the best personal choices, we \nempower Americans with the knowledge to take charge of their health \nspending and to negotiate health care prices. I should note that my \nhome State of Kansas is also considering price-transparency \ninitiatives.\n  This legislation is a good first step towards improving the quality \nof health care and lowering costs to consumers. I thank the original \ncosponsor, Senator Tom Coburn, for his support of this measure. \nAccordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the Medicare Payment Rate \nDisclosure Act of 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2607 A bill to establish a 4-year small business health insurance \ninformation pilot program; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have long believed that it is my \nresponsibility and the duty of this chamber to help small businesses, \nas they are the driver of this Nation's economy, responsible for \ngenerating approximately 75 percent of net new jobs annually.\n  Today, I rise with Senator Bennett to introduce legislation that \nwould address the crisis that faces small businesses when it comes to \npurchasing quality, affordable health insurance. This is not a new \ncrisis. Nearly 46 million Americans are currently uninsured. We've now \nexperienced double digit percentage increases in health insurance \npremiums in four of the past five years. Small businesses face \ndifficult choices in seeking to provide affordable health insurance to \ntheir employees. We must act now.\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\n  Study after study tells us that the smallest businesses are the ones \nleast likely to offer insurance and most in need of assistance. \nAccording to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, of the working \nuninsured, who make up 83 percent of our nation's uninsured population, \n60.6 percent either work for a small business with fewer than 100 \nemployees or are self-employed.\n  Furthermore, many of the small businesses who we meet with tell us \nhow they feel like the cost and complexity of the health care system \nhas moved health insurance far beyond their reach.\n  That is why today we introduce the Small Business Health Education \nand Awareness Act of 2006. This bill establishes a pilot, competitive \nmatching-grant program for Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) \nto provide educational resources and materials to small businesses \ndesigned to increase awareness regarding health insurance options \navailable in their areas. Recent research conducted by the Healthcare \nLeadership Council has found that a short, less than 10 minute \neducation session, can increase small business knowledge and interest \nin offering health insurance by about 33 percent.\n  For those of you who are not familiar, SBDCs are one of the greatest \nbusiness assistance and entrepreneurial development resources provided \nto small businesses that are seeking to start, grow, and flourish. \nCurrently, there are over 1,100 service locations in every state and \nterritory delivering management and technical counseling to prospective \nand existing small business owners.\n  Our legislation would require the Small Business Administration (SBA) \nto provide up to 20 matching grants to qualified SBDCs across the \ncountry. No more than two SBDCs, one per State, would be chosen from \neach of the SBA's 10 regions. The grants shall be more than $150,000, \nbut less than $300,000 and shall be consistent with the matching \nrequirement under current law. In creating the materials for their \ngrant programs, participating SBDCs should evaluate and incorporate \nrelevant portions existing health insurance options, including \nmaterials created by the Healthcare Leadership Council.\n  In addition, SBDCs participating in the pilot program would be \nrequired to submit a quarterly report to the SBA.\n  Enacting this legislation is an important step in the right direction \ntowards assisting small businesses as they work to strengthen \nthemselves, remain competitive against larger businesses that are able \nto offer affordable health insurance, and in turn bolster the entire \neconomy.\n  We encourage our colleagues to join us in supporting this bill, and \nto continue to work to address the issues facing the small business \ncommunity.\n  Thank you. I ask unanimous consent that the text of our bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2607\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure full partnership of small contractors in \nFederal disaster reconstruction efforts; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Chair of Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to introduce The Small \nBusiness Partners In Reconstruction Act of 2006. This legislation, co-\nsponsored by Senator David Vitter, is the product of 3 hearings held in \nmy Committee in September and November 2005, and in February 2006, \nwhich examined the response of the Small Business Administration, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, the Department of Homeland Security and its \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, and other Federal agencies to the \ndevastation wrought by the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on our Gulf \nCoast states.\n  Speaking on September 15, 2005 from New Orleans' historic Jackson \nSquare, President Bush declared that ``It is entrepreneurship that \ncreates jobs and opportunity; it is entrepreneurship that helps break \nthe cycle of poverty; and we will take the side of entrepreneurs as \nthey lead the economic revival of the Gulf region.'' Unfortunately, the \nFederal Government's performance has not matched the President's \ndeclaration. This is particularly true with regards to the role of \nsmall firms, especially Gulf Coast small firms, with regards to \ncontracts and subcontracts for recovery and reconstruction. Too often, \nsmall contractors have been treated in the disaster contracting process \nless like the partners in disaster recovery and economic revitalization \nthey are, and more like unwanted stepchildren. Eight months after \nHurricane Katrina, it is time for this to change.\n  To begin with, some Federal bureaucrats have used the Katrina and \nRita disasters to exclude small business from contracting in the name \nof emergency and speed. Contracting with small firms, it was said, does \nnot provide sufficient flexibility to the contracting officers in time \nof crisis. Quite the opposite is true. The Small Business Act contains \nflexible contracting authorities as part of the 8(a) program, the \nHUBZone program, and the service-disabled veteran-owned program, which \nallow Federal agencies to quickly buy goods and services in emergency \nsituations. Indeed, on May 30, 2003, the Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy issued guidance on Emergency Procurement Flexibilities, which \nencouraged Federal agencies to use contracting flexibilities, such as \nthe HUBZone flexibilities, which are part of the Small Business Act. \nThis guidance was largely ignored, as billions of dollars went to large \ncorporations through non-competitive mechanisms such as no-bid \ncontracts or the so called micro-purchase authority, originally \nintended by Congress to cover small purchase card transactions.\n\n  My legislation requires the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and \nthe Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that Federal \ncontracting officials have the most comprehensive and up-to-date \nguidance on the full use of available small business emergency \nprocurement flexibilities, and that such guidance is published in the \nFederal Register. My legislation also ensures that the SBA provides \ngovernment-wide training for procurement agencies on using small \nbusiness contracting flexibilities in emergency situations, and directs \nthe SBA to designate at least one advisor for small business emergency \ncontracting who would help Federal agencies apply small business \nprocurement flexibilities in emergency situations.\n  Small contractors have also been denied access to reconstruction \ndollars by paperwork and bureaucracy. Red tape had the most serious \neffect on small disadvantaged businesses. Many of these contractors \nhave been certified to do business under the Federally-funded, \nCongressionally-established Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program \n(DBE) for transportation contracting such as highway or bridge \nconstruction. In the Federal procurement system, a parallel Small \nDisadvantaged Business (SDB) Program exists. According to law and the \nMemorandum of Understanding between the SBA and the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, the DBE certifications are based on the SDB \ncertification requirements under the Small Business Act. Unfortunately, \nDBEs have been unable to secure recognition as SDBs by the Federal \nagencies or by Federal prime contractors. As a result, agencies and \nprime contractors had little assurance that SDB goals may be met by \ndoing business with DBEs. My measure will ensure that capable small \ncontractors enjoy full reciprocity among contracting programs instead \nof the red tape they currently face.\n  Lack of comprehensive procurement data on Katrina and Rita \ncontracting is another flaw which my bill is trying to correct. It is \nhard to believe that almost 8 months since the Hurricane Katrina \nstruck, the Federal Government's disaster contracting ship is literally \nsailing blind. Both the Small Business Act and the Office of Federal \nProcurement Policy Act require that accurate and comprehensive data on \ngovernment contracting and subcontracting, especially including small \nbusiness participation, be collected and maintained. Although the \ngovernment-wide procurement spending database, the Federal Procurement \nData System (FPDS), collects the data related to Hurricane Katrina and \nRita reconstruction, this data is demonstrably incomplete. According to \nthe Government Accountability Office and admissions of Federal \nprocurement officials, the FPDS data is not accurate and omits billions \nin Defense and Homeland Security contracts. As a result of these \ndeficiencies, the Executive Branch made exaggerated claims concerning \nthe share of reconstruction work that went to small businesses. For \ninstance, last October, the Commerce Department claimed that small \nbusinesses received 72 percent of Katrina contracting dollars, and the \nSBA claimed the small business share to be at 45 percent. During \nhearings before my Committee, the GAO confirmed that the \nAdministration's claimed numbers are unrealistic and unsubstantiated. \nMy legislation directs the Administrators of the SBA and the OFPP to \nensure that the Federal Procurement Data System reflects comprehensive \ngovernment-wide contracting spending on Katrina and Rita \nreconstruction.\n  For years, the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) \nprogram, created to direct Federal contacting dollars to small firms in \neconomically distressed areas, has been recognized as a potent economic \ndevelopment stimulus. Since its inception in 1997, the HUBZone program \nstimulated the hiring of over 124,000 HUBZone residents and investment \nof over half a billion dollars in HUBZones by HUBZone-certified firms. \nWith the support of the Administration, I propose extending the HUBZone \ndesignation to the disaster region. A HUBZone designation would enable \nsmall businesses located in the disaster area and employing people in \nthat area to receive contracting preferences and price evaluation \npreferences to offset greater costs of doing business. Extending the \nHUBZone designation to the Gulf Coast would bring needed businesses \ndevelopment tools to affected areas of the Gulf Coast. Under my \nproposal, the SBA Administrator would have the discretion to define the \ngeographic scope or duration of this designation to ensure that the \nHUBZone preference is targeted to those who need it the most.\n  Small businesses vying for government contracts or subcontracts often \nmust post bid or performance bonds in order to convince Federal \ncontracting officials or prime contractors that small business are a \ngood project risk. In turn, small firms must seek bonding from private \nbonding companies. The SBA, through its surety bond program,\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\nhas provided guarantees on bonds awarded to small businesses up to $2 \nmillion. But small firms need an increase in bonds to handle larger \nprojects for hurricane relief. Local small businesses in the Gulf Coast \ncan use higher bonds to compensate for the damage to their assets from \nthe hurricanes. My legislation would increase the maximum size of SBA \nsurety bonds from $2 million to $5 million, and provide the SBA with \nauthority to increase the maximum size to $10 million upon request of \nanother Federal agency. In its proposal to re-build the Gulf Coast \nregion, the Administration suggested making the $5 million increase.\n\n  My legislation also directs the SBA to create a contracting outreach \nprogram for small businesses located or willing to locate in the \nKatrina disaster area for the next five years. Federal contracts and \nsubcontracts can provide critical assistance to small businesses \nlocated in the areas devastated by the hurricanes in the form of solid \nbusiness opportunities and prompt, steady pay. In addition, government \nprocurement would open doors for many local small businesses to \nparticipate in the long-term reconstruction work in the Gulf Coast \nareas. While many small businesses would benefit from other forms of \ndisaster assistance, many of them want to get back to work and into \nbusiness as soon as possible. Technical assistance and outreach through \nthe SBA, the Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, the Federal \nOffices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilizations, and other \norganizations could prove invaluable to these firms.\n  Yet, outreach alone would not ensure fair participation of small \nbusinesses in Gulf Coast reconstruction contracts. To promote jobs \ncreation and development in the disaster region, the Federal Government \nmust set and follow definitive goals for small business participation. \nPrior to the disaster, small construction companies in Alabama, \nMississippi, and Louisiana received nearly $500 million in Federal \ncontracts a year. Total small business contracts in the Gulf Coast \nregion exceeded $3 billion a year. With the Federal cost of hurricane \nrelief and rebuilding estimated at over $100 billion, small businesses, \nparticularly those located in the disaster area and that employ \nindividuals in the affected areas, should receive their fair share of \nFederal contracting and subcontracting dollars. My legislation \nestablishes a 30 percent prime contracting goal and a 40 percent \nsubcontracting goal on each agency's hurricane-related reconstruction \ncontracts. These goals are compatible with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's and the Army Corps of Engineers' history of small business \nachievements.\n  My legislation would also address two unfortunate provisions in the \nSecond Katrina Supplemental Appropriations that unwisely changed the \nemergency procurement authority Congress granted to contracting \nofficers in the aftermath of 9/11 and reclassified many reconstruction \ncontracts into categories that excluded small firms from prime \ncontracting or subcontracting. I spoke out against these provisions, \nand Congress ultimately repealed them last year. Nonetheless, this bill \nputs in place safeguards to ensure that small firms do not fall prey to \nsuch actions again. My legislation protects the Small Business \nReservation (SBR) for disaster-related contracts below the Simplified \nAcquisition Threshold (SAT). The SAT and the SBR are normally set at \n$100,000. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act allowed Federal \nagencies to use simplified procedures for all contracts below the SAT, \nbut only if they attempt to place, or ``reserve'', these contracts to \nqualified small businesses. Many small businesses qualify for contracts \nunder expedited procedures under the Small Business Act, which would \nhelp to move the reconstruction process forward. The SBR does not delay \nrelief contracting. If no qualified small business is available to do \nthe job, agencies can place the contract with any qualified supplier. \nThis provision restores the parity between the SBR and the SAT any time \nthe SAT is increased for disaster-related contracts.\n  My legislation also restores small business subcontracting \nrequirements in emergency procurements. The Second Katrina Supplemental \nabolished small business subcontracting requirements for all Katrina-\nrelated contracts by treating contracts for hundreds of millions of \ndollars as purchases of commercial items, like contracts for office \nsupplies. This is an improper and unjustified procurement practice. The \nArmy Corps of Engineers currently imposes a 73 percent subcontracting \nrequirement on hurricane-related contracts, demonstrating that the \nsubcontracting requirements are not onerous. Under the Small Business \nAct, only a ``good faith effort'' to provide subcontracting \nopportunities is required. The legislation allows a grace period of 30 \ndays to negotiate an acceptable plan (subject to a 50 percent payment \nlimitation until the plan is concluded).\n  Looking forward, my legislation directs the Administrators of the \nOFPP and the SBA to work with other Federal agencies to ensure creation \nof multiple-award contracts for disaster recovery which are set aside \nfor small business concerns. As the GAO testified before the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship last year, Federal \nagencies lacked adequate acquisition planning for hurricane disaster \nrelief. This measure would reverse this practice both for ongoing and \nfor future disaster recovery efforts.\n  I am a firm believer that the reconstruction acquisition process must \nbe not only efficient, but also transparent. In this regard, the \nFederal Government provides central website postings for all Katrina-\nrelated opportunities through the SBA's Sub-NET. Unfortunately, the \nSBA's Sub-NET subcontracting database, though recommended by the \nGovernment, has been until recently unused by the Katrina prime \ncontractors. My legislation directs all prime contractors which \nreceived substantial Federal contracts related to the Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita for which subcontracting plans are required to post \nsubcontracting announcements on the SBA's Sub-NET online database.\n  Finally, my legislation addresses the government's failure to direct \ncontract dollars to those who need them the most--local small \nbusinesses. During the hearings in my Committee last November, I was \ndeeply troubled to discover that Federal agencies failed to grant \nbusiness opportunities to qualified Gulf Coast small firms. These \nshocking practices make a mockery of our national commitment to rebuild \nthe Gulf Coast. For instance, while investigating Hurricane Katrina \ncontracts at my request, the GAO found a memorandum from an official in \nthe Army Corps of Engineers informing the SBA that the Corps has \nsuccessfully concealed the information about millions of dollars in \nupcoming contracts for mobile classrooms in Mississippi from, among \nothers, local small businesses. The Corps requested that SBA approve \ngiving this work to an out-of-state company without any prior \nexperience. As a result, the Corps excluded a local small business, \nlicensed by the Mississippi Department of Education, from bidding. \nIncredibly, the SBA obliged and approved the contract three times, \neventually increasing its value from $10 million to $47 million.\n  Practices such as these violate Section 15 of the Small Business Act, \nwhich unequivocally directs priority in government contracts ``to small \nbusiness concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the \nproduction on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of \nconcentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus \nareas.'' It is hard to imagine a clearer example of an ``area of \nconcentrated unemployment or underemployment'' or a area with labor \nsurplus than the devastated Gulf Coast region. Nonetheless, some have \nignored the clear command of the statute. My legislation would \ndesignate the Gulf Coast disaster area as a labor surplus area for \npurposes of the Small Business Act's preference for labor surplus area \ncontractors. In addition, this provision authorizes Federal agencies to \nuse contractual set-asides, incentives, and penalties to enhance \nparticipation of local small business concerns in disaster recovery \ncontracts and subcontracts.\n  Finally, my legislation suspends the application of the Small \nBusiness Competitiveness Demonstration (Comp Demo) program to Gulf \nCoast disaster contracts. The Comp Demo Program denies the protections \nof the Small Business Act like set-asides to small businesses involved \nin construction and\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\nspecialty trade contracting, refuse systems and related services, \nlandscaping, pest control, non-nuclear ship repair, and architectural \nand engineering services, including surveying and mapping. \nHistorically, small businesses have been the backbone of these \nindustries, and these industries are in heavy demand for disaster \nrecovery efforts. The Comp Demo Program, ostensibly a test program, \ndenies Federal agencies likes the Departments of Defense and nine other \nagencies the ability to do small business set-asides. Essentially, the \nComp Demo Program reserves whole industries for big business. Last \nyear, at the request of the Department of Defense, I supported an \namendment to terminate the Comp Demo Program. The Senate agreed that \nsmall businesses in all industries should receive the full protections \nof the Small Business Act, and unanimously voted to repeal this \nProgram. Suspending this Program for Katrina and Rita contracts would \ngo a long way towards restoring fair treatment for small businesses \naffected by this disaster.\n  I believe this legislation will find broad support in this body. \nIndeed, the HUBZone designation, the outreach programs, and the surety \nbonding increase have already been adopted by the Senate on a vote of \n96-0 as part of my amendment to the Science, State, Commerce, and \nJustice Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2006. The provisions dealing \nwith the small business reservation offset and retention of small \nbusiness subcontracting in emergency procurements were cosponsored by a \nbi-partisan group of Senators as part of my bi-partisan disaster relief \nbill, S. 1807. With the Senate leadership and every Senator of both \nparties on the record in support of greater access of small businesses \nto Federal contracts, I look forward to speedy consideration of this \nlegislation and its support by the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 2614. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to establish a \nprogram to provide reimbursement for the installation of alternative \nenergy refueling systems; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation along \nwith my colleague from Illinois, Senator Obama, concerning what we \nbelieve is yet another important step in reducing our Nation's \ndependence on petroleum fuels.\n  S. 264, the Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006 would \nprovide an incentive for gas station owners across the country to \ninstall alternative refueling systems for automobiles. This legislation \nbuilds upon the existing tax credit that gas station owners can receive \nfor installing alternative energy tanks. Most importantly, I would like \nto point out to my colleagues that this legislation does not require \nany additional taxes.\n  Currently, as a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a tax credit \nof up to $30,000 is available through 2009 for gas station owners who \ninstall an alternative refueling system. Eligible alternative fuels \ninclude those that contain 85 percent by volume of ethanol, natural \ngas, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum \ngas, hydrogen, or any mixture of biodiesel or diesel fuel that is \ncomposed of at least 20 percent biodiesel.\n  Our legislation basically allows gas station owners and operators to \nbe reimbursed for 30 percent of the costs--not to exceed $30,000--of \ninstalling an alternative energy system.\n  One of the primary benefits of this legislation is that it can be \nused for up to two alternative refueling systems per gas station. This \nis important because under the tax credit that was part of last year's \nenergy bill, a gas station owner can only utilize the $30,000 tax \ncredit one time--even for those individuals who own multiple refueling \nstations.\n  For example, if a gas station owner in South Dakota, Illinois, or \nelsewhere wanted to install three new alternative refueling systems at \nhis or her gas station, under the current system that owner would be \nlimited to the $30,000 tax credit for a single alternative fuel system.\n  Under our legislation, that same gas station owner would continue to \nreceive the tax credit for the first alternative fuel system. However, \nthe station owner could also be reimbursed for 30 percent of the \ncosts--not to exceed $30,000--for up to two additional alternative \nrefueling systems. Therefore, the legislation we have introduced today \nwould drastically increase the incentives for gas station owners to \ninstall additional alternative fuel systems.\n  I am hopeful that if this bill is signed into law, gas station owners \nacross the country will be able to use this reimbursement mechanism to \nhelp consumers who already own or are thinking of purchasing an \nalternative fuel vehicle.\n  Senator Obama and I are both strong supporters of alternative fuels. \nIn fact, South Dakota and Illinois are leaders in the production of \nethanol--our Nation's leading renewable fuel. The legislation we are \nintroducing today in no way preferences ethanol over other alternative \nfuels. In fact, they are all treated equally under our bill.\n  Alternative fuels such as E-85, which is composed of 85 percent \nethanol, are starting to gain popularity. However, while automakers \nsuch as Ford and General Motors are producing an increasing number of \nflex fuel vehicles, which can run on either E-85 or gasoline, there is \na critical need for more alternative refueling sites across the \ncountry. Many individuals would be shocked to know that of the 180,000 \ngas stations across the country, only 600--far less than 1 percent--\noffer alternative fuels such as E-85.\n  There are approximately 5 million flexible fuel vehicles on the road \ntoday. The addition of alternative refueling systems--such as E-85, \ncompressed natural gas, biodiesel, and hydrogen--will allow American \nconsumers the ability to refuel their vehicles with alternative fuels \nthat are better for both the environment and our Nation's security.\n  As President Bush noted in his State of the Union Address earlier \nthis year, ``America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from \nunstable parts of the world.'' Since being elected to Congress I have \nworked hard in promoting the development of alternative energy sources. \nIn fact, last year's energy bill marked an important milestone due to \nthe 7.5 billion gallon renewable fuels standard that I and others \nadvocated.\n  S. 2614 utilizes the interest earned from the Leaking Underground \nStorage Tank Trust Fund, which currently has a $2.6 billion surplus, to \nreimburse eligible gas station owners who add alternative refueling \nsystems.\n  This trust fund continues to grow from a portion of the Federal gas \ntax--one-tenth of a cent per gallon--which amounted to roughly $190 \nmillion last year. The fund also continues to grow from the interest \nthat is earned on the balance of the fund, which amounted to roughly \n$67 million in 2005.\n  I firmly believe that the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program \nserves an important function in keeping our land and water safe from \nstorage tank releases. Our legislation simply seeks to use a portion of \nthe interest earned annually to reimburse gas station owners for a \nportion of the costs associated with the installation of new \nalternative refueling systems.\n  An added benefit of using a portion of the interest from this trust \nfund is that the installation of alternative refueling systems reduces \nthe overall number of petroleum tanks that can cause leaks.\n  Additionally, this bill ensures that States are not required to use \ntheir annual allocation of appropriated funding to reimburse gas \nstation owners for the installation of alternative refueling systems. \nSuch reimbursement would come directly from the EPA Administrator.\n  Mr. President, this bill would help to lessen our Nation's dependence \non foreign sources of oil and--increase the use of alternative fuels. \nIt is a step in the right direction, and is something I hope my \ncolleagues will support.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague from South \nDakota, Mr. Thune, in introducing the Alternative Energy Refueling \nSystem Act of 2006. I applaud his work in crafting this bill and I hope \nmy colleagues will provide their full support and work towards its \nswift enactment.\n  As members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the \nSenator from South Dakota and I have worked to promote the expansion of \nalternative fuels production capacity in the United States--most \nnotably\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\nwith the enactment of the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) included in \nlast year's Energy Policy Act of 2005. The RFS states that 7.5 billion \ngallons of ethanol must be phased into the 140-billion-gallon annual \nnational gasoline pool during the next 6 years.\n  That's a bold step in reducing our reliance on foreign oil, but we \ncan't just rely on greater production of alternative fuels if we also \ndon't make sure those fuels are available at gas stations. We need to \nmake sure that when American drivers want to ``fill `er up'' with \nsomething other than petroleum, they can.\n  Last year, I introduced S. 918, a bill to provide a tax credit for \nthe cost of installing alternative fuel pumps. I was pleased that this \ntax credit was enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Soon \nhundreds more ethanol and biodiesel pumps throughout the United States \nwill be installed as a result of this new policy.\n  But if we are serious about reducing our reliance on foreign oil in \nan expeditious fashion, we must intensify our efforts. We must double, \ntriple, and quadruple our efforts. And that's exactly the purpose of \nour bill today, which simply provides a partial Federal reimbursement \nfor the installation of alternative fuel pumps that otherwise are \nineligible or have received the new tax credit.\n  Many more alternative refueling properties will be established by \nthis bill--a strong complement to the tax credit passed last year. And \nthis bill is fully offset in that it is financed by using just a small \nslice of the approximately $70 million in annual interest generated by \nthe Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund. We don't ask to \nuse that small slice in perpetuity, but just for the next several years \nuntil enough alternative fuel refueling capacity is established across \nthe country.\n  The total principal of the LUST fund is more than $2.5 billion--none \nof which we propose to draw down. And given that this fund has been \ncapitalized by a one-tenth-of-a-penny fee for every gallon of petro-gas \nor petro-diesel purchased by the American people, it is altogether \nappropriate that any interest generated by any unused fractions-of-\npennies be reinvested in infrastructure that weans our Nation from its \ndependence on the Middle East. All of this can be accomplished, while \nensuring that the integrity of the LUST fund--which is used to clean up \nunderground storage tanks--remains fully intact and untouched. In fact, \nI hope my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee will take note and \nwill increase funding for LUST fund activities to the level it has long \nneeded and deserved.\n  The Thune-Obama bill is a good bill that will accomplish good things \nfor our national energy dependence, but even if enacted, this bill \ncannot by itself guarantee more alternative fuel refueling stations. As \nmy colleagues are aware, alternative fuel refueling stations make up \nonly a tiny fraction of the nationwide network of gas stations. And \nwhile that fraction is growing by leaps and bounds, the vast majority \nof stations within that small fraction are independently owned and \noperated.\n  By comparison, the big oil companies--the Exxons, the BPs, or the \nConocoPhillips of the American petroleum industry--have not installed \nalternative fuel pumps. Rather, the evidence is accumulating that these \ncompanies have used institutional policies to deter the installation of \nalternative fuel pumps despite their retailers asking to sell these new \nfuels to meet growing consumer demand.\n  I think these practices must end. It is time for these companies to \ndemonstrate leadership and reinvest in America. Until that day comes, \nhowever, I pledge to continue my work in Congress with like-minded \ncolleagues to ensure that this Nation invests in a 21st Century \nrefueling structure. The bill we are introducing today is part of that \ninvestment. I thank my colleague from South Dakota for his authorship \non this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Menendez, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2617. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to limit \nincreases in the costs to retired members of the Armed Forces of health \ncare services under the TRICARE program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Military \nRetirees' Health Care Protection Act along with my colleagues, Senators \nHagel, Kerry, Menendez, Lincoln, and DeWine.\n  This important legislation will keep the Pentagon from dramatically \nraising health care fees on military retirees.\n  Our bill will limit increases to TRICARE military health insurance \npremiums, deductibles, and co-payments for those in the National Guard \nand Reserves who are enrolled in TRICARE. Under this legislation, \nincreases in health care fees cannot exceed the rate of growth in \nuniformed services beneficiaries' military compensation, thereby \nprotecting beneficiaries from an undue financial burden.\n  In February, officials at the Department of Defense (DOD) announced \nplans to double fees on senior enlisted retirees and triple them for \nofficer retirees. If enacted this would mean increases of up to $1,000 \nannually for some military retirees. While the Department of Defense \nhas since temporarily halted plans to raise fees, it still has \nauthority to implement steep increases in the future and may do so. We \nmust pass legislation now that limits the amount of any health care \nincrease and protects beneficiaries from extreme health care fee \nincreases in the future.\n  Senator Hagel and I want to demonstrate our commitment to our troops \nand future veterans by assuring them that just as they protected us, we \nwill take care of them when their service ends. Just as our men and \nwomen in uniform vow never to leave a soldier behind in battle, so \nshould we commit never to leave a veteran behind when he or she needs \nhealth care.\n  For three years, Congress has rejected a $250 Veterans Administration \nhealth fee increase for non-disabled veterans--doubling and tripling \nfees for career military is equally inappropriate.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support our troops \nby supporting this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Retirees Health \n     Care Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Career members of the Armed Forces and their families \n     endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n     extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-\n     year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans.\n       (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices \n     are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the \n     current Global War on Terrorism, but also during the wars of \n     the last 60 years when current retired members of the Armed \n     Forces were on continuous call to go in harm's way when and \n     as needed.\n       (3) The demands and sacrifices are such that few Americans \n     are willing to bear or accept them for a multi-decade career.\n       (4) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n     extraordinary retirement benefits that a grateful Nation \n     provides for those who choose to subordinate much of their \n     personal life to the national interest for so many years.\n       (5) One effect of such curtailment is that retired members \n     of the Armed Forces are turning for health care services to \n     the Department of Defense, and its TRICARE program, for the \n     health care benefits in retirement that they earned by their \n     service in the Armed Forces.\n       (6) In some cases, civilian employers establish financial \n     incentives for employees who are also eligible for \n     participation in the TRICARE program to receive health care \n     benefits under that program rather than under the health care \n     benefits programs of such employers.\n       (7) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n     to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, a \n     large part of those efforts has been devoted to shifting a \n     larger share of the costs of benefits under that program to \n     retired members of the Armed Forces.\n       (8) The cumulative increase in enrollment fees, \n     deductibles, and copayments being proposed by the Department \n     of Defense for\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\n     health care benefits under the TRICARE program far exceeds \n     the 31 percent increase in military retired pay since such \n     fees, deductibles, and copayments were first required on the \n     part of retired members of the Armed Forces 10 years ago.\n       (9) Proposals of the Department of Defense for increases in \n     the enrollment fees, deductibles, and copayments of retired \n     members of the Armed Forces who are participants in the \n     TRICARE program fail to recognize adequately that such \n     members paid the equivalent of enormous in-kind premiums for \n     health care in retirement through their extended sacrifices \n     by service in the Armed Forces.\n       (10) Some of the Nation's health care providers refuse to \n     accept participants in the TRICARE program as patients \n     because that program pays them significantly less than \n     commercial insurance programs, and imposes unique \n     administrative requirements, for health care services.\n       (11) The Department of Defense has chosen to count the \n     accrual deposit to the Department of Defense Military Retiree \n     Health Care Fund against the budget of the Department of \n     Defense, contrary to the requirements of section 1116 of \n     title 10, United States Code, as amended section 725 of \n     Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2005 (Public Law 108-375; 118 Stat. 1991).\n       (12) Senior officials of the Department of Defense leaders \n     have reported to Congress that counting such deposits against \n     the budget of the Department of Defense is impinging on other \n     readiness needs of the Armed Forces, including weapons \n     programs, an inappropriate situation which section 1116 of \n     title 10, United States Code, was intended expressly to \n     prevent.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have a \n     committed obligation to provide health care benefits to \n     retired members of the Armed Forces that exceeds the \n     obligation of corporate employers to provide health care \n     benefits to their employees;\n       (2) the Department of Defense has many additional options \n     to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that \n     do not disadvantage retired members of the Armed Forces who \n     participate or seek to participate in the TRICARE program and \n     should pursue any and all such options rather than seeking \n     large increases for enrollment fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments for such retirees, and their families or \n     survivors, who do participate in that program;\n       (3) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments that may be considered under the TRICARE program \n     for retired members of the Armed Forces and their families or \n     survivors should not in any case exceed the percentage \n     increase in military retired pay; and\n       (4) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments under the TRICARE program that may be considered \n     for members of the Armed Forces who are currently serving on \n     active duty or in the Selected Reserve, and for the families \n     of such members, should not exceed the percentage increase in \n     basic pay or compensation for such members.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS \n                   FOR MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Pharmacy Benefits Program.--Section 1074g of title 10, \n     United Stated Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) The amount of any cost sharing requirements under \n     this paragraph shall not be increased in any year by a \n     percentage that exceeds the percentage increase of the most \n     current previous adjustment to retired pay for members of the \n     armed forces under section 1401a(b)(2) of this title. To the \n     extent that such increase for any year is less than one \n     dollar, the accumulated increase may be carried over from \n     year to year, rounded to the nearest dollar.''.\n       (b) Premiums for TRICARE Standard for Reserve Component \n     Members Who Commit to Service in the Selected Reserve After \n     Active Duty.--Section 1076d(d)(3) of such title is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The monthly amount'' and inserting ``(A) \n     Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the monthly amount''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(B) In any year after 2006, the percentage increase in \n     the amount of the premium in effect for a month for TRICARE \n     Standard coverage under this section may not exceed a \n     percentage equal to the percentage of the most recent \n     increase in the rate of basic pay authorized for members of \n     the uniformed services for a year.''.\n       (c) Copayments Under CHAMPUS.--Section 1086(b)(3) of such \n     title is amended in the first sentence by inserting before \n     the period at the end the following: ``, except that in no \n     event may such charges exceed $535 per day''.\n       (d) Prohibition on Enrollment Fees Under CHAMPUS.--Section \n     1086(b) of such title is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) A person covered by subsection (c) may not be charged \n     an enrollment fee for coverage under this section.''.\n       (e) Premiums and Other Charges Under TRICARE.--Section \n     1097(e) of such title is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``The Secretary of \n     Defense''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) In any year after 2006, the percentage increase in \n     the amount of any premium, deductible, copayment or other \n     charge established by the Secretary of Defense under this \n     section may not exceed the percentage increase of the most \n     current previous adjustment of retired pay for members and \n     former members of the armed forces under section 1041a(b)(2) \n     of this title.''.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nSenator LAUTENBERG's and Senator HAGEL's bill, the Military Retirees \nHealth Care Protection Act, which I have co-sponsored. We must ensure \nthat our military personnel and military retirees, as well as their \nfamilies, have access to affordable, quality health insurance.\n  Over the past 10 years, military health care benefits have been \ngreatly expanded to include Medicare eligible retirees, Reservists, and \ntheir families. Additionally, new options for health care have been \nadded for active duty families, including an elimination of co-pays if \nthe families use military treatment facilities instead of civilian \ndoctors. Since 1995, health insurance costs have increased in the \ncivilian sector, but TRICARE rates have not increased. If fees aren't \nincreased and other avenues for funding TRICARE aren't explored, \ndefense health care costs, alone, may rise to as much as $64 billion by \n2015.\n  As part of the fiscal year 2007 budget request, the Department of \nDefense proposed a significant increase to the enrollment and \nprescription drug prices for military retirees under age 65 and \nsurvivors. This increase would more than double enrollment fees. In \nalmost every case, that's an unfathomable single-year increase for \nfamilies who live on a very tight budget. This is particularly \ntroublesome when the Department of Defense has many other options that \nit may pursue to limit the mounting costs of medicine.\n  In addition, last year I worked to extend military health insurance \nto every dependent child of a deceased servicemember at no cost as if \nthat parent were still alive and serving our Nation. The Department of \nDefense indicates that this important benefit could save dependents as \nmuch as $15,000 per year compared to the cost of private health \ninsurance premiums. This cost-free extension of TRICARE Prime medical \ninsurance to surviving minor children will alleviate one of the biggest \nworries on families today--and that's health care costs. However, if \npremiums and fees are increased drastically for the surviving spouse, \nworries about health care costs will still weigh heavily on these \nfamilies. TRICARE Prime premium increases would undo the good we have \naccomplished on this front.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would begin to address the \nneed for premiums and other health care fees to keep pace with the rise \nin health care costs, while keeping in mind the effect such increases \nwould have on the yearly budget for our military retirees, survivors, \nand their families.\n  This proposal calls for a yearly increase in premiums that is \nequivalent to the cost of living increase that military retirees \nreceive. For instance, if the cost of living increase is 2 percent, \nTRICARE Prime premiums will increase by 2 percent. Similarly, under \nthis proposal, fees for TRICARE Reserve Select--which I have fought for \nwith many of my colleagues--would increase by the same percent as the \nbasic pay raise. I believe that these represent fair fee increases for \nthe men, women, and families who have selflessly served our country.\n  Unfortunately, I understand that these modest fee increases will not \ncompletely solve the rising costs of providing superior military health \ncare. I encourage the Department of Defense to explore other options \nfor reducing the overall cost to taxpayers of delivering this benefit. \nFor instance, the DoD should negotiate with drug manufacturers for \ndiscounts in the TRICARE retail pharmacy network and encourage \nbeneficiaries to use the mail-order pharmacy. There are many more \noptions available to DoD to fund this health care system, which I \nstrongly urge them to explore.\n  I believe we owe a great debt of gratitude to those men, women, and \nfamilies who served our country in the armed services in uniform and on \nthe home front. It is essential that we\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\nhonor our commitment and investigate all available options for funding \nour military health care system, rather than strap the bill on the \nbacks of those who already have paid for their health insurance with \ntheir blood, sweat, and tears. I will continue to work with Senators \nLautenberg and Hagel to ensure fair treatment of these men and women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2618. A bill to permit an individual to be treated by a health \ncare practitioner with any method of medical treatment such individual \nrequests, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Grassley \ntoday to introduce the Access to Medical Treatment Act. The idea behind \nthis legislation is to allow greater freedom of choice and increased \naccess in the realm of medical treatments, while preventing abuses of \nunscrupulous entrepreneurs. The Access to Medical Treatment Act allows \nindividual patients and their properly licensed health care providers \nto use certain alternative and complementary therapies not approved by \nthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but that may be approved \nelsewhere. As more Americans seek out alternative and complimentary \ntreatments for their health care, we need to be responsive. We need to \nsee what works and what does not, but we also need to make sure that \npatients are protected, and are not misled about the potential benefits \nand risks of alternative treatments. The Access to Medical Treatment \nAct presents one option to help Americans make better choices, and it \nis my hope that this legislation can help spur a dialogue about the \nbest way to promote access to safe and effective alternative medical \ntreatments.\n  Importantly, the bill contains an informed consent protection for \npatients, modeled after the National Institutes of Health's, NIH, human \nsubject protection regulations. Under the protections provided for in \nthe legislation, a patient must be fully informed, orally and in \nwriting of the following: the nature, content and methods of the \nmedical treatment; that the treatment is not approved by the FDA; the \nanticipated benefits and risks of the treatment; any reasonably \nforeseeable side effects that may result; the results of past \napplications of the treatment by the health care provider and others; \nthe comparable benefits and risks of any available FDA-approved \ntreatment conventionally used for the patient's condition; and any \nfinancial interest the provider has in the product. The consent \ndocuments will then become part of the patient's medical record.\n  Providers and manufacturers are required to report to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, any adverse effects from \nalternative treatments, and must immediately cease use and manufacture \nof the product, pending a CDC investigation. The CDC is required to \nconduct an investigation of any adverse effects, and if the product is \nshown to cause any danger to patients, the physician and manufacturers \nare required to immediately inform all providers who have been using \nthe product of the danger.\n  Our legislation ensures the public's access to reliable information \nabout complementary and alternative therapies by requiring providers \nand manufacturers to report the results of the use of their product to \nthe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH, \nwhich is then required to compile and analyze the information for an \nannual report. The bill also stipulates that the provider and \nmanufacturer may make no advertising claims regarding the safety and \neffectiveness of the treatment of therapy, and grants FDA the authority \nto guarantee that the labeling of the treatment is not false or \nmisleading.\n  Mr. President, the goal of this legislation is to preserve the \nconsumer's freedom to choose alternative therapies while addressing the \nfundamental concern of protecting patients from dangerous treatments \nand those who would advocate unsafe and ineffective therapies. I hope \nthat we have struck the appropriate balance, and I welcome feedback \nfrom interested parties.\n  It wasn't long ago that William Roentgen was afraid to publish his \ndiscovery of X-rays as a diagnostic tool. He knew they would be \nconsidered an alternative medical practice and widely rejected by the \nmedical establishment. As everyone knows, X-rays are a common \ndiagnostic tool today. Well into this century, many scientists resisted \nbasic antiseptic techniques as quackery because they refused to accept \nthe germ theory of disease. I think we can all be thankful the medical \nprofession came around on that one.\n  The underlying point is this: today's consumers want alternatives in \nmany medical situations for them and their families. They want less \ninvasive, less expensive preventive options. Americans want to stay \nhealthy. And they are speaking with their feet and their pocketbooks. \nMr. President, Americans spend $30 billion annually on unconventional \ntherapies. That is one of the reasons we established the National \nCenter for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine, NCCAM, at NIH in \n1998. As more Americans look for alternative courses of treatment, we \nneeded to provide a way to see what works and what does not. This bill \nis another step in that direction.\n  This legislation simply provides patients the freedom to use--with \nstrong consumer protections--the complementary and alternative \ntherapies and treatments that have the potential to relieve pain and \ncure disease. And it provides a means to see what works and what does \nnot. I thank Senator Grassley for his continued leadership on this \nissue, and urge my colleagues to consider this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 2620. A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize \nthe Assistant Secretary for Aging to provide older individuals with \nfinancial assistance to select a flexible range of home and community-\nbased long-term care services or supplies, provided in a manner that \nrespects the individuals' choices and preferences; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nCommunity-Based Choices for Older Americans Act of 2006. This \nlegislation would take several important steps toward helping older \nAmericans meet their long-term care needs.\n  Issues related to long-term care are of growing concern to many in \nNew York and around the country, especially as baby boomers begin to \nrequire more of these important services. Older Americans are \nstruggling to afford costly care and to maintain dignity and choice \nregarding these services.\n  As I talk with seniors around the State of New York and throughout \nthe country, what I hear most is that people want to stay in their \nhomes for as long as they can. However, too many individuals struggle \nto afford quality home and community-based care and, as a result, are \nforced into institutional care: A more costly outcome they do not \ndesire and that places additional burden on the Medicaid program.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today. The Community-\nBased Choices for Older Americans Act will assist individuals age 60 or \nolder who grapple with daily living activities or with a disability, \nyet are above a State's Medicaid eligibility threshold, in meeting \ntheir long-term care needs.\n  This bill will establish a matching grant program to States to help \nthese individuals pay for a broad range of health, social, and \nsupportive services based on the individuals' personal choices and \npreferences in collaboration with a service coordinator. Eligible \nindividuals will be able to purchase services and supports that would \nbe provided in home or community-based settings, such as home \nmodifications like a wheelchair or ramp, assistance with grocery \nshopping or meal preparation, or adult day services.\n  This legislation is based on the Cash and Counseling model \nsuccessfully used in demonstration projects in 15 States. This \nconsumer-directed approach offers individuals more choice, flexibility, \nand control in managing their daily lives.\n  Through this bill, State Agencies on Aging throughout the country \nwill be given the tools to develop a community-based, long-term care \nsystem where seniors choose the services and the providers they want so \nthey are able to maintain independence and dignity while they age in \nplace in the\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\nhomes and communities where they have often lived for decades.\n  This year marks the first year that the baby boom population turns \n60. Development of a consumer-friendly, home and community-based system \nof long-term care is a critical step in planning services for this \npopulation.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to ensure passage \nof this bill to help our seniors choose the long-term care resources \nand services they need to remain independent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community-Based Choices for \n     Older Americans Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that \nexpresses the Sense of Congress that colleges and universities should \ncontinue to educate their students about the importance of intellectual \nproperty and the harm caused by copyright infringement. I am joined in \nintroducing this resolution by Senators Leahy, Hatch, and Nelson of \nFlorida, and I thank them for their support.\n  The intent of this resolution is to help draw attention to the \nproblem of digital piracy on campus through the use of university \ncomputer networks to illegally share copyrighted materials. Efforts to \ncombat digital piracy were bolstered last year when the U.S. Supreme \nCourt handed down its decision in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. \nThat ruling has allowed the movie and recording industries to take \nadditional steps to protect intellectual property and prevent what \nJustice Breyer described in the Grokster decision as ``no less an \nunlawful taking of property than garden-variety theft.''\n  However, truly stamping out digital piracy requires that we challenge \nthe widespread belief that there is nothing wrong with illegally \ndownloading music and other copyrighted material, and that it doesn't \nhurt anybody except for rich performers and corporate executives who \nhave plenty of money. I can tell you that's not true because I have \npersonally met with songwriters from Nashville who have explained how \nillegal downloading has hurt their livelihoods. There are many other \nAmericans without million-dollar bank accounts who have been hurt by \ncopyright infringement as well.\n  The place to start turning that belief around is at our institutions \nof higher learning. For many students, a college campus is the first \nplace where they have high-speed Internet access and are exposed to \ntechnology that allows them to trade copyrighted files with other \ncomputer users. At the same time, college campuses are the source of \nsome of our Nation's most valuable intellectual property. The \ncombination of these two factors makes our colleges and universities \nthe ideal place for students to develop a respect for intellectual \nproperty and to understand the harm caused by copyright infringement.\n  The resolution that my colleagues and I are introducing today \nencourages colleges and universities to take a leadership role in \neducating students regarding the importance of protecting intellectual \nproperty, and to take steps to prevent unauthorized downloading on \ntheir computer systems. Throughout the country, many schools are \nalready meeting this challenge. In my own State, Vanderbilt University \nhas taken steps to instill respect for intellectual property in its \nstudents, while taking action to prevent its computer system from being \nmisused. For example, Vanderbilt has created VUmix, a music downloading \nservice, to help its students understand the digital piracy issue and \nprovide them with a legal alternative. The VUmix service is part of\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nthe university's Digital Life Initiative, a comprehensive approach to \noffering music, film, and other forms of digital media to the \nVanderbilt community. Other schools are doing similar things to combat \ncopyright infringement, and this resolution encourages such efforts.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and promote \nrespect for one of America's most valuable assets: its intellectual \nproperty.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to stand with my \ncolleagues, Senator Alexander, Senator Hatch, and Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, to express the sense of this Congress that institutions of \nhigher education should act diligently to help eliminate the harms from \nthe illicit copyright infringement that plagues many campus computer \nsystems.\n  Online piracy, especially illegal file-sharing of copyrighted works \nsuch as music, movies and software, is a growing problem. While I \nalways encourage technological innovation, I am also acutely aware of \nthe need to respect the intellectual property rights and talent of \nthose who create the works that are made available online. Some peer-\nto-peer software applications allow individuals, without authorization, \nto copy and distribute--for free--unlimited numbers of these valuable \nworks. The speed and convenience of our universities' networks, which \nwere built for academic pursuits, have unfortunately also proved to be \na lure for students seeking to engage in this illegal and detrimental \nbehavior.\n  When music and movie industry representatives speak with me about \nthis problem, they describe a disturbing level of online piracy. In \naddition to exposing students to legal liability, illegal file-sharing \non school networks may compromise the integrity of those systems by \nusing up expensive bandwidth, introducing spyware, and hosting \ndestructive viruses.\n  I am pleased that colleges and universities in my home state have \nbeen working for nearly two years to combat these problems. In July \n2004, Middlebury College, located in Middlebury VT, announced a deal \nwith Napster to provide legitimate file sharing services that offer \nonline music to students. It is my hope that more institutions will \nfollow in step, and work to provide students with the tools needed to \nlawfully access the wealth of information available on the web.\n  As technology continues to advance, the issues that surround \nlegitimately accessing online content will become increasingly \nimportant. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the isle for \nworking with me to convey this important message.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3395-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 439--DESIGNATING THE THIRD WEEK OF APRIL 2006 AS \n            ``NATIONAL SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Salazar, Mr. \nDurbin, and Mr. Coleman) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 439\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated ``National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month'' as an annual tradition that \n     was initiated in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the most recent National Child Abuse and Neglect \n     Data System figures reveal that almost 900,000 children were \n     victims of abuse and neglect in the United States in 2002, \n     causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our most vulnerable \n     citizens;\n       Whereas among the children who are victims of abuse and \n     neglect, nearly 4 children die in the United States each day;\n       Whereas children aged 1 year or younger accounted for 41.2 \n     percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2002, \n     and children aged 4 years or younger accounted for 76.1 \n     percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2002;\n       Whereas abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as \n     ``Shaken Baby Syndrome'', is recognized as the leading cause \n     of death of physically abused children;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas a 2003 report in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association estimated that, in the United States, an \n     average of 300 children will die each year, and 600 to 1,200 \n     more will be injured, of whom \\2/3\\ will be babies or infants \n     under 1 year in age, as a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome, \n     with many cases resulting in severe and permanent \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas medical professionals believe that thousands of \n     additional cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome are being \n     misdiagnosed or are not detected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent, \n     irreparable brain damage or death to an infant and may result \n     in more than $1,000,000 in medical costs to care for a \n     single, disabled child in just the first few years of life;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent the abuse, and it is clear that the \n     minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     prevent enormous medical and disability costs and \n     immeasurable amounts of grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how they can help protect their child from \n     injury can bring about a significant reduction in the number \n     of cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs have been shown to raise \n     awareness and provide critically important information about \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome to parents, caregivers, daycare workers, \n     child protection employees, law enforcement personnel, health \n     care professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas efforts to prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome are \n     supported by advocacy groups across the United States that \n     were formed by parents and relatives of children who have \n     been killed or injured by shaking, including the National \n     Shaken Baby Coalition, the Shaken Baby Association, the \n     Shaking Kills: Instead Parents Please Educate and Remember \n     Initiative (commonly known as the ``SKIPPER Initiative''), \n     the Shaken Baby Alliance, Shaken Baby Prevention, Inc., A \n     Voice for Gabbi, Don't Shake Jake, and the Kierra Harrison \n     Foundation, whose mission is to educate the general public \n     and professionals about Shaken Baby Syndrome and to increase \n     support for victims and the families of the victims in the \n     health care and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas child abuse prevention programs and ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' are supported by the \n     National Shaken Baby Coalition, the National Center on Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome, the Children's Defense Fund, the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics, the Child Welfare League of America, \n     Prevent Child Abuse America, the National Child Abuse

of the United States \n     believe that, of all the public health issues facing the \n     United States, child abuse and neglect is the most important \n     issue;\n       Whereas Congress previously designated the third week of \n     April 2001 as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week \n     2001''; and\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the third week of April 2006 as ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness

Con. Res. 88\n\n       Whereas, since November 2005, the Beijing Judicial Bureau \n     has shut down the law firm and suspended the license of Mr. \n     Gao Zhisheng, one of China's best known lawyers and legal \n     rights defenders;\n       Whereas Mr. Gao has represented citizens of China in \n     lawsuits against various local and administrative \n     governmental bodies of the People's Republic of China over \n     corruption, land seizures, police abuse, and violations of \n     religious freedom;\n       Whereas Mr. Gao wrote 3 open letters to President Hu Jintao \n     and Premier Wen Jiabao condemning the methods employed by the \n     Government of China in implementing its ban on ``evil \n     cults'', such as the Falun Gong and an additional letter \n     documenting severe persecution of Christians in Xinjiang \n     Uighur Autonomous Region;\n       Whereas Mr. Gao's law practice filed a petition to appeal \n     the verdict against Cai Zhuohua, who was found guilty of \n     ``illegal business practices'' based upon his distribution of \n     Bibles and religious material;\n       Whereas Mr. Gao's home has been constantly monitored by \n     agents from the Ministry of State Security and Mr. Gao was \n     prevented by the Public Security Ministry from meeting with \n     the representatives of the United Nations Special Rapporteur \n     on Torture during his November 2005 visit to Beijing;\n       Whereas agents of the Public Security Bureau of China, \n     numbering between 10 and 20, have consistently monitored the \n     activities and whereabouts of Mr. Gao, his wife, and his \n     daughter since late November 2005;\n       Whereas, on November 10, 2005, an open letter, signed by \n     138 organizations worldwide, was submitted to President Bush \n     calling on him to voice support of Mr. Gao and his legal \n     practice during the President's November 2005 visit to China;\n       Whereas other human rights lawyers, collectively known as \n     ``rights defenders'', or Wei Quan, have also faced \n     harassment, arrest, and detention for their consistent and \n     vigorous activities to defend the fundamental rights of the \n     people of China, contrary to measures within the law of China \n     protecting human rights and rights of lawyers;\n       Whereas Mr. Chen Guangcheng, a blind human rights lawyer \n     who has exposed cases of violence against women, including \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization perpetrated by \n     authorities of China under the 1-child policy, was beaten on \n     October 10, 2005, and currently remains under house arrest;\n       Whereas law professor and People's Political Consultative \n     Congress Delegate, Xu Zhiyong, who advocates on behalf of \n     petitioners filing grievances with the Central government in \n     Beijing, was also beaten on October 10, 2005, when meeting \n     with Chen Guangcheng;\n       Whereas Mr. Yang Maodong (also known as Guo Feixiong), a \n     lawyer representing villagers in Taishi village who attempted \n     to oust their village head in peaceful elections, has been \n     arbitrarily detained repeatedly and remains under consistent \n     surveillance by security agents;\n       Whereas Mr. Tang Jingling, a Guangdong based lawyer also \n     working on the Taishi village elections case, has been fired \n     from his law firm and was beaten on February 2, 2006, after \n     attempting to meet with Yang Maodong;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State 2005 Country \n     Reports on Human Rights Practices, lawyers who aggressively \n     tried to defend their clients continued to face serious \n     intimidation and abuse by police and prosecutors, and some of \n     these lawyers were detained;\n       Whereas the Constitution of China states that the courts \n     shall, in accordance with the law, exercise judicial power \n     independently, without interference from administrative \n     organs, social organizations, and individuals, but in \n     practice, the judiciary is not independent and it receives \n     policy guidance from both the Government of China and the \n     Communist Party, whose leaders use a variety of means to \n     direct courts on verdicts and sentences, particularly in \n     politically sensitive cases;\n       Whereas the Criminal Procedure Law of China gives suspects \n     the right to seek legal counsel, but defendants in \n     politically sensitive cases frequently find it difficult to \n     find an attorney;\n       Whereas the Lawyers Law of the People's Republic of China \n     states that a lawyer may ``accept engagement by a criminal \n     suspect in a criminal case to provide him with legal advice \n     and represent him in filing a petition or charge or obtaining \n     a guarantor pending trial'';\n       Whereas according to Article 306 of the Criminal Law of \n     China, defense attorneys can be held responsible if their \n     clients commit perjury, and prosecutors and judges in such \n     cases have wide discretion in determining what constitutes \n     perjury;\n       Whereas according to the All-China Lawyers Association, \n     since 1997 more than 500 defense attorneys have been detained \n     on similar charges, and such cases continued during the last \n     year despite promises made by the Government of China to \n     amend Article 306;\n       Whereas the State Department's 2005 Annual Report on Human \n     Rights states that China's human rights record ``remained \n     poor'', that authorities of China quickly moved to suppress \n     those who openly expressed dissenting political views, and \n     that writers, religious activists, dissidents, lawyers, and \n     petitioners to the Central Government were particularly \n     targeted;\n       Whereas directly following their August 2005 visit to \n     China, the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom found that--\n       (1) the Government of China actively seeks to control and \n     suppress the activities of unregistered religious \n     organizations;\n       (2) China has outlawed unregistered religious organizations \n     and provides severe penalties for engaging in unregistered \n     religious activities;\n       (3) leaders of unregistered Protestant organizations have \n     come under increased pressure to register their churches and \n     affiliate with one of the government approved organizations, \n     and those who refuse, for theological or other reasons, are \n     subject to harassment, detention, arrest, and closing of \n     their religious facilities;\n       (4) groups determined by the Government of China to be \n     ``evil cults'', such as Falun Gong, are brutally suppressed; \n     and\n       (5) practitioners of Falun Gong have experienced severe \n     persecution, including arrests, numerous detentions, torture, \n     irregular trials, imprisonment, and subjection to the \n     reeducation through labor system, whereby accused criminals \n     are subject to up to 3 years detention;\n       Whereas despite questions raised by the Government of the \n     United States and others about the charges made against \n     Pastor Cai Zhuohua, the Government of China sentenced Pastor \n     Cai and other members of his family to 3 years in prison for \n     ``illegal business practices'' for their printing and \n     distribution of religious materials;\n       Whereas, according to China's Regulations on Religious \n     Affairs, promulgated in March 2005, any religious \n     organization that carries out activities without registering \n     with the government is subject to civil punishment and to \n     criminal prosecution;\n       Whereas since the promulgation of the Regulations on \n     Religious Affairs, the Government of China has stepped up its \n     efforts to eliminate unregistered religious activity, with \n     raids on ``house church'' Christian groups in several \n     provinces, resulting in detention of hundreds of leaders of \n     the house church, dozens of whom remain in custody; and\n       Whereas the Government of China has, on several occasions, \n     stated a commitment to ratify the International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, but has delayed ratification \n     since signing the document in 1998: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) Congress--\n       (A) commends ``rights defense'' lawyers and activists of \n     China for their courage and integrity, and expresses moral \n     support for\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\n     this grass-roots ``rights defense'' movement in China;\n       (B) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China, \n     at all levels, to cease its harassment of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, \n     overturn the suspension of his license to practice law, and \n     restore his legal right to represent the clients of his \n     choosing as protected by China's own Constitution, its \n     Criminal Procedure Law, and its Lawyers Law;\n       (C) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to repeal Article 306 of the Criminal Code of China, which \n     provides penalties for lawyers whose clients are accused of \n     perjury and has been used to curtail the active legal defense \n     of individuals accused of political crimes;\n       (D) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to undertake measures to further amend the Lawyers Law to \n     ensure lawyers' rights to investigate charges brought against \n     their clients, to provide a vigorous defense of their \n     clients, and to remain free of harassment and intimidation \n     throughout the course of representing clients, including \n     clients who are charged with offenses related to political or \n     religious activities;\n       (E) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to respect fully the universality of the right to freedom of \n     religion or belief and other human rights;\n       (F) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to ratify and implement in law the International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, and to adopt such legislative or \n     other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the \n     rights recognized in the Covenant;\n       (G) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to amend or repeal Article 300 of the Criminal Code of China \n     so it is consistent with international law, and to halt its \n     crackdown on spiritual movements;\n       (H) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to halt arrests, harassment, and intimidation of leaders of \n     unregistered religious organizations on the basis that their \n     organizations violated the law by not registering with the \n     Government of China;\n       (I) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to Amend the Regulations on Religious Affairs to conform more \n     closely with the internationally recognized freedom of \n     thought, conscience, religion or belief and allow all \n     religious believers in China to practice their religion \n     without interference from the government or from government \n     sponsored ``patriotic religious associations'';\n       (J) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to release Pastor Cai Zhuohua, his wife, and others \n     imprisoned with him, and to allow Pastor Cai to resume \n     religious activities and to resume leadership of his \n     congregation in Beijing; and\n       (K) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to invite the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human \n     Rights on freedom of religion or belief to China as promised \n     according to an agreement between the Ministry of Foreign \n     Affairs of China and the Department of State of China in \n     March 2005; and\n       (2) it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) the Government of the United States should support \n     democracy and human rights programs that strengthen \n     protection of basic rights and freedoms, and should initiate \n     programs to train lawyers, judges, academics, and students in \n     China about international human rights law, to inform \n     citizens of China about international human rights norms, and \n     to build organizations and associations to promote these \n     priorities;\n       (B) the Government of the United States should support \n     programs to promote legal protections and cultural awareness \n     of the right to the freedom of religion or belief in China; \n     and\n       (C) the President should raise the issue of the Government \n     of China's harassment, arrest, detention, and persecution of \n     rights defense lawyers and activists and the need for the \n     Government of China to respect the basic human rights of its \n     citizens and the rule of law with Chinese President Hu \n     Jintao.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 439, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 439) to designate the third week of \n     April 2006 as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness \n     Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nSenator Alexander, to introduce a resolution that of the resolution the \nSenate has passed to proclaim the third week of April of 2006 as Shaken \nBaby Syndrome Awareness Week. Last year, we passed a similar resolution \nand continue to support raising awareness of this important issue. I \nwould like to recognize the many groups, particularly the National \nShaken Baby Coalition and the SKIPPER Initiative, who support this \neffort to increase awareness of one of the most devastating forms of \nchild abuse, one that results in the death or lifelong disability of \nhundreds of children each year.\n  We must recognize child abuse and neglect as the public health \nproblem it is, one that is linked with a host of other problems facing \nour country and one that needs the comprehensive approach of our entire \npublic health system to solve. The month of April has been designated \nNational Child Abuse Prevention Month as an annual tradition that was \ninitiated in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter. In 2006, April is \nagain National Child Abuse Prevention Month.\n  The tragedy of child abuse is well documented. According to the \nNational Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, NCANDS, almost 900,000 \nchildren were victims of abuse and neglect in the United States in \n2002, causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our most vulnerable \ncitizens. Each day, nearly four of these children die as a result of \nthis abuse. Most experts are certain that cases of child abuse and \nneglect are in fact underreported.\n  Abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as Shaken Baby \nSyndrome, is recognized as the leading cause of death of physically \nabused children, especially young children. Shaken Baby Syndrome is a \ntotally preventable form of child abuse that results from a caregiver \nlosing control and shaking a baby, usually an infant who is less than 1 \nyear old. This severe shaking can kill the baby, or it can cause loss \nof vision, brain damage, paralysis, and seizures, resulting in lifelong \ndisabilities and causing untold grief for many families.\n  Too many families have experienced the pain of Shaken Baby Syndrome. \nA 2003 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nestimates\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\nthat, in the U.S., an average of 300 children will die each year, and \n600 to 1,200 more will be injured, of whom two-thirds will be babies or \ninfants under 1 year in age, as a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome. \nMedical professionals believe that thousands more cases of Shaken Baby \nSyndrome are being misdiagnosed or not detected.\n  Families should be spared the needless tragedy of Shaken Baby \nSyndrome. Prevention is the most effective solution to ending Shaken \nBaby Syndrome. It is clear that the minimal costs of educational and \nprevention programs may help to protect our young children. Families as \nwell as professionals who care for children must be made aware of the \ninjuries that shaking can cause. In 1995, the U.S. Advisory Board on \nChild Abuse and Neglect recommended a universal approach to the \nprevention of child fatalities that included services such as home \nvisitation by trained professionals or paraprofessionals, hospital-\nlinked outreach to parents of infants and toddlers, community-based \nprograms designed for the specific needs of neighborhoods, and \neffective public education campaigns.\n  Prevention programs have demonstrated that educating new parents \nabout the danger of shaking young children and how they can help \nprotect their child from injury can bring about a significant reduction \nin the number of cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome. In 1998, Dr. Mark Dias \nstarted the Upstate New York SBS Prevention Project at Children's \nHospital of Buffalo, which uses a simple video to educate new parents \nbefore they leave the hospital. Since that time, the number of shaken \nbaby incidents in the Buffalo area has dropped by nearly 50%; none of \nthe perpetrators have been identified as participants in the hospital \neducation program. Hospitals around the country, including several in \nmy own State of Connecticut, have adopted programs similar to these to \neducate new parents about the dangers of shaking young children.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution designating the third week \nof April of 2006 as National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week, and \nto take part in the many local and national activities and events \nrecognizing the month of April as National Child Abuse Prevention \nMonth.\n  The prevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome is supported by advocacy \ngroups across the U.S. that were formed by parents and relatives of \nchildren who have been killed or injured by shaking. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a list of groups supporting this resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Groups Supporting National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week\n\n       The National Shaken Baby Coalition, The National Center on \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome, The Children's Defense Fund, The \n     American Academy of Pediatrics, The Child Welfare League of \n     America, Prevent Child Abuse America, The National Child \n     Abuse Coalition, The National Exchange Club Foundation, The \n     American Humane Association, The American Professional \n     Society on the Abuse of Children, The Arc of the United \n     States, The Association of University Centers on \n     Disabilities, Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, Family \n     Partnership, Family Voices, National Alliance of Children's \n     Trust and Prevention Funds, United Cerebral Palsy, The \n     National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related \n     Institutions, Never Shake a Baby Arizona/Prevent Child Abuse \n     Arizona, The Center for Child Protection and Family Support.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 439) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 439\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated ``National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month'' as an annual tradition that \n     was initiated in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the most recent National Child Abuse and Neglect \n     Data System figures reveal that almost 900,000 children were \n     victims of abuse and neglect in the United States in 2002, \n     causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our most vulnerable \n     citizens;\n       Whereas among the children who are victims of abuse and \n     neglect, nearly 4 children die in the United States each day;\n       Whereas children aged 1 year or younger accounted for 41.2 \n     percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2002, \n     and children aged 4 years or younger accounted for 76.1 \n     percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2002;\n       Whereas abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as \n     ``Shaken Baby Syndrome'', is recognized as the leading cause \n     of death of physically abused children;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas a 2003 report in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association estimated that, in the United States, an \n     average of 300 children will die each year, and 600 to 1,200 \n     more will be injured, of whom \\2/3\\ will be babies or infants \n     under 1 year in age, as a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome, \n     with many cases resulting in severe and permanent \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas medical professionals believe that thousands of \n     additional cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome are being \n     misdiagnosed or are not detected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent, \n     irreparable brain damage or death to an infant and may result \n     in more than $1,000,000 in medical costs to care for a \n     single, disabled child in just the first few years of life;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent the abuse, and it is clear that the \n     minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     prevent enormous medical and disability costs and \n     immeasurable amounts of grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how they can help protect their child from \n     injury can bring about a significant reduction in the number \n     of cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs have been shown to raise \n     awareness and provide critically important information about \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome to parents, caregivers, daycare workers, \n     child protection employees, law enforcement personnel, health \n     care professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas efforts to prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome are \n     supported by advocacy groups across the United States that \n     were formed by parents and relatives of children who have \n     been killed or injured by shaking, including the National \n     Shaken Baby Coalition, the Shaken Baby Association, the \n     Shaking Kills: Instead Parents Please Educate and Remember \n     Initiative (commonly known as the ``SKIPPER Initiative''), \n     the Shaken Baby Alliance, Shaken Baby Prevention, Inc., A \n     Voice for Gabbi, Don't Shake Jake, and the Kierra Harrison \n     Foundation, whose mission is to educate the general public \n     and professionals about Shaken Baby Syndrome and to increase \n     support for victims and the families of the victims in the \n     health care and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas child abuse prevention programs and ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' are supported by the \n     National Shaken Baby Coalition, the National Center on Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome, the Children's Defense Fund, the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics, the Child Welfare League of America, \n     Prevent Child Abuse America, the National Child Abuse

Center for Child Protection and Family Support, \n     and many other organizations;\n       Whereas a 2000 survey by Prevent Child Abuse America shows \n     that approximately half of all citizens of the United States \n     believe that, of all the public health issues facing the \n     United States, child abuse and neglect is the most important \n     issue;\n       Whereas Congress previously designated the third week of \n     April 2001 as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week \n     2001''; and\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the third week of April 2006 as ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs be discharged from further consideration of \nH.R. 3351 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3351) to make technical corrections to laws \n     relating to Native Americans, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, H.R. 3351, the Native American Technical \nCorrections Act of 2005, was passed by the House on November 16, 2005, \nand referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs. Many of the provisions \nin the House bill have already been acted on by the Senate in various \nbills. I will ask the Senate to pass the bill with a substitute \namendment which includes most of the provisions in the original House \nversion of the bill as well as some amendments that were not in the \nHouse version. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Dorgan as an \noriginal cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The Senate amendment to H.R. 3551 that I am offering contains the \nfollowing: Section 104 is the same as S. 1484, which passed the Senate \non July 26, 2005, and it amends the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Indian \nTribes Water Rights Settlement Act of 1990 to adjust the spending rule \nset forth in that act for the Tribe's Settlement Fund. The provision \nwould authorize expenditure of 6 percent of the average market value of \nthe Settlement fund over the preceding 3 years. Section 201 is the same \nas S. 706, which passed the Senate on July 26, 2005, and it authorizes \nthe transfer of lands, now held by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to \nthe Department of the Interior to be held in trust for the benefit of \nthe Prairie Island Indian community in Red Wing, MN. The transfer will \nhave no effect on the tax status of the lands, nor will the Prairie \nIsland Indian Community be permitted to develop commercial or gaming \nfacilities on the land; section 202 authorizes various 99-year leases. \nPart of this section passed Senate in S. 1485 on July 26, 2005, while \nother provisions were contained in H.R. 3351. Section 203 addresses the \nproblem of lack of appraisers in Indian country by providing that for \npurposes of obtaining agricultural loans, the market value of land is \nthe default appraisal value. This section is the same as S. 1489, that \npassed the Senate on July 26, 2005. Section 301 previously passed the \nSenate in S. 1295 on December 12, 2005, and it authorizes the National \nIndian Gaming Commission to collect fees up to 0.08 percent of gross \ngaming revenues, and eliminates $12 million cap, and subjects NIGC to \nthe Government Performance and Results Act. Section 401, like S. 1758, \nthat passed the Senate on August 22, 2005, amends the Indian Financing \nAct of 1974 to clarify that nonprofit tribal entities are eligible for \nBureau of Indian Affairs Loan Guaranty Program. In addition, because \nthe BIA is fast reaching its $500 million limit on the amount of loans \nit can have outstanding, and this section will increase that number to \n$1.5 billion.\n  The four new provisions that have not passed the Senate as stand-\nalone measures do the following: Section 101 corrects a drafting error \nto the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; section 102 facilitates \nexchanges between Alaska Regional and Village Corporations of land \nobtained through the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act by clarifying \nthat undeveloped land received by each Native corporation participant \nin the exchanges is deemed to be land conveyed under ANCSA; and section \n103 will allow the State of Mississippi to pay the Mississippi Choctaw \nfor work already preformed, through a newly established BIA Trust Fund. \nThe final new provision is section 501, the Native American Probate \nReform and Technical Amendment, described in more detail below.\n  Section 501 corrects drafting errors and clarifies and includes new \nprovisions relating to amendments made by the American Indian Probate \nReform Act of 2004, AIPRA, and S. 1481, which was enacted into law in \nDecember of 2005. One of these provisions is an amendment to 25 U.S.C. \n464. In 2004, this section was amended in AIPRA so that it would \nconform to the new uniform Indian probate code that was the centerpiece \nof AIPRA; however, after reviewing the various amendments that were \nmade by AIPRA, which was a very complex piece of legislation, we \nconcluded that the AIPRA amendments to 25 U.S.C. 464 was drafted in a \nway that its execution was unclear. So in the 109th Congress, we \nattempted to correct this in S. 1481--P.L. 109-157, enacted on December \n30, 2005, by restating section 464 as it should have read. \nUnfortunately, there were drafting errors in S. 1481 that were not \npicked up prior to its enactment. Accordingly, my substitute amendment \nincludes a new restatement of section 464 correcting these drafting \nerrors and conforming the statute to the new uniform Indian probate \ncode enacted as part of AIPRA. I would like to make the point here that \nthe purpose of the amendments restating section 464, both in S. 1481 \nand in the current substitute amendment to H.R. 3351, were and are \nintended to do nothing more than to conform the provisions in that \nsection relating to the devise and inheritance of lands to the new \nuniform probate code contained in the American Indian Probate Reform \nAct of 2004. As the author of both S. 1481 and the substitute \namendment, I want to make it clear\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\nthat neither measure intends to affect any of the other sorts of \ntransactions that might otherwise be subject to section 464 or to \naffect in any way the application of any other Federal laws that might \napply to lands that are covered by section 464.\n  We are also making clarifying amendments to AIPRA relating to the \neffective date of its amendments and to its amendments to the \n``Applicable Federal Law'' provisions of section 207(g) of the Indian \nLand Consolidation Act. With respect to the former, the substitute \nincludes technical amendments to the effective date section of AIPRA, \nsection 8(b) of AIPRA, to make it clear that the amendments that were \nmade to 25 U.S.C. 464 and 25 U.S.C. 348 are intended to take effect 1 \nyear after the date on which the Secretary of Interior certified that \nnotice of the AIPRA amendments had been given to Indian country in \naccordance with AIPRA section 8(a), and that sections 348 and 464, as \nthey read immediately prior to the passage of AIPRA, would continue to \napply until the effective date of the new amendments.\n  Finally, the substitute also makes some minor changes to the wording \nof section 207(g) of ILCA just to further clarify congressional intent \nthat nothing in ILCA supercedes or affects the application of special \nlaws that relate to specific Indian tribes or the allotted lands of \nspecific tribes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3587) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 3351), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/07/senate-section/article/S3403-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PROVIDING FOR ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 366 which was \nreceived from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 366) to congratulate \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on the 21st \n     anniversary of the first flight of the space transportation \n     system.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, there have been times that we, as a \nnation, have become so accustomed to successful space shuttle launches \nthat we barely heard about them on the evening news. One hundred and \nfourteen successful missions have provided a wealth of information and \nresearch results that are seen and felt in our everyday lives. Yet few \nof us could identify these as having resulted from Space Shuttle \nresearch.\n  Today, the Space Shuttle is viewed by many as an over-aged relic of \nthe past and the vehicle whose two failures in the past 24 years of its \nservice cost the lives of 14 brave astronauts. As tragic and \nunforgettable as the Challenger and Columbia accidents were, we must \nhonor the memory of their crews by honoring the task for which they \ngave their lives. I am proud that our Nation has chosen to learn \neverything possible from those tragic losses to minimize the risks that \nwill always be present in human space flight and to move forward to \nkeep the dream of spaceflight alive.\n  It is appropriate today, as we consider House Concurrent Resolution \n366, to reach back to the very beginning of space shuttle nights to the \nday, 25 years ago next week--April 12, 1981, at 7 a.m. eastern time. On \nthat morning, the space shuttle Columbia lifted off on her maiden \nvoyage, carrying two brave and intrepid explorers, Commander John Young \nand Pilot Robert Crippen. They orbited the Earth 36 times in two days, \nsix hours and twenty minutes, landing in California at Edwards Air \nForce Base on April 14, 1981, at 1:20 p.m. eastern time. This first \nmission of a reusable spacecraft marked the beginning of a new era in \nhuman spaceflight.\n  This era also provided the Nation and the world with new and \nincredible views of our Earth as seen from orbit. It also provided a \ncontinuous stream of important microgravity research that has found its \nway into medical devices, treatment procedures, computer enhancements, \ncommunications technologies, and a host of other practical applications \nthat generally go unnoticed. The Great Telescopes, such as Hubble, \nChandra and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, were all made possible \nby the Space Shuttle. In the case of the Hubble, its inestimable value \nas a research tool was both rescued by the Space Shuttle and extended \nby servicing missions not possible without the Space Shuttle.\n  In the next several years, as the Space Shuttle completes the mission \nfor which it was designed--completing the assembly and outfitting of \nthe International Space Station--we will move into a new era of human \nspaceflight. We will experience new firsts and enter new names into the \nhistory books of those who accomplish the important milestones along \nour way to the Moon, Mars and beyond.\n  None of that would be possible, however, without the service of those \nwho have gone before, and especially those two heroes we honor and \nrecognize today. These two men took a vehicle never flown before on a \njourney of over a million miles. By any standard, that is an impressive \nfirst step.\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, 25 years ago, on April 12, \n1981, the Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from the Kennedy Space \nCenter in Florida. It marked the beginning of a historic two day \nmission, and more importantly, it was the first of many future shuttle \nmissions. I am pleased to support passage of H. Con. Res. 366, \ncommemorating this important anniversary.\n  I applaud the tremendous bravery of the STS-1 crew--Commander John W. \nYoung and Pilot Robert L. Crippen--on accomplishing the mission safely \nand successfully. This anniversary is a testament to the thousands of \npeople who worked to bring the Space Shuttle Program to life and to \nthose who have sustained it throughout the years.\n  The Space Shuttle Program brought our Nation commercial and \ngovernment satellite deliveries, in-orbit satellite repairs, delivery \nof large science observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope, \nSpace Lab science missions, historic dockings with the Russian Mir \nSpace Station and assembly of the International Space Station.\n  Since the STS-1 launch in 1981, this Nation has launched more than \n100 flights. Sadly, the Challenger and Columbia were lost in 1986 and \n2003, respectively. What we learned about safety in spaceflight, \nbrought by the sacrifices of the Challenger and Columbia crews, has \nmade our space program stronger.\n  Today the great challenge facing our space program is one of \ntransition. We must complete the construction of the station and retire \nthe shuttle fleet with dignity. And equally important, we must work \ntogether to preserve the workforce that will soon become the backbone \nof the new Crew Exploration Vehicle and the next human space project.\n  With the 25th anniversary of STS-1, let us all rededicate ourselves \nto the unfinished mission of exploration and discovery. Let us pledge \nto complete the journey that Commander Young and Pilot Crippen began by \nreturning safely to flight with STS-121 later this summer, and move \nforward in leading the world in space exploration.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
