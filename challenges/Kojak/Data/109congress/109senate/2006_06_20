Mr. President, today we open the Senate with a 30-minute \nperiod of morning business. After those statements, we will resume \nconsideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. There \nare now six pending amendments that the chairman and ranking member are \nreviewing to determine how much debate will be necessary. Yesterday, \nSenator Levin filed an amendment related to troop withdrawal in Iraq. I \nunderstand that amendment may be offered today. I know many Senators \nwill want to participate in that debate. It is my expectation that we \nwill set up blocks of time for debate, perhaps for this afternoon, so \nthat Senators will know of the appropriate time to come to the floor to \ngive their remarks on the amendment. In addition to the pending \namendments, other amendments will be offered today. Therefore, we will \nbe voting today on amendments to the Defense authorization bill. The \nDemocratic side of the aisle will have their normal policy meeting \ntoday, and we will recess from 12:30 to 2:15. As a reminder to my \ncolleagues, we have scheduled our Republican policy meeting to occur \nduring Wednesday's session instead of today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6099-7", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6099-S6100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to comment on \nthe debate that has been underway on the Defense authorization bill. In \nparticular, I want to draw attention to the heroism, courage, and great \nwork of our soldiers on the frontline. Every day they are risking their \nlives to defend our freedom. They are taking that battle to the enemy \nso that the enemy does not bring that battle to us on our own soil.\n  No one would have guessed almost 5 years ago that we would be free \nfrom having suffered another major terrorist attack. We have been \nextraordinarily fortunate. We remember 1993, the World Trade Center \nattack, Khobar Towers, our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, the USS \nCole, and then that day on 9/11. We have been safe because of our brave \nmen and women, Americans who are putting their lives on the line to \nprotect this country. Then there was that day on 9/11 where our enemy \ndeclared war. They slaughtered innocent citizens right here on American \nsoil. They judged us to be weak, to be vacillating. They believed we \nwould cower in the face of brutality. They were wrong.\n  Out of the black smoke and ashes of that terrible day, America stood \nup strong, united, and determined. And after careful deliberation, we \nanswered back. We toppled the Taliban in Afghanistan, where al-Qaida \nhad trained. We toppled Saddam Hussein, a real and continuing threat to \nthe security of our Nation and to our allies. Since then we have \ncontinued the hard work of draining the swamp that nurtured and \nfestered these monsters. It hasn't been easy. The last 3 years have \nstrained our patience as we have watched the terrorists' counterattack. \nInnocent Iraqis, coalition forces, humanitarians, and journalists have \nbeen targeted simply for trying to secure a free and open Iraq. But the \nenemy's effort to plunge Iraq into chaos will not succeed.\n\n  Slowly, freedom is gaining ground. The Iraqi people are emerging from \nthree decades of brutal repression and claiming their right to stand \namong democratic nations. Last year, millions of Iraqis defied the \nthreats of Abu al-Zarqawi and streamed to the polls in three national \nelections. Iraq's Sunni population participated in greater numbers each \ntime. On June 8, the new democratically elected Prime Minister Jawad \nal-Maliki named the last three members of his Cabinet--the Ministers of \nDefense, Interior and Security--thereby completing formation of his \nunity government. What huge progress. The new government is committed \nto facing the challenges of terrorism and corruption and to move Iraq's \nfledgling\n\n[[Page S6100]]\n\ndemocracy forward on the path to freedom. I believe they will succeed \nas long as we do not break faith with them.\n  It was a week ago the Iraqis formally asked the United Nations \nSecurity Council to maintain the U.S.-led coalition with these words:\n\n       While great achievements have been gained by the people of \n     Iraq in the realm of political development, the continuation \n     of the mandate of the multinational force in Iraq remains \n     necessary and essential for our security.\n\n  Far from the rhetoric that is being used by some today, the Iraqi \npeople want us, and they need us to help them. If we don't, if we break \nour promise and cut and run, as some would have us do, the implications \ncould be catastrophic. Not only would it be a dishonor to our \nAmericans, a dishonor of historic proportions, the threat to America's \nnational security would be potentially disastrous. If large parts of \nIraq were to fall into the hands of terrorists, there would be no end \nto the threats we might face. Iraq could become a terrorist base for \nattacking us and undermining our allies. Many of Saddam Hussein's \nweapons scientists are still in Iraq, and the destruction of 9/11 would \npale in comparison to the devastation terrorists could inflict with \nweapons of mass destruction produced in Iraq using their experience.\n  Leaving Iraq to the terrorists is simply not an option. Surrendering \nis not a solution. Zarqawi's elimination on June 7 was a profound \nvictory. Coalition forces have captured or killed 161 of Zarqawi's \nleaders, key elements in the command and control of the terrorist \nnetwork. Iraqi troops and the Iraqi people are working ever more \ndiligently to defeat the terrorist enemy. In July of 2004, there were \nno operational Iraqi Army division or brigade headquarters. In just 2 \nyears, 2 divisions, 14 brigades, and 57 battalions control their own \narea of responsibility. That is progress. Also, 28 authorized national \npolice units are in the fight with 10 battalions in the lead. Over \n254,000 trained and equipped Iraqi security forces are taking the \nbattle to the enemy. These are just a few of the positive indicators. \nWith our help, Iraq is making steady and impressive progress every day.\n  America has faced great challenges before. We rose up to defeat \nNaziism, one of the ugliest ideologies in modern history. It took \nterrible sacrifice and great pain, but we defeated the Nazi scourge. \nThrough the Marshall plan, we rebuilt a continent of democratic and \nindependent states. For the next four decades, we battled the Cold War \nagainst Communism, a long battle we ultimately won. In the great wars \nof the 20th century, our ideals carried us through even when victory \nseemed far from assured. Young American men and women who had never \nseen the world came to be its bravest defenders.\n  As we continue the war on terror, we cannot retreat, we cannot \nsurrender, we cannot go wobbly. The price is far too high. The strength \nwe show now is the security we earn for the future. As the President \nhas explained, America's troops will stand down as the Iraqi troops \nstand up. They are gaining strength every day. By keeping a steady eye \non the ultimate goal, by having flexibility and patience, I am \nconfident we will succeed. No less than America's security depends on \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6100-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it goes without saying there are a number of \nissues upon which Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans will never \nagree. We have our differences about whether there is global warming, \nabout the staggering deficits we have, lack of health care, economic \npolicy generally. I understand and respect the differences we have on \nthose issues. If there were ever an issue where we should be able to \nfind common ground, it is supporting the troops we have around the \nworld. I use the word ``should'' because of what is now happening in \nthe Senate.\n  As I speak, there is an amendment pending before this body. It is an \namendment that says the Iraqi Government should not proceed with their \nplan to grant amnesty to terrorists who kill American troops. It is a \nvery simple amendment with a message the American people, I know, agree \nwith. So why is it that Republicans who control this body have \nfilibustered this amendment? It has been going on for days now. I \nreally have trouble figuring that out. Their excuses don't make sense.\n  Their first excuse is that aides to the Prime Minister were \nmisquoted, but we don't have any evidence of that. In fact, it is quite \nthe contrary. The aide who first stated this stands by his story. They \nhave asked him to step down, and he no longer has his position. But he \nwas quoted, after having stepped down, as saying:\n\n       The prime minister himself has said that he is ready to \n     give amnesty to the so-called resistance, provided they have \n     not been involved in killing Iraqis.\n\n  That was the end of the quote. Of course, what it doesn't say, \naccording to everything that they have said, is that it is OK to kill \nAmericans but not Iraqis. We now have news accounts--not confirmed by \nthe Pentagon, at least to me--that Kristian Menchaca, 23 years old, \nmember of the U.S. Army, and Thomas Tucker, age 25, U.S. Army, who were \nabducted, taken as prisoners of war, have been killed. Try telling \ntheir families that it is OK to give amnesty to the so-called \nresistance provided they have not been involved in killing Iraqis, only \nAmericans. The families of Tucker and Menchaca would be very \ndispleased.\n  Over the weekend we received even more evidence that the Iraqi \nGovernment favors amnesty for those who shed American blood. From \nSunday's Los Angeles Times: The amnesty plan would apparently include \ninsurgents alleged to have staged attacks against Americans.\n  They are saying amnesty. So it is clear that the situation regarding \namnesty, the amendment pending before this body, is one where the \nIraqis who serve in their Government are saying that it is OK if the \ninsurgents kill Americans and not OK if they kill Iraqis. The only \nthing that is clear is the Senate needs to go on record and direct \nPresident Bush to tell the Iraqi Government that that plan is \nunacceptable. That is what the amendment does.\n  There are other excuses offered by the majority. Some have argued \nthat if indeed this amnesty plan is real, we should just accept it as \nwe did amnesty plans following World War II and Vietnam. Of course, we \nknow that there were war trials in World War II. World War II went on \nfor 3 years plus. This war has been going on for 3 years plus. World \nWar II was fought all over the world, Southeast Asia, all over Europe, \nAfrica, all of the islands between Hawaii and Japan. The war in Iraq \nhas been fought in a relatively small area and has been going on almost \nas long as World War II. So I believe the argument that we should \naccept their amnesty plan doesn't set well with me or with the American \npeople.\n\n  The majority of Americans killed in Iraq have not been killed in \ntraditional acts of war. This war is different from others. They have \nbeen killed in acts of war, even though they have been so-called \nnontraditional acts of war. They were killed in acts of terror, which \nis part of this war. Anybody who believes in freedom and what our \ntroops are dying for in Iraq should believe their killers should be \nbrought to justice if possible. I believe the excuses on the majority \nside are designed by Republicans to hide the truth.\n  The filibuster of the anti-amnesty amendment is just another example \nof cutting and running. We hear this all the time. If there were ever \nan example of cutting and running, it is not to allow a vote on a \nsimple amendment that says we should not condone the Iraqis granting \namnesty to Iraqis who have killed Americans.\n  I believe this cutting and running, which is thrown around here so \ngratuitously by the majority, could apply to what happened last year on \nthe Defense authorization bill. It took months. The bill was reported \nout of committee, I think sometime in late April. We didn't get to the \nbill for months after that. Why? We had it on the floor once, but it \nwas pulled because of gun liability legislation, which some believed \nwas more important than the bill directing\n\n[[Page S6101]]\n\nhow we are going to handle the policy of our armed services.\n  Today, instead of pulling this bill for gun liability or some other \nextraneous issue, they are doing it with filibustering. They have more \nvotes than we have. They control what happens on the floor most of the \ntime, and they are not letting us vote on this amendment. The majority \ndoesn't want to embarrass the White House, so they are content to sit \non their hands and have the Iraqi Government over there talking about \ngranting amnesty to those who kill Americans.\n  The President said he looked Prime Minister al-Maliki in the eye and \nsaid he is OK, ``I looked him in the eye.'' Well, I hope he saw in that \neye the fact that this man was willing to grant amnesty to Iraqis who \nkilled Americans. It is not an eye that I think the American people \nthink is appropriate--amnesty for the killers of American troops. But \nit appears that the majority is willing to do this even if it \njeopardizes our soldiers serving in Iraq by giving terrorists who want \nto attack them a get-out-of-jail-free card.\n  We can do a lot better than that. Let's put the excuses aside and do \nthe right thing before another day passes. Let's join together and pass \nthis amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6101-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later this week, we are going to debate \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill. It is a very important \nbill. It also is one of the few times during the course of the year \nwhere we actually have a chance to offer amendments on very important \nissues. Most bills that come to the floor are fairly restrictive in \nterms of the procedures of the Senate. They limit what you can say and \nwhat you can address and the amendments that can be offered.\n  On this authorization bill, in the words of the Senate, precloture \nyou can offer quite a few different amendments, and many will address \nissues that don't relate directly to the Department of Defense. There \nis one Senator Kennedy will bring to the floor this week that he has \nbeen offering repeatedly and one that we should take up very quickly; \nthat is, the question of the minimum wage in America today.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment would raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an \nhour in three steps over a period of several years--$5.85 shortly after \nenactment, $6.55 a year later, and then $7.25 a year after that. \nIncreasing the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour would benefit 6\\1/2\\ \nmillion Americans, 60 percent of whom are women. These are people by \nand large who are in very low-paying jobs and are trying to raise \nchildren, trying to make ends meet under extremely difficult \ncircumstances.\n\n  The current minimum wage was enacted in 1997 at $5.15 an hour, which \nis barely $10,000 a year in gross wages, total wages. I cannot imagine \na family struggling to survive that could make it on $10,000 a year. As \na result, many people are forced to work more than one job in minimum \nwage. Many are forced to turn to pantries and soup kitchens to \nsupplement the income for their families. Imagine, if you will, the \nstress most Americans feel working 40 hours a week, trying to keep up \nwith their kids and trying to spend a little time with them, enjoying \nlife with them on weekends, and then make that 40-hour week a 60-hour \nweek and figure out how it would be, particularly if you are a single \nparent doing your level best to raise a good child.\n  As this Congress has ignored the minimum wage for 9 years, we have \nsaid to these struggling families and parents: We are going to make the \nburden more difficult for you. Even though you get up every morning and \ngo to work, which we applaud, we are not going to reward you for that. \nWe are going to make it more difficult for you to keep your family \ntogether.\n  Since Congress last increased the minimum wage in 1997 to $5.15 an \nhour, the real value of that wage has gone down 20 percent, which \nbasically means the cost of living keeps going up while the minimum \nwage has been stuck at $5.15. Minimum wage workers have already lost \nall of the gains that were enacted in 1996 and 1997, when we last \nraised the minimum wage. It is amazing to me that the minimum wage has \nbecome a partisan football in the Congress. There was a time when \nRepublican Presidents would waste no time increasing the minimum wage, \nand Republican Congresses would follow suit, understanding that this is \nvery basic to the question of economic justice in America; that if the \npoorest among us don't receive enough money for going to work, it \ncauses extreme hardship on them.\n  The minimum wage, once created by President Roosevelt, has been each \nyear, through each administration, extended. Now for 9 years we have \ndone nothing, leaving the minimum wage workers in very difficult \ncircumstances. If we pass Senator Kennedy's amendment--and I hope we \ndo--to raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour, it will mean $4,400 \nmore a year for these families. That is significant. When you look at \nthe average low-income family, they would be able to buy 15 months' \nworth of groceries; pay 19 months of utility bills, which have gone up \ndramatically since we last raised the minimum wage; pay 8 months of \nrent; over 2 years of health care for the basic low-income family; 20 \nmonths of childcare; 30 months of college tuition at a public 2-year \ncollege.\n  Think about that difference. A low-income mother, a single mother, \nraising children now might be able to afford good daycare for her \nchildren so she has peace of mind when she goes to work, knowing the \nkids are in safe hands. I have visited with families, and if they are \nnot lucky enough to have a mother or a grandmother who will step in, \nsome try to find a neighbor who will, and that is not always the best \ncare. That has to be a source of great concern to every parent facing \nthat possibility.\n  I believe there is a direct correlation between the failure to raise \nthe minimum wage and a dramatic increase in the number of Americans \nliving in poverty.\n  We used to talk about this issue. This used to be an issue which was \ndebated on the floor of the Congress, about how many people were poor \nin America. We believed--and still do--that this great land of \nopportunity should offer opportunity to the poorest among us. Yet what \nwe have seen is that the number of poor people has been growing \ndramatically over the last several years, while those who are well off \nare even better off. So the poor are truly poorer, and the rich are \ngetting richer.\n  If you look at America as a system of laws that reflect an American \nfamily, how can we afford to leave people behind? I don't think we can. \nThirty-seven million Americans currently live in poverty. That is more \nthan 10 percent of America. Thirteen million of those are children. \nAmong full-time, year-round workers, poverty has increased by 50 \npercent since the late 1970s. There was a time when we cared about \nthose numbers. There was a time when President Reagan suggested \nchanging the Tax Code to put in an earned-income tax credit to give the \npoorest families a helping hand. Of course, we created programs such as \nfood stamps, WIC, and other programs for those low-income categories. \nThere was a time when both political parties cared about the issue of \npoverty. Today, we don't discuss it. I don't know why. I believe we \nshould.\n  Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earn \n$10,700 a year. That is $6,000 below the\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\nFederal poverty guideline of $16,600 for a family of three. We should \nbe ashamed of our Nation that we have reached this point where we \nignore what we are doing to people because of this minimum wage.\n  Let me add that I salute our Governor in Illinois who, through the \nState legislation, increased Illinois' minimum wage so that we pay more \nto workers. But clearly we need to do this across the Nation and not \nleave it to the leadership of Governors. We should show leadership in \nCongress.\n  Raising the minimum wage is going to help the economy, too. A lot of \npeople argue otherwise. Whether it be raising the Federal or State \nminimum wage, history shows that it doesn't have a negative impact on \nthe economy. That is the argument which has been used against the \nminimum wage since Roosevelt first created it; that if you raise the \nminimum wage to $1 an hour--or whatever it happened to be in the \nearliest days of the history of this legislation--somehow jobs would be \neliminated because people would say that rather than pay a dollar an \nhour, they will hire fewer employees. That is always the argument, and \nthat argument fails every time when we look at the impact of an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  In the 4 years after the last Federal minimum wage increase passed in \nCongress, the economy experienced its strongest growth in over 30 \nyears. Nearly 12 million new jobs were added in the late 1990s--almost \na quarter of a million a month. So as we raised the minimum wage, the \nnumber of jobs didn't shrink, it dramatically increased--exactly the \nopposite of what the critics of increasing the minimum wage have argued \nfor 60 years or more.\n  The last raise in the minimum wage did not have a negative impact on \nmy State's economy when the State of Illinois sought a minimum wage \nincrease. The fact is, in the 4 years after Congress passed the last \nFederal increase, Illinois experienced great economic growth. Over \n350,000 new jobs were added to the State's economy. Even the retail \nindustry, which is often cited as the industry most sensitive to the \nminimum wage, saw over 44,000 new jobs created in Illinois 4 years \nafter the increase in the Federal minimum wage.\n  Research shows that other States experienced similar impacts.\n  A study by the Fiscal Policy Institute of 10 States that raised the \nminimum wage above the Federal rate found that both total employment \nand employment in the retail sector grew more rapidly in higher minimum \nwage States.\n  And for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees, the number of \nbusinesses, employment, and the size of the total payroll grew faster \nin higher minimum wage States than in States where the lower minimum \nwage prevailed, exactly the opposite of what critics say if you raise \nthe minimum wage: you are going to hurt the retail sector; they are \ngoing to have to shut down their businesses. Exactly the opposite has \nhappened time and again.\n  The minimum wage needs to be updated. In contrast to the first 4 \nyears after the Federal minimum wage took effect and created jobs, in \nthe last 4 years under the Bush administration the minimum wage has \nheld steady while its real value has steadily declined, and only 4.7 \nmillion jobs have been created.\n  It is one thing for politicians to give lofty speeches about values \nand family values. It is another thing to look at the rollcall on the \nminimum wage and ask those same Members who are pontificating about the \nguidance--the divine guidance--that brings them to this Chamber and \nthen systematically voting against the poorest among us. That, to me, \nis a shame and something we should remedy by adopting the Kennedy \namendment.\n  We force a lot of hard-working Americans and their families to work \nlonger hours, work harder to pay for the necessities. That is time away \nfrom their children, time away from just a little relaxation so they \ncan put their lives together and face another hard week of work.\n  In Illinois, a worker earning the minimum wage has to work 95 hours a \nweek to afford a two-bedroom apartment. Mr. President, 11.9 percent of \nIllinois residents live in poverty, and an unacceptably low minimum \nwage is part of the problem.\n  Over 20 States, including Illinois, have taken upon themselves to \nraise the minimum wage and give an economic boost to their citizens. \nAfter the State of Illinois raised the minimum wage in January of 2005 \nto $6.50, Illinois nonfarm employment increased by 79,800 jobs. It \ndidn't go down in Illinois after the minimum wage went up. It \nincreased.\n  Since the State raised the minimum wage, Illinois has ranked No. 1 \namong all Midwest States in the total number of new jobs.\n  Illinois employers have created 30,000 new jobs in the traditionally \nlower paying, higher proportion minimum wage industry sectors of \nleisure, hospitality, and trade.\n  The minimum wage amendment we are debating today would give a raise \nto 333,000 workers in Illinois.\n  It has been more than 9 years since the minimum wage workers last saw \nan increase in their wages. It is a delicate subject and one that \nMembers of Congress do not want to discuss, but I think we have to be \nvery honest about it. While we have consistently, year after year, \ndenied an increase in the minimum wage to the poorest, hardest working \nAmericans, we have every year without fail increased congressional pay. \nOur salaries have gone up while we have ignored the plight of the \npoorest among us.\n  During the 9 years that Congress has raised its own pay by $31,600, \nwe have not increased the minimum wage for the poorest workers in \nAmerica. It isn't fair.\n  How can we continue to turn a blind eye to these people who get up \nand work hard every day? Who are they? They are the people who took the \ndishes off your table at the restaurant this morning. They are the ones \nwho made the bed at the hotel after you left. They are the ones who are \nwatching your kids at the day-care center. They are the same ones who \nare watching your parents at the nursing home. They are the ones who \nare making sure your golf course is perfect when you go out to play \ngolf. And they are the ones who get up every single day and do these \nhard jobs for very little pay.\n  Why in the world are we sitting here ignoring the obvious? If you \nvalue families and you value workers, you should value work. To hold \nthe minimum wage at $5.15 an hour for 9 years is shameful, and it \nshould change.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment that is going to be \noffered by Senator Kennedy. I am happy to be a cosponsor of that \namendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the Democratic side in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint).

Mr. President, later this week as part of the debate on \nthe Defense authorization bill, we will talk about Iraq. That a timely \nissue. As of last week, there have been 2,500 soldiers' lives lost in \nIraq since the beginning of this conflict. What was promised to the \nAmerican people to be a rather uncomplicated effort by America to rid \nIraq of a dictator has turned out to be a war that has gone on for 3 \nyears with no end in sight.\n  This week the Senate will have a chance to say to the Iraqi people \nthat as of the middle of next year, this becomes your responsibility. \nWe will give you 12 months and more American lives and more American \ndollars and then, Iraq, you have to stand up and defend yourself. If \nyou believe in the future of your Nation, it has to go beyond an \nelection, go beyond political debate. It has to reach the point where \nIraqi citizens are prepared to stand, defend, and die, if necessary, \nfor their own country.\n  There are 130,000 American lives on the line today and every day. We \nhave to serve notice on the Iraqis that their future has to be in their \nhands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 7 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6102-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6102-S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I heard the distinguished deputy minority\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\nleader speak last Friday morning in about a 15-minute speech, and he \njust added another minute, about Iraq. So I come to the floor to \naddress the specific points the distinguished Senator just raised and \nthe potential amendments that will be offered on the floor.\n  I want to tell you about the flashback that went through my mind as I \nsat in that chair and listened to that speech. The flashback was to my \ngeneration's war in the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam. The flashback was \nto what I remember started in 1970 and culminated in 1972.\n  I commend my staff, in particular Andrew Billing, for spending the \nweekend accumulating the speeches on the floor of the Senate from \nAugust of 1970 to May of 1972, speeches by Cranston and McGovern and \nKennedy and Byrd and Humphrey. They talked about it was time for us to \nstart withdrawing, first not on a time certain, but by just a certain \nnumber of troops, until the crescendo built so loud over 18 months it \nbecame a date certain, August 31, 1972.\n  The debate on the Senate floor drove the policy of the United States \nof America against communism and in defense of freedom, and all of us \nremember what happened. The first steps were it wasn't a date certain, \nit was 120,000 troops, and we went from a half million to 380,000 and \nthen to 240,000, and then when we got to 240,000, the resolution \nbecame: Withdraw by August 31, 1972.\n  Anyone who was alive on that date who remembers that scene remembers \nprecisely what happened: the last of the Americans to leave Saigon on \nthe roof of our Nation's embassy being shot at by the Vietcong as they \nwere climbing a rope ladder into a Huey helicopter.\n  We lost over 50,000 American lives in Vietnam and a lot of them \nbetween the beginning of that debate to withdraw in August of 1970 \nuntil the end of it in August of 1972.\n  I know there is a proposed amendment, probably by the Senator from \nMichigan, that will begin the same way the amendments began over 30 \nyears ago on this Senate floor: not a date certain, but a scaling down \nof our commitment. And to that I want to address the damage that will \ndo to our effort.\n  First and foremost, it hands a victory to our enemy they cannot win \non the battlefield. The terrorists have said it is to psychologically \ndestroy the will of America that they want to win the battle. They know \nthey can't win it on the battlefield. Why should we begin to question \nour resolve and, worst of all, why should we repeat the horrible \nmistake of the way in which we managed our conflict in the seventies?\n  It is time we recognized that we are winning a great victory for \nmankind, not just the Iraqi people; that America went to enforce a U.N. \nresolution when the U.N. would not; that we deposed a dictator that \neverybody said was bad. We won in Afghanistan over the Taliban, and we \nare winning in Iraq today over the insurgency headed by al-Qaida.\n  Have some of us forgotten 9/11/2001? Have we forgotten the USS Cole? \nHave we forgotten the fatwa issued in 1996 when war was declared by al-\nQaida on the United States of America? Most Americans haven't.\n  I want to conclude by three little stories about the past month in my \nlife.\n  I stood on the courthouse steps in Walton County, GA, this Saturday \nwelcoming home eight members of the 48th Brigade from Iraq. I stood \nthere with all the citizens of Monroe and Walton Counties cheering them \non--all the citizens, including Robert Stokely, the father of SGT Mike \nStokely who died in August of 2005 in Iraq. He came up and gave me \nMichael's dog tag, hugged me, grabbed my hand, and he welcomed home \nthose eight soldiers, knowing that his son, Michael, the ninth, was not \nhome with them, but he was proud of his effort.\n\n  Let's make sure Michael didn't die in vain. Let's not lose our \nresolve on the floor of the Senate.\n  The second incident I want to describe is what happened yesterday in \nthe Atlanta airport. I was late. I was running for my flight. I went \nthrough the atrium. All of a sudden a huge round of applause erupted. I \nstopped. I didn't know what in the world was going on. I turned and \nlooked, and there marched about 30 members of the United States Army in \ntheir desert fatigues on the way to an airplane, probably on their way \nto Iraq, and all those citizens in that airport from around the world \nflying through Atlanta stopped to give them a standing ovation.\n  I don't think those people would want us to set deadlines, \ntimetables, and withdraw from the ultimate battle.\n  And my last analogy is in Margraten in the Netherlands 3 weeks ago \nwhen Senators Craig, Specter, Burr, and myself sat on a beautiful sun-\nlit day before 7,000 Dutch in the American Cemetery in the Netherlands \nas the Royal Dutch Air Force flew over in a missing-man formation and \nas the Royal Dutch Senior Man's Choir sang ``God Bless America.''\n  I stood there for the better part of an hour having my hand shook by \ncitizens of Holland thanking me for what Americans did 62 years ago \nwhen they invaded Normandy, fought the Battle of the Bulge, and deposed \nAdolph Hitler.\n  There is nothing different about the hatred and intolerance for \nhumanity, race, and religion of Adolph Hitler and the intolerance for \nrace, religion, and faith of al-Qaida. The battle is just as great. The \nwarriors may be different, the site may be different, the methodology \nmay be different, but the result would be the same.\n  Had we not stayed the course in the 1940s, the world would have lost. \nIf we do not stay the course today, if we turn our back, the world will \nlose again.\n  Once again, the sons and daughters of the United States of America \nare fighting the right war in the right place at the right time for the \nright reason. For us to talk about timetables or suggest drawdowns or \ncompromise our commitment is just plain wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I compliment our distinguished colleague \nfrom Georgia for his remarks. I hope throughout the day colleagues on \nboth sides will address this critical issue with regard to our future \npolicies in Iraq and in Afghanistan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is amazing to me that less than a week \nafter the President returned from Iraq, having visited with the new \nGovernment leaders there, and having disclosed the death of the top al-\nQaida leader Zarqawi, in Iraq, colleagues in the Senate would actually \nbe proposing withdrawal from Iraq.\n  The strategy there needs to be to win, not to withdraw. Withdrawal \nfollows victory. If we think about the wars we have gone into--think \nabout World War II, for example--would it have made any sense for the \nCongress of the United States to pass a resolution saying to Franklin \nRoosevelt: You set a deadline for getting out of Germany and for \ngetting out of Japan or we are not going to continue to support this \neffort? It would have been ludicrous at the time. More importantly, it \nsends a message to our troops, to our enemies, and to our allies, and \nto the people in Iraq that is devastating.\n  Let me read a letter that was written by one of our soldiers \nstationed in Fallujah recently to his hometown newspaper in Ridgefield, \nCT, which expresses what I suspect is the view of many of our soldiers. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       In Fallujah, the people watch Al-Jazeerah. However, they \n     also watch CNN. A lot of them fear the United States will \n     soon cut and run. . . . Furthermore, they know that the \n     insurgents will not end their efforts early . . . Therefore, \n     if they help us, their lives and the lives of their loved \n     ones will be in great jeopardy the minute we leave--if we \n     don't finish the job. Much that they see on American \n     television leads them to believe that we intend to abandon \n     our efforts before the new Iraqi Government is capable of \n     defending itself and its citizens.\n\n  The bottom line is that the people in Iraq watch what we do, our \nfriends and our enemies, and much of our ability to win there depends \nupon figuring out which is going to be the winning side. They want to \nbe on the winning side. They don't want to side with us only to have us \ncut and run, leaving them with these insurgents who will find out who \nthey are and take care of business. Obviously, we have to send a \nmessage to them that we intend to prevail and therefore they can side \nwith us.\n  What we will learn is that much of our ability to get al-Zarqawi and \nothers depends upon the cooperation of the\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\nIraqis themselves. A lot of our intelligence comes from the fact that \nIraqis believe we are there to stay until the job is done, and if they \nhelp us, they can hasten that day. But if they come to believe that \nthey help us, we leave, and then the insurgents find out who they are, \nwe are not going to get any more help. It is going to delay the time \nthat we can leave rather than accelerate that time.\n  The people in the region, the countries that surround Iraq, would be \nin the very same position. They have decided that they are going to be \non the side of the winner, and they believe right now the United States \nis the winner in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and certainly the leaders of \nPakistan, of Saudi Arabia, of Lebanon, each of the countries \nsurrounding has decided to throw in with us. As the President said, you \nare either for us or against us. If we cut and run from Iraq, those \ncountries are not going to be able to stay with us, and what we will \nhave done is to prove what Osama bin Laden said is true, and that is \nthat instead of the strong horse, we are the weak horse. That is what \nthe people in the region are waiting to see.\n  So these concepts--whether it is an immediate withdrawal or simply \nthe beginning of a phased withdrawal this year, with the President \nbeing required to submit a plan for complete withdraw by the end of \nnext year--are all part and parcel of the same thing: a message to the \nenemy that we are leaving and here is our timetable for leaving. All \nyou have to do is wait until we are gone and then it is yours for the \ntaking. That is not just destructive for the Iraqi people; the whole \npoint is that it is destructive for our whole policy in winning the war \nagainst the terrorists.\n  They have to believe we are on the offensive, we are going after \nthem, and we won't quit until we win. But by pulling out of Iraq, we \nare sending the signal that by simply hanging on, by causing us trouble \nwith roadside bombs and other mechanisms, all they have to do is wait \nus out; we will lose patience, we will lose nerve, we will leave, and \nthat is how they win the war on terror.\n  So it is not just about the Iraqi people and their ability to govern \nthemselves in freedom or the people of Afghanistan; it is about the \nmessage it sends to the people who are today with us in the war on \nterror. It is about our ability to continue to show that we are winning \nthe war on terror, and that they better side with us rather than side \nwith people who are going to lose. It is all about winning the war over \nthere so that we don't have to worry as much about attacks in the \nUnited States.\n  This is a multifaceted war. There are enemies all over the globe. The \nbest way to win that war is through good intelligence and then taking \nthe fight to the enemy. Right now, the bulk of that fighting is in \nIraq, and it is there that we have to confront the enemy and defeat the \nenemy. If we pull out through these sort of sugar-coated notions of \nphased withdrawals--not a deadline--not cut and run--it is just a \nphased withdrawal, what kind of a signal does that send? It still \ncreates a date, a timetable, and a message to the enemy that we are, in \nfact, going to be leaving, and all they have to do is wait us out.\n  So I say to my colleagues, these kinds of proposals should be soundly \nrejected as they were last week, both in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives, and we should be sending the signal to our troops, as \nwell as to our enemies and to our allies: we are there to stay until \nvictory, not until we achieve some artificial deadline.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his contributions \nto this debate. I simply would add this one very important thought I \nhave had all along. This has been a struggle of a nation to achieve its \nplace in the world of governments of democracy. They have had--if there \nis one sign of courage amongst the Iraqi people, and today regrettably \nthere is so much strife and killing, but these people have gone to the \npolls in record numbers three consecutive times. You need only look at \nhistory and the difficulty of forming a government to say that the \nnewly elected government, a permanent government now, at long last, is \na unified government, and it has been achieved in a matter of months. \nThey were tough months, to wait them out. It is interesting that it \ntook 8 years in a way for this great Nation of ours to achieve the \nfinal form of government that we have today.\n  So the Iraqi Government is in place, and we must recognize it is a \nsovereign nation, and they have to make decisions on their own. The \nIraqi people cannot perceive that we are dictating how they will \nexercise their sovereignty. We are committed to stay there with our \nforces and the coalition forces to enable them to exercise their choice \nand the means by which to provide sovereignty for their people.\n  So I thank my distinguished colleague, and I think this will, in the \nhours and days to come, unfold into a very strong and vigorous debate \non these issues. But in the end, always allow the beacon of \nsovereignty, which we have enabled through enormous sacrifice to allow \nthem to achieve, to be the beacon that we must follow.\n  Mr. President, I understand that my distinguished colleague from \nRhode Island is prepared to address the Senate for a period of 20 \nminutes or so is my understanding, and if that is in accordance with \nthe wishes of my ranking member, he may so state.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Rhode Island, \nwho is under a unanimous consent agreement to be recognized for 20 \nminutes, to yield to me for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I will yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I noticed Senator Kyl again uses rhetoric \nwhich they apparently have decided will be used no matter what the \nfacts of any particular proposal are. I would just point out in this \nmorning's Washington Post that Mr. al-Rubaie, who is the National \nSecurity Adviser for Iraq, has argued that by year's end, we envision \nthe U.S. troop presence to be under 100,000. That would be at least a \n30,000 reduction. I wonder whether people, or Senators, who are going \nto mischaracterize the Levin-Reed et al amendment are going to also \nthen suggest that the Security Adviser to the new Prime Minister of \nIraq supports cut and run when he says that they envision a reduction \nof American troops to be below 100,000 by the end of this year, and he \nsets forth in this morning's Washington Post all of the reasons it is \nso important that foreign troops be redeployed, including to legitimize \nIraq's Government in the eyes of its people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article written by the \nSecurity Adviser to the new Prime Minister, Mr. al-Rubaie, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                    The Way Out of Iraq: A Road Map\n\n                        (By Mowaffak al-Rubaie)\n\n       There has been much talk about a withdrawal of U.S. and \n     coalition troops from Iraq, but no defined timeline has yet \n     been set. There is, however, an unofficial ``road map'' to \n     foreign troop reductions that will eventually lead to total \n     withdrawal of U.S. troops. This road map is based not just on \n     a series of dates but, more important, on the achievement of \n     set objectives for restoring security in Iraq.\n       Iraq has a total of 18 governorates, which are at differing \n     stages in terms of security. Each will eventually take \n     control of its own security situation, barring a major \n     crisis. But before this happens, each governorate will have \n     to meet stringent minimum requirements as a condition of \n     being granted control. For example, the threat assessment of \n     terrorist activities must be low or on a downward trend. \n     Local police and the Iraqi army must be deemed capable of \n     dealing with criminal gangs, armed groups and militias, and \n     border control. There must be a clear and functioning \n     command-and-control center overseen by the governor, with \n     direct communication to the prime minister's situation room.\n       Despite the seemingly endless spiral of violence in Iraq \n     today, such a plan is already in place. All the governors \n     have been notified and briefed on the end objective. The \n     current prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has approved the \n     plan, as have the coalition forces, and assessments of each \n     province have already been done. Nobody believes this is \n     going to be an easy task, but there is Iraqi and coalition \n     resolve to start taking the final steps to have a fully \n     responsible Iraqi government accountable to its people for \n     their governance and security. Thus far four of the 18 \n     provinces are ready for the transfer of power--two in the \n     north (Irbil and Sulaymaniyah) and two in the South (Maysan \n     and Muthanna). Nine more provinces are nearly ready.\n       With the governors of each province meeting these strict \n     objectives, Iraq's ambition is to have full control of the \n     country by the end of 2008. In practice this will mean \n     significant foreign troop reduction. We envisage\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\n     the U.S. troop presence by year's end to the under 100,000, \n     with most of the remaining troops to return home by the end \n     of 2007.\n       The eventual removal of coalition troops from Iraq streets \n     will help the Iraqis, who now see foreign troops as occupiers \n     rather than the liberators they were meant to be. It will \n     remove psychological barriers and the reason that many Iraqis \n     joined the so-called resistance in the first place. The \n     removal of troops will also allow the Iraqi government to \n     engage with some of our neighbors that have to date been at \n     the very least sympathetic to the resistance because of what \n     they call the ``coalition of occupation.'' If the sectarian \n     issue continues to cause conflict with Iraq's neighbors, this \n     matter needs to be addressed urgently and openly--not in the \n     guise of aversion to the presence of foreign troops.\n       Moreover, the removal of foreign troops will legitimize \n     Iraq's government in the eyes of its people. It has taken \n     what some feel is an eternity to form a government of \n     national unity. This has not been an easy or enviable task, \n     but it represents a significant achievement, considering that \n     many new ministers are working in partisan situations, often \n     with people with whom they share a history of enmity and \n     distrust. By its nature, the government of national unity, \n     because it is working through consensus, could be perceived \n     to be weak. But, again, the drawdown of foreign troops will \n     strengthen our fledging government to last the full four \n     years it is supposed to.\n       While Iraq is trying to gain its independence from the \n     United States and the coalition, in terms of taking greater \n     responsibility for its actions, particularly in terms of \n     security, there are still some influential foreign figures \n     trying to spoon-feed our government and take a very proactive \n     role in many key decisions. Through this many provide some \n     benefits in the short term, in the long run it will only \n     serve to make the Iraqi government a weaker one and \n     eventually lead to a culture of dependency. Iraq has to grow \n     out of the shadow of the United States and the coalition, \n     take responsibility for its own decisions, learn from its own \n     mistakes, and find Iraqi solutions to Iraqi problems, with \n     the knowledge that our friends and allies are standing by \n     with support and help should we need it.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nReed is recognized--the chairman and I have talked about this--at that \npoint, the Dorgan amendment be the matter before the Senate. I believe \nthat the Senator from Virginia and I have agreed that Senator Dorgan \nwould be recognized for 10 minutes, to be followed then by the chairman \nfor 5 minutes, and the intention then would be to proceed to a rollcall \nvote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are fully in concurrence as managers, \nbut I would like to have the benefit of our leaders and the respective \nstaff working up a unanimous consent agreement precisely outlining \nthat. Then, as I further discussed with my colleague from Michigan, we \nhad hopes that the matter raised by the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nNelson, in which he had an amendment relating to the issue of amnesty, \nbe addressed together with the side-by-side amendment by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, Mr. McConnell. So I hope that while hearing from our \ncolleague from Rhode Island addressing the Senate, we can have a \nformalized UC agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6105-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Reed, shall be recognized to speak for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss the fiscal \nyear 2007 Defense authorization bill. I am glad it is on the floor. It \nis very important legislation, and it is arriving in a timely manner \nwhere we can dispose of it along with the other body and hopefully \nconclude in the next few weeks with a finalized Defense authorization \nbill.\n  I would also note that this is Senator Warner's last bill as chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I personally want to \ncommend him and thank him for his leadership, not only as the chairman \nof this committee, but as a young sailor, a young marine, and a more \nmature Secretary of the Navy, and now a mature Member of the United \nStates Senate. So thank you, Senator, for your leadership and \nfriendship.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island. I \nappreciate his remarks, a Senator with a very distinguished military \nrecord of his own, and quite modest about it. But at some point I would \nlove to have a colloquy with the Senator on why Rhode Island--we are \ntalking about sovereignty and the formation of governments--about why \ndid they hold out those many years before ratifying the Constitution? \nAt some point, could the two of us have a colloquy about that?\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to do that, in the future.\n  I would like to highlight some of the aspects of the bill which I \nthink are very important. I have had the privilege of working with \nSenator Cornyn as the ranking member of the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee. It has been a real pleasure. He has conducted the \ncommittee with great efficiency and great cooperation. The staff has \nbeen particularly helpful on a bipartisan basis.\n  I am pleased to note that in the context of our deliberations, \nseveral important measures were included in this legislation. First, we \nhave authorized an additional $400 million for science and technology \nprograms. The original request sent by the Department of Defense was \nwoefully inadequate. Science and technology is the key to our future on \nthe battlefield as we match the skill and valor of our soldiers with \nthe very best technology. We have to continue this investment. I am \npleased that our legislation increases that item by $400 million.\n  Also, the bill includes language to require a report to Congress on \nthe testing policies and practices that should be pursued with respect \nto rapid acquisition programs, spiral development programs, quick \nreaction fielding programs, and the testing for safety and \nsurvivability of deployed equipment. One of the weaknesses, I believe, \nwith the present approach of the Department of Defense is a failure to \nadequately test and evaluate, and I think that failure has to be \ncorrected and this report will, I hope, put attention on this issue and \nlead to positive results.\n  The legislation also urges the Department of Defense to identify and \nnominate an individual to serve as the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation. This position has been vacant since January 2005. It is a \ncritical position. This individual is the key independent personality \nin the Department of Defense to look at the testing and evaluation of \nnew equipment. Without this position, the testing emphasis is woefully \ninadequate in the Department of Defense.\n  As we put new systems into the military, we have to ensure that these \nsystems are adequately tested. Without an individual with that \nresponsibility and that position and posture within the Department of \nDefense, we are not providing the appropriate personality and mechanism \nto do the job.\n  The bill also establishes the Joint Technology Office to coordinate \nall DOD hypersonics research programs in\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\nconjunction with NASA. The new office reflects an appreciation of the \nimportant role that these technologies can play in advanced air \nplatforms, missile systems, and space systems. The committee's \nprovision is an effort to ensure that millions of dollars being \ninvested by the services and by DARPA in hypersonics are optimized and \ncoordinated to enable this maturing set of technologies to reach \noperational capabilities at the highest possible rate and at the \nearliest possible time.\n  The bill also extends the authority for DOD to run technology \ncompetitions and awards cash prices to winners. This is a provision \nthat DARPA uses very effectively.\n  The bill also authorizes more than $30 million in increases for \nresearch that supports defense manufacturing technology. A growing \nconcern in the United States, in both the defense and commercial \nsector, is whether or not we have the capability to manufacture what we \ninvent. This money will help us enhance our manufacturing abilities \nthroughout the United States.\n  There is another area of the bill that I think is very important and \nthat is the area that helps us protect this country from weapons of \nmass destruction. First, the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program of \nthe Department of Defense is fully funded with a budget request of $372 \nmillion. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program is one of the leading \nnonproliferation programs. It allows our Government to cooperate with \nother governments, principally those of the former Soviet Union, to \nreduce the availability and supply of the fissile material and \npotential access to nuclear devices.\n  Also, the nonproliferation programs at the Department of Energy are \nfully funded at $1.7 billion. This funding is critical. One of the most \nobvious threats and the most grievous threats to face this country is \nthe existence of nuclear weapons, particularly if they fall in the \nhands of terrorists. One very effective way to prevent this potential \napocalypse is to ensure these weapons are fully under the control of a \ncredible responsible party. In fact, in many cases we are destroying \nsome of this material to prevent it from ever being used again.\n  The bill also includes an important waiver for the President with \nrespect to the conditions that Russia must meet for chemical weapons \ndestruction programs. It is important to continue to have these \nprograms go forward. This waiver gives the President flexibility to \ncontinue these efforts.\n  In the areas of combating terrorism and homeland defense, the bill \nauthorizes funding increases of about $150 million. Approximately $100 \nmillion of these funds are being used to fund the top eight unfunded \nrequirements of the Special Operations Command. We all understand each \nof the components of the Department of Defense submit their requests. \nThese eight elements were not funded under the prevailing budget. Our \nlegislation would provide $100 million to do that and allow our special \noperators to continue to enhance their technology and their programs.\n  The increase will provide, I think, also, support for our Weapons of \nMass Destruction Civil Support Teams. These are military teams that are \norganized in case of a weapons of mass destruction incident in the \nUnited States. They are critical. The original 32 teams played a key \nrole. This would allow them to upgrade their equipment.\n  The bill also authorizes about $70 million to fund two of Northern \nCommand's highest unfunded priorities. Included among these priorities \nare interoperable communications to facilitate the support of civilian \nauthorities. This is an obvious need after Hurricane Katrina. When we \ngo back--I am sure my colleagues are in the same position--to our home \nStates we hear a persistent cry from fire and police officials that \nthey need interoperable communications to talk amongst themselves and \nto talk to other levels of command.\n  The bill also creates a senior executive position within the Office \nof the Assistant Secretary for Defense for Special Operations and Low-\nIntensity Conflict to provide management oversight for SOCOM's \nacquisition programs. One of the lacking elements in SOCOM's \norganization is an acquisition specialist. This bill would put in a \nperson with those skills, so they can facilitate the acquisition and \ndevelopment of new technology for our Special Operations Command.\n  The bill also includes an authorization for the Department of Defense \nto use counterdrug funds to support U.S. assistance to the unified \ncounterdrug/counterterrorism military campaign in Colombia. Last April, \nI was in Colombia and I had the opportunity to meet with President \nUribes. I was encouraged by what he has done and what the people of \nColombia have done. I also visited with our military personnel and \ncivilians working to help the Colombian military personnel who have \nbeen working to fight narcoterrorism and strengthen democratic \ngovernance in Colombia, and I was extremely impressed with what they \nhave done since my last visit in 2000. I believe, as we support the \nColombians in their efforts, we will make a significant contribution to \nstability in that region.\n  Finally, with respect to our efforts on the Emerging Threat \nSubcommittee, I note the bill includes authorization for incentive \nclauses in some of our chemical demilitarization contracts. This \nauthority is intended to provide a more efficient way to close some of \nour chemical weapons facilities and to meet international deadlines.\n  All of these efforts were the result of the close cooperation of \nSenator Cornyn and the staff with respect to the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee.\n  Let me now turn to an issue of increased importance in the last few \ndays and that is missile defense. We are all anxiously observing what \nis going on in North Korea--the intelligence suggesting that the North \nKoreans are preparing to launch a long-range ballistic missile.\n  This bill contains language that I think recognizes a need to \ncontinue to develop a missile defense system and to do so in a way that \ncan assure its effectiveness. The bill would authorize additional \nfunding for systems that we know are working and are extremely \nvaluable, including the Aegis BMD system and the Patriot/PAC-3 system. \nI note the Patriot system is our only system that has actually \nintercepted a hostile missile, and that additional support for this \nsystem is more than justified. I also note that the Patriot system \nwas rigorously tested and was subject to operational testing before it \nwas fully deployed.\n\n  The largest single missile defense funding increase which is \nauthorized by this bill is $115 million for additional integrated \nflight tests for the Ground-based Mid-course Defense system, the GMD. I \nthink it is very important to focus in on operational testing of this \nsystem. One of the shortcomings of the whole program for developing our \nmissile defense system has been a rush, in many cases, to failure, not \ntaking the steps to test the system or not designing tests that are \noperationally significant. In that respect, we have spent a lot of \nmoney but we have yet, I think, to fully and effectively deploy the \nground-based mid-course system.\n  We have to recognize that after three successive intercept flight \ntest failures, the Missile Defense Agency is taking some steps which I \nthink are encouraging. They created an Independent Review Team and a \nMission Readiness Task Force to analyze these failures and recommend \nimprovements to the GMD program.\n  Again, one of the persistent criticisms I had was that the system was \nrushing pell-mell forward without stopping to evaluate the mistakes \nthat have been made and then planning for a thorough and exhaustive \nsystem of tests. Therefore, the effort was just to put something in the \nground, not to ensure that missile system would work adequately.\n  MRTF, the Mission Readiness Task Force, recommended that four ground-\nbased interceptors be diverted from planned operational deployment--\nessentially sitting in the ground being described as operational, but \nfrankly I don't know anyone who would give that a high probability of \nsuccess--to using these missiles for ground tests. I think that is a \nstep forward in terms of development the system.\n  These recommendations were accepted by the Missile Defense Agency and \nthe Defense Department. Again, I think a recognition of a new \npragmatism and realism on the part of the Missile Defense Agency, \nsomething\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\nthat is more than overdue. We need more testing to ensure the GMD \nsystem will work, and I think the legislation we have before us will \nsignal and encourage such testing.\n  The bill would also include a provision that would require the \nDepartment to submit to Congress each test and evaluation plan approved \nby the Director of Operational Tests and Evaluation under Section 234 \nof last year's National Defense Authorization Act. Again, this \nprovision is designed to help improve testing and to show the emphasis \nthat the Congress places on this testing.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision that would extend the \nrequirement to have the GAO assess the missile defense program. The GAO \nplays a very valuable role as an outside objective observer on the \nprogress of missile defense.\n  We have to invest in a missile defense system, but we have to do it \nwisely. We have already seen where the effect of other budget \npriorities, principally Iraq, has even caused the administration to \nmove money away from their original plans in missile defense. I believe \nwe cannot afford to waste money in this regard. We have to invest it \nwisely. Part of that wise investment means having an adequate, \nthorough, exhaustive operational testing program to make steady \nprogress, rather than to rush to failure.\n  I would like to turn to another topic which is of concern to myself, \nand that is the shipbuilding program. Since 2001, most of the focus of \nthe Department of Defense and Congress, indeed, of the Nation, has been \non our land forces, the Army and Marines. They are engaged in combat in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and doing a magnificent job. They are bearing the \nburden of a very difficult combat situation.\n  However, our Navy is still a vital element in our national defense. \nIts importance will continue to loom significant in the future. The CNO \nhas stated that he needs $13.5 billion each year for at least the next \ndecade to recapitalize the fleet. With this funding, the Navy must also \nbuild approximately 11 ships per year to maintain a 313-ship fleet.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator kindly yield for me to \nmake a unanimous consent request so Senators can arrange their \nschedules?\n  Mr. REED. I yield to the Senator from Virginia and will then regain \nmy time.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is a cleared unanimous consent request on both \nsides. I ask unanimous consent that at 11:15 the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Dorgan amendment No. 4292 and that no \namendments be in order prior to the vote. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Dorgan be recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes \nbetween now and the time before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. As I stated, the Chief of Naval Operations indicated he \nwould need approximately $13.5 billion each year for the next decade to \nrecapitalize the fleet. However, the President's budget request only \nincludes 7 ships in fiscal year 2007 versus the 11 that the Chief needs \nto maintain the 313-ship fleet. Seven ships in fiscal year 2008. In \n2009 the suggestion is they move up to nine ships. But those plans have \nbeen delayed before.\n  This shipbuilding level simply cannot sustain the fleet. My greatest \nconcern is with respect to the construction level of submarines. While \nmany believe that the need for submarines has diminished with the end \nof the Cold War, the demand for these unique assets has never been \ngreater.\n  Last week I was with Senator Dodd and Senator Inouye for the \nchristening of the USS Hawaii, our newest Virginia Class attack \nsubmarine at Groton, CT. Admiral Roughhead, Commander of the Pacific \nFleet, pointed out submarines are his most demanded asset. They are the \none ship that is constantly requested by commanders throughout the \nPacific to do the tasks that are necessary to defend the Nation.\n  This is true in our global war on terrorism as we need the ability \nfor stealthy insertion of special operations troops. We need to be able \nto recover these troops, we need to have the capacity to strike with \nprecision-guided Tomahawk cruise missiles. All of these are \ncapabilities of the submarine fleet.\n  Back in March of 2004, Admiral Bowman, who was then the Director of \nthe Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program, suggested to me that the Navy \nwas only able to meet about 65 percent of the combatant commanders' \nsubmarine requirements with the current fleet of 54 boats. In 2003, \nVice Admiral Grossenbacher, then commander of the Naval Submarine \nForces, estimated we needed 70 submarines to meet the request of all of \nthe commanders. These are requests that will simply not be met if we \ndrop our submarine fleet below certain limits.\n  In addition, we understand that China is developing a very robust \nsubmarine fleet. Today, China's submarine fleet is estimated at a \nnumber of approximately 60 boats. In 2004 and 2005, 12 new submarines \njoined the Chinese fleet. New nuclear-missile-attack boats are coming \non line, and China has one of the largest modern diesel submarine \nfleets in the world. Clearly, there is a need to prudently react to the \ngrowing underwater prowess of China.\n  Presently, the U.S. Navy has 282 ships, including 54 attack \nsubmarines. In the fiscal year 2007 long-range plan for construction of \nnaval vessels, the Navy expressed the intent to maintain 313, but only \n48 attack submarines. Recall recently there were requirements for up to \n70 submarines--at least discussion of 70 submarines--or 54 submarines; \n48 attack submarines are currently in the plan. The Navy is in danger \nof not even being able to put to sea 48 attack submarines at current \nbuild rate.\n  Right now the Navy is currently procuring one Virginia class attack \nsubmarine per year, and a ninth is in the budget for this year. \nHowever, under the original plan drawn up by the Navy in 2003, \nproduction of two boats per year was supposed to begin in fiscal year \n2007. Now the procurement of two per year has been pushed back to \nfiscal year 2012.\n  If the Navy is able to implement its plan and begin building two \nattack submarines per year in fiscal year 2012, the attack submarine \nfleet will still drop below 40 before it begins to increase again. If \nthe 2-per-year procurement keeps getting pushed off to the left--it has \nalready happened 10 times where it has been pushed back--the submarine \nforce would drop as low as 28.\n  I think we all agree that 28 is a number that cannot be justified in \nterms of the demand and in terms of this effort. We have to do quite a \nbit to move up the construction of two submarines per year.\n  First, the report language accompanying this bill states: ``The \nCommittee does not understand the continuing delays in increasing the \n[submarine] construction rate'' and directs the Secretary of the Navy \nto submit a detailed plan for lowering costs and defining goals and \nbenchmarks for the Virginia class production program. I believe this \nlanguage will help compel the Navy and the industry to redouble their \nefforts to increase the construction rate--and that is vitally \nimportant.\n  Second, I am pleased to know that this legislation includes $65 \nmillion for R for the Virginia class submarines.\n  This R is I think critical not only to improve the capabilities of \nthese ships but also to continue to engage in the design force which is \npart of the human capital in our submarine industrial base.\n  Also, I note that the bill includes $10 million for funding to begin \ndesign work on the successor to the Ohio class ballistic submarine. \nThis design work is essential to continue our ability to produce a \nfollow-on generation of attack submarines but also ballistic \nsubmarines.\n  I think this is absolutely critical.\n  Let me turn to another point with respect to our Army; that is, end \nstrength.\n  I am pleased to see that this bill authorizes an Active-Duty Army end \nstrength of 512,400, which is 30,000 over the President's fiscal year \n2007 budget request.\n  The act also authorizes an Active-Duty Marine Corps of 180,000, which \nis 5,000 over the President's budget request.\n  I think it is important to maintain the end strength of the Army.\n  I think it is a result of the efforts of Senators Lott and Talent and \nmyself on the budget resolution, where we actually moved $3.7 billion \nto accomplish this.\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\n  Let me make one final point, if I may.\n  The Army end strength is a critical issue. I think we have to note, \nat this time but also at a later date continue to note, that recruiting \nis becoming a critical issue for the U.S. Army. According to the \ninformation I have, the U.S. Army, in the first three-quarters of the \nyear, has recruited to a level of 40,000. That means in the final \nquarter the Army is going to have to recruit 40,000 soldiers to meet \ntheir goals. That is much higher than they have ever done in the last \nfew years.\n  We have a recruiting problem that is beginning to emerge.\n  I will devote additional time on this subject at a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be recognized for 10 minutes, after which time the \nSenator from Virginia be recognized for 5 minutes, and the Senate then \nvote immediately thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \ncourtesy.\n  This is a vote that we had before in the Senate. It is a vote on the \nestablishment of a type of committee called a Truman Committee. The \nTruman Committee was established in the early 1940s to try to root out \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in military contracting. That was done when \nthere was a Democrat in the White House, a Democratically controlled \nSenate, and a Democratic Senator named Harry Truman. He decided there \nought to be a special investigation of waste, fraud, and abuse with \nrespect to military contracting. They established a bipartisan \ncommittee to do that. They found a massive amount of waste, fraud, and \nabuse.\n  I think it is clear that perhaps the most significant amount of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse that has ever occurred in this country is \noccurring right now. I think the American taxpayers are being fleeced. \nI don't think the Congress is doing nearly enough about it.\n  Let me go through a couple of charts that I have shown before on the \nfloor of the Senate. This is from the highest ranking procurement \nofficial in the Corps of Engineers, which does all the procurement for \nthe Department of Defense. She lost her job. She was demoted for being \nhonest.\n  She said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to the \n     contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and \n     improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of \n     my professional career.\n\n  This from the top civilian contracting official in our Government at \nthe Corps of Engineers. She is being demoted for being honest. She was \nalways given the best recommendations, the highest performance \nevaluations, and when they saw that the ``old boy'' network decided to \ngive big sole-source contracts, no-bid contracts and do it in a way \nthat violated procurement rules, she spoke out. ``The most blatant and \nimproper contract abuse'' she has ever seen.\n  Let me describe one contract--the Custer Battles contract. Two guys--\nCuster Battles--show up in Iraq. They know there is a lot of money. The \nAmerican taxpayers are funding not only reconstruction of Iraq but also \nfunding Army contracts. Two guys show up in Iraq with nothing. And $100 \nmillion later, they got $100 million of the taxpayers' money for \ncontracts. The first contract was to provide security at the Baghdad \nAirport. There is a criminal inquiry as a result of that.\n  Here is what Bagdad Airport security said about this company, Custer \nBattles--Mr. Custer and Mr. Battles.\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative war \n     profiteers. Other than that, they are swell fellows.\n\n  They received 100 million in American taxpayer dollars.\n  By the way, they took the forklift trucks off the Baghdad Airport and \nput them in a warehouse. They painted them blue and then sold them back \nto the Coalition Provisional Authority--forklift trucks which didn't \nbelong to them. There are now criminal proceedings about this contract. \nBut this is the tip of the iceberg.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to show an item on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a man named Henry Bunting worked for KBR, \na subsidiary of Halliburton Corporation, in the area of Kuwait where \nHenry Bunting was in charge of procurement. He had to buy things.\n  Let me show the Senate what he bought. He brought this to a hearing \nwe held. This is a hand towel. He was charged, on behalf of \nHalliburton's KBR subsidiary, to buy hand towels. He would order a hand \ntowel for the American troops at a certain price, but his company said: \nDon't do that. We want you to have a hand towel that has the \nembroidered logo on it, the name of our company. So double the price to \nthe American taxpayer for hand towels for the troops. So you have KBR \nembroidered on the hand towel.\n  He says: Why should we do that? It doesn't matter. It is cost-plus. \nThe American taxpayer is paying the bill. Don't worry about the cost.\n  Same guy, $7,500 a month for an SUV; $45, $43 for a case of Coca \nCola. He said: Don't worry, be happy. The taxpayer is going to pay for \nall of this. Don't worry about the cost.\n  Yes, I know this towel is one small issue. But when you buy thousands \nand thousands and tens of thousands of towels and double the price so \nyou can put the logo of the contractor on it because it is a cost-plus \ncontract, that relates to $100 million contracts, and it relates, in my \njudgment, to billions of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Regrettably, the Congress doesn't care enough.\n  I suggest we remedy this by creating a Truman-type committee. It \nworked, it was bipartisan, and it began to root out the waste, fraud, \nand abuse that is so prevalent.\n  I am not going to go through the whole list again. But let me \ndescribe it. If you are in the right place of the country of Iraq, you \ncan stumble onto 50,000 pounds of nails, 25 tons of nails, lying in the \nsand. Why? Because somebody ordered the wrong size nails. So you throw \nthem out in the sand. Doesn't matter, the American taxpayer is going to \npay for that.\n  Or you can see a brandnew $75,000 truck that was set on fire because \nit had a flat tire, and they run it off the road. They didn't have the \ncapability to fix it and just left the truck. Doesn't matter, the \nAmerican taxpayer is going to pay the bill.\n  I think this is unbelievable. We have spent hundreds of billions of \ndollars at this point.\n  I understand that our responsibility is to do everything we should \ndo, and must do, to support the troops who are fighting in Iraq.\n  We cannot send American men and women abroad wearing our country's \nuniform and not do everything that is humanly possible to provide all \nof their needs, equipment needs, weapons needs, and so on. I understand \nthat. That is a responsibility we have. I believe the chairman of this \ncommittee and the ranking member of this committee have done a great \njob. I am impressed with that.\n  The one area where all of us have failed in this Congress, however, \nis oversight. We have not done the oversight. I think part of it is \nbecause we have one-party rule in this town--the White House and the \nHouse and Senate. Nobody wants to embarrass anybody. But the fact is \nthere is such massive amount of money that is going out the door in \nsupport of these contracts--sole-source, no-bid contracts that have \npromoted waste. And nobody wants to take a second look at it. Nobody \nwants to see what is going on.\n  There are whistleblowers coming forward saying this money is being \nspent. It is being spent in an unbelievable way.\n  This is a slightly different picture. By the way, this is $2 million \nin $100 bills wrapped in Saran Wrap. This money actually belongs to the \nIraqi people that was spent by us in something called the Coalition \nProvisional Authority. That was our responsibility to spend this \nappropriately. This money went to Custer Battles and is the subject of \na criminal inquiry. This $2 million wrapped in Saran Wrap in $100 bills \nwas a part of a substantial\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\nstash of cash in the basement of a building where they were standing.\n  This particular fellow came and testified. He said: We used to throw \nthese around as footballs. We wrapped up $100 bills in Saran Wrap and \nthrew them as footballs in the office because the message in this \noffice was this:\n  You bring a bag because we pay in cash. Bring a sack. If you want \nsome money, bring a sack, we pay in cash.\n  The stories are unbelievable.\n  The American taxpayer is going to pay to air condition a building. It \nwent to a subcontractor, to another subcontractor, and then to another \nsubcontractor, and pretty soon we pay the bill. The American taxpayer \npaid the bill, and that building now has a ceiling fan--not an air \nconditioner.\n  What is going on is unbelievable. Yet nobody seems to care very much. \nNobody seems to be willing to do anything. I suggest, given the \nunprecedented amount of waste, fraud, and abuse, that now is the time \nfor us to decide we are going to take action. We will create a Truman \nCommittee, bipartisan, and sink our teeth into this and investigate on \nbehalf of the American taxpayer--investigate and expose the waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  The fact is we turned down, regrettably, a bill which I offered \npreviously that would have prevented the no-bid, sole-source, huge \ncontracts going to just a couple of companies. That is one way to solve \nthis problem. We should have accepted that. But notwithstanding the \ndecision by the Senate to turn down that amendment, this amendment \nstands on its own.\n  Are we going to decide that when the highest civilian procurement \nofficial in the Corps of Engineers responsible for all these contracts \nsays that she can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \ncontracts awarded represents the most blatant and improper contract \nabuse she has witnessed during the course of her professional career, \nare we going to decide that is serious? We are going to do something \nabout it?\n  I know people will say we have done this or that. The fact is we \nhaven't scratched the surface--not a bit.\n  It is time for the Senate to ask itself whether it is serious about \noversight and doing the job.\n  I am not standing here trying to pull the ground out from under this \ncommittee--or any committee. I am saying we have never spent this much \nmoney so quickly, never given the kind of sole-source, no-bid contracts \nthat we have offered. We have never shoved money out the door as \nquickly as we have for procurement and in support of contracts for the \ntroops.\n  Again, let me show this towel as a small hand-towel symbol of a \nmassive amount of waste, fraud, and abuse that I believe we ought to \ncorrect, and we ought to begin today by approving my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I wish to say to our colleague from North Dakota that \nhe feels very strongly about this issue. That comes through in the \ndebate on this issue that we have had now for 3 days, on and off.\n  But I bring to the attention of my colleagues that three times the \nSenate has addressed this issue and has rejected it. It is not a \nrejection in the sense that the Senator doesn't raise points that \nshould be addressed to the Senate. But there is a clear record that the \nSenate is addressing these issues. The Committee on Armed Services had \na number of hearings. The Committee on Foreign Relations had a number \nof hearings. And most importantly, the Senate is structured whereby \nissues of this type are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  In that committee, and it has been for many years, there is a \nsubcommittee entitled ``The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation'' \nwith subpoena power. In the colloquy we had on the Senator's bill on \nThursday, my distinguished colleague, Senator Levin, and I, both \ncommented, since we serve on that committee--he serves on the Special \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations--that this is a matter we \nshould take up with the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Before the Senate tries to restructure the framework of how it \nperforms its work, we should focus on what is and what has been that \nframework for these many years now. It is for that reason I suggest \nstrongly this amendment not be accepted. It would, in effect, be \noverruling what we are doing on the Permanent Subcommittee.\n  Second, Congress should be stepping into the role that is now being \nperformed by inspector generals, being performed by the General \nAccountability Office and, indeed, an inspector general specially \ndesignated by the Congress and the Secretary of Defense for Iraq and \nother nations.\n  With that, I will not move to table this because I feel very strongly \nthe Senate should address it in the same manner we have addressed it on \nprevious occasions three times and rejected it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Under the previous order a vote is now to occur in relation to the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed 1 minute to respond \nto my good friend's comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what we are dealing with is a historic use \nof no-bid contracts, where billions of dollars have been spent. There \nis good evidence they have been misspent in many ways, and there is a \nhuge amount of waste and abuse.\n  I agree with my good friend from Virginia we do have committees that \ncould look into this matter and could focus on this matter. The agendas \nof those committees are left basically to the chairmen of those \ncommittees. If the chairmen of those committees choose to focus their \nenergies in other places--and I don't quarrel with the places they \nlook--it does not mean the Senate should not express its opinion on the \nneed to focus on these abuses, these excesses, this expenditure of \nbillions of dollars on no-bid contracts.\n  Therefore, I support the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I ask consent to point out to my colleagues that \nSenator Harkin, Senator Durbin, and Senator Clinton are cosponsors. I \ndid not mention that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, a vote now occurs on the Dorgan amendment \non which the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Reserving the right to object. Mr. President, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are still getting the concurrence of \none side on the unanimous consent request. It was my understanding it \nwas cleared. I think it will eventually be cleared. In the meantime, I \nyield the floor so that our colleague from Iowa can speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn. The Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. Any time the \nchairman needs to interrupt my remarks to seek that agreement, I will \nbe more than happy to yield the floor.\n  I wish to talk about an amendment I have not offered yet but I hope \nwill be accepted by both sides. I will offer it, and I hope it will be \nacceptable. It has to do with the loss of some $8 billion for which we \ncannot account.\n  More than 3 years into the Iraq war, we have had report after report \ndocumenting rampant corruption and profiteering on the part of some \ndefense contractors, as well as lax oversight by governmental \nofficials. A major reason this is continuing largely unchecked is that \napparently the Department of Justice has been delaying whistleblower \nlawsuits brought under the False Claims Act, and DOJ is not pursuing \nthese suits aggressively. So I filed an amendment designed to break \nthis logjam by requiring the Department of Justice to report on a \nsemiannual basis, every 6 months----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator to yield for the \npurpose of a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa. I am \nprepared to restate the unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to 30 \nminutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form, relative to the \nMcConnell and Nelson amendments; provided further, that following the \nuse or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nMcConnell amendment No. 4272, as modified--\n  The modification is at the desk. Did the Chair rule on the \nmodification?\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4272, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 4272), as modified, is as follows:\n\n     SEC._SENSE OF THE CONGRESS COMMENDING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ \n                   FOR AFFIRMING ITS POSITION OF NO AMNESTY FOR \n                   TERRORISTS WHO ATTACK U.S. ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces are serving heroically in Iraq to provide all \n     the people of Iraq a better future.\n       (2) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces have served bravely in Iraq since the \n     beginning of military operations in March 2003.\n       (3) More than 2,500 of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and members of coalition military forces have been \n     killed and more than 18,000 injured in operations to bring \n     peace and stability to all the people of Iraq.\n       (4) The National Security Advisor of Iraq affirmed that the \n     Government of Iraq will ``never give amnesty to those who \n     have killed American soldiers or Iraqi soldiers or \n     civilians.''\n       (5) The National Security Advisor of Iraq thanked ``the \n     American wives and American women and American mothers for \n     the treasure and blood they have invested in this country . . \n     . of liberating 30 million people in this country . . . and \n     we are ever so grateful.''\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that\n       (1) the goal of the United States and our Coalition \n     partners has been to empower the Iraqi Nation with full \n     sovereignty thereby recognizing their freedom to exercise \n     that sovereignty. Through successive elections and difficult \n     political agreements the unity government is now in place \n     exercising that sovereignty. We must respect that exercise of \n     that sovereignty in accordance with their own wisdom;\n       (2) history records that governments derived of free \n     elections should not grant amnesty to those who have \n     committed war crimes or terrorists acts, and;\n       (3) the United States should continue with the historic \n     tradition of diplomatically, economically, and in a \n     humanitarian manner assisting nations and the people whom \n     have fought once a conflict is concluded.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. To be followed by a vote on the Nelson amendment No. \n4265, and that no amendments be in order to the amendments prior to the \nvotes, with the modification that is at the desk having now been acted \nupon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, did I hear that they have an opportunity to speak on their \namendments?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct, 30 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I missed that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to accommodate the Senate, would we not at \n12:30 p.m. go into recess? Perhaps I can ask unanimous consent that at \nthe conclusion--how much time does the Senator wish to speak?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nremarks of the Senator of Iowa, the Senate stand in recess until the \nhour of 2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and \nranking member.\n  As I was saying, the amendment I filed is designed to break the \nlogjam of what is happening at the Department of Justice delaying \nwhistleblower lawsuits brought under the False Claims Act, and they are \nnot pursuing these cases aggressively.\n  My amendment would require the Department of Justice to report on a \nsemiannual basis on the status of its efforts to respond to \nwhistleblower lawsuits alleging corruption in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere. The Department would be required to report its findings to \nthe Judiciary Committee, the Appropriations Committee, the Armed \nServices Committee, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  I believe this is an important first step that would allow Congress \nto evaluate the Department of Justice efforts so we can decide what \nfurther steps are needed to ensure these cases are vigorously \nprosecuted.\n  I am pleased that Senators Grassley, Dorgan, Durbin, Kennedy, \nJohnson, Wyden, Kerry, Lieberman, Leahy, and Lautenberg are \ncosponsoring this amendment.\n  The cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has risen dramatically \nin each of the last 3 years. The Congressional Research Service reports \nwe are\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\nnow spending about $6.4 billion a month in Iraq alone. That is about $9 \nmillion an hour of spending in Iraq--$9 million an hour. One of the \nreasons for these runaway costs is the widespread corruption in the \ncontracting process: shoddy work, nonwork, theft, fraud, kickbacks, \nbribes, insider dealings, inflated billings, and on and on.\n\n  There have been many reports in the press about this wave of \ncorruption. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year about \nthe problem. Our former inspector general in Baghdad, Stuart Bowen, \nconcluded that U.S. occupation authorities accounted poorly for $8.8 \nbillion in funds dedicated to Iraqi reconstruction from the Development \nFund for Iraq. He stated this $8.8 billion is lost--lost. The Inspector \nGeneral Stuart Bowen said, ``The Coalition Provisional Authority did \nnot implement adequate financial controls.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the April 19, 2006 article in the Wall \nStreet Journal by Yochi J. Breazen be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 19, 2006]\n\n           Contractor Admits Bribing a U.S. Official in Iraq\n\n\n  lawyer uses civil war-era law to go after firms for corruption, but \n                       administration won't help\n\n                         (By Yochi J. Dreazen)\n\n       Orlando.--From his home office in a pink-painted mansion \n     here, lawyer Alan Grayson is waging a one-man war against \n     contractor fraud in Iraq.\n       Mr. Grayson has filed dozens of lawsuits against Iraq \n     contractors on behalf of corporate whistle-blowers. He won a \n     huge victory last month when a federal jury in Virginia \n     ordered a security firm called Custer Battles LLC to return \n     $10 million in ill-gotten funds to the government. The ruling \n     marked the first time an American firm was held responsible \n     for financial impropriaties in Iraq. But it also highlighted \n     the limits of the broader efforts to stem contractor abuses \n     there.\n       The False Claims Act that Mr. Grayson used in the Custer \n     Battles case is a Civil War-era statute allowing whistle-\n     blowers to sue contractors suspected of defrauding the \n     government and then keep a chunk of any recovered money. \n     There are an estimated 50 such cases pending against Iraq \n     contractors, including large firms like Halliburton Co.'s \n     Kellogg Brown and Root subsidiary. A technicality in the \n     statute, however, has allowed the Bush administration to \n     prevent the other lawsuits from moving forward. Cases filed \n     under the statute are automatically sealed, which means that \n     they can't proceed to trial--or even he publicly disclosed--\n     until the administration makes a formal decision about \n     whether to join them.\n       The law says such decisions are supposed to be made within \n     60 days, but with the exception of the Custer Battles case, \n     which it declined to join, the administration has yet to take \n     a position on any other suits, some of which were filed more \n     than two years ago. The law allows the Justice Department to \n     ask for extensions, which are almost always granted, for as \n     long as it sees fit. The department has kept the other False \n     Claims Act cases from proceeding by repeatedly asking for \n     extensions in each one.\n       That has left the cases in legal limbo, with lawyers like \n     Mr. Grayson unable to bring them to trial or detail them \n     publicly.\n       Contracting experts says previous administrations often \n     declined to join the False Claims Act lawsuits but that the \n     Bush administration's refusal to unseal the cases is \n     unprecedented. Justice Department spokesman Charles Wilson \n     says he can't discuss sealed cases or comment on why the \n     department has yet to act on them. ``All of the cases are \n     examined on their merits,'' Mr. Wilson says. With the Bush \n     administration sitting on the sidelines, primary \n     responsibility for pursuing the Iraq fraud cases rests with \n     plaintiffs' lawyers like Mr. Grayson, a Harvard-educated \n     lawyer who began his career defending federal contractors but \n     now makes his living going after them.\n       ``With the sheriff asleep in the office, the only way you \n     get justice is with private lawyers like Alan Grayson willing \n     to step up and take down these fraudulent companies,'' says \n     Patrick Burns, the spokesman for the advocacy group Taxpayers \n     Against Fraud. ``Alan Grayson showed that you can do that \n     even without help from the government.''\n       Though it is unclear when the cases will proceed to trial, \n     Mr. Grayson is continuing to press ahead as best he can. He \n     and other lawyers in his firm travel the country taking \n     depositions, gathering documents and interviewing prospective \n     witnesses for the dozens of currently pending lawsuits. Mr. \n     Grayson says he also regularly passes information to the \n     federal investigators probing the cases and the prosecutors \n     deciding whether the government will participate in them.\n       A fierce critic of the war in Iraq, Mr. Grayson drives an \n     aging Cadillac emblazoned with antiadministration bumper \n     stickers such as ``Bush Lied, People Died, ``He says the \n     administration's botched handling of Iraq opened the door \n     for corrupt contractors to improperly reap fortunes there. \n     At a hearing in February 2005 held by Democratic senators, \n     Mr. Grayson asserted that the administration had ``not \n     lifted a finger to recover tens of millions of dollars our \n     whistle-blowers allege was stolen from the government.''\n       His opinions on the matter haven't shifted since. ``The \n     Bush administration has made a conscious decision to sweep \n     the cases under the rug for as long as possible,'' he says \n     today. ``And the more bad news that comes out of Iraq, the \n     more motivation they have to do so.''\n       For the contractors in his cross hairs, Mr. Grayson, 48, is \n     a formidable opponent. He received his undergraduate, \n     master's and law degrees from Harvard. He made millions \n     during a two-year stint as the president of IDT Corp., a \n     start-up that has since grown into one of the nation's \n     largest providers of discount telecommunications services. \n     Mr. Grayson says he has poured hundreds of thousands of \n     personal funds into his small eight-person law firm to help \n     defray the cost of pursuing Iraq fraud cases that may not \n     make it to trial for years. ``I have deep enough pockets to \n     subsidize the legal work,'' he says.\n       If he prevails, he might fill those deep pockets. Whistle-\n     blowers generally receive 30% of any penalty, although the \n     exact portion of every award is set by the judge in each \n     case. Lawyers like Mr. Grayson, in turn, receive 30% to 50% \n     of whatever the whistle-blowers get. ``It's really a \n     financial crapshoot,'' he says.\n       Mr. Grayson's firm switched its focus from working for \n     contractors to representing individual whistle-blowers \n     shortly after U.S. forces swept into Iraq in March 2003. He \n     says the firm made the move because they began to be \n     contacted by whistle-blowers who were referred by former \n     clients and others.\n       Two of his first clients were William D. Baldwin, a former \n     manager for Custer Battles, and Robert J. Isakson, a \n     construction subcontractor who had worked with the firm. The \n     company, run by a pair of politically connected military \n     veterans, had won security contracts in Iraq worth more than \n     $100 million. But the two men told Mr. Grayson that they had \n     evidence the firm was substantially overcharging the U.S. \n     occupation authority.\n       Mr. Grayson filed suit against the company under the False \n     Claims Act in February 2004, but it languished under seal \n     until that fall, when the Justice Department formally \n     declined to join the case. The government never explained its \n     decision. The case finally went before a judge in February.\n       After a contentious three-week trial, a federal jury on \n     March 9 found the company's two founders, along with a \n     business partner, guilty of using fake invoices from shell \n     companies to overcharge the authorities by millions of \n     dollars. The jury ordered the men to pay $10 million in \n     penalties, with Mr. Grayson's clients standing to receive \n     about $3 million of the money. Mr. Grayson declined to say \n     how much money he will be paid. David Douglass, a lawyer for \n     Custer Battles, says the company has appealed the verdict.\n       While waiting for the government to act on the other \n     lawsuits, Mr. Grayson is weighing a career change. HIs \n     congressional district is represented by a conservative \n     Republican, and Mr. Grayson is strongly considering seeking \n     the Democratic nomination to oppose him. He says his \n     campaign, if he chooses to run, would center on the war in \n     Iraq.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n  plea deal shows how businessman rigged bids for rebuilding hillah; \n                   `considered it a free-fraud zone'\n\n                         (By Yochi J. Dreazen)\n\n       In January 2004, Robert Stein, a senior U.S. contracting \n     official in Iraq, sent an unusual email to American \n     businessman Philip Bloom.\n       Mr. Stein wrote that he arranged for a new set of lucrative \n     rebuilding contracts to be awarded to Mr. Bloom, but wanted \n     the businessman to send his bid on the letterhead of a fake \n     company to avoid attracting attention in Baghdad. A few days \n     later, Mr. Bloom replied that he would ``bring with me the \n     dummies . . . I have five dummies per bid.''\n       The emails illustrate how closely U.S. officials on active \n     duty, like Mr. Stein, were willing to work with Mr. Bloom to \n     help him defraud the government through a massive bid-rigging \n     scheme in southern Iraq. They were released yesterday as part \n     of a guilty plea from Mr. Bloom, who admitted to steering $2 \n     million in cash and other bribes to government officials in \n     exchange for $8.6 million in Iraqi construction and \n     demolition contracts. Mr. Bloom--who also admitted to \n     providing the officials with jewelry, first-class plane \n     tickets and sexual favors from women he employed at a villa \n     in Baghdad--faces as long as 40 years in prison and nearly $8 \n     million in penalties.\n       The plea to charges of conspiracy, bribery and money \n     laundering is the latest to emerge from an investigation into \n     alleged corruption by American officials in Hillah, a restive \n     southern city. Mr. Stein, a former civilian occupation \n     official charged with overseeing $82 million in rebuilding \n     funds there, pleaded guilty on Feb. 2 to conspiracy, bribery \n     and using stolen government money to purchase an array of \n     high-powered rifles and grenade launders.\n       Lt. Col. Michael Wheeler and Lt. Col. Debra Harrison, who \n     both worked in Hillah, were arrested late last year and \n     charged with similar offenses; both are free on bond. Lt. \n     Col. Wheeler's attorney didn't return a call; Lt. Col. \n     Harrison declined to comment. Three other military officials \n     are mentioned in the court papers, and law enforcement \n     authorities say more arrests are likely. ``There\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\n     was no oversight anywhere near them at the time and they did \n     not believe they would be caught,'' says Special Inspector \n     General for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen, whose \n     investigators uncovered the ring. ``They considered if a \n     free-fraud zone.''\n       A variety of reports of congressional investigators and the \n     special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction have found \n     evidence that hundreds of millions of dollars were spent \n     without proper authorization, given to contractors who \n     performed shoddy work or paid to firms charging unreasonably \n     high prices. Large sums of money remain unaccounted for, and \n     auditors say they have little sense yet of how much may have \n     been stolen.\n       Previous court filings had detailed the broad outlines of \n     the conspiracy, which continued for almost two years. Mr. \n     Stein and the military officials submitted fake bids from \n     dummy companies for contracts that Mr. Bloom was seeking and \n     then awarded him the work as the low bidder. To evade \n     scrutiny, Mr. Stein--who had the authority to award contracts \n     of as much as $500,000--typically awarded contracts to Mr. \n     Bloom in amounts of as much as $498,900.\n       The new plea offered new evidence of how closely the two \n     men worked. In a separate series of early 2004 emails, Mr. \n     Stein warned the businessman that another U.S. official in \n     Hillah would demand a ``cut'' if he knew about the bid-\n     rigging arrangements. ``The fewer people who know what we are \n     doing the better,'' Mr. Stein wrote. ``I am your partner as \n     you put it so trust in me and what I feel.''\n       Mr. Bloom seemed willing to make Mr. Stein his partner in a \n     formal sense as well, In a Feb. 18, 2004, email, Mr. Bloom \n     told one of his employees that Mr. Stein was the ``vice \n     president of operations'' for the company and should get \n     whatever assistance he asked for. Mr. Stein, then a serving \n     government official, sent a note back asking that the firm's \n     business cards spell his name as Robert because ``it sounds a \n     bit better than `Bob.' ''\n       Mr. Stein, 50, who faces formal sentencing next month, \n     could receive a prison sentence of as long as 30 years, \n     although he is likely to receive far less because of his \n     cooperation with prosecutors.\n       No sentencing hearing has been set yet for Mr. Bloom, 65. \n     He had pleaded guilty in February and been cooperating with \n     prosecutors ever since, although the plea was only unsealed \n     Tuesday. John Nassikas, an attorney for Mr. Bloom, said he \n     had filed court papers asking for home detention during the \n     course of his dealings with the government and hopes Mr. \n     Bloom's ultimate sentence would be reduced because of his \n     cooperation.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This has had an extremely negative impact on our work in \nIraq. This fund was responsible for paying the salaries of hundreds of \nthousands of government employees, such as teachers, health workers, \nand government administrators; it supported the Iraqi defense and \npolice forces; and it helped repair Iraq's dilapidated infrastructure. \nSo the loss of $8.8 billion hurts our mission in Iraq.\n  There is real urgency to the spending issue. On Meet the Press \nrecently, we heard from retired GEN Barry McCaffrey, who just returned \nfrom Iraq and who only last week advised the President and his national \nsecurity team at the White House on the situation in Iraq. He spoke \nabout the importance of spending our resources efficiently on Iraq \neconomic reconstruction. General McCaffrey said:\n\n       Unemployment is a bigger problem than the Iraqi insurgent \n     force. We spent $18 billion on economic reconstruction. There \n     is only $1.6 billion left in the pipeline. When the money \n     runs out, in my judgment, we just lost the war.\n\n  But money on a massive scale--$8.8 billion, as the inspector general \nhas said--has been ``lost into thin air.'' We can't account for it. \nWhile this was not all U.S. money, it symbolizes the magnitude of the \ncorruption we are facing. We don't know where it has gone. Imagine the \ncritical things we could have done with that $8.8 billion to help win \nthe hearts and minds of the Iraqi people. This chart shows what the \nIraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund goes for. I won't read them all, \nbut obviously security and law enforcement, the electric sector--they \nare getting less electricity now than they did before the war started--\noil infrastructure, water resources and sanitation, roads and bridges, \nhealth care, education; all of these things, $8.8 billion could have \ngone for, but it didn't go for that. Where did it go? Well, we just \ndon't know.\n  The State Department's own numbers for this Iraq Relief and \nReconstruction Fund tell us they believe a lot can be done with this \namount of money. It could have paid for all of the security and law \nenforcement training. It could have paid for all of the electric sector \nprograms. The waste of billions of dollars is bad enough, but the \nwidespread corruption is impeding our war effort; it is slowing \nreconstruction efforts; it is denying our troops in the field the \nquality support and equipment they deserve.\n  Just imagine how we could have utilized $8.8 billion to help our \nmilitary in the field. When our administration loses $8.8 billion that \nwas to have gone for reconstruction, then we have to replace that money \nwith our money. The reconstruction is taking place. If we don't restore \nthe unaccounted for money, no other country will. So we have to \nappropriate U.S. taxpayer dollars to fill the void. Let me repeat that. \nBy this loss of $8.8 billion, if we don't account for it and somehow \nrecoup it, the reconstruction effort going forward will be made up by \ntaxpayers' dollars, our taxpayers' dollars.\n  Aside from that, how could we have used $8.8 billion to support our \nown troops? Well, let's take a look at this. Here is the $8.8 billion \nthat we have lost. Equipment maintenance, about $3.2 billion; billeting \nof soldiers, $2.4 billion; body armor, $1.9 billion; special pay for \nhostile fire pay, family separation allowances, hardship duty pay, $1.3 \nbillion. All of it could have been done with the $8.8 billion that is \nlost. Let me repeat: $8.8 billion lost. It is not just a loss to our \nTreasury and the taxpayers, it is as well a loss to our ability to keep \nour own troops sustained.\n  The single most important legal tool that American taxpayers have to \nrecover funds stolen through fraud by U.S. contractors is the False \nClaims Act. Indeed, thanks to this law, more than $17 billion has been \nrecovered on behalf of the American taxpayer. Under the False Claims \nAct, whistleblowers are given a powerful incentive to come forward and \nexpose instances of fraud. The statute allows them to sue contractors \nsuspected of defrauding the government, and then they can keep a \nportion of the recovered funds as a reward.\n  But there is a problem--a big problem. Scores of lawsuits have been \nbrought against contractors suspected of fraud in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nincluding--and I will have more to say about this in a minute--a \nHalliburton subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown, & Root. Yet the Department of \nJustice has allowed only one of those suits to go forward in the \ncourts, and that lawsuit resulted in a major recovery of fraudulently \ncollected payments.\n  Given the massive amount of missing money, you would think that more \nthan just one lawsuit has been filed against corporate contractors. To \nbe sure, there are many more legitimate cases out there. Since 2003, \nthe Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, the U.S. Army \nAudit Agency, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency have all uncovered \ncontracting abuses related to the conflict in Iraq. Auditors of the \nDefense Contract Audit Agency have found that Halliburton has charged \n$1.4 billion in questionable and undocumented costs on just two \ncontracts. The auditors found $813 million in questioned costs under \nHalliburton's Logistic Civil Augmentation Program contract to provide \nsupport services to the troops. So here are two, right here: $813 \nmillion in ``questioned costs'' on Halliburton's--what they call the \nLOGCAP contract, that is for Logistic Civil Augmentation Program; and \n$382 million in ``unsupported costs.'' That is $1.195 billion just to \none company. That is Halliburton. That is Halliburton in ``questioned \ncosts.''\n\n  The auditors at the agency challenged most of these costs as \n``unreasonable in amount'' after completing the audit action because \nthe costs ``exceeded that which would be incurred by a prudent \nperson.'' The auditors also found an additional $442 million in \nHalliburton's charges are ``unsupported.'' As a result, Halliburton's \ntotal ``questioned'' and ``unsupported'' costs exceed $1.4 billion.\n  So if you look here at the audits of Halliburton's Iraq contracts, \nthe ``questioned costs,'' the ``unsupported costs'' under these two \ncontracts, LOGCAP and RIO, if you add them up, combined it is $1.47 \nbillion.\n  What is being done about this? Nothing. Nothing. The Department of \nJustice is doing nothing.\n  There are numerous reports from former top Army contracting \nofficials, from former DOD officials, from soldiers on the ground, and \nfrom former Halliburton and Kellogg, Brown & Root employees as to that \ncompany's waste,\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\nfraud, and abuse--numerous reports. There are reports that Halliburton \ncharged for meals never served, that Halliburton overcharged for oil \nand oil delivery, that Halliburton overcharged and double-charged for \nshipments of soda pop, that Halliburton overcharged on transportation \ncontracts. I could go on and on.\n  But for reasons that I cannot fathom, the Department of Justice has \nnot told Congress or the American taxpayer what it is doing to bring \nthese cases to justice. And it seems as though nothing is being done.\n  I believe we have an obligation to the American taxpayer to be \nprotected against theft or misuse of tax dollars by corrupt \ncontractors. Yet there is no evidence the Justice Department is doing \nanything about it. So absent this information, I can only conclude that \nnothing is being done about this corruption. If this is the case, then \nthe recovery of perhaps billions of dollars in taxpayer money is being \nblocked.\n  While Congress and the American taxpayer remain in the dark about \nwhat the Justice Department is doing to combat contract corruption, \nFalse Claims Act cases continue to languish. The way it works is that \nthe False Claims Act cases are automatically sealed. They cannot go to \ntrial; they cannot be publicly disclosed until the Department of \nJustice makes a decision of whether to join them. Under the statute, \nthese decisions are supposed to be made within 60 days. However, the \nDepartment of Justice is allowed to seek additional time where needed. \nThis is appropriate because a lot of times these cases are very complex \nand require extensive investigation. However, these extensions cannot \nbe allowed to become a form of indefinite delay, stretching out year \nafter year after year. And I fear that is exactly what is happening. As \nI said, with just one exception, the Department of Justice has refused \nto take a position on any of the lawsuits related to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, some of which were filed over 3 years ago. Instead, the \nDepartment files for and receives indefinite extensions.\n  As a result, as I said, with one exception, every single \nwhistleblower lawsuit has been effectively blocked by the Department of \nJustice. Fraud has gone unpunished, billions of taxpayer dollars \ncontinue to be squandered, and courageous whistleblowers who have come \nforward, often at great personal risk, have been left in a sort of \nlegal limbo. As one attorney representing a whistleblower put it:\n\n       The Bush administration has made a conscious decision to \n     sweep the cases under the rug for as long as possible. And \n     the more bad news that comes out of Iraq, the more motivation \n     they have to do so.\n\n  This situation is unacceptable. So my amendment would therefore \nrequire the Justice Department to report to Congress on a semiannual \nbasis the efforts it is undertaking to ensure that it is investigating \nin a timely and appropriate manner all claims of contractor waste, \nfraud, and abuse related to the U.S. Government's activities in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. It would require the Department of Justice to report \non similar executive branch interagency efforts. My amendment would \nprevent the Department of Justice from imposing undue secrecy on false \nclaims civil actions related to Government spending in Iraq and \nAfghanistan by simply requiring the Department of Justice to tell \nCongress what it is doing to combat this corruption. Sharing this \ninformation with Congress is nothing out of the ordinary, but it is \nlong past due. As a matter of good faith to our troops and to the \nAmerican taxpayer, we need to move aggressively against corruption and \nwar profiteering in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. These cases have \ngone on too long.\n  In closing, I quote the British philosopher John Stuart Mill who \nsaid: ``The proper office of a representative assembly is to watch and \ncontrol the government.''\n  Mr. President, hopefully this is a nonpartisan amendment. It is all \nabout enabling Congress to provide meaningful oversight of executive \nbranch activity consistent with our duty to do so under the \nConstitution and the law. It will enable Congress to know the \nadministration's plans for rooting out contractor corruption in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere, and I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6113-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The distinguished Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the pending business is the DOD \nauthorization bill and most specifically the amendments by Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Bill Nelson of Florida. The McConnell amendment \nis to be voted on first, followed by a vote on the second amendment. Am \nI correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4272, as modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I shall address the McConnell amendment.\n  First, the amendments have a great likeness. But I felt, in working \nwith the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, that his amendment--I ask \nunanimous consent that I be a cosponsor of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe very strongly that a second amendment was \nneeded because of what we have been working toward--the United States \nand its coalition partners--from the very beginning, and that is to \nprovide the Iraqi people with a sovereign nation in which they can \nexercise the full range of authorities and responsibilities of a \nsovereign nation. Therefore, they went about a series of elections. \nEvery Member of this Chamber recognizes the courage of the Iraqi people \nin three elections. Then there was the formation of a permanent \ngovernment, a unity government. Having achieved that, they are now \nbeginning to exercise the full responsibilities of a sovereign nation. \nI was concerned that we, as a legislative body of our Nation, not \nindicate that we are infringing on their rights of sovereignty.\n  This whole issue of amnesty is an important one. I do not, in any \nmeasure, suggest it is not important. But I think we have to observe \nthat they are a sovereign nation. How they go about it should largely \nbe within the confines of their own wisdom and goals because our whole \nfuture is dependent on this Government and the people of Iraq taking \nback their country such that our forces can come back home. Whatever \nthat Government does that is constructive toward reaching that goal I \nwant to support. So in working on this amendment, I, working with the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, drafted one or two provisions with \nhim which state as follows:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the goal of the United \n     States and our Coalition partners has been to empower the \n     Iraqi Nation with full sovereignty thereby recognizing their \n     freedom to exercise that sovereignty. Through successive \n     elections and difficult political agreements the unity \n     government is now in place exercising that sovereignty. We \n     must respect that exercise of that sovereignty in accordance \n     with their own wisdom;\n       History records that governments derived of free elections \n     should not grant amnesty to those who have committed war \n     crimes or terrorist acts, and; [further]\n       The United States should continue with the historic \n     tradition of diplomatically, economically, and in a \n     humanitarian manner assisting nations and the people whom \n     have fought once a conflict is concluded.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Virginia yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am happy to yield the floor, if the Senator so desires.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield for a question, I say to my \nfriend from Virginia: Is the Senator from Kentucky correct that the \ngenesis of the Nelson amendment is a newspaper story quoting a lower \nlevel Government official, since dismissed by the Iraqi Government for \nsuggesting that forces who may have killed American or Iraqi troops \nwould be given amnesty? Is it not correct, I ask my friend from \nVirginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that that lower \nlevel official has since been dismissed from the Iraqi Government?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, he was fired.\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. He was fired. Is it not the case, I ask my friend, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, that the National Security \nAdviser, Steve Hadley, if you will, of the Iraqi Government, stated \nshortly thereafter what the policy of the Iraqi Government was?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is exactly correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator from Kentucky not correct that the \npolicy of the Iraqi Government is not to do exactly what we have been \nhaving this discussion about on the Senate floor for lo these several \ndays?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. Based on my discussions with Senator \nNelson, he in good faith read those reports and felt very strongly, as \nI think many of us do, about the issue of amnesty and came forward with \nthat amendment. Then, we purposely delayed final action on these two \namendments last week, such that in the intervening time there would be \nfurther clarification. I do believe there has been some further \nclarification of this matter. I can address that in the context of a \ncommunication from the Department of State, I say to my good friend \nfrom Kentucky. I was able to obtain this information, which hopefully \nwill be forthcoming momentarily, stating just that: The Iraqi \nGovernment understands precisely what the situation is, that an error \nwas made and they have put in place I think adequate corrections.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So I ask one final question of my friend from \nVirginia. Since the Nelson amendment basically addresses a nonexistent \nproblem and the McConnell amendment simply asserts what we already know \nto be the policy of the Iraqi Government, that it would likely be a \ngood idea for the Senate to go on record as supporting both of these \namendments at this juncture?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think, certainly in my judgment, that \nwould be an acceptable situation because there is clarity in the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky about a point that is very \nimportant to me; i.e, sovereignty, exercise of that. With no disrespect \nto the Senator from Florida, I believed his amendment as originally \ndrafted, and the intent, was to reach across the ocean and have the \nU.S.A. reach into the Government and try to dictate what was to be \ndone. So I believe the Senator is correct in that, and I join him in \nthat suggestion to our colleagues.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the Senator yielding the floor?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me add, briefly, as I hear the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, at this juncture the \nappropriate thing for the Senate to do would be to vote for both of \nthese amendments. It has been made perfectly clear, by statements by \nthe National Security Adviser of the new Iraqi Government, that it is \nnot the policy of the Iraqi Government to grant amnesty to those who \nkilled American soldiers.\n  I hope we can move past this reaction to some lower level Iraqi \nofficial, since fired from the Iraqi Government, over his ill-advised \nand basically untrue suggestions about what the policy of the Iraqi \nGovernment would be toward those who may have killed American soldiers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, to answer your question--\nparliamentary inquiry: Under the previous order, I understand 15 \nminutes were allocated to the majority and 15 minutes to the minority. \nSo under the previous order, is that how the Senator from Florida is \nbeing recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is true, in the understanding of this \nSenator, what the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee has said. Over the course of the weekend, as he represented \nit to this Senator, that he wanted to wait and see what further \nclarification has happened on this matter since there was such a \ndisturbance about the language put forth on the amendment by this \nSenator from Florida. Indeed, over the course of the weekend, a number \nof additional things have occurred that have made it quite clear what \nvery likely is the policy of the Government of Iraq. This Senator \nquotes from the Los Angeles Times publication over the weekend:\n\n       The Iraqi government has crafted a far-reaching amnesty \n     plan for insurgents.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The amnesty plan, which apparently would include insurgents \n     alleged to have staged attacks against Americans and Iraqis. \n     . . .\n\n  That doesn't sound to me like the Government of Iraq is disclaiming \nthis, that this is not their policy. To the contrary. The Senator from \nFlorida is quite appreciative of the majority whip when he says they \nare going to support the amendment of the Senator from Florida. I would \ncertainly hope so, given the fact of the tragedy that has been revealed \ntoday. I quote directly from CNN:\n\n       The bodies of two U.S. soldiers found in Iraq Monday night \n     were mutilated and booby trapped, military sources said \n     Tuesday.\n\n  If you turned on the television in the course of the last couple of \nhours, you have heard described in gruesome terms the condition that \nthe bodies of these two young Americans were found in, which was \nunrecognizable because of the mutilation.\n  Is this the kind of stuff that we in any way, in setting forth the \nsense of the Congress, want in any way, any misunderstanding of what \nthe sense of the Congress is, that the policy of the Iraqi Government \nshould not be to grant amnesty to those who would do harm to Americans, \nand have done harm, as witnessed by this most recent tragic example of \nhow people treat prisoners of war?\n  Sadly, I think the facts speak for themselves. Sadly, we could have \ndispensed with this at the hour of 2 o'clock on Thursday, after this \nSenator had offered his amendment. Yet we went on for 2 hours on that \nday and subsequently the next day. It brings us to the following \nTuesday, now, with the comments that have been made, saying that the \nmajority will accept this Senator's amendment.\n  I am grateful to the majority, and I think the majority has come to \nthe right place. I thank you for recognizing this is the statement that \nshould be the policy, as enunciated by the sense of the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was one of those last week who spoke to \nthis amendment by the Senator from Florida. I know now the Senator from \nKentucky, the distinguished majority whip, has introduced another \namendment and has suggested perhaps it would be appropriate to vote for \nboth of them, since what in effect was a misstatement by a low-level \nGovernment employee in Iraq has now been clarified, making it crystal \nclear that it is not the policy of the new Government in Iraq to grant \namnesty to those who have killed Americans.\n  But I have to scratch my head a little bit and wonder why it is we \nare having this debate. We are on the Defense authorization bill, an \nenormously important bill that is being shepherded on the Senate floor \nby the distinguished chairman, for the last time as chairman--at least \nthis will be the last time he will serve as chairman because of term \nlimits on that committee. But we are essentially having a debate over a \nnonissue, and we are being asked now to send a message to the new Iraqi \nGovernment that you are going to be admonished, in effect, because of \nsome of the missteps of a low-level Government employee.\n  I am really confused about the message our friends on the other side \nof the aisle are trying to send our allies in Iraq. On the one hand, we \nhave amendments that are offered suggesting that we leave them in 6 \nmonths' time and bring all of our troops home, and whatever happens as \na result of that, well, it is not our problem anymore; it is their \nproblem. On the other hand, amendments like these suggest that anytime \na low-level government employee misstates the facts and has to be then \ncorrected, and that person is then disciplined through dismissal, do we \nin essence want to pick a fight where there is no fight and where it is \nclear what the policy of the new Iraqi Government is?\n  I think we should give this new Iraqi Government at least the benefit \nof the\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\ndoubt that some would give to Saddam Hussein. There are some who come \nto the Senate floor and say, no, it was a terrible mistake for us to \never go into Iraq notwithstanding the fact that we know that Saddam \nHussein was a mass murderer. I, along with other of my colleagues, have \nstood on the edge of mass gravesites where at least 400,000 Iraqis lie \ndead by the hands of this mass murderer Saddam Hussein.\n  We know the record is clear that al-Qaida in the form of Zarqawi, who \nwas killed just last week, was in Iraq more than 2 years before the \nUnited States and our coalition partners took out Saddam Hussein. There \nare those who said no, no, no. Iraq has no less linkage whatsoever to \ninternational terrorism, and now we know the facts are that the worst \nal-Qaida operative of all, the head of al-Qaida in Iraq, was in fact in \nBaghdad and was in Iraq more than a year before Saddam Hussein was \ndeposed.\n  So I guess I am confused by those who would say, no, let's leave the \nIraqis on their own, wish them luck, but so much for the loss of lives \nand lost treasure invested in trying to help the Iraqi people free \nthemselves from this terrible tyrant and get on their own feet and \ncreate a stable democracy in Iraq. But then, on the other hand, when \nthis new democracy that has done miraculous things over the last few \nyears has ratified their new constitution and created a unity \ngovernment and have now finally gotten their permanent government in \nplace, that when a low-level figure makes an unauthorized, incorrect \nstatement, for which he has been disciplined, we want to come to the \nSenate floor and offer amendments admonishing our friends, the Iraqi \nGovernment. They are our allies in what has now become the central \nfront in the global war on terror.\n  If we don't finish the job and support our Iraqi allies in any way we \ncan as they continue this fight against al-Qaida, against other foreign \nfighters, against insurgents who want to destabilize the government and \nput Saddam Hussein back in power, if we don't do everything we can to \nsupport them militarily and rhetorically provide them any assistance we \ncan, then we are going to be in a less safe condition because we know \nthat any power vacuum that would be created in Iraq would easily be \nfilled as it was in Afghanistan by the likes of Osama bin Laden and \nothers.\n  I appreciate the fact that there are those who say, Well, we ought to \njust vote for both of these amendments. But I really think we are \nheading down a bad road here by slapping the Iraqi Government on the \nwrists for what clearly was a misstatement of a low-level government \nemployee for which he has been disciplined and which has now been very \nmuch clarified that it is not the policy of the Iraqi Government to \nprovide amnesty for those who have killed Americans in that country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. President, first, the distinguished Senator from Florida \nreferred to a Los Angeles Times article. I think that article should be \nplaced in the Record following the colloquy between myself and the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida and the Senator from Texas.\n  Also, I am not sure that we should make decisions here based on one \nreport of one newspaper. I am not impugning the Times; it is an \noutstanding newspaper. But we just do not have any corroboration of \nsome of the statements.\n  I point out they refer to the amnesty plan which currently would \ninclude insurgents alleged to have staged attacks against Americans and \nIraqis.\n  The second sentence down is the reconciliation plan which is expected \nto be formally announced soon. So that plan is in the making. There is \nstill some formulation of policy going on.\n  It is for that reason that I believe a strong vote on both of these \namendments sends a subtle message about our concern. Let us assume for \nthe moment that that plan has not been made formal.\n  I inquired of the Department of State as to whether or not anything \nhad transpired over the weekend. There was one meeting between Prime \nMinister Maliki and the charges d'affaires of the American Embassy. The \ncharges d'affaires reported back to the Department of State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Has the 15 minutes allocated to the Senator from Virginia \nexpired?\n  I ask unanimous consent that both sides be extended 5 minutes in this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. It was stated that there was a meeting between the \ncharges d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy and Prime Minister Maliki on 17 \nJune. Prime Minister Maliki affirmed that any future amnesty would not \ndifferentiate between those who killed Iraqis and those who killed \ncoalition forces. None of these people would be pardoned.\n  Second, Prime Minister Maliki confirmed that there should not be a \nconcern that his reconciliation plan would prohibit Multinational \nForces-Iraqi--MNFI--operations or impose a timeline for future Iraqi \nsupport of the MNFI, the point being that they are looking at this \nsituation.\n  I think that these two amendments will send not a message that \ninvades or impairs their exercise of the right of sovereignty but \nexpresses the concern on behalf of all.\n  The distinguished Senator mentioned the tragic loss of our two \nservicepersons. It has not, to the best of my knowledge, been confirmed \nofficially, but nevertheless earlier media reports the tragic killing \nand mutilation of these two brave American soldiers, which is just an \nexample of the ferocity of this conflict that we are experiencing over \nthere and the enormous risks being taken by the men and women of our \nArmed Forces.\n  So I think the message sent by both of these amendments is a timely \none.\n  I urge Senators to vote for both.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator \nyield for a clarification?\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might on the Senator's time because ours is down to \nabout 1 minute.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I commend the Senator for his \nconcern. He knows my affection for him as chairman of the committee.\n  Indeed, CNN is reporting that it is even worse than we had described \nout here on the destruction of the two soldiers. CNN sources said the \ntwo men had suffered ``severe trauma.''\n  My question to the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee is, in evaluating the McConnell amendment, I am confused by \nthe language under the sense of Congress, paragraph 1, the last \nsentence in the paragraph. I quote: ``We''--meaning the United States--\n``must respect the exercise of the sovereignty''--meaning of Iraq--``in \naccordance with their own wisdom.''\n  The Senator from Florida asks the chairman of the committee: Would we \nrespect their sovereignty if their wisdom said it was their policy to \nhave amnesty against those who would kill Americans?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we should visit that issue only if \nin fact at some point in time that position is made official. The \npurpose of that language--and I accept full responsibility for that \nlanguage--is I feel fervently that the ability for us to conclude our \noperation with our coalition partners in Iraq and to bring our troops \nhome is predicated on the strength of the sovereignty exercised by this \ngovernment.\n  The Senator knows full well as do others in this Chamber that there \nis a high disrespect, unfortunately, among many Iraqis for the United \nStates and its government. If there are any of our fingerprints that we \nare trying to dictate to that sovereign nation how they must make \ndecisions, I fear it could impede the progress to bring our forces \nhome. That is why that is in there.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I respect that. This Senator respects the \ngoals that the Senator from Virginia is stating but I am looking at the \nfour corners of the McConnell amendment to wonder if this is something \nthat the Senate wants to vote for when, in fact, in the sense of \nCongress that is expressed in the McConnell amendment starting on page \n2 at line 15 and ending on page 3 at line 9, there is not any statement \nin the sense of Congress with regard to the policy of not supporting \nthe Iraqi Government if it gives amnesty to people who kill Americans.\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I may call the Senator's attention to page \n1 of the McConnell-Warner amendment. It says:\n\n       Sense of the Congress commending the government of Iraq for \n     affirming its position of no amnesty for terrorists who \n     attack United States Armed Forces.\n\n  Could that be any clearer?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is in the findings as set forth on page 1 \nbut not in the sense of Congress. Is it the Senator's feeling that the \nMcConnell amendment clarifies the language that says with respect to \nthe exercise of sovereignty we must respect the exercise of sovereignty \nin accordance with their own wisdom? Does that clarify it?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am certain that working on the predicate \nthat they are a sovereign nation, they can make decisions. There will \nbe decisions which are inconsistent with the views that we hold in this \ncountry. How do we enforce our views without interfering with their \nsovereignty?\n  First, let them speak with absolute clarity to this. The McConnell \namendment--and the Senator keeps saying within the four corners. Look \nat corner No. 1. The introductory has very clear and expressed language \nagainst the policy.\n  Will there be times that we disagree with their exercise of \nsovereignty and their own wisdom? Yes. But if we are to obtain what we \nhope is our goal of giving that nation its sovereign right, we cannot \nbe dictating to them how they reach their final decision.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Is it not true that the Senator from Florida would fully agree that \nwe want them to have sovereignty and we don't want to dictate to them \nwhat to do, but that his point is, is it not, that we still should \nstrongly urge them not to exercise their sovereignty in a way which \nprovides amnesty in advance since we are in the middle of a war with \npeople who kill American troops? Is that not true? We can urge them \nwithout violating their sovereignty. Would the Senator not agree?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is exactly correct. The amendment \nby this Senator, for which the majority has already said that they are \nurging a vote, will further give specific action; that is, that the \nPresident of the United States should immediately notify the Government \nof Iraq that the Government of the United States opposes granting \namnesty to persons who have attacked members of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States? So we clearly set it out in the amendment offered by \nthis Senator.\n\n  We want to have time for Senator Menendez to speak. How many minutes \ndoes this Senator have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for \nboth yielding time and for the amendment he has offered which I am \nproud to cosponsor with him.\n  I am astonished at some of the debate in the Senate. We are twisting \nand turning not to take a simple position on behalf of the men and \nwomen who serve in the uniform of the United States in Iraq and to send \na message elsewhere in the world. What is that simple position? It is \nthe sense of Congress that the Government of Iraq should not grant \namnesty to persons known to have attacked, killed, or wounded members \nof the Armed Forces of the United States. What is so difficult, what is \nso wrong about sending that message?\n  I heard some of our colleagues say that this is a nonexistent \nproblem. If it wasn't for Senator Nelson's amendment, we would not have \nhad the clarifications that have been forthcoming. I would like to see \nthe Prime Minister of Iraq say that formally, in public, as the \nposition of the Government of Iraq.\n  Then I hear some of our colleagues saying that we have to respect the \nIraqis and their sovereignty. This administration has been telling the \nIraqis from day one what they want them to do in a variety of ways. \nThey have been telling them how they have to form their government, how \ninclusive that government has to be. They have had a whole checklist of \nthings they have been telling the Iraqis they want them to do. And now, \nwhen it comes time to defend the men and women of the United States in \nthe Armed Forces by simply sending a sense of the Senate that we want \nto urge the Government of Iraq not to include in any amnesty plan those \nwho have committed murders of U.S. soldiers or who have injured them, \nwe cannot actually pass a sense of the Senate that says that? This is a \nnonexistent problem?\n  Let me state how nonexistent it is and how important it is to send \nthis message. We woke up to the very sad story of two missing soldiers \nwho were found dead, PFC Kristian Menchaca and PFC Thomas L. Tucker. \nLet me tell the Senate what Private First Class Menchaca's uncle said:\n\n       Don't think that it's just two more soldiers. Don't \n     negotiate anything. They [the killers] didn't. They didn't \n     negotiate it with my nephew. They didn't negotiate it with \n     Tucker.\n\n  And we are concerned about Iraqi sovereignty when we have been \ntelling the Iraqis what we want them to do, but we are so concerned \nabout Iraqi sovereignty that we won't send a sense of the Senate to \nmake it clear for this and any other future Iraqi Government that it is \nthe Senate position that they should not consider amnesty for those \nultimately who have committed the crime of killing American troops? \nThat is beyond my comprehension.\n  It seems to me the reality is we need to make a very clear statement \ntoday, a clear and unequivocal statement of what the position of the \nUnited States is as it relates to the protection of our soldiers and \nour view that no amnesty program should exist now or in the future that \nputs the lives of American soldiers in a position to be bargained for, \nnegotiated for, and given amnesty for. The only way to send that very \nclear, unequivocal message is to support Senator Nelson's amendment.\n  To suggest we are so concerned about their sovereignty and their \nwisdom to the extent we would send a message that you can leave \nAmerican soldiers in harm's way--and yes, we will respect your \nsovereignty. To the extent we won't do anything about you, ultimately, \nconsidering an amnesty plan that would allow the lives of U.S. soldiers \nto be the subject of forgiveness, that is not what I believe the \nAmerican people want to see. That is certainly not honoring the lives \nof those who gave their lives on behalf of their country or honoring \ntheir families. Only Senator Nelson's amendment does that.\n  It should be strong. It should be bipartisan. It should be unanimous.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to Senator Nelson.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, how many minutes remain for the \nmajority and minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, and the \nSenator from Virginia has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are bringing this in for \nlanding. I ask the distinguished chairman of the committee, had there \nbeen discussions on the floor during this debate about the \nclarification of the McConnell amendment by the words ``in accordance \nwith their own wisdom''?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my friend at this point in time \nthat we believe the amendment speaks for itself. The first section of \nthe amendment cites a sense of the Congress commending the Government \nof Iraq for affirming its position of no amnesty for terrorists who \nattack U.S. Armed Forces. What could be clearer than that? That sets \nthe tone and the thrust for the entire amendment.\n  I have said to my colleagues, it seems to me, in the spirit of \ncomity, we have had a good debate, we have seen some further \nclarification of this issue in the time that has evolved since Thursday \nand today; secondly, assuming time is a measure of accuracy, this \npolicy is undergoing evaluation in Iraq right now.\n  These two amendments, side by side, receiving a strong vote of the \nSenate, should suffice in the mission the Senator from Florida set out \non and on which I join him.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in light of the fact that this \nSenator only had 2 minutes to close, I ask unanimous consent that each \nside have 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. An objection is heard to a closing in which I \njust\n\n[[Page S6117]]\n\ngranted part of my time to the Senator from Virginia, the chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Armed Services?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Some of us have other things to do.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am quite surprised. Sadly, on a day in which \ntwo more Americans have been mutilated, sadly, on a day in which the \nCNN story is quoting a claim posted on a Web site that our soldiers \nwere slaughtered ``in accordance to God's will,'' and given the fact \nthat it is pretty clear the amendment of this Senator sets forth the \npolicy that it is the sense of the Congress that the Government of Iraq \nshould not grant amnesty to persons who kill Americans, I think it is \nself-evident.\n  I thank the Senator for sharing these thoughts.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to the \nMcConnell amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the two managers have been working with \nMembers. We have reconciled a series of amendments, and I believe at \nthis point in time I will make the following statement: I have sent a \nseries of amendments to the desk which have been cleared by myself and \nthe ranking member. I ask, therefore, unanimous consent that the Senate \nconsider these amendments en bloc, the amendments be agreed to, and \nmotions to reconsider be laid on the table. Finally, I ask that any \nstatements relating to any of these individual amendments be printed at \nthis point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object because the amendments have been cleared on our side, I \nwould suggest that if we have a moment here, after the UC is accepted, \nwe read the list of the amendments so people will know their amendments \nare in here. But if the leaders are ready to send us forward on our \nnext mission, then I would withdraw that suggestion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we first ask that you act on the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4308\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for expansion of the Junior Reserve Officers' \n                        Training Corps program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EXPANSION OF JUNIOR RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretaries of the military \n     departments shall take appropriate actions to increase the \n     number of secondary educational institutions at which a unit \n     of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps is organized \n     under chapter 102 of title 10, United States Code.\n       (b) Expansion Targets.--In increasing under subsection (a) \n     the number of secondary educational institutions at which a \n     unit of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps is \n     organized, the Secretaries of the military departments shall \n     seek to organize units at an additional number of \n     institutions as follows:\n       (1) In the case of Army units, 15 institutions.\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\n       (2) In the case of Navy units, 10 institutions.\n       (3) In the case of Marine Corps units, 15 institutions.\n       (4) In the case of Air Force units, 10 institutions.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4299\n\n  (Purpose: To require a report on the feasibility of establishing a \n scholarship or fellowship program to educate future nuclear engineers \n             at the postsecondary and postgraduate levels)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XXXI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3121. EDUCATION OF FUTURE NUCLEAR ENGINEERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense and the United States depend \n     on the specialized expertise of nuclear engineers who support \n     the development and sustainment of technologies including \n     naval reactors, strategic weapons, and nuclear power plants.\n       (2) Experts estimate that over 25 percent of the \n     approximately 58,000 workers in the nuclear power industry in \n     the United States will be eligible to retire within 5 years, \n     representing both a huge loss of institutional memory and a \n     potential national security crisis.\n       (3) This shortfall of workers is exacerbated by reductions \n     to the University Reactor Infrastructure and Education \n     Assistance program, which trains civilian nuclear scientists \n     and engineers. The defense and civilian nuclear industries \n     are interdependent on a limited number of educational \n     institutions to produce their workforce. A reduction in \n     nuclear scientists and engineers trained in the civilian \n     sector may result in a further loss of qualified personnel \n     for defense-related research and engineering.\n       (4) The Department of Defense's successful Science, Math \n     and Research for Transformation (SMART) scholarship-for-\n     service program serves as a good model for a targeted \n     scholarship or fellowship program designed to educate future \n     scientists at the postsecondary and postgraduate levels.\n       (b) Report on Education of Future Nuclear Engineers.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary of Energy shall study the \n     feasibility and merit of establishing a targeted scholarship \n     or fellowship program to educate future nuclear engineers at \n     the postsecondary and postgraduate levels.\n       (2) Report required.--The President shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees, together with the budget \n     request submitted for fiscal year 2008, a report on the study \n     conducted by the Secretary of Energy under paragraph (1).\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4349\n\n  (Purpose: To require a National Academy of Sciences study on human \n    exposure to contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune, North \n                               Carolina)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 352.

Mr. President, I am pleased that my amendment to \nsupport military families was accepted today by the Senate by unanimous \nconsent to S. 2766, the National Defense Authorization Act of fiscal \nyear 2007. Let me begin by thanking my good friend, the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, who joined me last year in introducing the \nlegislation upon which this amendment is based, S. 1888, the Military \nFamily Support Act. His advocacy for this issue and for the families of \nour men and women in uniform is greatly appreciated. I would also like \nto recognize Senator Dayton, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Murray for \ntheir support for this amendment. Of course, the Senate and our Nation \nbenefit greatly from the leadership on national defense issues of the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, chairman of the\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee, and the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin. I thank them both and their staff for their assistance with this \namendment.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the cooperation of Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Government Affairs Committee Chairwoman Collins and \nRanking Member Lieberman and the expertise of their staff. They were \nvery helpful in the process that has led to this amendment, and I \nappreciate their assistance.\n  At about this time last year, I was contacted by a group of \nVermonters who were trying to help their coworkers with family members \nserving in Iraq as part of the Vermont National Guard. I was impressed \nby the generosity of Vermonters who wanted to do all they could to help \nease the strains of military deployments felt by their friends and \nneighbors. I was also reminded of how a family's day-to-day life is \ndisrupted by a deployment of a loved one overseas.\n  This amendment calls for two pilot programs to help with family \ndisruptions due to an overseas deployment. The first pilot program, \nadministered by the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, would \nauthorize Federal employees who have been designated by a member of the \nArmed Forces as ``caregivers'', as defined by the Department of \nDefense, DOD, to use their leave in a more flexible manner. No new \nleave would be given to any employees. This amendment simply makes \nleave already available more useful during stressful times for military \nfamilies. The second pilot program allows the Department of Labor, DOL, \nto solicit businesses to voluntarily take part in a program to offer \nmore accommodating leave to their employees. This amendment does not \ninclude in its scope the Family Medical Leave Act, FMLA, and it does \nnot require any private sector entity to participate.\n  Mr. President, in closing, this amendment aims to make life a little \neasier for those who are already giving so much to our country and to \ntheir communities.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and this amendment be sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am \nwondering whether we have an order here where we are alternating and, \nif so, what the situation is.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would respond that we have concluded all \nthe work at the moment. I believe our leaders are working out a \nprocedure by which the minimum wage amendments are being addressed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder, as the alternative now comes to us, whether we \ncould let Senator Harkin first go before Senator Enzi. On the other \nhand, if it is your turn in rotation, then we would have no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this moment I think there has been a \nrequest to go off of our bill. Is that the request of the Senator from \nWyoming?\n  Mr. ENZI. No, Mr. President. Senator Kennedy filed an amendment that \ndealt with the minimum wage. I actually won't send mine to the desk \nright now, but I would like to comment on that right now.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is quite correct, quite correct. We will \nremain on the bill for the purpose of debate on such amendments \nrelative to minimum wage that may be brought forward, correct. Senator \nKennedy's is at the desk and you wish to speak to it?\n  Mr. ENZI. That is correct. Of course, I am going to ask that he \nwithdraw that amendment and I do not propose my amendment because they \ndon't have to do with the Department of Defense authorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator request to set aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator withdraws his request to do that but requests \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I know that some people who are following \nthis debate might be wondering how the minimum wage relates to \nlegislation that authorizes national security programs in the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Energy for the next year, \nand that is certainly a valid question. The answer is: It doesn't.\n  The underlying legislation the Senate has been considering for over a \nweek is of tremendous importance to our national security. The bill is \nbipartisan and was reported out of committee unanimously. As those of \nus who chair committees know, it isn't easy to obtain unanimous \nbipartisan support for legislation. Chairman Warner and Ranking Member \nLevin worked hard to achieve this feat because the subject of the bill \nis so critically important. Now I believe we owe it to them, as well as \nto our constituents and every American, to give this national security \nlegislation swift consideration so that it can become law.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Kennedy has the opposite effect. It \nwill slow this bill down because it is an entirely different subject \nthan the underlying bill. It will take up valuable debate time that \nshould be spent on the bill's national security provisions. Should it \nbe adopted, the Kennedy amendment would become a thorny issue for the \nconference committee, and that will further slow down the bill's \nenactment.\n  Even more frustrating, the issue Senator Kennedy is raising has been \nconsidered and voted on by the Senate four times already in this \nCongress. We voted on the majority and minority plans to raise the \nminimum wage twice. We voted on the two of them in March, and we voted \non them in November. Now, both times, no proposal succeeded.\n  Amendments offered by the Senate must comply with certain budget \nrules which, as a member of the Budget Committee, I fully support. \nAmendments that constitute an unfunded mandate are subject to a point \nof order which can only be waived with a vote of 60 Senators. Not 1 of \nthe 4 minimum wage amendments has received 60 votes in the Senate this \nCongress. Yet here we are again, facing the same situation, using up \ntime on the Defense bill. The outcome is likely to be the same as it \nwas the last four times we voted. Knowing this, I find it difficult to \nunderstand why those on the other side of the aisle want to bring it up \nagain on this critically important national security bill.\n  Let us not misuse the time we should be spending debating our \nnational security priorities for the next year by repeating votes that \nalready occurred four times in this Congress. Instead, let's focus on \nhow we should prepare for the many threats we face as a nation. The \ngood men and women who work for the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Energy need our authorization and our guidance to move \nforward with their activities that keep us safe. We have always done it \nbefore we do the appropriations on those budgets. We should not let \nthem down. We should not let the American people down.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not to divert \nthis debate on to an entirely unrelated matter, the outcome of which is \nclearly determinable. So I urge my colleague, Senator Kennedy, to \nwithdraw his amendment. I would add that if he does not, I am plenty \nwilling to have the debate again. We want to have the American public \nmaking as much money as possible.\n  I would rise in opposition to the amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy that would increase the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 over 26 \nmonths, which amounts to a 41-percent increase. My amendment would \nraise the minimum wage by $1.10 in two 55-cent steps over 18 months. \nBut, more important than the numbers, only my amendment recognizes the \nenormous burdens a mandate such as this would place on the backs of \nAmerica's small businesses.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has previously referred to the \neconomic effect of the minimum wage proposal as a drop in the bucket in \nthe national payroll. Comments such as this are\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\nprecisely why small business owners across the Nation believe that \nWashington, DC, politicians do not understand their needs. We must \nalways bear in mind that these are the people who create jobs that \nprovide an increasing percentage of employment for all workers, \nincluding those entering the workforce for the first time and those who \nmost need to acquire job skills. Those businesses train people with no \nskills. We are not talking minimum wage; we are talking minimum skills. \nAnd a lot of the small businesses that employ people at a minimum wage \nhire them at a minimum wage with no skills. As they get skills, which \nin many of those businesses occur in the first month they are hired, \nthey go above the minimum wage to other levels, and as quickly as they \nlearn other skills, they get paid more money or they go elsewhere, \nwhich is another option.\n  It is particularly offensive to those employers doing that training \nto suggest that a 41-percent increase in their labor costs amounts to a \ndrop in the bucket. A 41-percent increase in labor costs forces a small \nbusinessperson to face difficult choices such as whether to increase \nprices, which they usually can't do or face a potential loss of \ncustomers because they raise the price, or whether to reduce spending \non health insurance coverage or other benefits for their employees or, \nthe worst of all possibilities, to terminate employees. These choices \nare far more significant than a drop in the bucket.\n  Apart from its failure to mitigate the cost of this mandate for small \nbusinesses, Senator Kennedy's amendment also fails to address the root \nof the problem for our lowest paid workers. Congress, by simply \nimposing an artificial wage increase, will not meaningfully address the \nreal issue of the lowest paid workers. Regardless of the size of any \nwage increase Congress might impose, the reality is that yesterday's \nlowest paid worker, assuming he or she still has any job, will continue \nto be tomorrow's lowest paid worker as well. There is a spiral effect \nto these increases when we do them because everybody all up the chain \nhas to have an increase to stay ahead of those with no skills. There \nare even union agreements that are tied to raises in the minimum wage, \nwhich is probably a bigger reason we debate the minimum wage on such a \nfrequent basis around here.\n  But if everybody gets a raise, something has to happen to cover the \ncost of that raise. As I mentioned, you either eliminate employees so \nthat you are increasing productivity to handle the same thing or you \nare raising the price. If you raise the price, you create inflation. If \nyou create inflation, what they were able to buy for minimum wage today \nthey can't afford for tomorrow's minimum wage because the price went \nup. So a false economy of just demanding by Congress that everybody do \nthis really doesn't affect the economy the way we think it will. The \nway that you do that is advancement on the job and earned wage growth. \nEarned wage growth cannot be legislated. We do a disservice to all \nconcerned, most especially the chronic low-wage worker, to suggest that \na Federal wage mandate is the answer.\n\n  What we need to focus on is not an artificially imposed number but \nthe acquisition and improvement of job and job-related skills. In this \ncontext we should recognize that only 68 percent of the students \nentering the ninth grade 4 years ago--68 percent of the students \nentering the ninth grade 4 years ago are expected to graduate this \nyear. Do you know what kind of a job you get if you don't graduate from \nhigh school? Well, 68 percent of the kids who entered 4 years ago--not \nall of them--are going to graduate. For minority students this number \nhovers around 50 percent. In addition, we continue to experience a \ndropout rate of 11 percent a year. These noncompletion and dropout \nrates and the poor earning capacity that comes with them cannot be \nfixed by a Federal minimum wage policy.\n  I was in a retail store the other day. I noticed some of the skills \nhave deteriorated to the point where the person at the cash register \ncan't figure out the dollars themselves. I remember when cash registers \nin stores didn't tell you how much change you had to give the person. \nYou had to figure it out, and kids and adults did that. But there are \nerrors with that, so modern machines took up the disadvantage that was \ncaused by that and we now have cash registers that figure the change \nfor you.\n  But watch out if you ever change the way you give them the money \nafter they figured it on the computer cash register.\n  Have you ever had a bill for $10.81 and you gave the clerk $11 and \nthen you gave them a penny? That is no skills, if they can't figure out \nthey owe you the 20 cents. No skills. That is what the retailers out \nthere are training people on--basic, rudimentary things for having a \njob. We don't fix those by legislating.\n  If we are going to meaningfully address the issue of low-wage workers \nwe have to acknowledge that you do not do that by simply passing a wage \nlaw. If that were the case, we could pass a law that made the minimum \nwage $20 or $50 or $100 an hour. It is just not that simple. In my own \nState of Wyoming, Governor Freudenthal, a Democrat, this year, in \nspeaking about legislation to raise the minimum wage from the current \n$5.15, noted that the real question is how do you enable a worker to \nbecome more qualified and thereby able to earn a higher wage? He noted:\n\n       How do you make the individual more valuable in the \n     marketplace and demand a higher wage? It's not simply how do \n     you pass a law.\n\n  As I mentioned, the Governor of Wyoming is a Democrat, one who \nunderstands the reality of this issue in the workplace and the job \nmarket. Low wages may be the effect; low job skills are the cause. \nRaising the minimum wage does absolutely nothing to enhance job skills \nfor low-wage workers. In fact, to the extent it makes entry into the \nworkforce more difficult, and increases low-skilled unemployment, as a \nminimum wage hike without economic relief for small business will \nunquestionably do, it will have precisely the opposite effect.\n  If we are able to approach this debate in a candid and constructive \nway, we need to acknowledge certain basic principles of economics. \nFirst of all, wages do not cause sales. Sales are needed to produce \nrevenue. And wages don't cause revenue. Revenue drives wages.\n  Wages can cause productivity, but the productivity has to come first \nto be able to afford the wages. Wages have to be paid for.\n  Skills, however, operate differently than wages do. Skills do create \nsales. Sales do produce revenue. Skills do create productivity. And \nhere is the most important part--skills get compensated with higher \nwages or else the employee goes somewhere else to get true higher wages \nto compensate for their increased skills. There is a relationship \nbetween skill and how much you make. Dropouts will not make as much as \ncollege graduates. Dropouts will not make as much as someone who has \nbeen to a technical school. Dropouts will have minimum skills.\n  Some people who finish school have minimum skills. I know my dad, \nonce, when he was interviewing a person, said the person told him he \nhad 5 years' experience. My dad, after questioning him, said: \nUnfortunately, he had 1 month of experience 60 times.\n  Wage increases without increased sales or higher productivity, which \nare a result of more skills, have to be paid for with higher prices. \nHigher prices wipe out wage increases. Better skills, not artificial \nwage increases, produce true net gains in income.\n  We also need to focus on the goal that the minimum wage should be for \nall workers and what it is for most, which is a starting point in an \nindividual's lifelong working career if they are not skilled.\n  Let me say that again. We need to focus on the goal that minimum wage \nshould be for workers who need a starting point in an individual's \nlifelong working career because they are not skilled. If viewed as a \nstarting point, it is clear the focus needs to be far less on where an \nindividual begins in his or her work career and far more on how an \nindividual can progress--get jobs that have the potential for increase, \nget jobs that teach skills. They are available.\n  I always have to mention this. Right now in Wyoming, which is the \nleast populated State in the Nation, we have a huge shortage of \nworkers. There is a huge shortage of workers. Are these good jobs? Yes, \nthey are good jobs.\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\nThey are in the coal mines. We ship a third of the Nation's coal out of \nmy county. It is clean coal and it is open-pit mining. We use huge \ntrucks. You could only fit two trucks in this whole room and that would \nbe a pretty tight squeeze. The top of it would probably touch the top \nof the roof. They are big trucks. We are having trouble getting drivers \nfor the trucks.\n  The only requirement for being a driver on one of these trucks is to \nbe able to drive and have a clean drug record--be able to pass a drug \ntest. When you drive one of these trucks, once you get up to elevation \nand get in the driver's chair, there are antivibration seats, power \nsteering, air-conditioned cabs. That great big vehicle is easy to \ndrive.\n  What do you get paid for driving it? The starting salary is about \n$60,000, and they train you, provided you have this clean drug record--\n$60,000 a year. We are having trouble getting people to come to Wyoming \nto work for $60,000 a year. So it isn't always minimum wage that \ndrives these things. Skills are important, but you can even get the \nskills if you look for the jobs that pay well.\n\n  They may be nontraditional jobs. We have a lot of women who are \ndriving coal haul trucks. They can do it very capably and probably with \nfewer accidents than the men.\n  The truth is, real wage growth happens every day. It is not the \nfunction of Government to mandate it. It is the direct result of an \nindividual becoming more skilled and therefore more valuable to his or \nher employer. As a former small business owner, I know these entry-\nlevel jobs are a gateway to the workforce and an opportunity for \nworkers to begin to acquire the skills and experience they need. These \nentry-level jobs can open the door for better jobs and better lives for \nlow-skilled workers--if we give them the tools they need to succeed.\n  We have a great example in Cheyenne, WY. Workers entering the job \nmarket were given the tools and the opportunity to reach the American \ndream. We have a man there named Mr. Jack Preiss, and he is the owner \nof eight McDonald's in Wyoming. We often talk about McDonald's and \nminimum wage.\n  I want to tell you he has had three employees who started working at \nMcDonald's at minimum wage who now own a total of 20 McDonald's \nrestaurants. They own them. This type of wage progression and success \nshould be the norm for workers across the country. However, there are a \nsmall percentage of workers who have not acquired the necessary work-\nbased skills and for whom stagnation at the lower tier wage is a longer \nterm proposition. The answer for these workers, however, is not to \nsimply raise the lower wage rung. Rather, these individuals have to \nacquire the training, experience, and skills that will lead to \nmeaningful and lasting wage growth. Our policies ought to be directed \nat that end.\n  We have to equip our workers with the skills they need to compete in \na technology-driven global economy. It is estimated that 60 percent of \ntomorrow's jobs will require skills that only 20 percent of today's \nworkers possess.\n  It is also estimated that graduating students will likely change \ncareers 14 times in their lives. You didn't hear me say change jobs 14 \ntimes in their lives. That is easy. I said change careers 14 times in \ntheir lives.\n  Here is the important part of that statistic. The world is changing \nso fast that 10 of those jobs don't even exist today. They are going to \nhave 14 career changes, 10 of which are for jobs that don't even exist \ntoday. We have to do a better job of educating and training our youth \nto be able to take the kind of jobs we are going to have.\n  We need a system in place that can support a lifetime of education, \ntraining, and retraining of our workers. The end result will be the \nattainment of skills that will provide meaningful wage growth. As \nlegislators, our efforts are better focused on ensuring that the tools \nand opportunities for training and enhancing skills over a worker's \nlifetime are available and fully utilized--more available and fully \nutilized than we are in imposing an artificial wage increase that fails \nto address the real issues and in the process does more harm than good. \nSkills and experience, not an artificial wage hike, will lead to \nlasting wage security for American workers.\n  As chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \none of my priorities is reauthorizing and improving the Nation's job \ntraining system that was created by the Workforce Investment Act. This \nlaw would help provide American workers with the skills they will need, \nnew skills to compete in a global economy. Those are ones that will \nlead to real, not artificial wage increases.\n  Last Congress--this is 3 years ago--I was denied the appointment of a \nconference committee to resolve the differences with the House on this \nimportant bill by some of the very people who are proposing this \nminimum wage increase. This Congress, this important bill has faced the \nsame obstruction. In November of last year we reported this legislation \nout of the HELP Committee by unanimous voice vote. Yet it continues to \nlanguish, unavailable for debate on the floor of this Congress, with no \nprogress being made and little hope for action in this Congress if such \nobstruction continues. This bill would train an estimated 900,000 \npeople a year to higher skilled jobs--900,000 people a year could be on \na better career path, could have more skills. That would be a real \nimprovement for chronic low-wage workers.\n  It makes little sense to me that some of the same people who denied \nthe opportunity in the last Congress to enact real improvement now \nthink a redetermination of the lowest wage will magically change \neveryone's life. If we truly want to change and improve the lives of \nour lowest paid workers, we must pass the Workforce Investment Act.\n  Let's be clear about what a minimum wage hike will and will not do. \nFirst, we must realize that large increases in the minimum wage will \nhurt low-income, low-skilled individuals. Mandated hikes in the minimum \nwage do not cure poverty, and they clearly do not create jobs. The \nCongressional Budget Office has said:\n\n       Most economists would agree that an increase in the minimum \n     wage rate would cause firms to employ fewer low-wage workers \n     or employ them for fewer hours.\n\n  That is a CBO estimate from October 18, 1999.\n  What every student who has ever taken an economics course knows is \nthat if you increase the cost of something--in this case a minimum wage \njob--you decrease the demand for those jobs. Misleading political \nrhetoric cannot change the basic principle of supply and demand. The \nmajority of economists continue to affirm the job-killing nature of the \nmandated wage increases. A recent poll concluded that 77 percent or \nnearly 17,000 economists believe that a minimum wage hike causes job \nloss.\n  It is kind of a spiral that we get into.\n  We simply cannot assume that a business that employs 50 minimum wage \nworkers before the wage increase is enacted will still employ 50 \nminimum wage workers, whether the business is in Washington, Wyoming, \nor Massachusetts. Employers can't absorb an increase in their cost \nwithout a corresponding decrease in the number of jobs or benefits they \ncan provide workers. We know there are losers when we raise the minimum \nwage. But who are the individuals who will benefit?\n  Minimum wage earners who support a family solely based on the wage \nare actually pretty few and far between. Fully 85 percent of the \nminimum wage earners live with their parents, have a working spouse, or \nare living alone without children.\n  Of the minimum wage earners, 41 percent live with a parent or \nrelative, 23 percent are single or the sole breadwinner of the \nhousehold with no children, and 21 percent live with another wage \nearner.\n  All are low-skilled workers or brandnew employees. In a shoe store \nyou might have the lowest-skilled people unpacking the shoes. By the \ntime they can check inventory and correctly put it on the shelf so they \ncan find the size when the customers come in, they get a raise. If they \ncan actually wait on a customer--that is kind of the goal in most \nbusinesses, to be able to wait on a customer--that is another level of \nwage increase. The better they do waiting on customers--which is the \nimportant part in the business--the more they get paid.\n  Research shows that the poor targeting and other unintended \nconsequences of the minimum wage make\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\nit a terribly ineffective approach to reducing poverty in America--the \nintended purpose of the policy. In fact, two Stanford University \neconomists concluded that a minimum wage increase is paid for by higher \nprices that hurt poor families the most.\n  A 2001 study conducted by Stanford University economists found that \nonly one in four of the poorest 20 percent of families would benefit \nfrom an increase in the minimum wage. The way to truly improve the \nwages and salaries of these American workers is through education and \ntraining--not an artificial wage increase.\n  With these realities in mind, I will offer an amendment, unless \nSenator Kennedy wishes to withdraw his amendment. We can go on with the \nDefense debate. There must be serious discussion on that possibility. \nSo I will allow that to go on and make a few more comments.\n  But I am considering offering an amendment that recognizes the true \ncost of the minimum wage increase on American workers and businesses, \nand particularly small businesses.\n  My amendment includes a minimum wage increase of $1.10, and it also \naddresses other needs for reform and the needs of small businesses that \ncreate the most jobs in this country. Therefore, my amendment is \nprotective of economic growth and job creation.\n  Let me turn to a brief review of the provisions that would be \ncontained in my amendment. In doing so, we must bear in mind that small \nbusinesses continue to be the engine that drives our economy and the \ngreatest single source of job creation. Any wage increase imposed on \nsmall businesses poses difficulties for that business owner and, more \nimportantly, for his or her employees.\n  My amendment recognizes this reality and provides a necessary measure \nof relief for these small business employers.\n  My amendment would make the following changes that are critical, \nparticularly for small business. The first one is updating the small \nbusiness exemption.\n  Having owned a small business in Wyoming, I can speak from personal \nexperience about how difficult any minimum wage increase is for small \nbusinesses at the low end of the scale level and job growth.\n  Small businesses generate 70 percent of new jobs. Since the negative \nimpact of a minimum wage increase will affect small businesses most \ndirectly, we have proposed addressing the small business threshold \nwhich is set under current law at $.5 million. If the original small \nbusiness threshold enacted in the 1960s--that is when we came up with \nthis arbitrary number, in the 1960s--if it were to be adjusted for \ninflation, it would amount to over $.5 million.\n  The small business threshold was last adjusted 15 years ago. In those \nensuing years since the national minimum wage rate has been hiked, the \neconomy has undergone a dramatic change, and the way work is done in \nthis country has changed forever.\n  The pending amendment raises that threshold for small business \ndetermination to $1 million to reflect these changes.\n  My amendment also incorporates bipartisan technical corrections that \nwere originally proposed in 1990 by then Small Business Committee \nChairman Dale Bumpers, Democrat from Arkansas, and cosponsored over the \nyears by Senator Reid, now the Democratic leader, Senator Harkin, \nSenator Pryor, Senator Mikulski, Senator Baucus, Senator Kohl, and \nothers. Those Senators can attest to the Department of Labor's \ndisregard of the will of Congress and interpreted the existing small \nbusiness threshold to have little or no meaning. The Labor Department \nwould make a Federal case out of the most trivial paperwork infraction \nby the smallest small business because of what it interpreted as a \nloophole in the law.\n  Some would say that the 1989 bill to hike the minimum wage and the \nsmall business threshold was inartfully drafted and permitted this \nresult. Others say the Department is misreading the clear language of \nthe statute.\n  Regardless, the fact is that a threshold enacted by Congress is not \nproviding the balance and fairness that was intended. This amendment \ncorrects the problem by stating clearly that the wage and overtime \nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act apply to employees working \nfor enterprises engaged in commerce or engaged in the production of \ngoods for commerce. My amendment also applies those wage and hour \nworker safeguards to home-work situations.\n  Second, ensuring procedural fairness for small business: This next \nprovision is just common sense and good government legislation.\n  Surely, we can all agree that small business owners--the individuals \nwho do the most to drive our economy forward--deserve a break the first \ntime they make an honest paperwork mistake when no one is hurt and the \nmistake was corrected.\n  Let me say that again.\n  Surely, we can all agree that small business owners-- the individuals \nwho do the most to drive our economy forward--deserve a break the first \ntime they make an honest paperwork mistake where no one is hurt and the \nmistake is corrected.\n\n  Small business owners told me over and over again how hard they try \nto comply with all the rules and regulations imposed on them, mostly by \nthe Federal Government. As a former owner of small business myself, I \nknow what they mean. Yes, for all that work, a government inspector can \nfine a small business owner for paperwork violations alone, even if the \nbusiness has a completely spotless record and the employer immediately \ncorrects the unintentional mistake. Even the best intentioned employer \ncan get caught in the myriad of burdensome paperwork requirements \nimposed on them by the Federal Government. And I will even go so far as \nto say a lot of times the paperwork isn't clear, because I have filled \nout a lot of those documents.\n  To comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act, sometimes we use \nsomething for insurance that deals with health, and the questions can't \nbe the same.\n  So there are a lot of possibilities unless you follow the manual very \nclosely. And small businesses don't have time to do that because they \nare trying to make a living for themselves and their employees.\n  There are a lot of opportunities out there which the Federal \nGovernment gives them to make paperwork mistakes that really don't \naffect anybody. But if we have enough people working in the Federal \nbureaucracy to check and see if all the t's are crossed and all the i's \nare dotted, we can find some mistakes, particularly if that person only \nhas to concentrate on one document. The small business owner has dozens \nthat he has to comply with.\n  The owners of small businesses are not asking to be excused from any \nobligations or regulations, but they feel they deserve a break if they \npreviously complied perfectly with the law. Small business men and \nwomen who are first-time violators of paperwork reduction deserve some \nprotection.\n  The third part of the bill would provide regulatory relief for small \nbusinesses.\n  As any increase in the minimum wage places burdens on small \nemployers, it is only fair to simultaneously address the ongoing \nproblem of agencies not fully complying with the congressional \ndirective contained in the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act.\n  That is a mouthful.\n  Under the law, agencies are required to publish small entity \ncompliance guidelines for those rules that require a regulatory \nflexibility analysis. Unfortunately, agencies have either ignored this \nrequirement or when they tried to comply have not done so fully or \ncarefully.\n  My amendment does this by including specific provisions that the \nGovernment Accountability Office has suggested to improve the clarity \nof the requirement.\n  The fourth thing it would do is remove the barriers to flexible time \narrangements.\n  My amendment includes legislation that could have a monumental impact \non the lives of thousands of working men and women and families in \nAmerica.\n  This legislation would give employees greater flexibility in meeting \nand balancing the demands of their work and family.\n  We came up with an idea like this, and it is real important to pay \nattention to it. We stole it from the Federal\n\n[[Page S6127]]\n\nGovernment. The Federal Government imposes this on agencies. The \nFederal Government says you are going to give the employees \nflexibility.\n  The first time I ever heard of this was in Wyoming. Some people in \nWyoming are married to people that work for the government, probably \nnot nearly as strange as out here. Out here, I think a lot of people \nwho work in government are married to people who work in government. \nBut out there, a lot of people who are working in government are \nmarried to people who aren't working in government.\n  We give this benefit to government employees--being able to have a \nlittle flex in their time. But we prohibit it in the private sector. We \nsay you cannot do this even though we let the government folks do this. \nThere, it would be a bad idea for your employees. We don't want you to \nhave any flexibility. We know both the Federal employee and the private \nemployee would like to watch their kids play soccer. The private \nemployee better have his soccer schedule done so he doesn't need any \nflextime. But the government worker ought to be able to take it \nwhenever they feel like it and trade it around.\n  We give the Federal Government the kind of flex I am talking about in \nthis bill. Particularly in a family where the private employee is \nmarried to a government employee, they do not understand why they \ncannot have the same right as the government employee. They can bank a \nfew hours and have a little longer weekend the next weekend, all in the \nsame pay period. Their spouse can do it. They can have a little longer \nweekend. They can go use the boat over the longer weekend, but for the \none that works for private industry it would be illegal. You cannot do \nthat.\n  Just try and explain that to a family. That is how I first found out \nabout this problem. I had a mother who wanted to be able to do the same \nthing as her husband. Her husband worked for the State government. He \ncould do it. He could bank hours. But if it is a private sector, no, \nthat would be stealing overtime from people. Why would it be stealing \novertime in the private sector when it is not stealing overtime in the \ngovernment sector? I don't understand that.\n  You will hear more, if we debate these things, and if we decide we \nare going to impose it on the Department of Defense and the Department \nof Energy authorization. If we decide we are going to impose that, \ncomments will be on this flextime provision. Most of it will be on this \nbecause it is kind of a red herring that you can throw up and say, We \ndo not trust business. Yes, we trust government but we don't trust \nbusiness. You will hear that as the main part of this debate.\n  That is why I have spent a little time concentrating on it here.\n  This legislation would give employees in the private sector \nflexibility like in the government sector in meeting and balancing the \ndemands of work and family.\n  Whatever we do, remember that part--only asking for private business \nwhat we give to government employees. Let me give some of the latest \nstatistics: 70 percent of employees do not think there is a healthy \nbalance between their work and their personal life; 70 percent of \nemployees say family is their most important priority.\n\n  The family time provision in my amendment addresses these concerns \nhead on. It gives employees the option of flexing their schedule over a \n2-week period. In other words, employees would have 10 flexible hours \nthey can work in 1 week in order to have 10 hours off in the next week.\n  Flexible work arrangements have been available in the Federal \nGovernment for over two decades. Have we had any arguments about them? \nNo, they have been a great idea. They have been accepted and desired \nand used. But don't let the private sector have that. Because it works \nin one place doesn't mean it might work in another place. Let's \ncontinue to discriminate against private business. That is what we are \nsaying when we do not allow the flextime.\n  This program has been so successful that in 1994 President Clinton \nissued an Executive order extending it to parts of the Federal \nGovernment that had not yet benefited from the program. President \nClinton said:\n\n       [The] broad use of flexible arrangements to enable Federal \n     employees to better balance their work and family \n     responsibilities can increase employee effectiveness and job \n     satisfaction while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism.\n\n  It would allow the Federal employees to better balance their work and \nfamily responsibilities--that sounds good to me--and it can increase \nemployee effectiveness and job satisfaction while decreasing turnover \nrates and absenteeism. That sounds pretty good, too.\n  Let's see now. We tried it for over two decades and decided to extend \nit to all Federal Government, so it has to be a good idea. Would we \npass on a bad idea to the Federal Government? Would they stand for it \nif we did? No. So why can't we give it to the private sector? Why do we \nsay: Private sector, you are just not as good as Government employees. \nYou do not deserve the same breaks we give Government employees.\n  As I mentioned, this will be the bulk of the debate on this \nparticular issue, the flextime part. It could have been a lot more \ninclusive. Actually, the Federal Government gets to do more than what I \nhave stated, but we are definitely not going to allow that. We are \nputting this down to a very small minimum to see if we can get any \nmovement on it at all.\n  As I said, we have voted on this before, and the answer is, Heck, no, \nwe will not give the private sector that kind of a privilege. We don't \ncare what the Federal Government gets to do, you can't treat the \nprivate sector decently. No, they didn't say that, I said that.\n  I could not agree more with what President Clinton said when he did \nhis Executive order. I am saying now we need to extend this same \nprivilege to the private sector workers. It would allow employees to \nbetter balance their work and family responsibilities, it can increase \nemployee effectiveness and job satisfaction, while decreasing turnover \nrates and absenteeism. That was President Clinton talking about this \nkind of provision for the public sector. I am saying, if it is that \ngreat, we ought to do it for the private sector, too.\n  We know this legislation is not a total solution. We know there are \nmany other provisions under the 65-year-old Fair Labor Standards Act \nthat need our attention, but the flexible time provision is an \nimportant part of the solution. It gives employees a choice, the same \nchoice Federal workers have.\n  The fifth part of this would extend the restaurant employee tip \ncredit. A major employer of entry-level workers is the fast food \nservice industry. Another part of it is the regular food service \nindustry. The regular food service industry relies on what is known as \nthe tip credit, which allows an employer to apply a portion of an \nemployee's tip income against the employer's obligation to pay the \nminimum wage.\n  Currently, Federal law requires a cash wage of at least $2.13 an hour \nfor tipped employees and allows an employer to take a tip credit of up \nto $3.02 of the current minimum wage. To protect tipped employees, \ncurrent law provides that a tip credit cannot reduce an employee's \nwages below the required minimum wage. Employees report tips to their \nemployers, ensuring an adequate amount of tips are earned.\n  Seven states--Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, \nand Washington--do not allow a tip credit; however, requiring raises \nfor all hourly employees when States increase the minimum wage. The \nlack of a tip credit requires these employers to give raises to their \nmost highly compensated employees, the tipped staff. If you are working \nin a nice restaurant, the tips will be more than the salary. Nontipped \nemployees in these businesses are negatively impacted by the mandated \nflow of scarce labor dollars to the tipped position. In addition, \nemployers are put at a competitive disadvantage with the colleagues in \nthe rest of the country who can allocate employee compensation in a \nmore equitable manner.\n  My amendment expands the tip credit to nontip credit States, \nconsistent with the initial establishment of the credit under the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, anticipating the increase in minimum wage.\n  The sixth provision is small business tax relief. If we are going to \nimpose greater burdens on small business, we should give them some tax \nrelief at the same time. My amendment extends small business expensing \nby 1 year.\n\n[[Page S6128]]\n\nSimplify cash accounting methods. I am the only accountant in the \nSenate, so I probably ought to explain what cash accounting is. That \ncould be a huge debate all by itself. It means that the business can \nactually use the dollars coming in as part of the accounting as opposed \nto anticipated dollars that would be coming in. It works off the actual \ncash flow rather than some of the accrual methods that we use. I will \nnot go into that. Accounting is important, but it often puts people to \nsleep. It would simplify cash accounting methods and provide restaurant \ndepreciation relief.\n  All of these tax provisions are fully offset in the bill. That means \nthey are paid for. That means there is some way of covering the cost of \nthem so that it isn't the general budget.\n  In total, the additional provisions in my amendment are intended to \nmitigate the small business impact of a $1.10 increase in the minimum \nwage so people can keep their jobs. I share the view of many of my \ncolleagues that if we are going to impose such a mandate on the Federal \nlevel, we must do our best to soften the blow. This may be the best we \ncan do today, but I entreat all of my colleagues to look at the true \nroot of the problem for minimum wage workers. That is the acquisition \nof job-based skills: more skills, more money.\n\n  We all share the same goals, which is to help American workers find \nand keep good-paying jobs and to keep the best paying jobs in this \ncountry. Real job skills, not artificial wage levels, should be our \nfocus. Education, training, and job experience are the solution for \nlow-wage workers. We have to pass the Workforce Investment Act that \nwill train those 900,000 people a year to higher skill jobs.\n  In terms of education and training, we need to move forward on that \nkind of meaningful legislation that will lead to increased wages and \nbetter jobs that we all want for our Nation's workers.\n  In terms of job experience, we must always remember that businesses, \nparticularly small businesses, create the jobs and provide the gateway \nto the working world for the vast majority of low-wage workers.\n  If we do not balance a minimum wage increase with economic relief for \nthe small businesses, we will stifle job creation and shut the \nemployment door on the very individuals we are trying to help.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy and, if we continue to have the debate and I submit my \namendment, to support my amendment. Both raise the minimum wage. One \ncovers the cost of the minimum wage so that it would not drive down the \nnumber of people employed in this country.\n  We have been trying to increase employment. We want those people \nstarting with minimum skills to work their way up the ladder to owning \nthe business. That can happen in America. That can happen if we give \nthem an incentive to learn to improve their skills and we don't impose \nfalse security of mandated higher wages that drive a spiral upward and \neliminate jobs. Elimination of jobs is not the answer. Training people \nto higher skills so they can demand more money or go to work somewhere \nelse is the answer.\n  If we are going to have this debate on the Department of Defense \nbill, I would be happy to submit my amendment to have it voted on, \nalong with Senator Kennedy's amendment. We have done that before. We \nknow what the results will be, I suspect. Both of them will be subject \nto a point of order. We usually agree not to go for the point of order \nbut just order the vote and have the 60-vote threshold we have always \nhad. We would be willing to do that, but a more appropriate time to \ndebate this would be another time on another bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the issue we are talking about, my good \nfriend and the chairman of the Committee on Human Resources is talking \nabout, and that I have talked about earlier, is whether we were going \nto have an opportunity in the Senate to take a few minutes to consider \nan increase in the minimum wage for the lowest paid workers in America. \nI had offered that as an amendment on the Defense authorization bill.\n  One might ask: Why are we doing this on the Defense authorization \nbill? The answer to that is we would not have another opportunity to do \nit on any other bill until the recessing of the Senate.\n  In my opening remarks when I offered that amendment, I indicated to \nthe chairman of the Committee on Armed Services that we would be glad \nto work out a time for consideration that would not interfere with the \ngeneral debate and discussion of the issues on the Defense \nauthorization bill, but we have been unable to get that at this \nparticular time. Therefore, we are talking about this issue at this \ntime.\n  The Senator from Wyoming asked why is this relevant to the Defense \nauthorization. I think the answer is rather compelling. That is, when \nwe think of why the service men and women are fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and around the world, they are fighting for American \nvalues, American principles. Part of American values and principles is \neconomic fairness, not the exploitation of poor workers in the United \nStates of America. That is why it is relevant.\n  We are talking about the ideals and the values of the United States \nof America. We are talking about family values. We are talking about \nwhat people at the lowest rung of the economic ladder are going to get \npaid.\n  I bet some of these individuals who will be affected by the minimum \nwage are over in Iraq now fighting. They are wondering, why in the \nworld are we taking up time when we have not increased the minimum wage \nin the last 9 years and we have taken the time to see six pay increases \nfor the Senate? They are saying: Why aren't you providing that increase \nfor the minimum wage for these workers? That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  Can anyone imagine that? We are going to get another pay COLA \nincrease next week. We have increased our own salaries $30,000 over the \nperiod of the last 9 years. And how much have we given to an increase \nin the minimum wage? Zero.\n  We have, I daresay, men and women who are serving in Iraq whose \nparents are probably earning the minimum wage. We are talking about \ngetting an increase to $7.25 an hour.\n  This issue never used to be a partisan issue. I regret it has turned \nout to be a partisan issue. We have been unable to get our Republican \nfriends to give us an opportunity to vote on an increase in the minimum \nwage. We are caught in this situation because we cannot get an up-or-\ndown vote on the increase in the minimum wage.\n  Since the time of the initiation of the minimum wage, going back to \nFranklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Republican, all \nhad an increase in the minimum wage. Richard Nixon, an increase in the \nminimum wage. George Bush, an increase in the minimum wage. But we do \nnot have anything after Bill Clinton and the increase in the minimum \nwage. Nine years is the longest period in history for no increase of \nthe minimum wage. If the Senator would let us have an up-or-down vote, \nwe will take a very short time period. We are interested in taking a \nshort time. We only received the Republican alternative about an hour \nand a half ago. We still don't know what the scoring is on it. The \ninitial statement we have heard is that it is pretty much the same as \nit was a year ago, and that basically cuts overtime pay. It also \nundermines the States' opportunities to deal with problems on the tip \ncredit. It also eliminates worker protections under the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. That is a fine option that is going to be out. That is \nwhat we have gotten in the last hour or so.\n\n  If I had the attention of my friend from Wyoming, the managers of the \nbill are here, I would ask unanimous consent that upon completion of \nthe Defense bill, the Senate turn to the minimum wage bill, the text of \nwhich is my amendment, that the Enzi amendment be in order, that there \nbe 4 hours of debate equally divided, and then we would go to a vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would have to object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have heard the objection. We have had complaints about \nmy offering the minimum wage amendment on this legislation. Then what \ndo we do? We say: OK, let's let this go through. But just give us an \nopportunity to consider an increase in the minimum wage on the floor of \nthe Senate with a very short time limitation.\n\n[[Page S6129]]\n\nAnd we can't get agreement on that. There you go. That is what this is \nall about.\n  I must say the idea that this isn't appropriate, if we could have \ngotten an option to go ahead and have the individual bill for an \nincrease in the minimum wage, have an opportunity to vote on both the \nSenator's amendment and our amendment, let's have that and let's go \nback to the good old days where a majority would carry. That is fine \nwith me. That would be fine with me. I will just take a half an hour on \nour side. Surely, the Senate can find time to give a half an hour to \nthe issue of increasing the minimum wage for workers. One half hour, \nlet's see where the Senate goes, whoever gets more than 50 votes. That \nused to be the way around here. But not now. We hear complaining about \nbringing up the minimum wage on this bill, and they still are going to \nhave to get 60 votes on it because there will be a point of order \nraised against this on the budget.\n  We have heard a great deal before, at the time when my good friend \nwas talking about his health care bill about wanting to have a debate \non his health care bill. Remember that? It wasn't all that long ago. \nLet's have a good up-or-down debate. Let's have a vote. What is it, \ndenying the opportunity for people to have this debate?\n  Well, we would be more than glad to have this legislation. You can \nhave on your side a half an hour. We will take a half an hour. Let the \nchips fall where they may. If the leader wants to come out and make \nthat, we have offered similar to that. There has been objection to it, \nbut it is a reflection of our good faith.\n  From an early reading of the amendment of the Senator from Wyoming, \nthey would raise the minimum wage by $1.10. Would the Senator tell me \nwhat the cost of the Enzi amendment is? What is the cost? Do we have a \nbudget point of order?\n  Could I address the Senator from Wyoming? If he could tell me what \nthe budget cost of his amendment would be? While he is doing so, I will \nmention a couple of other points.\n  His amendment would raise the minimum wage by $1.10 instead of by \n$2.10, which our bill does. It cuts overtime, and it also reduces \nbenefits so only 1.8 million workers would be covered. That is 4.8 \nmillion fewer than my amendment. Theirs is $1.10 an hour instead of \n$2.10, and there are 4.8 million fewer than my amendment. Then it also \ncuts overtime pay. It ends Federal labor standards coverage for over 10 \nmillion workers. By raising the gross income of the companies that will \nbe covered, they will eliminate 10 million workers. They will be \neliminated from any kind of minimum wage or fair labor standards \nprotections.\n  Then it basically overturns State actions that are dealing with what \nthey call the wage tip credit which States vary about how they do it. \nBut the Enzi amendment puts a cap on that. The States now, for example, \ncan have a higher minimum wage than we have. We haven't preempted the \nStates because it has always been a flooring. Some States believe that \nthose who depend on tips ought to be given a somewhat additional break. \nWe are talking about people who make $5.15 an hour, maybe make $6 or $7 \nin tips, and you are trying to nickel-and-dime them on that with the \nEnzi amendment, preempt the States.\n  I hope my colleagues have a chance to read through this overnight \nbecause we are preempting the States that have reached a different \nconclusion with regard to tip credit. The Enzi amendment says that is \ngoing to be out.\n  That is quite a mouthful. People understand those issues pretty well. \nThey are very important. I don't know whether we have an answer. I will \nbe glad to hear it later on. Could the Senator give me what the budget \ncost for his amendment would be?\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to be able to do that. I don't have the \nnumbers that I need to have. I appreciate the question, but I can't \ngive you an answer yet.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I imagine we will get them later in the afternoon \nor get them on tomorrow. Could the Senator indicate when we might \nanticipate those? The reason this is important is because we are \ntalking about 50 pages of tax issues in the Enzi amendment. Therefore, \nthere is a cost to it. It does seem to me that prior to the time that \nwe have a vote, we ought to know what those particular costs are. We \nhave on the one hand the issues that are directly related to the \nminimum wage, and then we have the costs in terms of an addition to the \ndeficit.\n  I don't know whether the Senator could tell us that we are going to \nget it later this evening. If you can give us the assurance, if you \nthink we will have it this evening, that is fine; otherwise, whatever \nhelp the Senator could provide, I would be grateful.\n  Mr. ENZI. In answer to the question, Mr. President, I can't tell how \nlong it will take for the Joint Tax Committee to have the new numbers. \nBut I can tell you, I didn't know that the Senator was going to offer \nhis amendment until yesterday. The estimated revenue effects that we \nhave are from the one that we did and voted on last year which shows \nover a 10-year period that all costs are covered with a slight surplus.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am not sure that I completely understood the Senator's \nresponse in terms of the cost. What is the cost of the first, second, \nthird, fourth, or fifth year? We will try and get that, if we could.\n  I point out to my colleagues, the amendment I offer is 2\\1/2\\ pages. \nThe Enzi amendment is 71\\1/2\\ pages, 50 of which are tax provisions. It \ndoes seem to me if we were debating, look, ours is $2.10, yours is \n$1.10, let's go at it. Let the Senate make a judgment. But it isn't \nthat. We have 50 pages in here of tax provisions that are going to \nevidently be called incentives on the one hand but to others they are \ngoing to increase the deficit on the other hand. I am not exactly sure \nwhat those are. Then we are not only being questioned about that, but \nwe also know that we have in that proposal a cut of overtime pay and \nthe ending of Federal Labor Standards Act coverage for 10 million \nworkers and basically a preemption of States that want to treat the tip \ncredit in the way that they want, which is quite a proposal. I would \nhope that we would have a chance, which I expect we will, to at least \nexamine it over the evening.\n  This chart says the $1.10 increase leaves 4.8 million workers behind, \nthe difference between the Enzi proposal and the way ours is drafted.\n  I wanted to address a couple of the issues the Senator has pointed \nout with regard to small business. This chart shows results of a Gallup \nPoll of May 2006: 86 percent of small business owners say the minimum \nwage does not affect their business. The question was: How does the \nminimum wage affect your business? Eighty-six percent said no effect; 8 \npercent, negative effect; positive effect, 5 percent; no opinion, the \nrest.\n  So it is kind of interesting, we have sort of gone beyond this point \nin terms of where the small business community is. They have a pretty \ngood understanding of what happens. What we have found out with the \nincrease, for example, on the living wage, you take the most dramatic \nexample is the neighboring city of Baltimore. When they increased it to \na living wage, what happened? First of all, they had less turnover. It \nwas less costly on the city in terms of training new workers.\n  Secondly, they increased their productivity. They got less \nindividuals who stayed home on sick leave because people began to take \na greater pride in their work. Why? Because they were being treated \nwith greater respect. And finally, the overall cost of the program, \neven though they increased it to about $11.50--I am not sure, I think \nit is even above that; they were one of the first with a living wage--\nthey found out that the workers were working harder, took greater pride \nin their work, and there was greater productivity, a greater increase \nin morale, and their overall costs have actually gone down.\n  States with higher minimum wages create more small businesses. I was \nlistening to the Senator talk about the burden on small businesses. I \njust showed a recent Gallup Poll of small businesses which was in May \nof this year. Here are the 10 States plus DC with minimum wages higher \nthan $5.15, and overall growth of small business is 5.4 percent. Forty \nStates have a minimum wage of $5.15, and there is 4.2 percent growth. \nThe States with the higher increase in the minimum wage saw an increase \nin the total numbers.\n  Study after study finds raising the minimum wage does not cause job \nloss.\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\nThis is by David Card and Alan Krueger, from Princeton's reanalysis of \nthe effect of the New Jersey minimum wage increase on the fast food \nindustry and representative payroll data, 1998. The increase in the \nminimum wage probably had no effect on total employment and possibly \nhad a small positive effect. Four different tests of the two increases \non employment impact fail to find any systematic, significant job loss \nassociated with the 1996-1997 increases, Economic Policy Institute. \nDetailed studies of California's last two decades, the State-increased \nminimum wage legislation, consistently no employment for workers.\n  This chart shows the increases in 1996. It is too bad we have to go \nback so far, but we haven't had an increase in the minimum wage. Here \nis the increase in the minimum wage to $4.75. I think it was $3.45 \nprior to that time. We went to $4.75. This is total job growth after we \nhad the increase in the minimum wage. Then we increased to it $5.15. \nThis is a chart that shows the total job growth in the United States \nduring that period. This idea about the impact on jobs is interesting, \nbut it has been refuted time and time again.\n  This chart shows that the last minimum wage increase did not increase \nunemployment. These are the figures on unemployment.\n  The last increase to $5.15 actually shows the unemployment going down \nover the period of the years, from 1997 until 2000. It doesn't have the \nmost recent figures. But it is a pretty good indication of what was \nhappening during that time. So we find that the States which have a \nhigher increase in the minimum wage are expanding in small business. \nEighty-six percent of small business, according to the Gallup poll, \nsaid it doesn't have any effect, in terms of employment. The national \nreview about what has happened the last two times we raised the minimum \nwage was that it had virtually no impact in terms of the employment \nissue.\n  Finally, inflation. That issue is always another canard that is \npointed out. They say if you raise the minimum wage, we are going to \ncause inflation. Look at what we are doing, Mr. President. Increasing \nthe minimum wage to $7.25 is vital to these workers, but it is a drop \nin the bucket to the national payroll. All Americans combined earned \n$5.4 trillion a year. A minimum wage increase to $7.25 would be less \nthan one-fifth of 1 percent of the national payroll. There it is. No \ninflation, no adverse impact on unemployment. Small business feels that \nit doesn't impact or affect them. The studies show that small \nbusinesses have grown in States where they have had an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  These are the economic arguments, but most of all, as we have said \nday in and day out, this is a fairness issue. These are men and women \nwho work hard and play by the rules and take a sense of pride in their \nwork. They work as teachers aides, in nursing homes, cleaning up the \ngreat buildings of American commerce, and they work hard and try to do \na decent job. More often than not they have two and sometimes three \nother jobs. Primarily, they are women. As I have pointed out, it is a \nwomen's issue. Primarily, those women have children. It is a children \nand a women's issue. It is a family issue. It is a family value issue \nand a civil rights issue because so many of the workers are men and \nwomen of color. And fairness, fairness. You don't have an economic \nargument against increasing it to $7.25, and you don't have an argument \nthat is relevant to decency and fairness in opposing this kind of \nincrease.\n  Americans understand fairness, they understand decency, and they \nunderstand the importance of hard-working Americans who are playing by \nthe rules. A job in America should get you out of poverty, not keep you \nin it. And the alternative to our increase in the minimum wage will \nkeep you in poverty. We can do better as a country, and we will.\n  I see my friend from New Jersey who desires to address the Senate on \nthe minimum wage. I hope he will have an opportunity to do that for as \nlong as he likes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Kennedy in \nhis call to increase the minimum wage to $7.25 and to cosponsor this \namendment. In my mind, this amendment is not just about wages, it is \nnot just about fairness; it is about dignity. Certainly, there could \nnot be any finer advocate for our Nation's workers than my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, who has pushed relentlessly to get this body to act \nand provide that opportunity for dignity and to provide a long, overdue \nincrease in the Federal minimum wage.\n  Yet despite his efforts, despite coming to this floor time and time \nagain to call for a simple yet critical wage increase, this body has \nnot heeded his calls. Despite the fact that some 7 million American \nworkers are struggling to keep their heads above water, this body has \nchosen inaction.\n  That is a disgrace.\n  I think it is shameful that Members of this body have walked away \ntime and again when given the chance to provide hard-working Americans \nwith what is at the core of the work ethic we hold as a Nation--fair \npay for a hard day's work.\n  We are not talking about a giveaway or a free ride; we are simply \ntalking about a fair and decent wage that ensures those working their \nhardest make enough to get by. To be honest, workers making the Federal \nminimum wage today don't make enough to get by. The average worker \nearning the minimum wage and working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, \nto support a family of three will only earn $10,700 on the current \nminimum wage. That is $6,000 below the Federal poverty line for a \nfamily of three.\n  No family can afford to live on those wages, especially not a family \nin a high-cost State such as New Jersey. In New Jersey, which has the \nhighest median income in the Nation and one of the highest average rent \ncosts in the country, $5.15 an hour is simply not enough to get by. \nPeople in New Jersey know that. Leaders in New Jersey know that, and \nthat is why our State acted to increase the minimum wage to $6.15 last \nOctober. Raising the minimum wage to $7.25, as this bill would do, \nwould benefit an estimated nearly 200,000 New Jerseyans.\n  I am proud that New Jersey has been a leader for increasing the \nminimum wage. I heard Senator Kennedy's reference to some studies about \nit. In fact, we are lifting people up in the process. New Jersey's move \nto be a leader, rather than wait for the Federal Government to lead the \nway, is providing a better standard of living for New Jerseyans.\n  We need leadership now in Washington. While Congress refuses to act, \nmillions of workers across the country are being left behind. Nine \nyears is far too long for those workers to wait. Nine years is too long \nfor those who work around the clock, hoping to save a little extra for \ngroceries, so they can buy school supplies or clothes for their \nchildren or for those who are saving so one day they can live in a \nplace that they are proud to call home.\n  Mr. President, that is what this amendment is about. It is about more \nthan just wages. It is about providing a decent and fair standard of \nliving for those who share in the dream of America, as every other \nworker in this country. It is for those who work their hearts out every \nday so that they may provide a better life for their families. It is so \nthat children in this country never have to know what it feels like \nnever to have enough.\n\n  Increasing the minimum wage would give more than 7 million children \nof minimum wage earners a chance for a better life.\n  As the son of poor immigrants, hard-working parents who worked day in \nand day out as a carpenter and a seamstress in a factory, I knew what \nit was not to have enough. My parents didn't have time to fight for \nbetter wages. They were working hard to achieve the American dream. \nSimilar to so many before them, my parents saw hard work as a path to a \nbetter life for themselves and their children. That continues to be the \nstory for so many hard-working Americans.\n  But unless wages rise to keep up with the rising costs, to meet the \nrealities facing working families, that dream will be out of reach for \nmillions of minimum wage earners, who earn a wage that is worth less \nthan it was nearly 30 years ago.\n  Now, I ask how the Members of Congress, who get a cost-of-living \nadjustment, can at the same time say to those people in this country \nworking at the minimum wage--even after you\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\nwork 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, which puts you at the poverty \nlevel--Members of Congress get an increase in the cost of living, but \nthey cannot vote after 9 years to give those hard-working minimum wage \nworkers the first increase in 9 years.\n  Every day that we stand idle, the minimum wage continues to lose \nvalue, our Nation's workers fall further and further behind. We have to \ngive working families the chance to work their way out of poverty. We \nwant Americans to be self-sufficient. Yet when we have individuals who \nget up every day and do some of the hardest work that our country has \nto offer--and it is honest work and decent work, but it is hard work--\nevery day they get up and go to work--and they cannot afford to be ill \nbecause most of them don't get health care. If they don't go to work \nthat day, they don't have the resources to take home for their \nfamilies. Can we not say as a Nation that we want to honor their work, \nthat we want to reward their work, so that work becomes the vehicle by \nwhich there is self-sufficiency? That is what we say when we are \nunwilling to increase the minimum wage.\n  The increase we are proposing would put more than $4,000 in the \npockets of these hard-working Americans. This is enough to help a low-\nincome family afford 2 years of child care, a year and a half in \nutility bills or a year of tuition at a public college.\n  This may be a simple increase for some, but an extra $2.10 an hour \nwill mean a lot more for the 15 million workers who have been waiting \nand waiting and waiting for 9 years for a better wage, a better \nstandard of living, for hope and opportunity, and for a message that \ntheir work is rewarded.\n  Mr. President, these workers have waited long enough. They are \nwaiting for leadership. They are waiting for a Congress that accepts \ncost-of-living adjustments to ultimately recognize that they, too, need \nan adjustment in their salary. Let's get our priorities straight and \nstand up for our Nation's families. Let's show true leadership and \nprovide these workers across the country what they deserve. Let them \nwork their way out of poverty. Let's pass this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I want to talk about the amendment of the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I want to specifically commend the Senator \nfor his passion and enthusiasm. But it reminds me of a line in an old \ncountry song: ``You only hurt the ones you love.''\n  The graphs that we were shown were macro graphs about all economies \nand all unemployment in the country. The people on minimum wage, which \nthis is designed to help, are those at the lowest end of the skill \nlevel and the beginning level of employment.\n  When the distinguished Senator from New Jersey referred to the 15 \nmillion Americans who were on the minimum wage 15 years ago as if they \nwere still on it today, it was deceiving and misleading. Those are not \nthe same 15 million people. They are 15 million new people who are \ngetting a foothold in the joy that is America by beginning on the \nladder of employment.\n  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly \ncautioned the Congress on this very subject and against raising the \nminimum wage for that reason. The Chairman pointed out that such a move \n``increases unemployment and, indeed, prevents people who are at the \nearly stages of their careers from getting a foothold in the ladder of \npromotions.''\n  The Federal Government can dictate what anybody pays anybody, but we \ncannot dictate who is hired. If we raise the component cost of \nemployment--as the bill of the Senator from Massachusetts would--29 \npercent, it stands to reason that you put at risk 29 percent of those \nwho are employed at the lowest level. What happens is that people seek \na more efficient worker at the detriment of the least skilled and the \nleast qualified.\n  One year after the first minimum wage was established, Franklin \nRoosevelt's own Department of Labor made the following observation:\n\n       In a number of instances, there have been reports that \n     workers who had been receiving less than [the new minimum \n     wage] had been laid off, and replaced by more efficient \n     workers.\n\n  The marketplace will drive employment, and when we in Government \ninfuse ourselves into an issue and make an arbitrary adjustment, then \nthe marketplace will make the adjustment for the business community and \nthe more efficient worker will be employed.\n  When the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts referred to the \ntremendous job growth and creation between the next-to-the-last \nincrease in the minimum wage and the last increase in the minimum wage, \nagain it was a macro graph. The fact is that while employment \nskyrocketed during the dot-com era, those were high-technology, high-\nend jobs. The reality was that, as a result of the Congressionally-\nmandated increase in the minimum wage, technology replaced a lot of \nthose minimum wage, low-skilled jobs, and actually unemployment \nincreased at the lowest end. It is only right to compare apples to \napples and oranges to oranges.\n  It is interesting that researchers at the University of Wisconsin did \na study not too long ago to determine what the minimum wage did to \nwelfare mothers, that I give you, Mr. President, as an example. The \nstudy revealed that welfare mothers in States that raised their \nrespective minimum wages remained on public assistance 44 percent \nlonger than those in States where the minimum wage was not raised, \nmaking the point I made earlier; that is, getting a foothold on the \nladder of success in America means getting in the employment chain. And \nthe more we put pressure on how much it costs to bring someone into \nthat chain, the more it punishes or penalizes someone who is not in it.\n  There is another deception which goes on in this argument, and that \nis that everybody who is on the low end of the chain and a minimum wage \nearner is at the bottom of the scale in life.\n  President Clinton's first Labor Secretary, Robert Reich, once \nobserved ``most minimum wage workers aren't poor.'' He is right. Today, \naccording to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the average family \nincome of a minimum wage worker is above $43,000 a year--well above the \nnational average. There are reasons for that.\n  Accordingly, minimum wage increases are inefficiently targeted to \nhelp poor workers since fully 85 percent of minimum wage earners live \nwith their parents, have a working spouse, or are living alone without \nchildren. In fact, when Congress last raised the minimum wage in 1997, \nonly 17 percent of the benefits of that increase went to families \nliving below the poverty level. For comparison, over 33 percent of the \nbenefits went to the richest two-fifths of all families, which is \nanother secret to raising the minimum wage.\n  It is not just at the lowest end of employment or the beginning \nlevel, but there are contracts in America that are indexed to the \nminimum wage. If the United States of America and this Congress force \nan increase in the minimum wage, then it very well could trigger, in a \nlabor contract, in a labor organization with a company, an automatic \nincrease in the pay scale for people far and above the minimum wage. \nOnce again, it has an arbitrary effect on the marketplace that the \nmarketplace will adjust, and when it adjusts, someone will lose a job \nor find it harder to get a job.\n  The University of Georgia in my home State recently did a study. The \neconomist who did that study was Joseph J. Sabia, a Ph.D. graduate in \neconomics from none less than Cornell University. He used Government \ndata from January of 1979 until December of 2004. This is a 25-year \nlongitudinal study, and in sum, Dr. Sabia found that a 10-percent \nincrease in the minimum wages causes a nine-tenths of 1 percent to a \n1.1 percent decrease in retail employment, and an eight-tenths of 1 \npercent to a 1.2 percent decrease in small business employment. Dr. \nSabia's research confirmed yet again that low-skilled workers is the \ngroup that is most likely to be most negatively impacted by the minimum \nwage hike.\n  The study also reiterated minimum wage hikes are not an effective \nmeans of reducing poverty among working poor because most minimum wage \nworkers are second or third earners in a family--teens or dependents--\nand most workers in poor households earn more than the minimum wage.\n  But the best study I refer to most often is the study I conducted \nduring 33\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\nyears in the private sector employing hundreds of individuals in a real \nestate company. I knew what competitive marketplace factors were, and I \nknew how, when we brought people in--and I had some jobs in my company \nthat were at the lower end, minimum wage to start. They may have been \nin maintenance, may have been in building upkeep, may have been \noperators on the night desk. But I always found myself being pressured \nby the market, not the Government, to raise the wage of the good worker \nbecause the good workers, as they improved and gained their self-\nconfidence, shopped around.\n  In most of the years I worked, we were in the type of economy we are \ntoday. We were in full employment where you are competing for the best \nand the brightest. Those who are motivated, those who enter the system, \nthose who are at minimum wage to start with will quickly rise as they \ngain skills, confidence, and self-esteem.\n  If we think an arbitrary, mandatory 29-percent increase in somebody's \nwages is going to solve poverty, improve their self-esteem or, in fact, \nsolve the problem the Senator from Massachusetts intends it to solve, \nwe are wrong. Instead, it is probably going to deny about 29 percent of \nthose starting at that level an opportunity early on. It probably, as \nPresident Roosevelt's Administration found in 1939, is going to cause \nsome people to actually lose their jobs. And worst of all, it is a \nfeel-good amendment whose intention ends up having the absolute \nopposite result.\n  I care deeply for everybody in my State, everybody in this country, \nand for everybody entering the workplace. I believe the minimum wage is \nappropriate, but I believe to take a time of full employment, a time of \na vibrant economy, a time when study after study indicates the exact \nopposite of what the distinguished Senator said, would be sending the \nabsolute worst signal.\n  I believe in the empowerment of our workers, not in the slavery of \nour workers. I don't believe Government should arbitrarily try to fix \nsomething that, in fact, the marketplace fixes day in and day out 365 \ndays a year.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to not try to fix something that \nis not broken. I will oppose the Kennedy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our friend and colleague, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, is looking forward to addressing the Senate \nin just a minute or two.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to review for the Senate what has \nbeen happening to many families in this country over recent years \nregarding the important growth of poverty and its relationship to the \nminimum wage. It has a very direct relationship. The figures are rather \nstartling. It is appropriate, when we are talking about an increase in \nthe minimum wage, that we have some fuller understanding about the \ngrowth of poverty in our Nation over recent years.\n  Mr. President, 5.4 million more Americans are in poverty. We had 31.6 \nmillion in 2000, and now there are 37 million. There is a 5.4-million \ngreater number of Americans living in poverty in the United States. Of \nthose 5.4 million, 2.5 million are children.\n  It is interesting, when we talk about an increase in the minimum \nwage, if we look at the countries of Western Europe--take Great \nBritain, for example, which has the second most powerful economy in \nWestern Europe. In October, they will increase the minimum wage, and it \nwill go to $9.80 an hour. Listen to Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the \nExchequer, and the pride that he takes as a public servant, Chancellor \nof the Exchequer--effectively our Secretary of Treasury and the head of \nOMB combined--in having lifted 2 million children out of poverty over \nthe last 6 years. We have put 2.5 million children into poverty in the \nlast 5 years.\n  There are 5 million more Americans who are on the verge of hunger. \nThese figures are from Food Security in the United States, USDA. These \nare not figures from those of us who are supporting an increase in the \nminimum wage. These are the figures. We have 5 million more Americans \nwho are feeling the pangs of hunger, and the great percentage of those \nare children, again.\n  What is consistent in the last 5 years? No increase in the minimum \nwage, the growth of the number of people in poverty, the growth of the \nproblems of hunger. We have Americans struggling to survive in this \ncurrent economy, the Bush economy. Too many Americans are living in \npoverty: 1 in every 10 families; nearly 1 out of every 5 children in \nthis country; 1 out of every 5 Hispanic Americans, and 1 out of every 4 \nAfrican Americans.\n  This is interesting. It shows the extraordinary growth of poverty, \nparticularly child poverty, in the failure to increase the minimum \nwage. So one says: What does that really have to do with the minimum \nwage no longer lifting a family out of poverty?\n  In 1965, 1970, 1975, for a period of some 20 years, we had a minimum \nwage that was above or at the poverty level. Republicans and Democrats \ndid this for 20 years, and now we are seeing an absolute collapse. \nThere was a little blip with the increase in the minimum wage, and now \nwe are down to an alltime low, some $5,888 or less. We know that in the \nlast 9 years, the increase to $5.15 is buying about 15 to 20 percent \nless. It is not only $5.15 an hour, the purchasing of that $5.15 per \nhour is less.\n  The United States has the highest child poverty rate of the \nindustrialized world. Here it is. Of all the industrial nations of the \nworld, we have the highest poverty rate. That obviously has something \nto do with what their parents are being paid. Not completely; there are \nother programs in these countries that are directed toward children.\n  The Presiding Officer, a former Secretary of Education, is familiar \nwith what a number of these countries do in terms of trying to assist \nand providing special allowances for children in a number of ways. \nNonetheless, what comes out of it is the fact that we have the highest \nchild poverty rate of any industrial nation in the world. The fact that \nwe have not had an increase in the minimum wage is directly related to \nthat.\n\n  Again, if you look over at this chart here, the States with the \nhighest child poverty have the lowest minimum wages, with the exception \nof Pennsylvania, and that is a State with 20 percent greater child \npoverty than the national average but has a higher minimum wage. But \nthe rest are basically States with lower minimum wages, a direct tie-in \nwith the minimum wage and poverty and child poverty.\n  We have a chance to do something about child poverty and about \npoverty in this country, and we can do it in a way that is not going to \nendanger inflation or provide increasing unemployment or threaten the \nsmall business community.\n  As we have gone through this, we have seen those arguments which have \nbeen raised and which were raised again this afternoon by my good \nfriends from Wyoming and Georgia. They are arguments I have listened to \nfor the last number of years I have been in the Senate. The fact is \nthat when we have had an increase in the minimum wage, no one has ever \nsaid: Let's go back, let's go back, although we are going to be faced \nwith an alternative tomorrow to my increase in the minimum wage that \nwill take us back, will eliminate the coverage, eliminate overtime for \na number of workers, and that is unfortunate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier today we went through a good deal \nof the history of the minimum wage, and we also went into the growth of \npoverty, particularly for children and\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\nfor those who receive the minimum wage. I wish to read a couple of \nreal-life stories because I think it is always useful to understand \nthat besides the graphs we have been able to show and the statistics we \nhave been able to show on these charts, we also show in real terms what \nis happening to a lot of our fellow citizens, our fellow Americans.\n  This is a story from the Sacramento Bee, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record in its entirety. This is June 18, \n2006, last Sunday:\n\n       Monique Garcia earned minimum wage for most of a decade \n     before becoming homeless. She washed dishes, swept floors, \n     collected parking tickets, worked cash registers, staffed \n     drive-through windows, and flipped burgers. Despite that, two \n     months ago, the 26-year-old single mom found herself with too \n     little money for rent and no place to go.\n       She moved with her 7-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son \n     into St. John's, a family shelter tucked into an industrial \n     corner of Sacramento. They share a room with another minimum-\n     wage worker and her two young children. Garcia and her \n     roommate trade off, one watching the kids while the other \n     works.\n       It's hard, you've got a family to support and minimum wage \n     isn't it, Garcia said last week.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, June 18, 2006]\n\n              Life on $6.75 an Hour: When Ends Don't Meet\n\n                          (By Jocelyn Wiener)\n\n       Monique Garcia, a single mother living on minimum wage, \n     ended up homeless.\n       As the gulf between what they earn and what they owe \n     continues to grow, many of the region's minimum-wage workers \n     have turned to food banks for sustenance. Some, like Garcia, \n     have moved into homeless shelters or cars for housing.\n       These workers welcome Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's proposal \n     to hike the minimum wage by a dollar, to $7.75 an hour. They \n     cheer a separate plan proposed by state legislators--and \n     supported by many labor groups--that would ensure the minimum \n     wage increases each year to keep pace with inflation. About \n     1.4 million of the state's lowest-paid workers would be \n     affected.\n       California's minimum wage is lower than that of more than \n     half a dozen states, but is higher than the federal minimum \n     of $5.15 an hour. Washington state has the highest minimum at \n     $7.63 an hour, and it is indexed to inflation.\n       California's Industrial Welfare Commission is scheduled to \n     consider the proposals early next month. Many business groups \n     oppose a minimum wage increase because it could force \n     increases for higher-paid employees, as well, and might cause \n     some small businesses to close.\n       According to a report published earlier this year by the \n     California Budget Project, a nonprofit group that conducts \n     economic and policy analysis to benefit the poor, the \n     purchasing power of the minimum wage has dropped $0.88 since \n     2002, a decline of 11.5 percent.\n       Advocates for the working poor say earnings have slipped so \n     far out of sync with the cost of living that the proposals \n     are unlikely to remedy families' deep financial distress. \n     Barring a drastic policy change, they say workers like Garcia \n     will continue to struggle mightily under the ballooning costs \n     of health care, transportation, child care and housing.\n       ``I hope I am wrong,'' said Ralph Gonzalez, a social worker \n     with the Sacramento County Department of Human Assistance. \n     ``I hope with the increase of the minimum wage we can get it. \n     But with all my years of experience, I really doubt it. I \n     really do.''\n       Another California Budget Project report, this one released \n     in September 2005, estimated that a single adult in the \n     Sacramento region needed to earn about $11.61 an hour, or \n     $24,151 a year, to cover housing, utilities, transportation, \n     food, health care, taxes and miscellaneous expenses. They \n     calculated that a single parent raising two children, such as \n     Garcia, would need to earn $24.17 an hour, or $50,272 \n     annually, to cover basic expenses.\n       Minimum-wage earners patch together strategies to make ends \n     meet: some cram into one bedroom apartments shared by \n     multiple families. Many work two or three jobs. They run up \n     debt to pay medical bills, buy clothing at rummage sales and \n     visit food banks when there's nothing left to eat. Many \n     teeter on the edge of homelessness until, like Garcia, they \n     fall off.\n       Garcia has round brown eyes, a long ponytail and the names \n     of her children, Yesenia and Joshua, tattooed over her heart. \n     Until last week, she worked about 15 hours a week at Round \n     Table Pizza. Now she's applying at Del Taco and Wal-Mart and \n     a discount store. She's worked full-time in the past and \n     would like more hours, but recently hasn't been able to get \n     them. She's afraid to take a second job because her absence \n     already is hard on her children. For the same reason, she \n     finds it difficult to complete the coursework she needs for a \n     GED, virtually a requisite for most better-paying jobs.\n       That leaves her with about $190 every two weeks, after \n     taxes, she said. Even with a $300 monthly check from \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families for her 7-year-old \n     daughter, and a monthly $300 in food stamps, she doesn't have \n     enough to rent an apartment.\n       To even consider an application, most landlords want her to \n     earn at least double the rent. The cheapest one-bedroom she's \n     seen is in North Highlands, for $400.\n       John Foley, executive director of Sacramento Self Help \n     Housing, said most landlords in Sacramento actually require \n     tenants to make 2.7 times the rent. Most refuse to rent to \n     people with any history of evictions or bad credit.\n       ``It's legal to have those criteria,'' he said. ``But, of \n     course, they really crunch the poor.''\n       He said it is especially disconcerting that workers in \n     Sacramento cannot afford rent, because the region is \n     relatively affordable compared with much of the rest of the \n     state.\n       ``We ought to be able to fix it here,'' he said. ``That's \n     what's so shameful.''\n       Health care costs, which increase more than 7 percent each \n     year across the country, also pinch the working poor. Some \n     workers, like Garcia, receive Medi-Cal. But, for a whole host \n     of reasons, many others are ineligible for government \n     programs.\n       Marina Aguilar, an uninsured Der Wienerschnitzel worker, \n     knows intimately the burden of medical bills. She says her \n     husband, an asthmatic, was admitted to a local hospital \n     overnight after a severe attack two years ago. He was \n     uninsured, and the bill for his short stay came to $5,000. \n     For two years, Aguilar says, she and her husband--who lays \n     tile for a living--have paid $100 every month on that bill. \n     So far, they've paid more than $2,000, but they still owe \n     about $4,000 because of interest.\n       Aguilar, a 37-year-old mother of three, earns minimum wage \n     working 30 to 35 hours a week. Her husband is now insured, \n     but she is not covered by his plan. Last month, her doctor \n     told her there was something in her breast that needed to be \n     biopsied. The biopsy alone would cost $5,000. Her mother, \n     grandmother, great-grandmother and sister all had cancer; the \n     risk is clear.\n       ``I'm worried, because if I have cancer, cancer spreads \n     very quickly,'' she said in Spanish as she sat in her sister-\n     in-law's lace-curtained home across the street from the \n     Sacramento Food Bank.\n       Aguilar would like to use the money she earns to buy things \n     for her 10-, 15- and 19-year-old daughters and 3-year-old \n     grandson. She'd like to take the younger ones to Chuck E. \n     Cheese's, maybe even on a vacation someday. She's never been \n     on a vacation.\n       Low-wage work can seem, to many workers, to be a whirlpool \n     from which they can never escape. Gonzalez, of the Sacramento \n     County Department of Human Assistance, has another name for \n     it: Catch-22.\n       Homeless people don't have alarm clocks or easily \n     accessible showers, he said. So those workers who are \n     sleeping in their cars, or under a bridge, often lose their \n     jobs because they can't be presentable for work. Those who \n     are not homeless may need to ride a bus several hours to get \n     to work on time. They may not be able to afford the high cost \n     of child care. Few services exist to help them, Gonzalez \n     said.\n       At nearly age 60, Epitacio Leon has spent 43 years watering \n     and tilling and picking the state's agricultural fields. His \n     face is baked dark from decades in the sun, his fingernails \n     are caked with earth, his bottom teeth are missing. His most \n     recent raise, from $6.75 to $7 an hour, represents the \n     highest wage he's ever earned.\n       Leon rises at 4 every morning in the tiny trailer where he \n     lives alone. He eats breakfast, then catches a ride to the \n     fields with another worker. By 6 a.m. he is working, \n     irrigating tomato and sunflower fields near Woodland. He \n     works for 12 hours, then comes home exhausted. He drinks a \n     few beers and goes to bed.\n       ``I'm old already,'' he said in Spanish as he sat in his \n     niece's Woodland home last week. ``I'm tired of working \n     already.''\n       If he retires now, he said, he wouldn't get enough money \n     from the government to pay his bills.\n       The sounds and smells of his great-niece's high school \n     graduation barbecue floated into the living room. Always \n     working, never saving, Leon didn't have a family of his own. \n     But he visits his niece's family on evenings and weekends and \n     special occasions, and finds pleasure in playing the role of \n     great-uncle.\n       On the evening of the graduation party, his 10-year-old \n     great-nephew walked into the living room. Leon teased him a \n     little, then asked him to bring him a beer. Then he stopped \n     him.\n       ``Let me see whether I have a peso,'' he said, fishing in \n     his pocket. He pulled out a $1 and a $10 bill. He deliberated \n     a moment before handing the boy the $10.\n       The boy beamed. Leon smiled a little.\n       It would be nice to retire some day, he said. But it won't \n     be next year, and probably not the year after that.\n       The Cost of Living:\n       $5.15 federal minimum hourly wage.\n       $6.75 California's minimum hourly wage.\n       $7.63 Washington state's minimum hourly wage, the highest \n     in the nation and indexed for inflation.\n       $11.61 hourly wage a single adult in the Sacramento region \n     needs to cover basic living expenses.\n       $24.17 hourly wage a single parent raising two children in \n     this region needs to cover basic living expenses.\n\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The stories continue along. This is happening out in \nSacramento.\n  Here is a story about, for all intents and purposes, Christie:\n\n       Christie did a job that this labor-hungry economy could not \n     do without. Every morning she drove her battered '86 \n     Volkswagen from her apartment in public housing to the YWCA's \n     child care center in Akron, OH, where she spent the day \n     watching over little children so their parents could go to \n     work. Without her and thousands like her across the country, \n     there would have been fewer people able to fill the jobs that \n     fueled America's prosperity. Without her patience and warmth, \n     children could have been harmed as well, for she was more \n     than a babysitter. She gave the youngsters an emotionally \n     safe place, taught and mothered them, and sometimes even \n     rescued them from abuse at home.\n       For those valuable services, she received a check for about \n     $330 every two weeks. She could not afford to put her own two \n     children in the day care center where she worked.\n\n  She is looking out for children, and she is unable to provide the \nchildcare for herself.\n  Carolyn Payne did everything right but still can't find a job with \ndecent wages.\n\n       She had earned a college diploma, albeit a two-year \n     associate's degree. And she had gone from a homeless shelter \n     into her own house, although it was mostly owned by a bank. \n     The third objective, ``a good-paying job,'' as she put it, \n     still eluded her. Back in the mid-1970s, she earned $6 an \n     hour in a Vermont factory that made plastic cigarette \n     lighters and cases for Gillette razors. In 2000, she earned \n     $6.80 an hour stocking shelves and working cash registers at \n     a vast Wal-Mart superstore in New Hampshire.\n       ``And that's sad,'' she said.\n\n  She just can't make it and is in a homeless shelter. These people, \nour brothers and sisters of America who want to work, want to provide \nfor their families, will do hard and difficult work. Carolyn Payne \nshould have a greater sense of hope in the richest and the most \npowerful country in the world. We will give them that if we increase \nthe minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to describe what I understand \nis in the amendment which is being offered by Senator Enzi. I think it \nis important that we have a chance over the evening--because it looks \nless likely that we are going to be completing this debate tonight. We \nhave others who are on their way over here. But I am going to review \nthis and try to get through it, and then if I have misstated it, I hope \nI will be corrected.\n  In the last 9 years, while costs have been rising, the minimum wage \nhas been stuck at $5.15 an hour; that is, $10,712 a year, $6,000 below \nthe poverty line for a family of three. Since 1997, the minimum wage \nhas lost 20 percent of its value. The Enzi proposal is a $1.10 \nincrease--far short of making up for this lost value. It won't even \nmake up for the lost value of the purchasing power of the existing \nminimum wage. It leaves behind 4.8 million workers who would be covered \nby the Democratic proposal because it only raises the wages of 1.8 \nmillion workers.\n  The raise to $5.15 was historically low, lower than any but for one \nincrease in the 1960s. In fact, before the 1997 increase, the minimum \nwage had fallen to its lowest level since 1960. So we can't allow such \na low increase for hard-working minimum wage workers.\n  Eighty percent of the 14.9 million Americans who would be affected by \nthe minimum wage are adults, and more than a third are the sole \nbreadwinners in their families. Minimum wage workers have waited 9 \nyears. They deserve one that is fair.\n  On the issue about the 10 million Americans who will lose the minimum \nwage in overtime protection, first, the Bush administration and \nRepublican leadership in Congress stripped away overtime protection \nfrom 6 million Americans. That has already taken place. That has \nalready taken place. They have done that through rules and regulations. \nNow they want to deny over 10 million more workers, minimum wage \nworkers, overtime pay by eliminating the fair labor standards coverage \nentirely. Do you see what I mean? If you eliminate the coverage of the \nFair Labor Standards Act, you eliminate the protections for overtime \npay.\n  Currently, all employees who work for employers who are engaged in \ninterstate commerce, have gross annual sales of at least $500,000, are \nguaranteed the minimum wage and overtime pay. But even in businesses \nthat have less than $500,000 in annual sales, employees still have \nindividual minimum wage and overtime coverage if they are engaged in \ninterstate commerce. The Enzi amendment would raise the $500,000 annual \nsales to $1 million and eliminate the fair labor standards coverage for \nworkers who are engaged in interstate commerce. No more overtime for \nthose individuals--10 million.\n  Raising the annual business threshold to $1 million and eliminating \nthe individual coverage would force greater numbers of hard-working \nAmericans, retail workers, security guards, garment workers, \nwaitresses, and their families into poverty. Raising the annual \nthreshold and eliminating individual coverage would allow businesses to \npay their workers less than the Federal minimum wage and require them \nto work longer hours without overtime pay.\n  So, on the one hand, you get the $1.10 increase for 1.8 million, \nwhich will not even cover the lost value of the $5.15 since the last 9 \nyears. Then you eliminate the overtime protections for these workers as \nwell. Because the Fair Labor Standards Act guarantees overtime and \nequal pay for women and men, this exemption jeopardizes these rights \nfor over 10 million workers.\n  The gross annual sales threshold was created as a way to determine \nthat employers were engaged in interstate commerce, not as a way to \nexempt workers from minimum wage and overtime protection. Doubling the \nannual sales threshold and eliminating individual coverage would take \naway those protections for over 10 million workers, contradicting the \nlong-term intent of the Congress to expand the Fair Labor Standards \nAct.\n  For over 60 years Congress has repeatedly amended the Fair Labor \nStandards Act to provide more protection, more minimum wage and more \novertime protection--not less. This will be the first time we will see \nthe significant reduction rather than an expansion.\n  Instead of trying to exclude over 10 million workers from the \nguarantee of a minimum wage, we should be trying to raise it. It has \nbeen more than 9 years. Americans have waited long enough.\n  This chart indicates raising the business exemption reverses a \ntradition of extending worker rights.\n  Congress amended the business exemption in 1961, 1967, 1969 and 1989, \neach time to afford more employees minimum wage and overtime \nprotections. The current $500,000 exemption was established \ndeliberately to cover more employees. By raising the exemption, the \nRepublican proposal would reduce the protection for the first time.\n  That is very important.\n  I want to cover the last two points. I see the Senator from \nConnecticut here.\n  Under the Republican proposal, workers opt into the flextime system, \nbut once they do, they do not control their own schedules. They work a \n50-hour workweek when their employer tells them to, not when they \nchoose to.\n  Under the current system, workers would get overtime for those extra \n10 hours a week. Under the Republican proposal, they would not.\n  The Republicans claim the proposal would give the parent time to see \na child's soccer game or attend a child's school play. They, in \nreality, don't get that freedom. They just get paid less for working a \nlonger workweek.\n  Public sector workers also have greater protection from being coerced \nto agree to flextime if they don't want it. Pubic employees generally \nhave the protection of a union contract as well as the constitutional \ndue process protections afforded them in the Civil Service, although \nthis administration is trying to undermine those due process rights as \nwell. Public employees can challenge abuses of flextime within the \ncontext of those protections, whereas most public employees cannot.\n  As then-Governor Ashcroft explained in 1985, when the Senate was \nconsidering whether to permit flextime in the public sector:\n\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\n\n       State and local governments are qualitatively different in \n     structure and function from private business. Public \n     employees serve under exceptional circumstance, the most \n     significant characteristic of which is the protection public \n     servants enjoy because they work in government.\n\n  I am also going to add to the statement an analysis on the tip credit \nthat would show how this effectively preempts the State from being able \nto make a judgment on this. This is a one-size-fits-all. It is ``the \nFederal Government knows best.''\n  If we pass it here, we preempt what Massachusetts can do, what \nConnecticut can do, what Georgia can do. It doesn't seem to me to be \nthe wise course of action. We permit States to make their own judgment \nto increase the minimum wage because that is what it is, a minimum. It \nis a bottom. But this proposal is going to interfere with the States' \nwage policy in other ways.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin, if I may, by once again \ncommending our colleague from Massachusetts for his leadership on this \nissue. Over the years, no one has been a stronger champion, a louder \nvoice, a stronger voice on behalf of the most disadvantaged in our \nsociety than the senior Senator from Massachusetts. Once again he is \nproving that point with this amendment he has offered. Frankly, as I \nrecall in years past, increases in the minimum wage were the ones that \nwere endorsed by both parties. I am old enough to remember when an \nincrease in the minimum wage would have occurred in far less time than \n9 or 10 years.\n  Nearly a decade has elapsed since the last increase. I am sure my \ncolleague from Massachusetts can tell me on the average, it was \nprobably every 2 or 3 or 4 years that the increase would occur. When it \ndid, when the proposal was offered and it was worked out between the \ntwo parties, it went through almost unanimously if not unanimously. But \nhere we are. This is an indication of what has happened in our beloved \ncountry over the last number of years.\n  Nearly 37 million of our fellow citizens, including 13 million \nchildren are currently living at or below the poverty level in the \nUnited States. Yet we somehow cannot find ways among ourselves here to \nreach a consensus to increase the minimum wage to $7.25 over the next 2 \nyears--a $2.10 increase.\n  I find that rather shocking. I suppose it is an indication of what \nhas happened to the body politic in this country, that you cannot find \ncommon ground to make a difference in the lives of almost 40 million of \nour fellow citizens.\n  These Americans are struggling out there every single day and as I \nmentioned earlier, 13 million of them are totally defenseless--our \nchildren. Certainly, while Members of Congress may find it odd, the \naverage citizen out there, even those who are making way beyond the \nminimum wage, were they here tonight in this Chamber, would tell you \nhow difficult it is to meet the rising cost of living--food, housing, \nclothing--not to mention soaring energy costs. Yet in the midst of all \nof that, we find it impossible to provide an increase, after nearly a \ndecade, of $2.10 per hour for these families in our country.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As all of us know, the Senator has been the chairman of \nthe Children's Caucus here in the Senate. He is the author of the \nFamily and Medical Leave legislation. He worked 5 years to get that \nlegislation passed. It has been a great success. There were extensive \nhearings in our committee over the course of the years on children and \nchildren's needs, children's education.\n  Does he agree with me that we have seen this remarkable growth of \nchild poverty in the last 5 years? The Senator has just mentioned this. \nI just want to underline it. In the strongest economy of the world, we \nare seeing a significant growth in child poverty and child hunger in \nthis Nation, and we have seen, as the Senator pointed out, the virtual \nlack of increase in the minimum wage and the reduction of purchasing \npower.\n  Does the Senator join with me in recognizing what we have seen? The \nU.K., which is the second strongest economy in Europe, will be going to \n$9.80 an hour in December. Gordon Brown takes pride in the fact that \nthey have raised 1.8 million children out of poverty in the U.K. over \nthe period of the last 5 years. In Ireland it is $9.60, and they have \nraised hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that the fact of the failure of \nincreasing the minimum wage has had an extremely negative impact on the \nwell-being of children in our country, resulting in the fact that there \nare hundreds of thousands, even millions more children who are living \nin poverty because we have failed to do that?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, if he will yield \nback, I couldn't agree with him more. This is one of the great myths \nabout the minimum wage increase. You will hear over and over again; in \nfact, we have heard it here already today: If you increase the minimum \nwage, this hurts business. This makes it more difficult to hire people, \nto employ people.\n  I found it rather interesting that in surveys done among the business \ncommunity, particularly the small business community, 86 percent of \nsmall business owners do not think the minimum wage affects their \nbusiness.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct that raising \nchildren out of poverty is directly related to the ability of their \nparents to provide for them.\n  Again, it should not take lecturing here to my colleagues in this \ngreat body to make the case, in the 21st century, that we are going to \nhave to have the best prepared, best educated, healthiest generation we \ncan produce if we are going to remain competitive in a global economy. \nWhen you have 13 million of your children growing up in poverty, how \nare these children going to effectively compete? How are they going to \nbe well educated? How are they going to be healthy enough not only to \nbe good parents themselves, but good workers, and good citizens?\n  It seems axiomatic. It should be understood on its face. If we \ncontinue on the road we are traveling, with the number of children in \nour country growing up in poverty increasing, it is going to make it \nmore difficult for our country to compete in the 21st century.\n  There is a graph here which I know the Senator has seen, but it makes \nthe case of what is happening. The United States has the highest child \npoverty rate in the industrialized world: Denmark, Sweden, France, the \nNetherlands, Germany, Spain, Japan, Canada, U.K., Italy. All of these \ncountries, major competitors in the world, do a far better job seeing \nto it that their children are better prepared to meet those challenges.\n  Our future is lagging behind when a substantial number of children \nare growing up, in our great country, in poverty. This is through no \nfault of their own. It is through the accident of birth, being born \ninto a family where their parents are struggling to earn a decent wage \nand make ends meet. These are working families, by the way. These are \nnot families collecting subsistence or some kind of charity. They are \nout there working, earning an income that does not allow them to meet \nthe basic necessities of life.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has given just an excellent statement about \nwhat happens to children when they live in poverty. I was wondering if \nthe Senator would comment about the growth of hunger over the last 5 \nyears. There are 5 million more of these people now, according to the \nUSDA, and more than 20 percent of these are children. Five million more \nAmericans are hungry or on the verge of hunger.\n  I wonder, I ask someone who chaired the Children's Caucus, I ask \nabout the fact that children are increasingly pressured in terms of the \nissue of hunger, what does this do to a child in terms of a child's \ndevelopment?\n  Let me add one addendum. I believe the Senator may remember what \nhappened, I think it was in Philadelphia, where they expanded the \nschool lunch program to include a school breakfast program. They found \nout that the grades of the children all went up noticeably--I think it \nwas somewhat\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\nclose to 10 percent. In any event, it was clearly noticed, as they \nfound out, when children have decent nutrition, their performance--in \nterms of educationally, culturally, socially, and from a discipline \npoint of view--is very importantly impacted. I wonder if the Senator \nwould tell us from his own experience what he knows about this.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for bringing up this chart to \nemphasize the point. I think these numbers are from the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Again, the Senator is making an excellent point. If you have a hard \ntime understanding what the Senator from Massachusetts is saying or the \nSenator from Connecticut, ask any teacher. Ask any teacher in this \ncountry, particularly at the elementary school level, what sort of \nacademic performance, what sort of attention spans you have with a \nchild who has received adequate nutrition, a decent meal, compared to \nthose who have not. You will hear anecdote after anecdote of what \nhappens with children who do not have proper nutrition--not to mention \nthe growing health care problems that can emerge.\n  This is just good, sound investment policy. If you really care about \nthe future of your country, if you really care about whether or not our \nNation's children are going to be able to perform adequately in this \ncentury, then clearly making sure that they have the basic essentials \nis, again, so obvious that it should not require a debate on the floor \nof the Senate to make the point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Now we find out there is increasing hunger, and now we \nknow it affects more than one million children.\n  Can the Senator tell us what he knows about Americans and their \ndegree of support to relieve the hunger of children? It is truly \noverwhelming, is it not?\n  Mr. DODD. It is not surprising but it is worthy of being repeated.\n  Ninety-four percent of our fellow citizens across this country, \nregardless of geography and economic circumstance, of gender, \nethnicity, whatever the differences may be, agree with the following \nquotation: People who work should be able to feed their families. \nNinety-four percent subscribe to that notion.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is talking about working families. Our \nfellow citizens believe that if you are a working family, you should be \nable to make enough money to feed your family.\n  This is the United States of America. This is not some Third or \nFourth World country we are talking about. Yet with 37 million of our \nfellow citizens, adults and children, unable to meet the requirements \nof basic food and nutrition, it ought to stun everyone in our country.\n  What we are trying to do is make it possible for these people who are \nworking hard to be able to provide for their families. That is all we \nare talking about.\n  I point out to colleagues who have offered an alternative to this \nproposal, that a $1.10 per hour increase to $6.25 per hour over the \nnext 2 years, means that millions of children would be left behind.\n  What the Senator from Massachusetts is offering--with a bipartisan \ngroup of support, we hope--is a $2.10 per hour increase to provide for \nthe needs of working families. What the Senator from Massachusetts has \nlaid out I couldn't agree more with him. If you are truly interested in \nmaking a difference in this country, that extra $1 per hour could make \na huge difference in the ability of these families to make ends meet.\n  Among full-time, year-round workers, poverty has increased by 50 \npercent since the 1970s. Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year are earning $10,700 a year. That is almost $6,000 \nbelow the Federal poverty guidelines of $16,600 for a family of three--\n$6,000 less than you ought to be able to have if you are going to meet \nthe poverty guidelines.\n  Here we are in the 21st century, and the minimum wage is losing its \nvalue as well. Since the minimum wage was last raised nearly 10 years \nago, its real value has eroded by 20 percent. Minimum wage workers have \nalready lost all of the gains from the 1996-1997 increase.\n  Today, the real value of the minimum wage is more than $4 below what \nit was in 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the \nminimum wage would have to be more than $9.25 per hour--not the $5.15 \nwe are currently at.\n  I want to make a point as well about what the impact of this minimum \nwage increase would have on the lives of working families.\n  Nearly 15 million Americans would benefit from the minimum wage \nincrease to $7.25 per hour. That is 6.6 million people directly \naffected in a positive way and another 8.3 million affected indirectly. \nAlmost 60 percent of these workers are women, and 40 percent are people \nof color. Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers, \nnot teenagers seeking pocket change, as some have said, and more than a \nthird of these are adults are the sole providers for their families.\n  Again, we are talking about an increase to $7.25 per hour, which is \nstill hardly enough to make ends meet when you consider the cost of \nfood, clothing, housing, not to mention the skyrocketing cost of energy \nthat has hit everybody in this country. We all know how hard it is to \nprovide for our families.\n  If you raise the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, it would mean an \nadditional $4,400 a year. That additional money would be enough for a \nlow-income family of three to buy 15 months of groceries which they \ncouldn't otherwise get, 19 months of utilities which they would not \notherwise be able to afford, 8 months of rent, over 2 years of health \ncare, 20 months of child care, 30 months of college tuition at a public \n2-year college. Consider those numbers--20 months of child care that \nthese working families need if they are going to keep their jobs and \nkeep their children safe, not to mention 30 months of college tuition. \nIt may not seem like much, but it is important.\n  In 10 years, the person earning minimum wage has received no pay \nincreases, unless they have been lucky enough to live in a State that \nincreased the minimum wage.\n  But for most of our fellow citizens, that has not been the case. And \nwe now have nearly 40 million of our fellow citizens living at or below \nthe poverty level.\n  I repeat this because I know my colleagues care so much about it. To \nhave 13 million of our children in this country who, except by accident \nof birth, have found themselves living under these circumstances and \nhaving to survive at that level is unacceptable.\n  This is the United States of America. We ought to be doing far \nbetter.\n  To find out, as we recently pointed out on the chart, that almost \nevery other industrialized country in Western Europe is doing far \nbetter by their children, far better by their minimum wage workers, \nought to be a source of collective embarrassment for this great country \nof ours.\n  I don't think I have to make this case too often. We know how \ndifficult it is going to be to compete in the 21st century. If we don't \nhave a generation coming along that is well educated and well prepared \nto meet the challenges of the 21st century, it is going to be hard for \nAmericans to remain strong and competitive.\n  You just have to read about what is happening in our major \ncompetitive countries. We take great pride in 60,000 high school \nstudents in this country who competed last year in the science fair, a \ngreat number. Compare that with 6 million who competed in the same \nscience fair in the People's Republic of China last year.\n  That is the challenge of the 21st century.\n  With 13 million kids in this country going without getting a decent \nmeal every day, we are going to have a real problem on our hands if you \ndo not begin to address that.\n  I feel strongly about this and I wish we could reach agreement \nquickly. I remember the days when the minimum wage increase was done by \na voice vote. We worked out the differences and sat down and \nnegotiated, and it was passed unanimously on a record vote or a voice \nvote. How sad it is that we have come to this, where nearly a decade \nlater we are sitting here arguing with each other about whether 15 \nmillion of our fellow citizens could get a bump of $2.10 per hour up to \n$7.25 an hour.\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\n  This ought to be something we can all agree on and not engage in this \nkind of acrimonious debate.\n  I want to point out, as well, that there are other provisions that \nwill be offered by the majority that are very troublesome to me, \nincluding a fundamental change in the overtime pay schedule that I \nthink is very unfair to people. This goes beyond the minimum wage \nworker. Here we have always provided that if you work more than a 40-\nhour week in that week, then you get time and a half. That has been \nFederal law. We are now saying we are going to apply a 2-week standard. \nAn employer could have you work 50 hours in 1 week and 30 hours in the \nnext. That is 80 hours, but for the 10 hours more in the first week, \nyou don't get the additional pay.\n  That is unfair to a lot of people in this country. If you work an \nadditional 10 hours in a week, that can be hard labor, and you ought to \nget time and a half. The law requires it. That would be a $3,000 per \nyear pay cut for a median income worker and an $800 pay cut for minimum \nwage workers. That additional 10 hours of overtime pay could make a big \ndifference.\n  I don't know why the majority decided to add that provision. It seems \nto me that is unduly harsh to an awful lot of people.\n  We talked about the poverty level working with the minimum wage. I am \ntalking about people who are above the poverty level but are struggling \nand don't have to be making $16,000 or $10,000 to be struggling in this \ncountry. You could be making $40,000, $50,000 or $60,000 a year. If you \nare a family of four, you may very well be struggling, considering the \ncost-of-living increases that have gone on. For that man or woman who \nworks an additional 10 hours a week, 10 hours away from their families \nafter putting in 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, that additional 10 hours \ncan be hard. And to say I am not going to give time and a half for \nthose 10 hours I think is unfair to those people.\n  If that ends up being adopted, I think it is a great step back as \nwell.\n  I hope we will adopt the proposal that the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas offered. I commend him, once again, for making a strong case.\n  Again, on behalf of 13 million children in this country, and million \nof people who are out there struggling tonight to take care of their \nfamilies, to raise good families, I urge adoption of the amendment \nbeing proposed by our colleague from Massachusetts. I hope it will be \nadopted by our colleagues when voted on tomorrow. It is an important \ncontribution. Nine years is too long to wait for an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, I make this \nunanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the first amendment, No. 4323, be \nwithdrawn; provided further that Senator Enzi be recognized in order to \noffer a first-degree amendment relating to the minimum wage; provided \nfurther that the Senate then resume debate at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday \nand that there be 1\\1/2\\ hours of debate equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking member of the HELP Committee or their designees. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that at the use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on Kennedy amendment No. 4322, to be \nfollowed by a vote on the Enzi amendment, with no amendments to the \namendments in order; provided further, if either amendment does not get \n60 votes in the affirmative, then that amendment would be automatically \nwithdrawn.\n\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following those votes, Senator \nLevin be recognized in order to offer amendment number No. 4320 related \nto Iraq. There will be 5 hours equally divided in relation to that \namendment, and following that debate, the amendment be set aside and \nSenator Kerry be recognized to offer his amendment related to Iraq.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I express my appreciation to \nthe Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan. I have an \namendment I am considering offering dealing with Guantanamo Bay.\n  I inquire as to whether there is an opportunity to work that out?\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say, I understood the Senator has that \namendment. I have asked colleagues on this side to be here. They are \nnow present.\n  The Senator indicated you would lay it down now for the purpose of \nintroducing the amendment, having a colloquy on the amendment, and the \ntime for the voting would be established by the leadership at some \npoint in the future.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is now ready to proceed.\n  Mr. DODD. I wanted to make sure in the discussion there was a space \nfor that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I am here to speak on the \nminimum wage amendment.\n  Are we going off of that?\n  Mr. REID. We will vote on it in the morning.\n  Mr. HARKIN. OK.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, is it my understanding that \nthere would be no amendments allowed to my amendment?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, we just got a call that some \nSenator objects to this.\n  Mr. WARNER. I didn't hear what the distinguished Democratic leader \nsaid.\n  Mr. REID. A Senator just called objecting to this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the unanimous consent \nproposed by the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is an objection, apparently, which we just received \nin the cloakroom.\n  Although I support it, we have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last March in the bankruptcy reform bill, \nthe Senate debated the minimum wage with Senator Kennedy offering an \namendment to increase the minimum wage over a 2-year period to $7.25. \nThat amendment failed on a largely party-line vote, 46 to 49. Again, \nlast October, another Kennedy amendment to increase the minimum wage \nover a 2-year period, to $6.25, again failed on a largely party-line \nvote, 47 to 48.\n  Both votes ignored the fact that 37 million Americans, many holding \ndown full-time jobs, are living in poverty.\n  Here we are again. This week we again debate an amendment offered by \nSenator Kennedy, me, and many others, to increase the minimum wage. I \nhope this time the outcome will be different. Indeed, with 37 million \nAmericans living in poverty, almost 13 percent of our population, we \nhave to have a different outcome. We have to raise the minimum wage.\n  Poverty is increasing sharply among the working poor. The new Census \nBureau numbers show over the last year alone, the number of Americans \nwho work but live in poverty increased by 563,000. The number of \nAmericans who work but live in poverty increased by half a million.\n  A job ought to lift people out of poverty not keep them in poverty. \nBut that is what we have today--more and more Americans working, yet \nmore and more Americans falling into poverty who are working. A job \nought to lift you out of poverty. It offends our basic sense of \nfairness to know there are many Americans who work full time, play by \nthe rules, and still live in poverty.\n  Millions of Americans find themselves doing this, including 13 \nmillion children. That is why it is absurd, beyond reason, hard to \nexplain to the average person why the minimum wage has been stuck at \n$5.15 an hour for the last 9 years.\n  How would any Senator like to have the same salary that he or she got \n9 years ago? Seven times in the last 9 years we have raised our \nsalaries. We have adjusted upward to account for the increased cost of \nliving. Yes, over the same time, we have callously allowed the income \nof workers earning the minimum wage to languish, lose value every year, \nas inflation has gone up and they stay the same. It is incredible we \nwould raise our salaries seven\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\ntimes in 9 years and never raise the minimum wage.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Kennedy and me and others to raise \nthe minimum wage to $7.25 is, as I said, long overdue. Prior to last \nMarch, it had been 5 years since we last had a vote on the minimum \nwage. It has now been 9 years since we last raised the minimum wage.\n  To have the same purchasing power, for example, if we took the year \n1968, the minimum wage today would have to be more than $9.26 an hour. \nMinimum wage workers earn a paltry $10,712 a year total, almost $16,600 \nbelow the Federal poverty guidelines for a family of three.\n  This chart shows the salary of a full-time minimum wage worker to be \n$10,712. The average family health care premium in 2005 was $10,880. \nRight now, 35 percent of minimum wage workers in America are the sole \nsupport of their families. These are not just teenagers. Some may be \nteenagers; more often than not it is a single, working mother. They can \nwork hard all year at the minimum wage--and they do work hard, if you \nhave ever seen anyone do that kind of work--and they cannot even buy a \nhealth care premium.\n\n  As I said, the salary for full-time minimum wage workers is $10,712; \nthe average cost of a health care premium, $10,880. They could not even \nafford to buy health care, let alone pay rent, buy food, pay for \nheating, buy gas for the car to get back and forth to work.\n  As I said, there is a lot of misperception about who gets the minimum \nwage. We hear it is teenagers, part-time workers flipping hamburgers. \nHere are the facts: 35 percent earning the minimum wage are the sole \nbreadwinners of their families; 61 percent are women; almost a third of \nthose women are raising children; 76 percent of the women who would \ndirectly benefit from an increase are over the age of 20. Among \nfamilies with children, and a low-wage worker who would be affected by \nan increase, the affected worker contributes half of the family's \nearnings. Those are the facts.\n  A decent minimum wage is critical to moving people from welfare to \nwork. I thought that is what we wanted to do. Since the Clinton \nWelfare-to-Work Program in 1996, we reduced the number of welfare cases \nby half. But so many of the people who moved off of welfare did not \nmove out of poverty. Why? Because at the current minimum wage, it is \nnot a living wage, it is a poverty wage.\n  An increase to $7.25 would make a dramatic difference. It would add \n$4,370 in income. That is real value to a family living in poverty. \nNearly 7.5 million workers would benefit from a minimum wage increase. \nIn my home State of Iowa, 87,500 workers would benefit from the \nincrease, more than 6 percent of our workforce.\n  In urging the passage of the first minimum wage legislation, \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt once said:\n\n       No business which depends for existence on paying less than \n     living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this \n     country.\n\n  Imagine that. He went on to say:\n\n       By living wages, I mean more than bare subsistence levels. \n     I mean the wages of a decent living.\n\n  He had it right. We can do it better. Gas prices are up 70 percent, \nhealth insurance is up 33 percent, college tuition is up 35 percent, \nhousing is up 36 percent, and wages are up 1 percent. Minimum wage is \nup nothing, not even 1 percent.\n  During the same period, private sector executive salaries have risen \ndramatically. Right now, the average CEO in America makes $11.8 million \na year--the average worker is earning $27,460 a year--431 times what \nthe average worker makes. Imagine being a minimum wage worker making \n$10,000.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. HARKIN. As long as I get the floor back.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the Senator, when we finish, be permitted to \nresume the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to ask the unanimous consent \nrequest made by the Senator from Virginia a few minutes ago be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I presume that the request is as read and \nthat there have been no changes, and we will then have the sequence of \nrecognition of Senators Levin and Kerry; and I add to it that \nthereafter the Senator from Virginia would be recognized for the \npurpose of submitting whatever amendment.\n  I ask for recognition for the purpose of offering the amendment from \nour side on whatever subject that comes up at that time at the \nconclusion of these two.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I assume there would be \nadequate time that we would be allowed to consider an amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia? As I understand, the Senator was talking about a \npossible amendment on Iraq.\n  Mr. WARNER. I said it could be on anything.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could be on Iraq.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have been going back and forth.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator offering the amendment he is referring to \npostcloture?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could inquire, I agree with the \nminority manager of the bill, there is a question about what the \namendment might be about. If it comes precloture or postcloture, \npostcloture it makes no difference. If it is precloture and it is about \nIraq, I think the Senator from Michigan and others would then have an \ninterest in being able to respond to whatever that amendment is.\n  I say to the distinguished manager, the Senator from Virginia--and it \nis his right, and we are very happy to have him acknowledge that right \nto put that amendment in--we would want to have time, obviously, to \ndebate it and respond to it, conceivably.\n  The question is whether it is precloture or postcloture. I ask the \nPresiding Officer if the Senator from Virginia intends to offer \nwhatever amendment he does immediately after cloture or precloture?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I withdraw that and ask unanimous consent \nthat we approve the request as read earlier.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, when we were discussing \nthis last, I asked whether or not the manager, the chairman, would make \nit clear that my amendment is not subject to amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are perfectly willing to make that \neminently clear.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And also if the Senator would agree that the Kerry \namendment--\n  Mr. WARNER. We have not seen his amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then the request is that the unanimous consent request be \namended so that my amendment which is on file will not be subject to \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \nunanimous consent request of the Senator from Virginia that the Levin \namendment not be amendable? Without objection, the request is so \nmodified.\n  Mr. WARNER. Has the Chair ruled on the underlying UC request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I know we have had a \ndiscussion with the distinguished chairman of the committee. Senator \nBingaman and I are interested in offering amendments at the appropriate \ntime precloture on the Guantanamo situation. I am wondering if we could \nallocate an hour before the cloture motion is filed to raise that \namendment and then have a vote on it, either one or two of those \namendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have been trying to get the minimum wage \nput aside so that you could move. And you are going to argue tonight \nyour amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague--\n  Mr. WARNER. And Senator Bingaman likewise. I think he has an \namendment pending at the desk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It has not been filed.\n  Mr. WARNER. But he has spoken to it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. What is the desire? I have to ask my colleagues, we are \ntrying as best we can to accommodate all interested parties. The \namendments are coming from this side. It is really incumbent on you all \nto try and reconcile how you wish to proceed. We are about to lock up \nthe two significant amendments of the Senator from\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\nMichigan and the Senator from Massachusetts. I recognize you have had \nthat amendment. You asked to bring it up tonight. I have assembled a \ngroup of my colleagues to debate the amendment. What is the pleasure?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from Virginia would yield--\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID.--the problem we have is, the Senator from Connecticut wants \nto have his amendment heard prior to cloture. The problem is, there has \nnot been a motion for cloture filed yet. If the cloture motion is filed \ntonight, then under the rules, an hour after we come in on Thursday, \ncloture would be voted on. That being the case, under the proposed \nunanimous consent agreement we have here, there is going to be a lot of \nhours used up prior to Thursday morning at 9 or 10, whenever we come in \nhere. I think there are a lot of people who want to offer amendments, \nbut unless they are germane amendments, there would be no guarantee \nthat there would be a vote on them, other than the two here. We have \nhad assurances that the Levin and the Kerry amendment, even though \nthere would be a problem with cloture, they would allow a vote on that. \nI think realistically, it would be hard for anyone to guarantee a vote \nprior to cloture to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we had understood that the debate would be \nheld tonight. We were willing to have a vote on Gitmo tomorrow right \nafter the minimum wage. There it is.\n  Mr. REID. That would certainly be long before cloture and the debate \nwould be finished tonight, and we could slow up Senators Levin and \nKerry by more than 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. If we could agree to a vote on one or two amendments on the \nGitmo situation and allow us the opportunity to debate this evening or \npossibly an hour tomorrow morning before the vote, that would \naccommodate us completely. If we could accommodate that request, then \nwe can go forward. That is the request we would like to make.\n  Mr. REID. I respectfully request, I have spent nearly all of the day \ntrying to work something out on these two amendments. Senator Levin and \nSenator Kerry can speak for themselves. I am not sure they want another \nhour. We can finish the debate on yours tonight and vote on it in the \nmorning with 15 or 20 minutes evenly divided. Maybe something like that \ncould be worked out, but I don't think there is an hour left. If these \ntwo men debate tomorrow night, we aren't going to finish this thing \nuntil some time late tomorrow night at best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Virginia?\n  Mr. REID. I would simply say this--and I appreciate very much the \nSenator from Iowa being so courteous--everyone is in agreement that we \nare going to try to work something out so that you and Senator Bingaman \ncan get a vote on your amendment tomorrow morning. It is just a \nquestion of how we do it timewise.\n  Mr. DODD. Is that the understanding, that that would be the case?\n  Mr. WARNER. We will try and do our very best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator would yield just for a moment, I would \nlike to ask my two colleagues, for the knowledge of my two colleagues \non this side, how soon may we start the debate on the Guantanamo \namendments?\n  Mr. DODD. Why don't we say around 7 o'clock. Say at 7 o'clock.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will certainly accommodate the Senator from Iowa. I \nhave two colleagues who withdrew from their schedules to come over here \ntonight because we were told that we would start this debate.\n  Mr. DODD. I would say at 7 p.m.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right, 7 p.m.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the average CEO in America today makes \n$11.8 million a year. The average salaried worker makes $27,460 a year. \nThat is 431 times what the average worker makes. That is the average \nworker. Take a minimum wage worker at $10,600 a year. The average CEO \nmakes a thousand times more a year, a thousand times more than a \nminimum wage worker. So you can see the disparity has gotten out of \nhand.\n  In the wake of Katrina, in a speech in New Orleans, President Bush \nproclaimed:\n\n       We should confront poverty with bold action.\n\n  We are just trying to raise the minimum wage for the first time in 9 \nyears, and we can't even do that. We can have tax reductions for the \nwealthy on and on and on; they seem to be sacrosanct, untouchable; but \nwe can't raise the minimum wage. The working poor have to do with $5.15 \nan hour. This is unconscionable. We have to do something about it.\n  Have Members of the Senate all joined the Neiman Marcus crowd? Have \nwe become so totally insulated from the realities of real life for the \npeople who work and shop at Wal-Mart and K-Mart, Dollar stores, who \npinch their pennies, who go to the grocery store and spend the time \nlooking for the best bargains, have we become so insulated from them \nthat we can't see the need to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 an \nhour?\n  Poverty has doubled since the late 1970s among full-time, year-round \nworkers from about 1.3 million to more than 2.6 million. Every day the \nminimum wage is not increased, it continues to lose value and workers \nfall further and further behind.\n  Here is what is happening today. That is why I say there is a misery \nindex out there, a working class misery index. This shows it. \nProductivity keeps going up. People are working longer, working harder. \nThey are producing more. Productivity is up 166 percent since 1960. \nLook what has happened to the real minimum wage. It is down 23 percent.\n  This is what the average person feels: My gas prices have gone up. My \nrent has gone up. I can never afford to send my kid to college. College \ntuition has gone up. Health care premiums are skyrocketing. I am \nworking harder, longer. I am producing more, and I am getting less. \nThat is what I call a working class misery index in America. And what \nhave we done? We raised our salaries 7 times in the last 9 years. We \nhave tax break after tax break after tax break for the privileged few \nin America.\n  Just a couple weeks ago there was an attempt on the floor to \ncompletely wipe out the estate tax, estate taxes paid by only 3 \nfamilies out of every 1,000 in America. Three out of every 1,000 \nfamilies pay any estate taxes. They are the wealthiest in our country. \nWe had an amendment to the bill by the other side to completely \neliminate it. Thankfully, we didn't do that.\n  But now when we want to raise the minimum wage just a paltry two \ndollars and something cents an hour, we can't do that? Where is the \nfairness? Where is the fairness for the American worker? No wonder the \naverage American's esteem of Congress has gone down--along, I might \nadd, with the President's, because the President is not up here asking \nfor a minimum wage increase either.\n  No wonder people don't think we are doing anything. We raise our \nsalaries 7 times in 9 years. We have tax breaks for the wealthy. We \nhave tax breaks for big business. We want to do away with estate taxes \nfor the wealthiest few. But we won't raise the minimum wage.\n  It all leads us to conclude that when it comes to the issues of \npoverty and the working poor, the American public should watch what we \ndo, not what we say.\n  I will bet every Senator here can give wonderful talks about work, \nthe value of work and more jobs and creating jobs and the economy is up \nand isn't everything wonderful. Yes, if you are a CEO, it is wonderful. \nIf you are a CEO, it is pretty darn nice. If you are making $150,000, \n$160,000 a year, $170,000, as we are here, things are pretty nice. But \nif you are a minimum wage worker, things aren't very pretty. Things \naren't pretty at all. You are not saving anything. You are barely able \nto scrape by. Your kids are probably not getting the best food and \nnutrition. They are probably not going to be able to manage to go to \ncollege. You don't have health care so you go to the emergency room \nwhen you get sick so you don't have any preventative care. Your kids \nare probably not getting the vaccinations and the checkups they need. \nThey are probably not getting the dental care they need.\n  I am not talking about ``poor people living in poverty who aren't \nworking.''\n\n[[Page S6140]]\n\nI am talking about poor people who go to work every single day. You see \nthem. We all see them. We all see them. You go into stores and see the \npeople working behind the counters. Check on the people who are working \nin day-care centers, people in Head Start centers, people cleaning \nhouses, cleaning our office buildings. Yes, and a lot of people are \nworking, flipping burgers and stuff like that, making the minimum wage. \nBut they are the sole breadwinner of their family.\n  We see them every day and yet we pass by, we just pass on by. Let's \nnot pass on by here. Let's stop and think, act accordingly, and reach \ndown and say to those people who are working hard every day that it is \ntime to give you a raise, too--not just corporate CEOs or Members of \nCongress, but let's give at least a $2.10 increase to the people who \nmake the minimum wage. It will be good for American workers and for our \neconomy. It is long overdue, and it is the right thing to do.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4376\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk for the \ndebate to be done in the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4376.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is that we will have two \namendments introduced by the other side with regard to Guantanamo. They \nwill be debated tonight. We are going to work toward making certain \nthey get a vote on those amendments. I ask my ranking member.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. We thank \nthe Senator for his unvaried hospitality and good nature on these kinds \nof difficulties. We appreciate his determination to try to find the \nopportunity for a Guantanamo amendment or amendments. They are trying \nnow, I believe, to figure out--I think it is going to be offered at 7 \np.m. I guess they will be here to offer that amendment at 7 o'clock.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the interim, seeing no Senator desiring \nto address the Senate, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to speak, if I may, regarding a \nproposal by Senator Bingaman concerning Guantanamo Bay and the \ndisposition of detainees. I understand he introduced an amendment \nyesterday. I have the summary of it. If I mischaracterize it or if it \nis changed in any way, I apologize. I will try to give an overview \nbased on what I know, with the understanding that if it changed, I \nstand corrected.\n  Senator Bingaman, from what I understand, has an amendment that would \nrequire the United States to either charge, repatriate or release \nindividuals held at Guantanamo Bay within 180 days of the enactment of \nthe Defense authorization bill, and if for some reason the Government \nfails to comply within that timeframe, the Department of Defense would \nhave to report back to Congress to tell us why. It provides further \nthat charges could be filed in U.S. District Court, a military tribunal \ncourt or military commission or an international tribunal against \ndetainees.\n  If I may, I will express my concerns about this amendment. No. 1, the \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay are being held as enemy combatants. That is \na concept that has been part of our law for quite a while. The Supreme \nCourt has several enemy combatant case holdings. That is someone who is \ninvolved in hostilities but not in the normal course of combat. They \ndon't wear uniforms. They are not supported by a particular State. They \nare fighting, in this case, for a terrorism cause that doesn't have a \ncountry of origin. They are irregular combatants.\n  For many years in the military law, a regular combatant or enemy \ncombatant has been considered a person outside of the protection of the \nGeneva Convention because that is an international treaty designed to \nprotect lawful combatants and have procedures that every signatory \ncountry will abide by. A lawful combatant is someone who represents a \nState, wears a uniform, and operates within the rules of international \nmilitary law.\n  Al-Qaida, by their very definition, because they don't wear uniforms \nand represent a particular country, are irregular enemy combatants. The \npeople at Guantanamo Bay have been captured in various parts of the \nworld by the U.S. military or were turned over to them as being \nsuspected of being involved in the war on terror. There are 500-\nsomething people down there now; over 200 have been released. Senator \nBingaman's amendment would require the Government to release them all \nor charge them.\n\n  The reason I believe that is not good public policy is because enemy \ncombatants--you don't have to choose between trying them and letting \nthem go. A prisoner of war is not required to be released until the \nhostilities are over. We have had Members of the Congress who were \nenemy prisoners during Vietnam and were incarcerated 5, 6 or 7 years, \nuntil the Vietnam war came to an end.\n  This amendment, in an odd way, would allow enemy combatants to be \nreleased before hostilities are over, which is something not afforded \nto a prisoner of war. But a traditional prisoner of war is not subject \nto being tried as a war criminal for the mere status of being involved \nwith the opposing force.\n  I believe strongly that it is not advisable for this country to say \nas a matter of policy that every enemy combatant or unlawful combatant \nper se is a war criminal. Military trials or commissions should be \nconducted for people who are part of the enemy force who have violated \nthe law of armed conflict. There are about 20-something people, I \nbelieve, facing military commission charges at Guantanamo Bay and \nhaven't been tried yet because of Federal court proceedings affecting \nthe outcome of the military commission status. This amendment would \nrequire the United States to make a choice that no other country has \never had to make: try them or let them go.\n  The truth is that some of them deserve to be tried as war criminals. \nSome of them deserve to be taken off the battlefield until they are no \nlonger a threat to our country and our coalition forces. And to have to \nlet them go or try them is a choice the country should not have to \nmake.\n  Who is at Guantanamo Bay? There have been some high-profile stories \nabout individuals who were sent there who may not have been involved in \nenemy combatant activities. Unfortunately, those things happen. You can \nget someone in your custody based on some bad information and, over \ntime, find out you made a mistake. And 200-something people have been \nreleased under the current procedure. What is that procedure? The \nGeneva Convention says if there is a question as to whether a person is \na POW, a prisoner of war, or an unlawful enemy combatant, the host \ncountry, the country in custody of that individual, must have a \ncompetent tribunal to make that decision.\n  As far as I know--and correct me if I am wrong--the decision as to \nwhether a person is an enemy combatant is a military decision. We don't \nhave civilian trials. The Geneva Convention doesn't require a civilian \njudicial determination to be made. The determination of whether you are \na POW who is entitled to the Geneva Convention protection, an enemy \ncombatant or an innocent individual, is left up to the military. I \nargue that that is the way it should be, with due process rights.\n  The problem with this war is that we don't know when it is going to \nbe over because there will be no surrender ceremony. I am sensitive to \nthat. I understand the Senator's concerns, and that is legitimate. The \nprocess at Guantanamo Bay now, as I understand it, is\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\nwhen somebody is sent there, a combat status review tribunal will \nreview their case, a military intelligence officer, and a military \nlawyer will look at the case and determine if the individual before \nthem is an enemy combatant or meets the definition of an unlawful \nirregular enemy combatant. The host country where the person comes from \ncan intervene on their behalf. Evidence is collected. They don't have a \nlawyer, but they have a representative. Every year, that person's \nstatus is reviewed. An annual review looks at whether the person still \nhas intelligence value, whether they are a threat to the United States \nor has anything changed about their initial status determination.\n  Under an amendment passed that was authored by Senator Levin and \nmyself, every Guantanamo Bay detainee now will have a chance to appeal \ntheir case to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and a \nFederal court of appeals at the District of Columbia will review the \ncombat status review tribunal's action in that case to see if it was \nproper. So now we have civilian courts looking over the initial \nmilitary determination. When it comes to military commissions and \npeople being tried as war criminals, we have the presumption of \ninnocence and the right to a lawyer, which is a very similar tribunal \nto international tribunals, very similar to the UCMJ but different in \nsome regards.\n  So the idea that we need to let the prisoners go or try them all, I \nthink it would be a very bad policy decision to make because some of \nthem can be dangerous, can be a threat to our country if released or \nthey could have intelligence value but don't fall within the definition \nof war criminal. To say that every enemy combatant is going to be tried \nas a war criminal is not good policy because you are beginning to \nchange the way the rules have worked for a very long time.\n  We have had 200-something people released. About a dozen of them have \ngone back to the fight, unfortunately. So there have been mistakes at \nGuantanamo Bay by putting people in prison that were not properly \nclassified. There have been mistakes about releasing people that we \nthought were not dangerous but turned out to be so.\n  I have a summary of statements made by individuals who have been \nreleased from Guantanamo Bay but went back to the fight. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                   SELECTED STATEMENTS FROM DETAINEES\n\n       Statements made by detainees provide valuable insights into \n     the mindset of these terrorists and the continuing threat \n     they pose to the United States and the rest of the world.\n       A detainee who has assaulted GTMO guards on numerous \n     occasions and crafted a weapon in his cell, stated that he \n     can either go back home and kill as many Americans as he \n     possibly can, or he can leave here in a box; either way it's \n     the same to him.\n       A detainee with ties to UBL, the Taliban, and Chechen \n     mujahideen leadership figures told another detainee, ``Their \n     day is coming. One day I will enjoy sucking their blood, \n     although their blood is bitter, undrinkable . . .''\n       During an interview with U.S. military interrogators this \n     same detainee then stated that he would lead his tribe in \n     exacting revenge against the Saudi Arabian and U.S. \n     governments. ``I will arrange for the kidnapping and \n     execution of U.S. citizens living in Saudi Arabia. Small \n     groups of four or five U.S. citizens will be kidnapped, held, \n     and executed. They will have their heads cut off.''\n       After being informed of the Tribunal process, the detainee \n     replied, ``Not only am I thinking about threatening the \n     American public, but the whole world.''\n       A detainee who has been identified as a UBL bodyguard, \n     stated, ``It would be okay for UBL to kill Jewish persons. \n     There is no need to ask for forgiveness for killing a Jew. \n     The Jewish people kill Muslims in Palestine so it's okay to \n     kill Jews. Israel should not exist and be removed from \n     Palestine.''\n       A detainee who has been identified as UBL's ``spiritual \n     advisor'' and a relative of a fighter who attacked U.S. \n     Marines on Failaka Island, Kuwait on October 8, 2002, stated, \n     ``I pray everyday against the United States.'' This detainee \n     repeatedly stated, ``The United States government is \n     criminals.''\n       A detainee and self-confessed al Qaida member who produced \n     an al Qaida recruitment video stated, ``. . . the people who \n     died on 9/11/2001 were not innocent because they paid taxes \n     and participated in the government that fosters repression of \n     Palestinians.'' He also stated, ``. . . his group will shake \n     up the U.S. and countries who follow the U.S.'' and that, \n     ``it is not the quantity of power, but the quality of power, \n     that will win in the end.''\n       A detainee who has assaulted GTMO guards on over 30 \n     occasions, has made gestures of killing a guard and \n     threatened to break a guard's arm.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, one of them is Mullah Shazada who was \nreleased from Guantanamo Bay on May 8, 2003. He assumed control of \nTaliban operations in southern Afghanistan. His activities reported \nincluding the organization and execution of a jail break in Kandahar.\n  Abdullah Mahsud was released in 2004. He became the militant leader \nof the Mahsud tribe in southern Waziristan. We learned he had been \nassociated with the Taliban since his teens and has been described as \nan al-Qaida facilitator. In mid-October 2004, he directed the \nkidnapping of two Chinese engineers in Pakistan. During a Pakistani \nrescue attempt, the kidnappers shot one of the hostages.\n  Mohammed Ismail was one of two juveniles held at Guantanamo Bay. He \nwas released in 2004. During a press interview after his release, he \nthanked the United States for providing him education opportunities in \nGuantanamo Bay and stated he would look for work after visiting his \nrelatives. He was recaptured 4 months later in May 2004 participating \nin an attack on U.S. forces near Kandahar. At the time of his \nrecapture, Ismail carried a letter confirming his status as a Taliban \nmember in good standing.\n  Abdul Rahman Noor, after being released in July 2003, has \nparticipated in hostile actions against U.S. forces near Kandahar. He \nwas later identified as the person in a 2001 al-Jazerra interview \ndescribed a mujhadeen defensive position claiming to have downed an \nairplane.\n  The reason I mention these individuals is that mistakes have been \nmade in letting people go. Once the military tribunal reviewed these \nindividual cases, they made a determination the person was no longer a \ndanger to the United States and possessed no additional intelligence \nvalue. They were wrong.\n  These people and several others went back to the fight, and at least \none of the people involved killed an American medic.\n  The process we have at Guantanamo Bay is reform in a manner that I \nthink is consistent with American values. This body, in an overwhelming \nvote, indicated to the Department of Defense that their interrogation \ntechniques needed to be standardized and put in the Army Field Manual. \nThat is a work in process.\n  This body, in an overwhelming vote, gave every detainee at Guantanamo \nBay a right to petition their status to Federal court for Federal court \nreview.\n  We have due process rights in place for detainees at Guantanamo Bay \nthat I think are unprecedented in the rules of armed conflict and are \nbased on the fact that this is a war without a definable end.\n  But the amendment before us by my good friend from New Mexico would \nrequire this country to release the detainees en masse or repatriate \nthem or charge them. The problem with repatriation is that one of the \nproblems with closing Guantanamo Bay is, where do we put these people?\n  We have had case after case where the detainee was eligible to be \nreleased but did not want to go back to their host country for fear of \nreprisal. The idea that we can take the 460 prisoners and open the \ngates of the prison and say, Go back, is going to be a problem because \na lot of them have no place to go or won't be taken back.\n  Another problem is that if we release these people en masse, some of \nthem will become our worst nightmare. Information about statements made \nby detainees--I have another document here, where they openly avow a \ndesire to get back into the fight and to kill Americans and to continue \nthe war on terrorism.\n  Simply stated, the people at Guantanamo Bay, in my opinion, are \npeople who need to be looked at every year in terms of their status and \nwhether they have intelligence value and whether they present a danger. \nAnd that decision can be reviewed by civilian authorities.\n  They are not people for whom we should open the door and say, Leave \nor be charged, because the truth of the matter is that there are people \ndown\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\nthere who are enemy combatants who have not engaged in conduct that \nwould fit a traditional definition of a war crime.\n  I just don't think we need to make that choice. We need to make sure \nthat every detainee has adequately been processed, that our country is \naccountable for their treatment, that our country is accountable for \ntheir legal status, and that we have a way to prove to the world and to \nour own public that the detainees are being confined within the rules \nof armed conflict and treated properly.\n  This amendment would set in motion, I believe, forces that would come \nback to haunt us. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from New \nMexico, I understand his concerns about Guantanamo Bay and the image \nproblems that it has created, but I would argue that the reforms in \nwhich we have engaged have been real. We are not getting much credit \nfor those reforms, but we are just going to have to understand as a \nnation that every critic of this country's policy doesn't have to make \nthe decisions we do.\n  The criticism coming from abroad about Guantanamo Bay is part of \ndemocracies being able to speak openly, but they are not coming to \nSouth Carolina. If we let them go, they are not coming to South \nCarolina. I will do everything I can to keep these people from coming \ninto my home State. And I doubt we want them to go to Mexico, and I \ndoubt they are going to go to Connecticut.\n  I do not want to intermingle them with our military prison population \nbecause these people represent the hardest of the hard.\n  I hope we can reform Guantanamo Bay and that one day it will be \nclosed because the needs of the war on terrorism have been met. And I \ndo hope that those who are war criminals in the truest fashion will be \ntried at Guantanamo Bay by military commission and those who are not \nwar criminals will be held until they are no longer a danger. I do not \nbelieve it is advisable for this country to make a choice as a nation \nthat no other nation has ever had to make before, and that is turning \nloose someone who is caught on a battlefield engaged in hostilities \nagainst our own people or try them all as war criminals. That has never \nhappened before, and it shouldn't happen here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we now have an agreement for a couple \nof votes in the morning relative to the minimum wage amendments which \nhave been discussed this afternoon. Tomorrow we will also proceed to \ndebate the Iraq-related amendments offered by Senator Levin and Senator \nKerry.\n  Mr. President, at this point, on behalf of the leader, I am prepared \nto send a cloture motion to the desk, but I do want to make the \nfollowing point before sending the cloture motion to the desk. This \ndoes not--I repeat, does not--preclude us from working toward further \nagreement to set up votes on these amendments prior to cloture. In \nfact, we anticipate having votes on both of those amendments prior to \ncloture. We are looking forward to the debate on both amendments.\n  Almost everyone on this side is interested in speaking to the \nappropriateness of adopting those amendments, and, as I said, we do not \nintend for cloture to shut out in any way votes on the Kerry and Levin \namendments.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 2766, the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007.\n         Bill Frist, John Warner, John E. Sununu, Jim Bunning, \n           George Allen, Lamar Alexander, Craig Thomas, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison, Chuck Hagel, Ted Stevens,\n         Judd Gregg, Robert F. Bennett, Thad Cochran, Pat Roberts, \n           Pete Domenici, Jim Inhofe, Jeff Sessions.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly in response to \nthe comments of my colleague and friend from South Carolina, Senator \nGraham, about the amendment which I intend to offer at an appropriate \ntime on the Defense authorization bill.\n  I say, in all respect to the Senator from South Carolina, he has \ntotally misread the amendment. He has totally mischaracterized it. This \namendment does not, as he said, require the Government to either \nrelease everyone at Guantanamo or charge those individuals.\n  It is very clear in the amendment. It starts out by saying, ``Except \nas provided in subsection (b),'' and then it goes on to say:\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the \n     law, an alien who is detained by the Secretary of Defense \n     shall, consistent with applicable law, be charged or \n     repatriated or released.\n\n  But then obviously the exception is what we start out with there. It \nsays the exception under paragraph (b) is that with respect to an alien \ndescribed in the first section, subsection (a), who is not charged or \nrepatriated or released within this 180 days, the Secretary of Defense \nshall submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress a detailed \nreport as to each such alien that includes, and then it specifies the \ninformation that needs to be included.\n  Essentially, it says the Department of Defense shall go ahead and \ncharge these individuals with criminal activity or it shall repatriate \nthem to their home country, an appropriate country, or it shall release \nthem, or it shall give us a report and explain what its plans are with \nregard to these individuals and why it is not taking one of the \nprevious actions. That is not the characterization or the description \nthat the Senator from South Carolina just went through.\n  This amendment does not require that any enemy combatant be released. \nIt is clear in its language that it does not require that. It does not \nrequire the release of people ``en masse,'' which was the language the \nSenator from South Carolina used. It does not require us to release \npeople who are then believed to have the motivation of getting, as the \nSenator from South Carolina said, back into the fight.\n  This does not in any way restrict what the Department of Defense \ndoes. It just says the Department of Defense has various options, but \nwe are going to begin to understand what action the Department of \nDefense is taking with these individuals.\n  It can charge them with a crime, it can repatriate them to their home \ncountry, it can release them, or it can tell us, the Congress, the \nappropriate committees of the Congress, what it intends to do and what \naction and what factors cause it to not want to take one of those \nprevious actions. That is a very straightforward amendment.\n  I think anyone who is opposed to that amendment basically says we, \nthe Congress, have no responsibility for oversight, the appropriate \ncommittees of the Congress have no responsibility to concern themselves \nwith what is being done with these prisoners at Guantanamo, and I think \nthat is a very unfortunate message for us to send.\n  The amendment goes on to provide that in the report to the \nappropriate committees of the Congress, if the Department of Defense \nwishes to submit part or all of that in classified form, it can do so. \nTo the extent it is not required to be in classified form, it would, of \ncourse, be a public report.\n  This is a very modest amendment. In fact, the criticism I have heard \nfrom people who have generally been aware that I might offer this \namendment is: Why does this amendment give the Department of Defense an \nout? It says with regard to each of these individuals, either charge \nthem with a crime, repatriate them, release them, or tell us what your \nother plan is, if you have some other plan that you believe is required \nunder the circumstance. That is the very least that this Congress \nshould be doing with regard to these individuals.\n\n  I, frankly, do not want to ask this Congress to resolve the question \nof the legality of what is going on at Guantanamo. Some of that is \nbeing determined in the courts, as it should be determined in the \ncourts. But, clearly,\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\nthis Congress has some oversight responsibility. This Congress should \nbe insisting that the Department of Defense specify what action it \nintends to take, go ahead with whatever action it intends to take in \nthe next 180 days, and at the end of that time report to the Congress \nas to any detainee for whom it does not intend to go ahead or for whom \nit has not gone ahead and brought charges against or decided to \nrepatriate or decided to release.\n  So let me just stop with that. I am glad to discuss the amendment \nfurther, but I know that my colleague from Connecticut who has a \nseparate amendment dealing with Guantanamo wishes to speak and describe \nhis amendment, and I also see that my colleague from Alabama is on the \nSenate floor and wishes to speak perhaps on the same issue as well.\n  So, Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have been to Guantanamo twice, and I \nhave seen the work of our military personnel, the good morale they have \nunder difficult conditions, their determination to provide every decent \nand right request and treatment to the prisoners who are there. I have \nseen areas where they are detained, the religious freedom that they \ngive them, including a Koran and prayer rugs and things that they have \nrequested, the exercise that they obtain. It is, I believe, in all \nrespects a very fine prison that treats people in a decent way.\n  But as the Senator from South Carolina noted, these individuals are \nprisoners of war, and prisoners of war are not given trials. In the \nhistory of the United States of America, we do not give prisoners of \nwar trials. They are detained until the conflict is over.\n  What about those who have gone beyond just being a combatant against \nthe United States but have become an unlawful combatant, violating all \nthe rules of warfare and are therefore apprehended and detained? Should \nthey be given more rights than a properly uniformed and properly lawful \ncombatant is given who is detained by an enemy? I think not. I would \nsuggest these are matters that are within the parameters of the U.S. \nmilitary to handle. They have no desire to maintain a single prisoner \nany longer than they have to. They have released several hundred \nalready, and 15 of those have been rearrested on the battlefield where \nthey are presumably attempting to fight the United States of America \nand our soldiers and our allies around the world.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, these are not academic questions. \nThey are matters of real life and death and must be carefully thought \nthrough. Under the circumstances we are now dealing with regarding \nprisoners in Guantanamo, we don't need to micro-manage the military. I \nwould agree with Senator Bingaman that his amendment at first glance \nsays that they must be charged with a crime, filed in an appropriate \nFederal district court of the United States or a military tribunal or \nan international criminal tribunal or repatriated to the country of \norigin or some other country. That is a mandate. The amendment goes on \nto say: But with respect to those who are not so charged, the \nDepartment of Defense must submit a report saying why they haven't been \ncharged and when they will be handled in this matter. So I think in \nconflict, as Senator Graham has detailed, it goes to the historic \nmanner by which any nation, and in particular the United States, \nhandles prisoners of war.\n  Again, I have seen the conduct at Guantanamo. I think it is an \nappropriate facility considering the danger that these individuals \npose. It is an appropriate location. It makes it very difficult for \nthem to break free and kill other people. The Department of Defense \nactually is continuing to improve it. They give the prisoners first-\nrate meals, first-rate medical care. Until the three suicides we saw \nrecently, not a single prisoner had died in Guantanamo of any kind of \ncauses, natural or otherwise.\n  So I believe this amendment is not necessary. I think it would have \nthe effect of restricting the power of the executive branch to carry \nout this war on terrorism and manage the military's treatment of \nprisoners. The Department of Defense wants to get rid of them. They \nhave tried to repatriate numbers of them. But some of them are just \ndangerous and must be detained.\n  I would ask, how would a prosecutor prove a case? Some would say we \nwill just give them a trial. What if they were captured in the \nmountains of Afghanistan and maybe the soldier who captured them was \nlater killed, or maybe he was reassigned to Korea or some other place? \nIt is not so easy to have trials of prisoners of war, and that is why \nit has never been done and why I think the amendment, which is \ncarefully drafted and attempts to avoid some of the worst criticisms \nthat might be made of it, is, nevertheless, a step too far, and I \nbelieve we should reject it.\n  I just want to point out a number of things that are important about \nhow careful our military is, unlike what happens when American military \nprisoners are captured, apparently, as we saw today, the horror of \nbeing captured, tortured and killed by the al-Qaida forces in Iraq, who \nare just brutal in their treatment of American prisoners. We give the \nprisoners at Guantanamo a combatant status review tribunal--a tribunal \nconsisting of three people, the Department of Defense Combatant Status \nReview Tribunal process pursuant to a Supreme Court plurality opinion \nin Hamdi. Hamdi dealt with due process for American citizens. The \nprocess created was applied to all foreign nationals detained at \nGuantanamo and went beyond the process referred to by the Supreme Court \nof the United States. It went beyond that.\n\n  The Combatant Status Review Tribunal provides a venue for detainees \nto personally challenge their status as enemy combatants. They were \ngiven that opportunity. As of January 22, 2005, the Department of \nDefense had completed 558 CSRTs. Of the 558 hearings that were \nconducted, the enemy combatant status of 520 detainees was confirmed, \nand 38 detainees were found to be no longer meeting the criteria to be \ndesignated as enemy combatants.\n  The Administrative Review Board is another process the Department of \nDefense has implemented. This administrative review process makes an \nannual assessment of whether there is continued reason to believe that \nthe enemy combatant poses a threat to the United States or its allies, \nor whether there are factors bearing upon the need or the continued \ndetention, including the enemy combatant's intelligence value, in the \nglobal war on terror. That is what this board does every year for every \nprisoner.\n  Based on this assessment, the Administrative Review Board can \nrecommend that individuals should be released or should be transferred \nwith conditions or should continue to be detained. Allowing detained \nenemy fighters to be heard and potentially released or transferred \nwhile hostilities are ongoing, as they are this very minute in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, is a historic and unprecedented step. We have never done \nthat before in war.\n  The first year, the Administrative Review Board resulted in 330 \ncontinue-to-detain decisions, 119 transfer decisions, and 14 release \ndecisions. So these are not rubber stamps. The Department of Defense is \nattempting to move people out, to transfer them, or release the people \nthey can justify releasing. But remember, 15 of those former prisoners \nat Guantanamo, who have been released, have later been detained and \ncaptured on the battlefield seeking to fight America.\n  The second year of the Administrative Review Board process, in this \nannual process, resulted thus far in 12 continue-to-detain decisions, 6 \ntransfer decisions, and no release decisions. That is as of June 20 of \nthis year.\n  So the Department of Defense has created a system that goes beyond \nwhat this Nation has ever utilized in time of war to deal with an \nattempt to release persons who have been captured as prisoners of war \nfighting the United States of America. They didn't do that for German \nprisoners. They didn't do it for Japanese prisoners. They didn't do it \nfor North Korean prisoners. They didn't do it for Vietnamese prisoners. \nThese are unprecedented steps. I think it is more than is required, but \nit is a generous step for the United States to take, and I certainly \nsupport that.\n  Mr. President, as of May of 2006, 287 detainees have departed \nGuantanamo,\n\n[[Page S6144]]\n\n192 have been released, 95 have been transferred to other governments, \nincluding Albania, Afghanistan, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Denmark, \nFrance, Great Britain, Kuwait, Morocco, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, \nSpain, Sweden, and Uganda. We would like to release them all, if we \ncould.\n  But the President of the United States took an oath to protect the \npeople of the United States from attack by enemies. If he releases \nprisoners who we believe will have any reasonable basis to continue to \nattempt to kill American citizens or American soldiers, he is derelict \nin his duty. This is not some game he is playing. This is not some \nacademic process that the generals who are supervising this are \ninvolved in or the Administrative Review Board members or the Combatant \nStatus Review Tribunals are dealing with. They can't make a mistake. If \nthey make a mistake, somebody could die.\n  I know the operations at Guantanamo have raised complaints from some \nof our allies, specifically a complaint from one British official. I am \nso proud of the support the British government and population has shown \nto the United States, but I have to tell you, I don't know what the man \nexpected us to do. Did he want us to release all 500 of them? Is that \nwhat he would want? Is that what the other people on our editorial \nboards like to write about? We should just release them? Well, maybe \nGreat Britain would like to take them. Maybe the United Kingdom would \nlike to take them and house them in their jails. Would they really? \nWould they release them? Would they want to release them on their \nsubways or on their buses or on their trains in London?\n  Three prisoners just committed suicide last week at Guantanamo, and \namazingly, we had newspapers in this great Nation that purport to be \nwise and thoughtful pandering to those seeking to close Guantanamo by \nsuggesting that they are somehow killing themselves because they are \ndepressed.\n  One of these was an active member of the Taliban forces who fought \nagainst the United States. One was a recognized leader in al-Qaida--\nthey are from Yemen and Saudi Arabia and other places. I believe two \nwere from Saudi Arabia and one was from Yemen. Do we want to release \nprisoners like these?\n  They hanged themselves. I suggest, with all sincerity, that these \nthree prisoners did not commit suicide together, the same day, because \nthey got depressed over mistreatment. Most of them have gained weight \nand have been well treated, well fed, and given superb medical care. \nThat is not why they committed suicide. They committed suicide as a \ncontinuation of their commitment to jihad and to prepare to commit \nsuicide to further jihad.\n  If they had a bomb with which they could have blown themselves up and \nothers, Americans or other people, they would have done that. They \nabsolutely would have done that. But because they were in our custody \nand couldn't get hold of a bomb and wrap it around their body and kill \nmen, women and children on buses or trains or something like that. The \nonly thing they could do was kill themselves in hopes they would have \neditorials around the world, editorials in New York City and \nWashington, DC, have Senators and Congressmen on the floor of the House \nand the Senate saying how badly we are treating these prisoners of war, \nthese unlawful combatants, and suggesting they all ought to be turned \nloose and how this is America's fault.\n  The fact that these three prisoners, clearly terrorists, committed \nsuicide the same day is absolute proof that they were threats to \ninnocent people and to the United States of America. It is proof that \nthey had that threat capability. If they had been released, do you \nthink they would have just gone nicely back home to work a job in Yemen \nor work on a pipeline in Saudi Arabia? No, they are committed \njihadists. They are terrorists. That is why they were in Guantanamo. I \nam glad they hadn't been released like some of the others and I am glad \nthat those like them are still being detained there. They are not \nentitled to trial.\n  I don't know what we will do with Guantanamo. The President said he \nwould like to close it. I guess it would make some people happy around \nthe world. Maybe they would get off his back. But somebody has to do \nsomething with them. I will tell you one thing, we can't release them \nall. Do we release them any better if they are brought back to the \nUnited States? Do we release them any better if we take them over to \nLondon or Madrid? I submit not. We have them in a safe place. They are \nbeing well taken care of. We have invested a lot of the taxpayers' \nmoney in making that facility at Guantanamo a good facility, a safe \nfacility. I don't know why we would want to move them, other than just \nto make people feel better and stop fussing.\n  But we are going to continue to apprehend people. When we went out \nafter the bombing of Zarqawi and did these raids in 17 different spots \nand they arrested quite a number of people, what are they going to do \nwith them? Turn them loose?\n  When I was in Iraq recently, I heard about two brothers who were \nknown bomb makers. Can you imagine someone a greater target of the \nUnited States military than a skilled bomb maker who is making bombs \nthat kill American soldiers on a regular basis? They caught them and \nthey thought they had enough proof. But the military decided they \ndidn't. Or the court or somebody did, and they turned them loose.\n  I am telling you, those military personnel and the civilians that \nworked with them to help build that case and to identify these bombers \nwere really heartbroken. It was very painful for them to have to \nrelease somebody whom they believed had been responsible for killing \ninnocent civilians in Iraq and American soldiers. But we didn't have \nenough proof, apparently, and we let them go.\n  We don't need to keep pushing the military, pushing that you have to \nhave proof beyond a reasonable doubt like you have to before you can \nlock up an American citizen--let's not put that kind of burden on our \nmilitary.\n  I think this Guantanamo matter is greatly overblown. We fail to \nrealize just how dangerous some of the prisoners are. Hopefully, we can \nsift through them and find some more who are not dangerous and they can \nbe released. Hopefully, we can send them back to foreign countries. But \nyou know, when you send them back to a foreign country, things don't \nalways work out right. You turn around and 6 months later, 2 years \nlater, they are released. Or sometimes we have Members of the Senate \nwho have made speeches and complained because, if we send them back to \ntheir home countries, the home countries realize they are terrorists, \nmaybe even applied those tactics against their country, and they \nmistreat them. Now we are blamed for some treatment by a foreign \ngovernment where we sent these prisoners.\n  We were aggressive in interviewing prisoners at the outset of opening \nGuantanamo. We had a very good briefing last time I was there where the \npeople said they really reduced the intensity of interrogations. In the \nweeks and days following September 11 when we thought and had every \nreason to believe that there were cells probably operating all over \nthis country, the military and our intelligence people were aggressive \nin asking questions of them and pursuing interrogations. They did not \ntorture them. I do not believe there has been a single allegation that \nhas been substantiated of any torture at Guantanamo. But people took it \nfarther and said the military was too harsh with these prisoners. So \nfor a whole lot of reasons we don't pursue those tactics as strongly \ntoday.\n  The standards are very lax in that regard--or strong in the sense \nthat prisoners are not stressed and not abused in any way as they are \nbeing interrogated. In fact, just the opposite is the case. \nOccasionally, it is odd, after time goes by, somebody begins to talk. \nSome people never talk.\n  I appreciate the interest of my colleagues in wanting to run the \ncleanest prison system we possibly can, to comply with the highest \nideals of the United States. I believe if they went there and examined \nwhat was going on they would conclude, with me, that the prisoners are \nbeing treated well, that they are being given every help and dietary \nand religious values that they need. We should continue to do that.\n\n  Sometime in the future we will have to wrestle with how we are going \nto handle them and maybe we can continue to repatriate them to the \ncountries of origin. Maybe some actually\n\n[[Page S6145]]\n\nought to be tried and executed. Others simply need to be detained until \nthe war is over. That is just the way it is, and that is the way it has \nalways been.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the comments of others about Guantanamo Bay \nand the individuals who are being held here. I listened to the \ndiscussion earlier between the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, \nand my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nSessions from Alabama, who discussed the issue of those who are being \ndetained in Guantanamo and the very facility itself.\n  I had thought about offering an amendment on this matter, but it is \ngetting confusing, with the number of amendments being offered tomorrow \nand the length of debate. Senator Bingaman is offering an amendment \nwhich I think is worthy of consideration. I may withhold the amendment \nI intended to offer until a later time, on another matter, when there \nis more of an opportunity to have debate. There is at best only a \nlimited amount of time we may get tomorrow for discussion. I have been \ntold I might have only a few minutes.\n  I regret that. I wish we had more time to offer this amendment. But I \nthink in the interests of my colleagues here, given the seriousness of \nthe issue, it probably deserves more time. So, I will reserve offering \nthat amendment until another time when we have more of an opportunity \nto discuss it.\n  Let me, if I can, discuss some issues that have been raised here this \nevening that I think are important. I have listened to my colleagues \ntalk about, first of all, the individuals being held in Guantanamo. We \ntalk about people here, some of whom clearly have the very worst \nintentions for the United States. Some of these individuals have \nattacked our soldiers, attacked innocent citizens, and pose serious \nthreats. There is no debate about that. We are not arguing about \nwhether or not that is true for many of these people.\n  There may, obviously, be some exceptions that fall out of that \ncategory--individuals who have been improperly retained or restrained \nand sent to Guantanamo or elsewhere. That certainly may be the case. \nBut there is no question that many of these individuals are people to \nworry about. That is not the issue.\n  The issue is: We are a nation of laws. We say this all the time. It \nis something about which we take great pride. We have celebrated it \nover and over again. It is one of the distinguishing features of this \ngreat country of ours. We proved that we are a nation of laws \ncategorically 60 years ago this very year when, in a different set of \ncircumstances, the United States, along with our allies, some of whom \nreluctantly joined us in this effort, held a series of trials in a \nplace called Nuremberg. We made the decision at Nuremberg that the \ndefendants in those trials--these thugs, these people who had murdered \n11 million innocents, 6 million Jews because of their religion, not to \nmention the millions more who lost their lives as a result of the Nazi \nwar effort--would be afforded a trial instead of just being summarily \nexecuted. Winston Churchill advocated summary execution, and many \nothers did as well. Why would you possibly give these defendants, it \nwas asked--these thugs that I have mentioned, who carried out the \norders of Adolph Hitler--why would you give them a trial? Why would \nthey get a lawyer? Why would they be allowed to present evidence in a \ncourt of law?\n  It was the conclusion of the United States, under the leadership of \npeople like Justice Robert Jackson, that the rule of law should be \nparamount. Justice Jackson and others argued very strongly that it was \ngoing to be critically important that the United States and others join \nin showing the world that there is a difference between these \nfascists--who had summarily executed people merely because of their \nethnicity or religion--and this great country of ours.\n  In fact, Nuremberg was an interesting choice for the venue of those \ntrials. In a sense, the Nazis chose Nuremberg. The Nuremberg Laws \ncreated a legal justification for every atrocity they committed, and so \nhaving a trial at Nuremberg, trying the very people who perpetrated \nthese crimes, was somehow a fitting coincidence.\n  I speak about this because as a child growing up I heard night after \nnight my father, who was the Executive Trial Counsel under Robert \nJackson at Nuremberg, speak of these days. I was 1 year old in the \nsummer of 1945 when my father left for a few short weeks merely to be \nan interrogator of these defendants at Nuremberg. He ended up replacing \nJudge Story as Executive Trial Counsel under Robert Jackson, and spent \na year and a half trying a number of defendants at Nuremberg. He wrote \nmy mother every single day 15 to 20-page letters describing in great \ndetail his views and thoughts about the defendants and our allies in \nthat effort, the Russians, the British, the French. He had some choice \nthoughts about a number of those people who were at Nuremberg. And he \ntalked to his children growing up over the years about what happened at \nNuremberg.\n  There was a great debate. In fact, half of the Supreme Court argued \nagainst Robert Jackson even going. There were colleagues here who \nargued that it was ex post facto juris prudence--that we had no right \nto go back and create a body of law to try the defendants at Nuremberg.\n  My father and others argued strenuously that the natural law should \nrequire that individuals who had committed such crimes--who had \ncommitted summary executions based on religion or ethnicity--that these \npeople should be taken to task for what they had done, but also, \ncritically, be afforded rights--the right to a fair trial, the right to \nhave legal representation.\n  Imagine--people like Goering and von Ribbentrop and Keitel and Speer \nand others--actually be given a lawyer to represent them in a trial, so \nthat they could stand up and make a case for themselves, as Goering did \nfor days on end at Nuremberg.\n  Obviously, the facts are different here. At Nuremberg, the war was \nover. There was a different set of circumstances. I would be the first \nto acknowledge it.\n  That is not the comparison I am trying to draw. The comparison I am \ntrying to draw here is about the rule of law.\n  We can characterize these individuals at Guantanamo in words that \nnone of us are going to terribly argue about. But I come back to the \npoint that those who were at Nuremberg, who made the case for the trial \nsuch as I described, need to be heard again today, 60 years later.\n  We are a nation of laws. We are different. We are not like these \npeople who are being held at Guantanamo. The rule of law is something \nwe cherish in this country, even to the point where we are willing to \nstand up and defend the rights of people who do things we find \nabhorrent.\n  Whenever I talk to students about the Bill of Rights and the first \namendment, I tell them that it doesn't just protect their rights when \nthey say something I agree with. It is important also to protect those \nindividuals who stand up and say something I totally disagree with or \nfind obnoxious, to put it mildly.\n  That is the rule of law. That is what makes us different. That is \nwhat distinguishes us.\n  What has happened already is that there is confusion. Are these \nprisoners of war? If they are, obviously the Geneva Conventions \nprevail. If they are not prisoners of war but enemy combatants, the \nSupreme Court has ruled already that they have certain rights, that \nthey have a right to appeal that status. Yet, we find that a \nsubstantial number of these people are being held without any \ndefinition of who they are, what their status is legally, whether or \nnot they are POWs, enemy combatants, or something else.\n  When Senator Bingaman offers his language here to get some clarity, \nwhy is that important? I think it is important because we are, again, a \nnation of laws. We determine that people ought to be given one status \nor another. We need some clarity as to who these individuals are and \nhow they are going to be dealt with.\n  Why do I say that? First, because we ought to care, particularly in \nthis a\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\nbody, the U.S. Senate, that the rule of law is defended. But second, \nand not unimportant, is the question of how we are being perceived in \nthe fight against terrorism--something that requires international \ncooperation. It is critically important that the United States not only \nlead on this issue but that other nations around the world and their \ncitizenry following us, join us, if you will, in this effort.\n  Today, as I speak about this issue--unfortunate symbols are \nimportant. Guantanamo has become a symbol of things that have gone \nwrong without clarity, without definition, and that lack of clarity is \nhurting our cause.\n  As we try to build a coalition, it is crucial that we win support for \nwhat we are trying to achieve. Without allies in this effort, we will \nnever ever win this war on terrorism. It is a transnational problem \nthat insists upon a transnational response.\n  It is critically important that we understand the necessity of \nbuilding the kind of relationships that are going to be absolutely \ncritical if we are going to succeed in this effort, as I believe we \nmust. We have no choice but to succeed in this effort.\n  But to disregard the feelings or sentiments of others on whom we must \nsupport and depend in the future, if we are going to succeed in this \neffort, is something that ought not to be lost on the membership of \nthis institution.\n  I am deeply concerned about the direction we are heading here, one \nthat is lacking clarity, any clarity at all, in dealing with these \nindividuals that are being held. What is their status? Is it one thing \nor do we need a determination of that.\n  The administration I think bears the responsibility to come forward \nand say what the status is. Just saying we are going to hold people \nwithout some clarity is not good enough. If you want to hold them, \nfine. Decide what they are. Are they prisoners of war? If they are, \nthen that is one set of circumstances. If they are not prisoners of war \nbut enemy combatants, that is a different set of criteria that applies. \nBut the rule of law must apply.\n  The criticism we are receiving here is that again we just do not have \nany definition. This ought not be an issue that divides us and people \ntrying to inflame the passions of others: Who cares more about \nterrorism or who is willing to stand up and fight against terrorism \nmore than anyone else. That is not the issue. The issue is the rule of \nlaw which joins people of different political persuasions but of like \nmind about insisting that the rule of law be applied. That has never \ndivided us. When we move that important criteria, that important \ndefinition of who we are as Americans--the rule of law--and engage in \nthis sort of demagogic debate about who cares more about terrorism, or \nyou don't care about terrorism at all, if you are only willing to talk \nabout the rule of law, that somehow makes you weak on this issue, that \nyou lack the kind of conviction and spine when it comes to dealing with \nterrorists because you start talking about the rule of law, how strong \nan American are you, if you only get up and talk about the rule of law?\n  We have all learned painfully when you begin to disregard the rule of \nlaw because you don't like the individuals that you want to apply it \nto, it comes back to hurt all of us.\n  Those who made the case more than 50 years ago at another place in \nanother set of circumstances but facing the same criticism--the \nemotional response was certainly warranted. The Nazis brutalized \npeople, incinerated millions, and certainly lit passions that said, Why \nwould you ever give that kind of individual a lawyer and a right to \npresent a case? And you can understand the emotions that people felt at \nthe time--to give them the right to present a case? Did they ever give \nany of their victims a right to present a case in the incinerators of \nBuchenwald or Dachau? They never did. Why should we do it now?\n  Because people stood up and said we are different than they are. That \nis why we insist upon the rule of law.\n  Today, we need to remind ourselves--conservative, liberals, \ncentrists--who we are. The rule of law unites us. It ought not divide \nus when we have these debates and discussions.\n  Guantanamo has unfortunately become a symbol of things that need to \nchange.\n  The President himself, to his credit, a week or so ago in a press \nconference on June 14, acknowledged that fact. He said:\n\n       No question, Guantanamo sends . . . a signal to some of our \n     friends . . . provides an excuse, for example, to say, ``The \n     United States is not upholding the values that they're trying \n     to encourage other countries to adhere to.'' He also stated \n     clearly that he ``would like to close Guantanamo.''\n\n  That was the President of the United States. I am not making a case \non my own. He recognizes what is happening with the symbol of \nGuantanamo, and how difficult it is to build the kind of relationships \nthat are critical if we are going to succeed as we must in this war \nagainst terrorism.\n  I am not going to be offering an amendment. I think there is not \nadequate time to debate and discuss these things at this late hour in \nthe evening. But I will find an opportunity at the appropriate time to \nraise the issue.\n  I hope we can build a broad, bipartisan consensus on these points. We \nought not have division over the rule of law; to get clarification \nabout how we talk about POWs, enemy combatants, and what the status of \nthese people is because different sets of rules apply. Having no status \nat all and not fitting into one category or another is something that \nought to be unacceptable to all of us.\n  I think having a facility that has become the symbol of something \nwhich none of us believe we stand for--we know we stand for the rule of \nlaw, we know we believe in that, and we embrace it--is raising serious \nreservations and concerns among people who ought to be joining us in \nthis effort. If that is the case, as General McCaffrey said in talking \nabout Guantanamo, close it down. He said he would like to close it \ndown, and others believe as well that we ought to find other venues to \ndeal with these issues as well as, of course, determining the legal \nstatus of these individuals so we can move on and again build the kind \nof coalitions necessary to have a successful coalition to fight the war \non terrorism.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the eloquent remarks of my \ncolleague and his sharing of insight into Nuremberg and a number of \nthoughts that he shared with us about the rule of law, which I think is \nvery important.\n  I note that at Nuremberg they tried and executed quite a number of \npeople who conducted their war unfairly, in an unlawful way and went \nbeyond being prisoners of war. They were, in fact, tried for crimes \nthat they had committed.\n  I also say to my colleague with great sincerity that we are \nrespecting the rule of law. These individuals that are caught and held \nat Guantanamo, some may qualify as a prisoner of war, many do not. They \nare what I have called--others used enemy combatants--unlawful \ncombatants because they were carrying out combat in an unlawful way. \nThey did not carry arms openly. They did not wear a uniform. They moved \nsurreptitiously. They killed randomly women, children--actions that \ndeny them the status of a lawful combatant and a prisoner of war. They \nare then held, if nothing else, certainly with legal protection because \nthe Geneva Conventions cover people who are lawful combatants, who wage \nwar for legitimate nations in a legitimate way.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it is an \ninteresting point. Going back, there was a body of law that had emerged \nprior to Nuremberg that, in fact, those who advocated that there should \nbe a trial at Nuremberg relied on a point. But one of the great crimes \nthat was argued against was crimes against humanity at Nuremberg. Many \nargued that this was sort of making it out of whole cloth. I don't \nthink it was. But that was debated at the time.\n  The people who my colleague described as committing crimes against \nhumanity, it clearly seems that those who were not enemy combatants in \nthe\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\ntraditional definition of that word but engaged in the kind of \nbrutality against humanity, today there is a codified body of laws that \nwould certainly make those people subject to international law let \nalone our own kind of crimes.\n  The point I am trying to make is, it just gives it some clarity. What \nare they? What is the legal status in that category? If you are a POW, \nthere is one set of laws that apply. If you are an enemy combatant, \nthere is a set of laws and regulations that apply. If you are a non-\nenemy combatant and have engaged in the very activities my colleague \ndescribed, what is the law that applies to those individuals under \nthose circumstances? There is no status at all being attributed to \nthese people. They are in limbo. That is what I am concerned about.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I certainly respect the Senator's \nthoughts about that. I must follow up a little bit.\n  First, what happened at Nuremberg happened after the war was over.\n  Mr. DODD. I agree.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We held German prisoners in the northern campus of the \nUniversity of Alabama where I lived when I was in law school. They had \nGerman prisoners there during World War II.\n  But what I want to try to reassure my colleague about is that we do \nhave a proper procedure that is ongoing. For example, we have defined \nthese as combatants. We give them a combatant status review tribunal \nwhen they come in. They are reviewed in that fashion. They have a \nthree-judge panel. They actually go beyond the requirements that the \nU.S. Supreme Court said in the Hamdi case.\n  In addition to that, they created an Administrative Review Board \nthat, on an annual basis, must make an assessment of whether there is \ncontinued reason to believe that the enemy combatant poses a threat to \nthe United States or its allies, or whether there are other factors \nbearing upon the need for the kind of detention, including its enemy \ncombatant intelligence value in the gulf war on terrorism.\n  For example, in the first year of those Administrative Review Board \nhearings, there were 330 decisions to continue to detain the prisoners, \n119 decisions to transfer them to other jurisdictions, other countries \nperhaps, or possibly other countries, and 14 release decisions. This \nsecond year, to date, the review board had 12 findings of continued to \ndetain, 6 transfers, and no release decisions.\n\n  At least there is a procedure. In response to criticisms in the \nCongress, around the word, in response to the Supreme Court decision, \nthey have taken it carefully because the military is proud of its \nstandards. The military wants to do this right. But they have a \nresponsibility not to release those who should not be released as they \ncontinue to pose a threat to the security of our Nation.\n  Mr. DODD. If my friend will yield further, I am sure he is a good \nlawyer. In the Rasul v. Bush case in 2004, of course, the Supreme Court \nruled ``a state of war is not a blank check for the President,'' and \n``enemy combatants have the right to challenge their detention before a \njudge or other neutral decisionmaker.''\n  That took a court case basically going to the highest Court of our \nland--I don't know what the ruling was, 5 to 4 or 6 to 3--and they \nruled in that case enemy that combatants have a judicial right to \nchallenge their status.\n  All I am saying, I am not trying to determine the outcome, just what \nis the status for the people to be detained or moved other places.\n  Our highest Court has said it is not a blank check, that they have a \nright to make a case. I don't want to be seen as perceiving--because I \nam saying they have a right to make a case, do I like these people? Am \nI trying to befriend them? I am saying the rule of law has to apply.\n  We are different. That is what makes us different from these people. \nThese people would never give their victims a right to a judicial \nsystem proceeding as they engage in the kind of activity my colleague \nfrom Alabama properly described.\n  What makes my colleague from Alabama, and I hope myself and our \ncolleagues, different is this very point the Supreme Court made. Even \nthese enemy combatants have the right to make a case before a judge or \nother ``neutral decisionmaker,'' that the state of war is not a blank \ncheck for the President. That is the point I am trying to make. I am \nnot trying to characterize the people in any other way than what my \ncolleague has described.\n  The point the Senator and I need to come together on is the rule of \nlaw. That is all I am trying to suggest. I don't have an amendment to \noffer, but we have to find this common ground on this issue because it \nis who we are. It is what we want the world to know and appreciate what \nthe United States is. That is really what did so much for us in the \nwake of World War II where we became this symbol of nations that rise \nabove their passions and their emotions.\n  He is absolutely right on Nuremberg. Several people got limited \nsentences, some got off, and many got executed, as they should have, \nbut it went through a legal process. To read those transcripts, where \npeople went on and talked as Goering--I am tempted to draw the \ncomparison of Goering to Saddam Hussein, who talks endlessly. Goering \ndid almost the same, and there was concern by some that he might have \ngotten away had it not been for a very aggressive prosecution.\n  It was the rule of law, and how proud these people were that showed \nthe world--and the United States led--we were different.\n  The fact situations are very different between the end of a conflict \nand an ongoing conflict and how you deal with it, but the rule of law \ndoes deserve stronger support than I am afraid we are giving. That is \nmy concern.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  I believe care has been taken to comply with the Supreme Court cases. \nThe Department of Defense has gotten the system in a way that has a \ncombatant status review tribunal and an administrative review board, \nand there have been multiple hearings. The Department is giving these \nprisoners--whether they are prisoners of war, lawful or unlawful \ncombatants who are being detained--the rights to which they are \nentitled. I really do believe they have.\n  That is the only concern I have about the perception that might be \nout there, even around the world, that we are acting outside the rule \nof law. I do not believe that is so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6147-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, on June 20, 1863, a new State was added to \nthe Union. Today, 143 years later, we celebrate the birthday of West \nVirginia. I am always happy to have an excuse to share my love for West \nVirginia with the rest of the Nation.\n  The story of West Virginia is unique and fascinating, a one-of-a-kind \njuxtaposition of geography, history, and politics. It is a story as \ninteresting as the State is beautiful.\n  The steeply folded mountain ridges that define the southern edge of \nthe State, and her rich mineral and natural treasures that more than \nmade up for her paucity of flat agricultural terrain, defined her early \nyears and set her apart socially and economically from the rest of \nVirginia. West Virginia's natural attributes attracted a hardy, can-do \nbreed of opportunistic settlers determined to scratch a living for \ntheir families from her rocky hillsides. They mined salt and coal, \nhunted and trapped, and cut small family farms out of the hillsides. \nThese mountaineers had little in common with the gentrified, land-\nowning and slave-owning plantation masters of eastern Virginia's \ntidewater and piedmont regions. Thus, even as the issue of slavery \nbegan to strain the relations between the Nation's industrial North and \nher agricultural South, the contrasts within Virginia were sharp.\n  A child of conflict, West Virginia's birth was surprisingly peaceful. \nBefore the Civil War, the Commonwealth of Virginia was a large State, \nfraught with its own internal divisions, based\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\nlargely on geography and economics. The eastern coastal plains and \npiedmont regions, with their large plantation economies, had much in \ncommon with the secessionist Southern States, while the mountainous \nBlue Ridge and Appalachian western portions of the State were populated \nby small farmers and woodsmen who had little use for the practice of \nslavery. Thus, when the convention was held in Richmond, VA, on April \n17, 1861, to decide on Union or secession, the farmers and businessmen \nof western Virginia held with the North on the slavery question and the \neastern half of the State held with the South. The matter was put to a \nstatewide vote. Led by Clarksburg's John S. Carlile, Western delegates \nmarched out of the Secession Convention and vowed to form a State \ngovernment loyal to the Union.\n  From May 13-15, 1861, another convention was held, this one in \nWheeling. Delegates from western Virginia decided to wait for the \nresults of the statewide vote, which approved Virginia's secession from \nthe Union on May 23. After the statewide vote, it was proposed that \ndelegates from the western counties be elected to a convention to \ndecide the matter for themselves. The convention, conducted in Wheeling \nfrom June 11-25, 1861, established a Restored, or Reorganized \nGovernment of Virginia. Francis H. Pierpont was elected Governor. \nPresident Lincoln recognized the Restored Government as the legitimate \ngovernment of Virginia, and senators and representatives were chosen to \nrepresent the pro-Union Virginia.\n  In October 1861, residents of 39 counties in western Virginia \napproved the formation of a new Unionist State. A Constitutional \nConvention met in Wheeling from November 1861 to February 1862. At the \nconvention, delegates selected counties to be included in the new \nState. In all, 50 counties were selected. Five additional West Virginia \ncounties--Mineral, Grant, Lincoln, Summers, and Mingo--were formed \nafter statehood to bring the total number of counties in West Virginia \nto its current 55.\n  Some eastern and southern counties did not support statehood but were \nincluded in the new State for political, military, or economic reasons. \nThe mountain range west of the Blue Ridge became the eastern border of \nthe new State, to provide a natural barrier to a Confederate invasion \nwhich many feared. The secessionist Eastern Panhandle counties were \nincluded in order to control the important Baltimore and Ohio railroad \nline. The inclusion of secessionist counties in the new State made for \na certain amount of tension and any number of fascinating war stories.\n  Perhaps the most interesting war story involves the proclamation of \nWest Virginia as a State. The U.S. Constitution requires that a new \nState gain approval for its establishment from the original State, \nwhich did not happen in the case of West Virginia. Virginia had seceded \nfrom the Union and was not, in any case, receptive to the idea of \nlosing any part of its territory to the Union. Since President Lincoln \nhad recognized the Restored Government of Virginia as the legal \ngovernment of Virginia, it granted permission to itself on May 13, \n1862, to form the State of West Virginia.\n  The U.S. Congress approved the West Virginia statehood bill after \namending it to assure that another slave State was not created. The \nSenate passed the West Virginia Statehood Act on July 14, 1862, and on \nDecember 10, 1862, the House of Representatives followed suit. \nPresident Lincoln signed the bill into law on December 31, 1862. On \nMarch 26, 1863, the citizens of the 50 counties approved the statehood \nbill, and on June 20, West Virginia was officially established. The \nRestored Government of Virginia, with Pierpont continuing as Governor, \nmoved to Alexandria, VA, from Wheeling, now that Wheeling was no longer \nin Virginia but in West Virginia.\n  The naming of West Virginia was also up for debate. Several \npossibilities were debated, including Kanawha, New Virginia, Western \nVirginia, Alleghany, Columbia, and Augusta, before the name of West \nVirginia was adopted by a majority of 30 votes. The runner up was \nKanawha, which garnered just nine votes, including that of Mister James \nHenry Brown of Kanawha.\n  Mr. President, these few facts are but a drop of water in the lake of \nWest Virginia's history. I invite the Nation to come and discover more \nin person. Our history runs deep, from the fossils hidden in the coal \nseams and rocks to the misnamed New River, which is, ironically, among \nthe oldest rivers on the continent. There are historic sites across the \nState from frontier forts to Revolutionary War and Civil War \nbattlegrounds.\n  West Virginia boasts an extensive park system that preserves the \nnatural beauty of the State for all to enjoy. Fairs and festivals \ncelebrate food from apple butter, blackberries, ramps, grapes, molasses \nand maple syrup. Sternwheelers, dulcimers, and even George Washington's \nbathtub merit their own festivals. People are not ignored, either, as \nfestivals celebrate pioneers and indians, Black history and Celtic \nculture, as well as the heritage of counties and countries from Ireland \nto Italy, Greece to Lebanon. Music, from Appalachian string bands to \nbluegrass to gospel, comes in for its share of the fun. And the great \nnatural treasures of West Virginia are not forgotten. There are \nfestivals and jubilees for trees, rivers, birds, mountains, marble, \ncoal, oil and gas, and even monarch butterflies. One can hardly mention \nWest Virginia without thinking of the State's great craftsmen and \nwomen, renowned for stunning handmade products that are featured in \nmany fairs and festivals as well as being available throughout the \nState in galleries and studios. Quilts, carvings, paintings, pottery \nand glass are but a few of the selections.\n  Larger commercial firms are also famous for their fine artistry. In \nhonor of West Virginia's birthday, each year the Blenko Glass Company \nof Milton, WV, produces a limited number of special edition pieces--the \nnumber equaling the number of years the State is celebrating. The 2006 \nedition consists of 143 glass vases, each 11 inches high in a blending \njungle green base that fades to a topaz gold mouth, rimmed in cobalt. \nThe beautiful commemorative vase this year was designed by Hank Murta \nAdams. What a lovely way to mark a special day.\n  West Virginia is a special place. It may seem a little out of the \nway, but it is surprisingly close to many of the population centers on \nthe east coast. It is full of quiet, peaceful spots--small towns with \nfriendly people and breathtaking vistas of scenic beauty. It has \nchurches and music, small farms and mills, rushing whitewater and still \nponds. West Virginia is a place for family exploration, a place where \nit is easy to pull off the road and reenter the past, to stop and meet \na craftsman at work, or just to eat a sandwich under a shady tree \nbeside a cool stream. The more adventurous families might enjoy some of \nthe whitewater rafting that West Virginia is famous for, or rock \nclimbing, or paddling a canoe down a river canyon while watching for \neagles overhead. You do not need to go on a crowded, canned cruise or \nto a hot, line-filled amusement park to find enjoyment. Just come to \nWest Virginia and you will learn to love it as I do.\n  Roy Lee Harmon wrote a poem about West Virginia that I would like to \nclose with. Roy Lee Harmon was from Boone County and lived in Beckley \nfor many years. He held the post of State Poet Laureate from 1937 until \n1978, some 41 years, becoming the Poet Laureate Emeritus in 1979. He \nwrote six books of poetry before he died in 1981. In his last book, \npublished in 1978, he noted that after suffering from a long illness, \nwhen he died, ``I shall thank God of all creation who has allowed me to \nlive so long in my beloved hills of West Virginia and write my poems.'' \nI wish the State and all of her inhabitants, my beloved Mountaineers, \nbest wishes for another year of happiness in their mountain fastness. \nHappy Birthday, West Virginia, and may God continue to bless you for \nanother 143 years.\n\n                             West Virginia\n\n     This was no land for lily-fingered men\n     Who bowed and danced a neat quadrille,\n     In towns and cities far beyond the ken\n     Of mountaineers--who loved each rock and rill.\n\n     It was a place for lean, tall men with love\n     For freedom flowing strongly in their veins,\n     For those attuned to vagrant stars above,\n     To rugged peaks, deep snows, and June-time rains.\n\n     And so our State was whelped in time of strife\n     And cut its teeth upon a cannon ball;\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\n     Its heritage was cleaner, better life,\n     Within the richest storehouse of them all.\n\n     With timber, oil and gas and salt and coal,\n     It bargained in the world's huge marketplace.\n     The mountain empire reached a mighty goal;\n     It never ran a pauper's sordid race.\n\n     And best of all, it sire a hardy flock\n     Whose fame will grow with centuries to be,\n     Tough as a white-oak stump or limestone rock,\n     The mountaineers who always shall be free.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I am honored to \ncelebrate the great State of West Virginia. June 20, 2006, \ncommemorates; the 143rd birthday of the ``Wild and Wonderful'' State of \nWest Virginia marking a milestone in both national and state history.\n  The historical importance of West Virginia should not be \nunderestimated. Born in 1863 out of the turmoil of the Civil War, it \nhas become synonymous with dedication, hard work, and integrity. West \nVirginia emerged as a staunch supporter of individuality, freedom, and \ntolerance. The common experience of the Civil War forged a unique bond \nof fraternity and camaraderie between its citizens. The commendable \ncitizens of our great State exemplify all of the aforementioned \nattributes through their unending commitments to their jobs, \ncommunities, and families.\n  People, however, are not the sole attraction to the State. The West \nVirginia experience is transforming and mesmerizing. Visitors from \naround the world enjoy the vibrantly lush forests, clearly flowing \nstreams, and majestic snow-capped mountains, which provide excellent \noutlets for recreational activity. Hiking, mountain biking, hunting, \nfishing, whitewater rafting, skiing, and golfing are just a few of the \namenities provided in the treasure that is West Virginia.\n  The culture of West Virginia rivals nature in beauty and intensity. \nMusic, history, pottery, glass, and storytelling make up a patchwork \nquilt of extraordinary experiences. Each individual, young or old, \nvisitor or native, is wrapped warmly into West Virginia's comforting \nblanket of culture and identity.\n  The West Virginia motto, ``Mountaineers are always free,'' rings \nthroughout the State with resounding force. Jerry West, Pearl Buck, \nChuck Yeager, and Senator Robert C. Byrd are just a few of the \ninfluential people of our time from West Virginia. As of June 12, 2006, \nSenator Byrd has had the distinction of being the longest serving \nSenator in U.S. history. Clearly, West Virginia has provided and \ncontinues to provide successful and inspiring individuals to the world.\n  Sadly, West Virginia has seen great tragedy in the last year: In four \nseparate mining accidents, 19 miners have lost their lives. Coal \nproduction is woven into the fabric of our State. While we always knew \nof the risks, losing loved ones is always devastating. Following those \naccidents, the Nation finally focused on what West Virginia has long \nknown--we must improve mine safety. Currently, 40,000 direct jobs are \nsupplied by the coal industry's influence in the State. This month, the \nMINER Act was signed into law by President Bush. This momentous step in \nmine safety legislation will bring greater safety to the brave men and \nwomen who work in the mines. The important role coal plays in the \nculture, economy, and history of West Virginia cannot be understated. \nThe jobs provided through the coal industry contribute to the well-\nbeing of thousands of West Virginians, they increase State development, \nand they enhance the economic vitality of the State. It is our \nresponsibility to make sure that miners are safe, secure, and \nprotected.\n  In addition to some of the hardships our State has faced since its \n142nd birthday, we also have a lot to celebrate: The Toyota Motor \nManufacturing Plant located in Buffalo, WV, recently celebrated its \n10th anniversary. Since its inception in 1996, the plant has expanded \nfive times and has been the single most productive engine and \ntransmission facility in all of North America for 4 consecutive years. \nIn 1996, 350 jobs were provided by the Toyota plant. By 2007, it is \nestimated that 1,150 workers will be employed by the organization.\n  Additionally, the West Virginia University football team won the \nright to participate in the 2006 Sugar Bowl in Atlanta, GA. In a \nstunning victory, the West Virginia University Mountaineers upset the \nUniversity of Georgia Bulldogs 38 to 35. The Mountaineers finished the \nseason ranked fifth overall in the Associated Press poll tying the \nhighest ranking in school history.\n  I am proud to represent West Virginia. I am proud to live in West \nVirginia, and I am proud to be called a West Virginian. Today, it is my \ngreat honor to celebrate and commemorate the 143rd birthday of the \n``Wild and Wonderful'' State of West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6149-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Munier\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wish today to express our Nation's \ndeepest thanks and gratitude to a special man and his family. I \nrecently received word of the untimely death of LTC Charles Munier of \nWheatland, WY, while serving his country in the war on terrorism. \nLieutenant Colonel Munier passed away on Monday, June 12, 2006, at \nWalter Reed Hospital following a stroke suffered while serving in \nAfghanistan where he was helping to train the Afghan army.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Munier served in Wyoming National Guard as \nfacilities manager for Camp Guernsey, Wyoming's training center for \nboth Guard and Active-Duty military. He is remembered by his brother \nsoldiers as a pivotal member of the Camp Guernsey staff and an \noutstanding officer who took his duties as a citizen soldier very \nseriously. In his civilian life, Lieutenant Colonel Munier worked for \nthe Platte County Sheriff's Office as the jail administrator.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Munier epitomized the ethos of the citizen \nsoldier. He did not hesitate to put down the plowshare and pick up the \nrifle when his country needed him. It is because of people like Charles \nMunier that we continue to live safe and free. America's men and women \nwho answer the call of service and wear our Nation's uniform deserve \nrespect and recognition for the enormous burden that they willingly \nbear. They put everything on the line every day, and because of these \nfolks, our Nation remains free and strong in the face of danger.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Munier is survived by his wife Nancy, his daughter \nVictoria Rice, and her husband Tim, and his brothers and sisters in \narms of the Wyoming National Guard.

Mr. President, given the continuing instability in \nSomalia, the growing tensions between the Transitional Federal \nGovernment and the Islamic Courts Union, ICU, and the worsening \nhumanitarian conditions throughout the country, it is more essential \nthan ever that the U.S. Government and the international community \nengage fully in efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to the \nconflict that has plagued Somalia for more than 15 years.\n  Most immediately, it is essential that the ICU recognize the \nlegitimacy of the TFG and that it engage in good-faith efforts to \nsupport the TFG's role and authority as Somalia's legitimate \nGovernment. The ICU must take immediate actions to begin assisting the \nTFG to extend its authority to Mogadishu, and it must do so in a \ntransparent and expeditious manner.\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\n  The international community must also play a productive--and more \naggressive--role. The United Nations must address this issue \nimmediately and must make the necessary decisions and actions to allow \nfor every option and tool for establishing stability in Somalia to be \npursued. It is clear that both regional and international efforts must \nbe strengthened and coordinated more effectively, and we must heed the \ncalls of international humanitarian organizations on the ground for \nadditional humanitarian assistance to increasingly vulnerable \npopulations there.\n  Somalia's neighbors must be cautious and patient as conditions within \nSomalia continue to change. Somalia's neighbors must play a supportive \nrole to the efforts of the TFG, the United Nations, and the African \nUnion to secure peace. Hasty, aggressive, or meddling actions could \nundermine or further complicate efforts to find a political solution to \nthe stand-off between the TFG and Islamic Courts Union. All \ninternational actions relating to Somalia must be coordinated, and \nactivities that may undermine current efforts there must not be \ntolerated.\n  Finally, the U.S. Government must take instability in Somalia \nseriously. Just last week, Ambassador Hank Crumpton, the State \nDepartment's coordinator for counterterrorism, testified in front of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee and said that the State \nDepartment has only one full-time Foreign Service officer, based in \nNairobi, working on Somalia-related issues. The administration has \nfailed to create a strategy for Somalia and is only now, after years \nand years of instability and chaos throughout the country, engaging in \ninternational efforts to address some of the problems Somalia faces. \nThe administration must create one sound policy framework to support \nstabilizing and rebuilding Somalia within which all U.S. Government \nactivities can be coordinated. It must also appoint a senior-level \ncoordinator to manage the multifaceted challenges that conditions in \nSomalia pose to both the United. States and the international \ncommunity.\n  Past efforts have been insufficient. It is past time to take the \ndeteriorating conditions within Somalia seriously, and we must do so \nimmediately. Recent developments in Somalia threaten to destabilize the \nentire region and plunge Somalia further in to despair. We can help \nprevent this if we act now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6150-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nreligious freedom. The freedom to believe and worship how one chooses \nis essential. However, as we strive for greater religious freedom and \ntolerance throughout the world, we have witnessed activist judges chip \naway at our own religious freedoms. These activist judges have worked \ndiligently to restrict our rights to express our religious beliefs \nunder the guise of separation of church and state.\n  Many of the court decisions that have broadened Americans' first \namendment right to free speech, overreach. In an effort to promote \ntolerance, religious expression is in fact, being censored.\n  Our Founding Fathers proclaimed liberty to be an unalienable right \nbestowed by our Creator--``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, \nthat all men are . . . endowed by their Creator with certain \nunalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit \nof Happiness . . .'' Yet unelected, activist judges are rewriting \nhistory. They have decided that, in fact, the Founding Fathers did not \nintend for there to be freedom of religious expression but, rather, \nfreedom from religious expression.\n  Thirty years of public opinion polls have shown that more than 75 \npercent of Americans support a constitutional amendment to protect \nvoluntary school prayer. However, the Supreme Court has said such an \nact violates the constitutional separation of church and state--again, \nanother act that forces freedom from religious expression rather than \nfreedom of religious expression.\n  It is not simply this decision but a growing and disturbing trend in \nour Federal courts to deny the rights of our States and our citizens to \nacknowledge God openly and freely. In fact, reciting the words ``one \nNation under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance has been ruled \nunconstitutional as has displaying the Ten Commandments in a State \nbuilding in my home State of Alabama. These tortured legal decisions \ndistort our Constitution, our Nation's history and its tradition in an \neffort to secularize our system of government and divest morality from \nour rule of law.\n  We simply cannot divest God from our country. Our country has no \nfoundation without a basic recognition that God invests us at birth \nwith basic individual rights that we all enjoy as Americans. In fact, \nour Government and our laws are based on Judeo-Christian values and a \nrecognition of God as our Creator.\n  Our motto is ``In God We Trust.'' It is enshrined on our currency.\n  Our national anthem recognizes our motto as ``In God is Our Trust.''\n  As Federal officials, each of us has taken an oath of office. The \nPresident takes a similar one. State and local officials and our \nmilitary personnel all swear a similar oath. Jurors and witnesses in \nour State and Federal courts take an oath as do witnesses before \nCongress. We all swear to uphold the Constitution or tell the truth, \n``so help me God.''\n  Our courts, including the Supreme Court, recognize God in their \nofficial proceedings, both the House and Senate acknowledge God through \nan opening prayer every morning. Our public buildings and monuments \nhonor this heritage through various depictions of the basic moral \nfoundations of our laws and system of government.\n  My point is that you simply cannot divest God from our country. \nDespite the actions of these activist judges, our country has no \nfoundation without a basic recognition that God invests us at birth \nwith basic individual rights--such as the blessings of liberty--that we \nall enjoy as Americans.\n  Again, I believe that the courts have exceeded their power. They have \noverreached. To that end, I have introduced the Constitution \nRestoration Act. This legislation recognizes the rights of the States \nand the people as embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution--9th and 10th amendments--to acknowledge God.\n  The Constitution Restoration Act goes to the very foundation of our \ncountry and the legitimacy of our system of government. Thomas \nJefferson in his first inaugural address said that ``The wisdom of our \nsages and the blood of our heros have been devoted to [the] \nattainment'' of our liberty and form of government.\n  If we are to maintain our form of government, we must ensure that \nactivist judges are not permitted to take away our religious liberties. \nThe very foundation of our government cannot and should not be expunged \nfrom public view--an unelected Federal judiciary should not be allowed \nto outlaw all public acknowledgments of God. We must protect our very \nbasic freedom of religious expression.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to work with me to protect \nthis basic freedom by supporting the Constitution Restoration Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6150-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6150-S6151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DRY EYE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I rise to call attention to an \nimportant but often overlooked chronic illness: dry eyes. The Sjogren's \nSyndrome Foundation and National Women's Health Resource Center have \ndeclared July Dry Eye Awareness Month.\n  Every year, chronic dry eye syndrome affects nearly 10 million \nAmericans of all ages; many sufferers will go undiagnosed. Without \ntears, good vision is impossible. Dry eye syndrome can cause \ndevastating symptoms, including constant pain, an inability to focus, \nand, in severe cases, serious visual impairment. It can significantly \naffect a person's quality of life, increasing the risk of problems with \nreading, professional work, computer use, and night driving.\n  Americans suffering with dry eye syndrome either do not produce \nenough tears, or have poor quality tears and/or excessive tear \nevaporation. Either problem causes their eyes to sting and burn, feel \nscratchy, become irritated, or excessively tear. Most people with\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\ndry eye find the condition to be an uncomfortable nuisance, with many \ncharacteristics of a ``chronic pain'' type of syndrome.\n  One study showed that dry eye patients experienced an average of 184 \ndays of reduced productivity in a year. Although dry eye syndrome \ncannot be cured, there are a variety of available treatments. However \nmany people with dry eye continue to suffer needlessly because they are \nunaware of their options. Both dry eye and Sjogren's seriously endanger \nwomen's health.\n  Sjogren's syndrome is a painful and debilitating autoimmune disease \nwhich causes the immune system to attack its own lubricating glands, \nsuch as tear and salivary glands. Sjogren's is one of the most \nprevalent autoimmune disorders, and although it affects people of all \nages, 9 out of 10 patients are women, and the average age of onset is \nlate forties. The hallmark symptoms are dry eyes and dry mouth, but \nSjogren's may also cause dryness of other organs, affecting the \nkidneys, GI tract, blood vessels, lungs, liver, pancreas, and the \ncentral nervous system. Patients with Sjogren's syndrome are also 40 \ntimes more likely to develop lymphoma.\n  Marking July as Dry Eye Awareness Month will bring more attention to \nthis widespread and potentially debilitating condition. I thank the \nMinnesota members of the Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation and the National \nWomen's Health Resource Center for bringing this issue to my attention \nand thank them for their efforts to educate the public about this \nserious health concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6151-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OF BURLINGTON, VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Burlington, VT, Boys and Girls Club \nprepares to begin an ambitious capital fundraising campaign this \nsummer, I am proud to give my strong support to this important \norganization. As a longtime supporter of this organization in Vermont \nand across the country, I wish them the best of success in their \nefforts, and I commend them for striving to continually improve their \norganization and Vermont's communities.\n  Through this campaign, the Burlington Boys and Girls Club plans to \nstrengthen its resources with the addition of high-speed Internet \naccess at the club, as well as a multimedia center where members can \nbecome proficient in current technology. This is a critical component \nof success for young people in our increasingly technological society. \nThe club will also reinforce its dedication to creativity through the \naddition of a visual and performing arts space where members will be \nable to pursue their artistic expression. These are just a few of the \nadmirable goals set out for this campaign, and I am confident they will \nbe achieved.\n  The Boys and Girls Clubs around the country are a leading example of \nhow the support and care of our young people benefits American society, \none boy and one girl at a time. The Boys and Girls Clubs have proven \nthat when we show our young people that we care about them and that we \ncare about their futures, they respond with positive and constructive \nactions in their communities.\n  We also know the Boys and Girls Clubs provide a healthy alternative \nfor many young people and oftentimes prevent them from being drawn into \ngangs, drug abuse, and other crime. The clubs instill leadership \nqualities, respect, and thoughtfulness in participants through programs \nthat include art, athletics, help with schoolwork, technology, life \nskills, training in resistance to drugs and alcohol, and community \nservice. In providing these valuable programs during critical \ndevelopment periods when young people are most vulnerable, the Boys and \nGirls Clubs fill a void and reduce the opportunity to succumb to \nnegative influences. The Boys and Girls Clubs represent the best of \nwhat communities can do to improve the lives of their young people.\n  I know firsthand how well Boys and Girls Clubs work and what topnotch \norganizations they are. When I was a prosecutor in Vermont, I was \nconvinced of the great need for Boys and Girls Clubs because we rarely \nencountered children from these kinds of programs. In fact, after I \nbecame a U.S. Senator, a police chief was such a big fan that he asked \nme to help fund a Boys and Girls Club in his district rather than \nhelping him pay for a couple more police officers.\n  Over the years, I have worked with other members of the Senate to \nmake sure the Boys and Girls Clubs around the country have the funding \nnecessary to carry out their mission. Since 1998, we have worked to \nsteadily increase Federal funding for the Boys and Girls clubs each \nyear. This year, as the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter and I have recommended $80 million in \nfunding to help keep this organization a strong and vital part of their \ncommunities, from coast to coast. As a senior member of the \nAppropriations Committee, I look forward to seeing that these funds are \nappropriated for this important work.\n  Represented in all 50 States, the 3,700 branches of the Boys and \nGirls Club reach more than 4.4 million young people. The Boys and Girls \nClub of Burlington alone serves more than 1,400 young people each year. \nThrough continued funding, Boys and Girls Clubs around the country will \nserve 6 million young people by January of 2007. The growth of these \nclubs across our country has been a true success story, and I am proud \nto work to ensure the Federal Government's continued support.\n  As the Burlington Boys and Girls Club kicks off its capital campaign, \nI commend all of Vermont's Boys and Girls Clubs, along with all of the \nother clubs across our Nation, for the important work they do to help \nour young citizens become exceptional adults.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/20/senate-section/article/S6151-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BENEDICT, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

The town grew \nquickly and was settled mostly by German and Norwegian immigrants, many \nof whose descendants live in Tolna today.\n  Tolna remains an active and involved community. The Tolna Summer Rec \nProgram sponsors a large number of sports teams for area youth and \nsports events involving the entire town. The\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\nSenior Citizens Center organizes a variety of events, including a \nseries of bingo games. The Tolna Alumni Association is also an active \norganization for all residents of Tolna, past and present.\n  The community has organized a wide variety of events to celebrate the \ncentennial, including a parade, fireworks, a bull riding event, and \nchildren's activities.

The town \nwas founded in 1883 when the Northern Pacific Railroad established a \nstation in the town. Major real estate settlement began in the area \nwith the help of Eber W.

Mr. President, Dr. James Cameron was man of great \nstrength, spirituality, and conviction.\n  Dr. Cameron was born in LaCrosse, WI, in 1914 and moved to Indiana as \na teenager. In Indiana, he accompanied two friends involved in an armed \nrobbery that turned to rape and murder. Though Dr. Cameron ran away \nwell before the crime was committed, all three young men were taken to \njail. The Ku Klux Klan stormed that jail on August 7, 1930, hung his \ntwo friends, and beat him severely. Dr. Cameron survived but spent \nanother 6 years in jail for crimes he did not commit.\n  Dr. Cameron never let us forget the injustice done to the many \nvictims of lynching and racial violence. After moving back to his home \nState of Wisconsin, he founded the Black Holocaust Museum in Milwaukee. \nThis unique museum lays bare our Nation's violent past of racism and \nslavery. His work opened the eyes of thousands to the suffering of \nAfrican Americans, not only in the age of slavery but also in the \ndecades that followed.\n  Dr. Cameron joined us last year to witness the passage of Resolution \nNo. 39, a resolution apologizing to the victims of lynching and the \ndescendants of those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact \nantilynching legislation. His mere presence assured us that we were \ndoing the right thing, albeit many years too late.\n  Dr. Cameron is survived by his dear wife Virginia and their wonderful \nfamily.

I transmit, for the information of the \nSenate, the report of the Department of State concerning these \ntreaties.\n  Geneva Protocol III. Geneva Protocol III creates a new distinctive \nemblem, a Red Crystal, in addition to and for the same purposes as the \nRed Cross and the Red Crescent emblems. The Red Crystal is a neutral \nemblem that can be employed by governments and national societies that \nface challenges using the existing emblems. In addition, Geneva \nProtocol III will pave the way for Magen David Adorn, Israel's national \nsociety, to achieve membership in the International Red Cross and Red \nCrescent Movement. Legislation implementing Geneva Protocol III will be \nsubmitted to the Congress separately.\n  CCW amendment. The amendment to Article 1 of the CCW, which was \nadopted at Geneva on December 21, 2001, eliminates the distinction \nbetween international and non-international armed conflict for the \npurposes of the rules governing the prohibitions and restrictions on \nthe use of certain conventional weapons. It does not change the legal \nstatus of rebel or insurgent groups into that of protected or \nprivileged belligerents.\n  CCW Protocol V. CCW Protocol V, which was adopted at Geneva on \nNovember 28, 2003, addresses the post-conflict threat generated by \nconventional munitions such as mortar shells, grenades, artillery \nrounds, and bombs that do not explode as intended or that are \nabandoned. COW Protocol V provides for the marking, clearance, removal, \nand destruction of such remnants by the party in control of the \nterritory in which the munitions are located.\n  Conclusion.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nnational center for public mental health emergency preparedness, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public \nMental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2006. This bill would take \nseveral important steps toward preparing our nation to effectively \naddress mental health issues in the wake of public health emergencies, \nincluding potential bioterrorist attacks.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the events of September 11, other recent \nnatural and man-made catastrophes have sadly taught us that our current \nresources are not sufficient or coordinated enough to meet the mental \nhealth needs of those devastated by emergency events. We need a network \nof trained mental health professionals--including first responders, \nlocal and state leaders, a well-developed infrastructure, and a \nmechanism--through which to mobilize and deploy mental health resources \nin a rapid and sustained manner in times of public health emergency.\n  It is clear that the consequences of emergency events like hurricanes \nor terrorist attacks result in increased emotional and psychological \nsuffering among survivors and responders, yet we must do more to assist \nall who are affected. That is why I have introduced the Public Mental \nHealth Emergency Preparedness Act of 2006.\n  This bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nestablish the National Center for Public Mental Health Emergency \nPreparedness--the National Center--to coordinate the development and \ndelivery of mental health services in collaboration with existing \nFederal, State and local entities when our Nation is confronted with \npublic health catastrophes. This legislation would charge the National \nCenter with four functions to benefit affected Americans in our local \ncommunities, particularly vulnerable populations like children, older \nAmericans, and persons with disabilities.\n  First, the Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act would make \nsure we have evidence-based curricula available to meet the diverse \ntraining needs of a wide range of emergency health professionals, \nincluding mental health professionals, public health and healthcare \nprofessionals, emergency services personnel, county emergency managers, \nschool personnel, spiritual care professionals, and State and local \ngovernment officials responsible for emergency preparedness. By using \nthese curricula, the National Center would build a network of trained \nemergency health professionals at the State and local levels.\n  Second, this legislation would establish and maintain a clearinghouse \nof educational materials, guidelines, and research on public mental \nhealth emergency preparedness and service delivery that would be \nevaluated and updated to ensure the information is accurate and \ncurrent. Technical assistance would be provided to help users access \nthose resources most effective for their communities.\n  Third, this bill would create an annual national forum for emergency \nhealth professionals, researchers, other experts and Federal, State and \nlocal government officials to identify and address gaps in science, \npractice, policy and education related to public mental health \nemergency preparedness and service delivery.\n  Finally, the Public Mental Health Preparedness Act would require \nannual evaluations of both the National Center's efforts and those \nacross the Federal Government in building our Nation's public mental \nhealth emergency preparedness and service delivery capacity. Based on \nthese evaluations, recommendations would be made to improve such \nactivities.\n  We must not wait until another disaster strikes before we take action \nto improve the way we respond to the psychological needs of affected \nAmericans. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to \nensure passage of this bill that would take critical steps toward \npreparing our Nation to successfully deal with the mental health \nconsequences of public health emergencies.\n  I would ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this legislation \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve passenger automobile fuel economy and \nsafety, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce dependence on foreign \noil, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Snowe, \nDurbin, Chafee, Inouye, Collins, Cantwell, Bill Nelson, Boxer, \nLautenberg, Menendez, and Lieberman to introduce a bill to increase \nCAFE standards by 10 miles in 10 years.\n  This is a commonsense, bipartisan approach to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil, decrease our greenhouse gas emissions, and save \nconsumers at the pump.\n  We have the technology available today to increase the fuel economy \nof our vehicles. We just need the political will--which is why we are \nhere today.\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\n  Specifically, our bill would raise the average fuel economy of all \ncars and SUVs to 35 miles per gallon by model year 2017.\n  This would save 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2025. That is \nthe same amount of oil we currently import from the Persian Gulf.\n  This bill would also save consumers dollars at the pump. At $3 per \ngallon, Americans driving 15,000 miles per year are, on average, using \n600 gallons of gasoline and spending $1,800 per year on gas.\n  By raising CAFE standards to 35 miles per gallon, consumers would \nonly use 429 gallons of gas per year, costing $1,287 per year for gas. \nThat is a savings of $513 per year at the pump.\n  Assuming the consumer keeps the vehicle for at least 5 years, that is \na savings of more than $2,500--more than enough to recoup the cost of \nmore efficient vehicles.\n  Raising CAFE standards is also good for the environment. The two \nlargest culprits of climate change are coal-fired powerplants and \nautomobiles. Coal powerplants are the largest U.S. source of carbon \ndioxide--producing 2.5 billion tons every year. But the automobile \nisn't very far behind--producing nearly 1.5 billion tons of carbon \ndioxide every year. In fact, every gallon of gasoline burned emits 20 \npounds of harmful CO2 into the atmosphere. That means that \neach car is responsible for about 12,000 pounds of greenhouse gas \nemissions every year. This legislation would take a good first step at \nreducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  By 2025, an average fuel economy standard of 35mpg would eliminate \n420 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions--the equivalent of \ntaking 90 million cars--or 75 million cars and light trucks--off the \nroad in 1 year.\n  Our daily driving habits are costing consumers at the pump, \nthreatening our national security, and potentially causing irrevocable \nharm to our environment. We have the technology available today to make \nsignificant increases in fuel economy standards. In fact, David Greene \nof Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a leading expert on fuel economy, \nsays that a 35 mpg standard by model year 2017 is cost effective and \ncan be achieved without reducing the size, weight, or horsepower of \nvehicles. And 78 percent of U.S. drivers have said they are willing to \npay for better fuel economy.\n  The longer we delay, the harder it will be to kick our addiction to \noil. We must act today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3543\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This support is largely \n     responsible for the decline in cocaine shipments to the \n     United States through the Bahamas.\n       (5) The Bahamas is an island nation composed of \n     approximately 700 islands and keys, which makes aviation \n     assets the best and most efficient method of transporting law \n     enforcement agents and interdicting smugglers.\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\n       (6) It is in the interest of the United States to maintain \n     the results of the successful Operation Bahamas, Turks & \n     Caicos program and prevent drug smugglers from rebuilding \n     their operations through the Bahamas.\n       (b) Report on United States Government Support for OPBAT.--\n       (1) Report on decision to withdraw.--Not later than 30 days \n     before implementing a decision to withdraw Department of \n     Defense helicopters from Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Congress a \n     report outlining the plan for the coordination of the \n     Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos mission, at the same level \n     of effectiveness, using other United States Government \n     assets.\n       (2) Consultation.--The Secretary of Defense shall consult \n     with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, and with other appropriate \n     officials of the United States Government, in preparing the \n     report under paragraph (1).\n       (3) Elements.--The report under paragraph (1) on the \n     withdrawal of equipment referred to in that paragraph shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) An explanation of the military justification for the \n     withdrawal of the equipment.\n       (B) An assessment of the availability of other options \n     (including other Government helicopters) to provide the \n     capability being provided by the equipment to be withdrawn.\n       (C) An explanation of how each option specified under \n     subparagraph (B) will provide the capability currently \n     provided by the equipment to be withdrawn.\n       (D) An assessment of the potential use of unmanned aerial \n     vehicles in Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, including the \n     capabilities of such vehicles and any advantages or \n     disadvantages associated with the use of such vehicles in \n     that operation, and a recommendation on whether or not to \n     deploy such vehicles in that operation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4369.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on June 20, 2006, by the President of \nthe United States:\n  Protocol III to 1949 Geneva Convention and an Amendment and Protocol \nto 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention (Treaty Document No. 109-10).\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith: the Protocol Additional to the \nGeneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of \nan Additional Distinctive Emblem (the ``Geneva Protocol III''), adopted \nat Geneva on December 8, 2005, and signed by the United States on that \ndate; the Amendment to Article 1 of the Convention on Prohibitions or \nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be \nDeemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects \n(the ``CCW Amendment''); and the CCW Protocol on Explosive Remnants of \nWar (the ``CCW Protocol V''). I transmit, for the information of the \nSenate, the report of the Department of State concerning these \ntreaties.\n  Geneva Protocol III. Geneva Protocol III creates a new distinctive \nemblem, a Red Crystal, in addition to and for the same purposes as the \nRed Cross and the Red Crescent emblems. The Red Crystal is a neutral \nemblem that can be employed by governments and national societies that \nface challenges using the existing emblems. In addition, Geneva \nProtocol III will pave the way for Magen David Adorn, Israel's national \nsociety, to achieve membership in the International Red Cross and Red \nCrescent Movement. Legislation implementing Geneva Protocol III will be \nsubmitted to the Congress separately.\n  CCW amendment. The amendment to Article 1 of the CCW, which was \nadopted at Geneva on December 21, 2001, eliminates the distinction \nbetween international and non-international armed conflict for the \npurposes of the rules governing the prohibitions and restrictions on \nthe use of certain conventional weapons. It does not change the legal \nstatus of rebel or insurgent groups into that of protected or \nprivileged belligerents.\n  CCW Protocol V. CCW Protocol V, which was adopted at Geneva on \nNovember 28, 2003, addresses the post-conflict threat generated by \nconventional munitions such as mortar shells, grenades, artillery \nrounds, and bombs that do not explode as intended or that are \nabandoned. CCW Protocol V provides for the marking, clearance, removal, \nand destruction of such remnants by the party in control of the \nterritory in which the munitions are located.\n  Conclusion. I urge the Senate to give prompt and favorable \nconsideration to each of these instruments and to give its advice and \nconsent to their ratification. These treaties are in the interest of \nthe United States, and their ratification would advance the \nlongstanding and historic leadership of the United States in the law of \narmed conflict.\n                                                      George W.
