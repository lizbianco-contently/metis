Following \nthat time, we will return to the consideration of the Transportation-\nTreasury-HUD appropriations bill. Last night, we entered into an \nagreement which will allow Senators Brownback and Landrieu to offer the \nDC appropriations bill at 11 o'clock this morning. Following their \nstatements, we expect a vote on that amendment. That will be a voice \nvote.\n  Also under our order from last night, at 12:10 today, we will vote on \nthe Kyl amendment relating to a freeze of the Members' COLA or cost-of-\nliving adjustment. After that vote, we will recess for our scheduled \npolicy luncheons.\n  We will return to the bill this afternoon, and we will have \nadditional votes on amendments to the appropriations measure. It would \nalso be helpful to have a filing deadline so that the two managers will \nbe better able to manage the amendments as they come forward. Today, I \nwill be talking to the Democratic leader about a unanimous consent for \nthat deadline.\n  We need to finish this appropriations bill this week. We will finish \nthis appropriations bill this week. It does mean we may need to be \nvoting on Friday in order to accomplish that, and we will be here on \nFriday to accomplish that if necessary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11449-6", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, I note my dear friend of over 30 \nyears, the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, is in the chair, \nthe President pro tempore of the Senate. I note that the President pro \ntempore showed his usual courtesy, instead of taking the chair \ninitially to open the session, as he would, to allow me to do so to \nintroduce my brother-in-law, Father Claude Pomerleau.\n  I also note that our distinguished Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black, is \nhere. I thank the Chaplain for his cooperation in making sure that \nFather Pomerleau could open the session.\n  Of course, I thank the distinguished majority leader, Senator Frist, \nand the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Reid.\n  Mr. President, I note that Father Pomerleau is a very close member of \nour family. He is probably not used to hearing me call him Father \nPomerleau; it has always been Claude. He was on the altar--not yet a \npriest but in the seminary--when my wife Marcelle and I were married \nslightly over 43 years ago. And 40 years ago this December, the two of \nus were able to be with his\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\nwonderful parents, Phil and Cecile Pomerleau, at his ordination in \nRome--a very proud time for his parents, certainly a proud time for \nClaude, but also a very proud time for Marcelle and me.\n  He has been, in many ways, our spiritual light and friend all these \nyears. He is very much a brother to me, as he is to Marcelle. I have \nhad the privilege one other time to have him as visiting Chaplain. And \nin my 31 years in the Senate, those two times stand out as highlights \nin my career.\n  So again I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska for showing \nhis usual courtesy, and, of course, I cherish our friendship of over \nthree decades.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11450-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise this morning to reflect for a \nmoment on the apparent successful events in Iraq this weekend and also \nto look forward to more successful events in the months ahead. It \nappears the people of Iraq--10 million of them--turned out on Saturday \nto ratify a constitution under which elections will take place on \nDecember 15 of this year. I believe now is an appropriate time for us \nto recognize, in the process of liberating the people of Iraq, the \ngreat accomplishments our brave young men and women have made to allow \nthat process to take place.\n  About 2\\1/2\\ years ago, America went into Iraq with three stated \ngoals. One was to depose Saddam Hussein. That was done. He goes on \ntrial tomorrow, to be tried by his own people, in his own court, by his \nown judges. Second, we went in to rid the nation of weapons that could \nhurt others and stabilize the country so we could accomplish the third \ngoal, which is to allow the people of Iraq to self-determine their \nfuture, as we in America did some 229 years ago.\n  The first goal, deposing Hussein, was accomplished, and he goes on \ntrial. The second goal of stabilizing the country has, in fact, been \naccomplished. It has been accomplished in a unique way and was ratified \nby the very election that took place on Saturday, because on Saturday \nthe Iraqi military protected the Iraqi polling places to allow the \nIraqis to have an election that had very little disruption or violence \nby the insurgents. Now we move toward December 15 and the election of a \npermanent assembly for the people of Iraq to govern themselves.\n  On the first day of February of this year, I visited Baghdad, shortly \nafter the elections that were held on January 31. I saw on that day the \npride of Iraqis holding up their index finger, stained with blue ink, \nwith smiles on their faces and self-satisfaction from having voted, \nwhich they did. We saw at that election where a number of the Sunnis \nstayed home, where most of the Shiites and the Kurds voted, and there \nwere about 8 million votes.\n  Just 8 months later, I watched this morning on TV and saw index \nfingers raised with ink stains to evidence the vote that had taken \nplace, but those ink stains were not just on the fingers of Shiites and \nKurds, they were on the fingers of Sunnis as well because, as was said \nafter the first election in Iraq in January, the Sunnis learned that in \na democracy, if you do not vote, you do not count. Although their votes \nmay have been different yesterday, it laid the groundwork for this \ncountry to self-determine its future in peace, for its three groups \nwithin their country to join together, to form a government, to iron \nout their differences peacefully, and to grow in the Middle East what \nmany thought was never possible, and that is an Arab nation self-\ndetermining its future, with its people electing its representatives, \nliving and growing in peace and harmony with its neighbors.\n  There have been a lot of critics of our efforts in Iraq. There have \nbeen some who have said the war was wrong and others who have said we \nought to come home, when, in fact, they have misjudged and \nmischaracterized the entire event. For us to come home is to lose the \nwar. For us to stay is for liberty and peace and freedom to take root, \nto grow, and to prosper, and for an area of the world that for all time \nhas been in turmoil to have the chance in future time to be in peace. \nThat is not just good for the Middle East. That is not just good for \nthe Iraqis. That is good for America. That is good for the nations of \nthe world. That is good for the future peace of this great Nation we \ncall the United States of America, for it was terrorism that drug us \ninto the Middle East. It is terrorism, through insurgents, that we \nfight today in Iraq. And it is terrorism that will lose, not in the end \nto bullets but to votes, with a people free to self-determine their \nfuture.\n  The people in Iraq began that process on January 31 and reaffirmed \nthat process this past Saturday. I am confident and looking forward to \nthe future, that on December 15 they will reaffirm that process again \nby holding free elections, guarded--and peacefully guarded--by their \nown trained troops, who will be the security force that in the future \nreplaces our men and women, and that they will secure the country of \nIraq not just for one election, not just for one day, but for the \nfuture.\n  It has been said that victory in Iraq is a process and not an event. \nI believe that is an appropriate statement. We have gone through a \nprocess that deposed an evil dictator, stabilized a violent nation, \nallowed free elections to take place, for a constitution to be drawn, \nfor elections for its ratification to take place, and now we are on the \ndoorstep of the election of those permanent representatives who will \nself-determine the future of the nation of Iraq. In this process, known \nas freedom, America has contributed much.\n  Our sons and daughters have been there steadfastly fighting the \ninsurgents, securing the Iraqi people, and giving the flame of liberty \nand freedom a chance to grow and glow. On Saturday that process \napparently took place again. I look forward to it taking place on \nDecember 15. I thank God for the brave men and women of the U.S. Armed \nForces and the resilience of our people as, once again, we are the \nleading light for freedom, peace, hope, and liberty not just in our own \ncountry but around the world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use my leader \ntime and not interfere with morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning I would like to speak for a \nshort time about a provision of the bill before the Senate, the \nTransportation bill, that was removed by Republican leaders when the \nbill was taken up yesterday. I commend my colleagues, Senators Feingold \nand McCain, for their leadership in advocating to the Republican \nleaders to take this step. The provision should not pass quietly in the \nnight. It was in this bill. It should not have been. More importantly, \nit should not emerge in any way in the future in some type of a must-\npass conference report.\n  The leadership PAC rider would have created a giant loophole in our \ncampaign finance laws and would have permitted unseemly money transfers \namong incumbents and national parties.\n  Today, leadership PACs are bound by the same campaign finance rules \nas are regular campaign PACs, known as political action committees; \nthat is, leadership PACs can't give more than $15,000 annually to the \nnational parties. The rider inserted in this bill during markup by the \nRepublican leadership removed this limit on leadership PACs so they \ncould transfer unlimited funds to national parties.\n  My colleagues, Senators Feingold and McCain, rightly decried this \nmove as a major circumvention of our campaign finance laws. The \nprovision would have directly undermined the point of those laws: \npreventing corruption in fact and in appearance. I joined with them to \noppose this provision and\n\n[[Page S11451]]\n\nassured them that the Democrats would stand united with them on a \nmotion to strike this rider or to prevent the bill from moving forward.\n  Through the efforts of Senators Feingold and McCain, we had the votes \nto strip this provision from the bill, and everyone knew that. \nRecognizing that, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agreed \nto remove it from the bill. I made it clear to my colleague and friend, \nthe majority leader, that we would not accept a conference report with \nreemergence of this provision.\n\n\n                  Compensation for Members of Congress\n\n  I also want to say another word about my friend, Russ Feingold. Russ \nFeingold is a person who is very talented. He is a unique advocate for \nmany issues that affect this country. I have just talked about campaign \nfinance reform. He is and has been a leader on campaign finance reform. \nThere are times that I disagree with Russ Feingold but not often. He is \na person who brings unique attributes to the Senate. Academically, he \nis without peer. He graduated from Harvard Law School and is a Rhodes \nscholar.\n  Today, he will speak on behalf of this side of the aisle on a \nprovision dealing with compensation for Members of Congress. There are \ntimes when a COLA is certainly in keeping with the needs of this body \nand the country, but there are times when it is not. As I have \nindicated, Russ Feingold has never shied away from offering \ncontentious, difficult amendments. Today, I am happy to see the other \nside of the aisle recognize that this amendment would pass, the \nFeingold amendment that has been offered by him alone in years past. \nThe majority decided they would step in the shoes of Senator Feingold \nbecause they knew this was a time--with Katrina, with the many other \nproblems facing our country--when a pay raise was not appropriate.\n  I want the record to be spread with the fact that Russ Feingold is a \nperson whose good work I so appreciate. I admire him and the work that \nhe does and want everyone within the sound of my voice to understand \nthat this amendment we will dispose of prior to 12:30 today has been \nthe Feingold amendment year after year after year. Now I am happy to \nsee that others have joined with him.\n  While I have disagreed with him on this issue in the past, no one can \ntake away from the fact that this has always been Russ Feingold's \nmantra: that he would offer the amendment to make sure that the \ncongressional pay raise did not go forward.\n  He certainly was not successful in years past, but everyone \nrecognized that he would be this year. Therefore, the majority, in an \neffort to take away a little recognition from him, decided they would \ndo it. But recognition will always be there because Russ Feingold has \nalways been out front on this issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I ask that I be able to proceed out of order. It is my \nunderstanding the Republicans actually control the time at the moment. \nI ask unanimous consent that I be able to proceed and the time to be \ntaken out of the Democratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11451-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11451-S11452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AVIAN INFLUENZA\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we are continuing to witness, as I think \nyou are aware, the relentless spread of avian flu carried slowly, but \npredictably, by wild migratory birds from countries in Southeast Asia \nto western China to Mongolia and then over the Ural Mountains into \nRussia and Ukraine. From there, avian flu this week has spread over to \nRomania and Turkey, and we have just learned possibly into Greece.\n  Dr. Joseph Domenech, chief of the Animal Health Service at the United \nNations Food and Agricultural Organization, has been quoted as saying \nthat `` . . . we are not surprised.''\n  At this point, no one should be surprised. The experts have told us \nrepeatedly that a flu pandemic is inevitable, although the timing is \nunpredictable. In other words, the question is not if but when. The \nspread of avian flu is our warning signal, and we need to heed this \ncall to action.\n  If we are lucky, we will have at least a year or perhaps several \nyears to prepare for a flu pandemic, but we might not be so lucky. \nRegardless of whether it is this particular strain of avian flu, H5N1, \nor another deadly strain, the time to act is long overdue if we want to \nprevent human suffering, death, and economic devastation.\n  International health experts say that two of the three conditions for \nan avian flu pandemic in Southeast Asia already exist. First, a new \nstrain of the virus has emerged to which humans have little or no \nimmunity. Second, this strain has shown that it can jump between \nspecies.\n  The last condition, the ability for the virus to travel efficiently \nfrom human to human, has not been met, and it is the only thing \npreventing a full-blown pandemic. Once this virus mutates and can be \ntransmitted from human to human, we will not be able to contain this \ndisease. Because of the wonders of modern travel, a person could board \na plane in Bangkok, Athens or Bucharest and land in Chicago less than a \nday later, unknowingly carrying the virus. In fact, we learned this \nlesson from SARS, which moved quickly from Asia to Canada, where it led \nto many deaths.\n  As my colleagues know, one of my top priorities since arriving in the \nSenate has been to increase awareness about the avian flu. In April of \nthis year, I introduced the Avian Act, which is a comprehensive bill to \nincrease our preparedness for an avian flu pandemic. This bill was \nincorporated into a larger bill, the Pandemic Preparedness and Response \nAct that Senator Reid and I introduced 2 weeks ago. We need to move \nthis bill as quickly as possible.\n  We also need to provide more funding to purchase vaccines and \nantivirals and improve our ability to spot and isolate a pandemic as \nsoon as it begins. In the spring and summer, I worked to secure $25 \nmillion in funding to fight the avian flu. Today, some of this money is \nalready helping the World Health Organization to step up its \ninternational surveillance and response efforts.\n  But obviously more money is needed--much more. Last month, I joined \nSenator Harkin and others in offering an amendment to the DOD \nappropriations bill to provide almost $4 billion to fight the avian \nflu. I am pleased that Senator Stevens cosponsored the amendment and it \nwas accepted into the appropriations bill. At this point, I am hoping \nthat the House will agree to this funding in conference.\n  Although we have begun to step up to the plate in the Senate, it is \nunfortunate that none of the avian flu bills that have been introduced \nhave yet been passed into law. There has been too much talk, not enough \naction. And this is not just true in the Congress.\n  One year after publishing the draft pandemic flu plan, the \nadministration still has not released the final HHS pandemic flu \npreparedness plan. Half the States have not published plans either, and \nwe know that many of these States will need substantial help.\n  This lack of planning is compounded by the fact that we still don't \nhave an FDA-approved vaccine against avian flu, and the one drug that \nmany countries are relying on, Tamiflu, may be less effective than \nexperts had thought. The manufacturer is also struggling to meet the \ndemand, and it could take up to 2 years for it to make enough for the \nU.S. stockpile, presuming this administration finally puts in an order \nfor the drug.\n  I ask my colleagues how many hearings and briefings have they sat \nthrough where witnesses and experts have urged the Government to be \nbetter prepared for these types of crises?\n  The failure to prepare for emergencies can have devastating \nconsequences. We learned that lesson the hard way after Katrina. This \nNation must not be caught off guard when faced with the prospects of a \npandemic because the consequences are simply too high.\n  The flyways for migratory birds are well established. We know that \navian flu will likely hit the United States in a matter of time. With \nthe regular flu season coming up shortly, conditions will be favorable \nfor the reassortment of the avian flu virus with the annual flu virus.\n\n[[Page S11452]]\n\n  Such reassortment could lead to a mutated virus that could be \ntransmitted efficiently between humans, which is the last condition \nneeded for pandemic flu.\n\n  The question is, Will we be ready when that happens? Let's make sure \nthe answer is yes. I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to \npush this administration to take the immediate action needed to prevent \ncatastrophe, the likes of which we have not seen during our lifetimes.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Now, a few \nmonths after that new law was signed, a scavenger hunt is underway to \ncome up with yet another bill to address the issues that Congress \nignored in the 2005 Energy bill.\n  The problem is that much of the new legislation tracks the \ntroublesome trends of the bill that was signed. What I want to do this \nmorning is spend a few minutes talking about why I think that is the \ncase, why I think this legislation is misguided, and then to suggest \nsome alternatives.\n  The central problem, in my view, is that this new legislation \nessentially says to these well-stuffed, well-oiled energy lobbies: We \nwill give you more than you got. This is on top of the fact that oil \nrefiners have seen their profits skyrocket by 255 percent over the last \nyear, an extraordinary fact--a 255-percent increase in profits for the \noil-refining sector. And now we are talking about another piece of \nlegislation to subsidize these folks and others who are literally \nswimming in cash today.\n  I do not believe that one of Congress's top priorities, after the \ntragedy of Hurricane Katrina, should be to help these special interest \nlobbies that already are swimming in cash.\n  There are too many Americans who are far from swimming in those kinds \nof funds. They are still trying to clean up the flood waters. They are \nmucking out their homes in the State of the Presiding Officer, \nLouisiana. They are trying to rebuild from the rubble of south \nMississippi. Many of them do not have a dime to their name. I believe \nit would be shameful if Congress returns to business as usual writing \nblank checks for these powerful energy lobbies, using the storms in the \nwake of these hurricanes as an excuse, as a Trojan horse, for handouts \nto the powerful energy lobbies in this country.\n  Let me outline the exact status of the subsidies that are on the \nbooks now and what was added in the bill in 2005. Under the laws \nalready on the books before the Energy bill was enacted, oil and gas \nindustries were on tap to get about $1.4 billion in tax breaks and \nother subsidies for a total of $6 billion in taxpayer subsidies over \nthe next 5 years.\n  With the Energy bill signed into law, the oil and gas interests will \nget another $2.6 billion of additional tax breaks and subsidies on top \nof what they were already slated to receive. That includes an ability \nto write off up to 50 percent of their costs in the first year, to name \njust one of the special interest breaks that was in the legislation. \nBut now we are talking about letting those who have received these huge \nsubsidies get another opportunity at the all-you-can-eat buffet.\n  So the taxpayers and consumers who are footing the bill for hurricane \ncleanup, paying for tax cuts for some who are extremely affluent, are \nnow going to be faced with the prospect of paying for additional \nsubsidies for these energy interests.\n  Two weeks ago, the House passed legislation to provide additional \nfinancial subsidies to benefit the oil refining industry. Under the \nHouse legislation, refineries would get a regulatory risk insurance \nprogram to cover all the refineries' costs if their production is \nreduced because of a delay in the permitting process.\n  There is no limit on the amount of these subsidies for refineries, \nwhile the refineries get essentially guaranteed cost protection. What \nthe Federal Government is essentially doing is privatizing the gains of \nthese refineries and socializing the risks. There is absolutely nothing \nin the legislation to require refineries to protect consumers from the \nsoaring costs they face today.\n  In my view, there is no need for these refiners, whose profits \nincreased more than 250 percent in the last year, to get even greater \nfinancial rewards on top of the subsidies they are already getting in \nthe brandnew energy law. In effect, what we are talking about is the \nprospect that these energy lobbies will become triple-dippers. They \nalready received big subsidies in the old law. Then they received \nadditional subsidies in the just-signed legislation.\n  We are talking about a third dip, a third round of subsidies, and I \nhappen to think that is too much. Even the President said when oil is \ntrading at upwards of $55 a barrel the oil companies do not need \nincentives to produce more. When the President, who certainly is not \nhostile to oil interests, says the oil companies do not need a deal \nfrom the Government, that ought to tell us something.\n  With oil selling for what is getting to be close to $70 a barrel, \nCongress should not be giving more taxpayer money away to these energy \ninterests.\n  What I suggest is two practical steps that Congress ought to look at \nas we consider energy legislation in the days ahead.\n  First, I think the Congress should freeze the new subsidies that \nCongress lavished on the oil interests that are now earning record \nprofits from record high prices. Nobody is talking about taking away \nwhat was there before the 2005 law was passed. What was there before \nthe 2005 law was passed would remain in place. What I am talking about \nthis morning is freezing the new subsidies, the new dollars that \nCongress just passed, despite the fact that the President of the United \nStates said it was not even needed. What I would propose by freezing \nthose new subsidies is that the Congress redirect those dollars to help \nlow-income Americans who are at risk, literally, of freezing in their \nhomes this winter.\n  For example, the $2.6 billion in new subsidies for oil interests \ncould be used to pay for weatherization assistance to more than 1 \nmillion low-income homes, taking basic steps to improve energy \nconservation. Adding insulation and sealing energy-leaking windows and \ndoors can help these families reduce their heating bills substantially.\n  Congress could help consumers further by using the Federal \nGovernment's purchasing power to make taxpayer energy dollars go \nfurther. The Federal Government is the largest consumer of energy in \nthe country. The Federal Government could use its substantial \npurchasing power to get some real discounts in the marketplace for the \nGovernment's energy purchases. These cost savings could be achieved not \nonly for direct energy purchases for Federal agencies' power needs but \nespecially for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Instead \nof reimbursing consumers for their sky high energy bills when they come \ndue, the billions of dollars spent each year under the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program could be used up front to acquire lower cost \nenergy to help low-income Americans.\n\n  So the question is, Is the Federal Government going to be a smart \nshopper? Is the Federal Government going to use its marketplace clout \nfor programs such as the one that serves low-income people to make sure \nthat the Government gets more for its money?\n  Everybody in the private sector shops that way. They are in a \nposition to make volume purchases. They go to the people with whom they \ncontract, and they say: We are going to buy a lot of your product, give \nus a deal.\n  This is essentially what I am proposing be done for the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program: the Federal Government use its clout in \nthe marketplace, the Federal Government use its purchasing power to get \ndiscounts for this program and to acquire lower cost energy to help \nlow-income Americans.\n  The bottom line is our country can do better. I believe we could have \ndone better in the Energy bill that was just passed. It seems \nincredible that just a few months after that law was passed and there \nwere great celebrations\n\n[[Page S11453]]\n\nabout what a difference it would make, now the Congress is back on a \nscavenger hunt to try to come up with legislation that does what should \nhave been done in the first bill.\n  The reality is we now have a second chance to do better. I am of the \nview that lives depend on the Congress doing better not just in homes \nwhere heat is going to be scarce this winter but for generations to \ncome.\n  When I came to the Senate floor to speak in opposition to the Energy \nbill a few months ago, I was sorry because that legislation failed to \nreduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil by one drop. It failed to \nreduce the prospects that America would again go to war in the Persian \nGulf. After 9/11, it became clear that the energy policy was a national \nsecurity issue and reducing our dependence on foreign oil had to be a \nnational security priority.\n  I am of the view that the great tragedy in the 2005 Energy bill is \nthat it essentially ratified pre-9/11 energy priorities. For the longer \nterm, Congress should look at smart, probusiness, and proconsumer \ninitiatives. I am willing, for example, to look at a limited antitrust \nexemption to let oil companies coordinate the refinery shutdowns \nexpressly to keep supplies up and prices down. So there can be plenty \nof opportunities to put together a business and consumer coalition to \nmeet the needs of our public.\n  I just suggested something that I suspect in the southern part of the \nUnited States, in the State of Louisiana, would be something that would \nbe well received by oil refiners, but I am also saying that at a time \nwhen refiner profits are up more than 250 percent that we ought to be \nlooking at other ideas that really help the consumer.\n  When gas prices are topping $3 a gallon and we are seeing these \nincreases in home heating prices, we know the public is prepared for \nchange. I have laid out a number of areas this morning where change \nwould be in the interest of the consuming public and be smart \nprobusiness policy, but I think there ought to be more to an energy \npolicy than just ladling out tax subsidies. We have done that again and \nagain. The Congress just poured on more subsidies in the 2005 bill and \ndid absolutely nothing to deal with the crisis that we have seen in the \nlast few months.\n  So at this crucial time, with the eyes of the country upon us, let us \nlook at a fresh energy policy, one that will meet this country's \nnational security needs, one that will meet the needs of our consumers \nthis winter at a time when they are so vulnerable. And let us learn \nthat just handing out subsidies willy-nilly is not going to make the \nreal energy problems of this country go away.\n  It is no time to further sate the appetites of the entrenched energy \ninterests. It is time, and there is a chance now, for a fresh start on \nenergy policy. This time, with the next Energy bill, let us do right by \nthe people of this country.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Transportation, Treasury, HUD, and \nrelated agencies bill is now back on the floor. At 11 o'clock it is my \nunderstanding that by previous order we will go to consideration of the \nDC appropriations bill, which will be included as a separate part of \nthis legislation because the House has the two functions of DC and \nTreasury, Transportation, HUD as one bill. Those, it is my \nunderstanding, will be conferenced separately but at the same time so \nthat the final conference report will bring back Treasury, \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development, and the District of \nColumbia appropriations.\n  The important thing to note is my partner and colleague in this \neffort, the ranking member, the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray \nand I, have asked our colleagues to bring to the floor the amendments \nthey wish to offer for this T-T-H-U-D or TTHUD bill. We will be having \na vote on the pending amendment, the Kyl amendment, at 10 minutes after \n12. The amendment relates to the cost-of-living increase for Members of \nCongress.\n  It is important to note that both sides agree we want to move \nquickly. We want to know what amendments there are. We are seeking a \ntime deadline for filing those amendments so our staff can go to work \non them.\n  We believe there will be time this evening for staff to consider \nthem. It is possible we will be able to take some of these amendments \nand conclude this bill sometime this week. It is very important we get \nthis moving because we are now in the new fiscal year. We are operating \non a continuing resolution and we have many important items in this \nbill and the DC bill that need to be put into law so we are operating \non fiscal year 2006 appropriations for the year.\n  As my colleague was kind enough to mention yesterday, there was an \nathletic contest in Houston last night in which Albert Pujols managed \nto keep the St. Louis Cardinals alive. I am currently in a good mood \nand ready to accept as many amendments as possible. While I have great \nhopes for continued success, this is the best time to catch me in a \ngood mood. And the Senator from Washington is in a good mood. This is \nthe time to bring the amendments forward. We will be happy to work with \nour colleagues to try to find ways to accept as many amendments as \npossible.\n  In any event, I know there will be some amendments that will require \nvotes. We would like to have them brought to our attention as soon as \npossible in order for us to set a schedule enabling us to finish this \nbill, we hope well before the end of this week. We have many other \nimportant measures to work on and we will have to have a number of \nvotes. We look forward to having those amendments before us. This is an \nurgent request to my colleagues who have amendments to the TTHUD bill \nto bring them to the floor and to share them with the managers on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues and ask that they bring those \namendments down.\n  Seeing no other speakers wishing to take the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Landrieu of Louisiana, the \nranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the District of \nColumbia, will be here shortly to use the other 20 minutes of this \npresentation. This is the District of Columbia appropriations bill. It \nhas been passed and reported by the full Appropriations Committee \nunanimously and contains some modifications within it. But we have \nstrong agreement within the Appropriations Committee. We have gone \nthrough a number of hearings. I want to highlight several particular \nissues within it, what we are trying to do to encourage family \nformation, encourage marriage in the District of Columbia.\n  I want to talk about the school issues. We have had a voucher program \nfor a short period of time. I want to report on how that is going and \nthe problems and needs within that area.\n  I also want to talk a little bit about the problems we are having \nwith the schools overall in the District of Columbia, which remains an \nongoing, desperate problem. Kids that get into the District of Columbia \nPublic School System get into a system that moves them more, \nunfortunately, in too many cases, toward failure rather than success. A \nsystem that does that is a system that needs changing.\n  I also want to talk about some needs in the future.\n  We are putting this forward as a part of the Transportation and HUD \nbill to mirror what is taking place in the House so that this will be \namended into the Transportation-HUD bill and then conferenced together \nwith the House of Representatives.\n  I thank the members of the Appropriations Committee, particularly my \ncolleague, Senator Landrieu, the ranking member, for her work on this \narea. She has been the ranking member under both myself and Senator \nDeWine. She does an outstanding job.\n  This bill provides $593 million in Federal funds for the District of \nColumbia and includes the city's own local budget of $6.2 billion.\n  The funds in the bill focus on three key Federal priorities for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  First, improving educational opportunities for inner-city children; \nsecond, reducing and preventing crime; and, third, promoting and \nsustaining healthy marriages.\n  To address the first priority, the bill provides funds to improve \ntraditional public schools, increase capacity at public charter \nschools, improve bilingual education for Latino students, and allow \nlow-income students in failing public schools to attend private \nschools.\n  This is the second year of the District of Columbia Opportunity \nScholarship Program.\n  I want to recognize my colleague, Senator DeWine, for getting this \nstarted last year when he chaired this committee, and also my \ncolleague, Senator Judd Gregg from New Hampshire, for his strong input \nand push into this program. It was difficult to get started, but it has \nbeen quite a success thus far.\n  This is the first ever Federal program to provide scholarships to \nlow-income, inner-city children so they can attend private schools.\n  I might note for my colleagues that several years ago, when I was the \nauthorizing chairman of the District of Columbia authorization \ncommittee, we polled Members of Congress and then the President and the \nVice President to see how many Members of Congress send their kids to \nDC public schools--either in the House or the Senate or the President \nor Vice President. I was actually shocked to find out that there were \nno Members--zero Members of Congress--who sent their children to the \nDistrict of Columbia public schools--not one in all of the House, all \nof the Senate, the President and Vice President.\n  I thought that said a lot by the action that people were taking. They \nwere not sending their kids to DC public schools, even though if you \nwere a poor parent, you had no other choice. Now there is a bit of a \ndifferent choice.\n  The demand for scholarships in this program, as far as allowing low-\nincome, inner-city children to go to private school, has been \noverwhelming, with nearly two applications from eligible public school \nstudents for each scholarship available. The federally mandated \nevaluation of the program is up and running, with a robust number of \nscholarships and nonscholarship students participating. We are doing \nevaluations. Most importantly, the program is succeeding and serving \nthe low-income children who truly need this educational opportunity the \nmost. Most of these scholarship students came from failing DC schools, \nand now they are flourishing in the District's private schools that are \nparticipating in the program.\n  We have heard the story of a first grader who couldn't read at all \nwhen he received his scholarship. Yet within 2 months at his new \nschool, he was already reading close to his grade level.\n\n  One scholarship mother tells us that her child used to complain about \ngoing to school every morning. Yet he is so excited about going to \nschool now that he grumbles about having to stay home from school on a \nsnow day.\n  Then there is the private school principal who marveled when she \ncalled a new scholarship student by his name, and the child said he \ndidn't believe she was the principal because there is no way the \nprincipal would actually know a student's name.\n  These kind of stories are commonplace and indicate that the program \nis successful. However, I am concerned about the current and growing \nmismatch between the number of private high school spaces available in \nthe District and the number of scholarship students seeking a space in \na District of Columbia private high school. Because of this mismatch, \nmany students who already have a scholarship will be forced to leave \nthe program. Specifically, for the current school year, there are about \n50 high school students with scholarships who could not attend the \nprivate school in the District because of a lack of capacity. \nUnfortunately, the problem will only worsen in each subsequent year as \ncurrent middle school students graduate to high school. If the trend \ncontinues--and even if no new scholarships are offered beyond the fifth \ngrade--nearly 75 percent of the students holding scholarships to attend \nhigh school will be unable to use them because of a lack of slots in \nprivate high schools in the District. This is a shame.\n  A number of Senators expressed objections to correcting this program \nat this early stage, so we have left the program unchanged. But I want \nto note for my colleagues the problems that we have.\n  The second priority funded by this bill is reducing and preventing \ncrime in the District. The Federal Government entirely funds the \nDistrict of Columbia courts and the DC Court Services and Supervision \nAgency. The committee is providing a total of $420 million for these \nagencies, which is $52 million more than the fiscal year enacted level. \nMost of these additional resources are for renovation and repairs to \nthe city's fourth oldest building, the historic old courthouse. We need \nto continue this effort.\n  The third priority in this bill is promoting and sustaining healthy \nmarriages. This is a new initiative, and I want to spend a little bit \nof time talking about this. I am hopeful this can be a model, \nparticularly across the country in inner cities where we are having \nparticular difficulty in forming, in many cases, healthy family units.\n  Every year, almost 57 percent of the babies born to residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia--that is right, 57 percent--are born to single \nmothers. This is 40 percent higher than the national average. It is not \nto say you can't raise healthy children in a single-parent household. I \nwant to go through some of the numbers to indicate the difficulty of \nraising a child in a single-parent household.\n  Statistics show that children born to single mothers are seven times \nmore likely to be poor than those born to\n\n[[Page S11455]]\n\nmarried parents and that over 80 percent of long-term child poverty \noccurs in broken or never-married families. Marriage has an enormous \npotential to reduce poverty amongst couples who are unmarried at the \ntime of their child's birth.\n  I want to point out this chart which shows that child poverty \ndramatically increases outside of intact marriages: Marriage impact \nwithin wedlock, 7 percent child poverty; never-married mother, 51 \npercent child poverty rate.\n  Children born and raised in households where their mother and father \nmarried tend to be more financially stable and more emotionally stable. \nStatistics tell a compelling story of the many positive benefits that \naccrue to children if they are raised by their married parents.\n  For example, children raised in married families are 3 times less \nlikely to repeat a grade in school, 5 times less likely to have \nbehavioral problems, half as likely to be depressed, 3 times less \nlikely to use illicit drugs, half as likely to become sexually active \nas teenagers, and 14 times less likely to suffer abuse from their \nparents.\n  We had a hearing on this 2 weeks ago, where a couple talked about \ntheir interest in getting married after living together for 20 years \nand having four children. We have a proposal, which I will be putting \nforward in a minute. I want to note, before we get to that, that this \ncouple said almost all of their friends came up to them and said: Are \nyou crazy, getting married? The couple said: No. We want to get \nmarried. We want to provide a model for our children. Aren't you crazy \ndoing this with all of the payments that you are going to lose under \nthe public assistance system if you get married?\n  I said at that point in time that we need to look at the \ndisincentives we put in Federal programs for people getting married, \nparticularly low-income households because we shouldn't be sending this \nkind of signal, given the benefit overall to children of having intact, \nmarried families.\n  Currently, there are many single mothers who are heroically and \nsuccessfully raising children on their own. They deserve our respect \nand support. But it is an indisputable fact that the best environment \nin which to raise a child is in a healthy, two-parent family.\n  In addition, the growth of single-parent families has had an enormous \nfinancial impact on our society at large. The welfare system for \nchildren is overwhelmingly a subsidy system for single-parent families. \nSome three-quarters of the aid to children--given through programs such \nas food stamps, Medicaid, public housing, Temporary Assistance to Needy \nFamilies, and the Earned Income Tax Credit--goes to single-parent \nhouseholds.\n  The Federal Government annually spends over $150 billion in means-\ntested welfare aid for single parents. I believe that improving a \ncouple's financial stability can help sustain a healthy marriage.\n  As a way to assist low-income, married couples to gain appreciable \nassets, the subcommittee has introduced legislation which has broad \nbipartisan support. It is supported by Eleanor Holmes Norton. It will \nestablish Marriage Development Accounts in the District of Columbia. \nThe MDAs will be available to low-income, married couples who are \ncitizens or legal residents of the District and who have very low net \nworth. Couples may save money to buy a home, pay for job training or \neducation or start their own businesses. Couples will have a high \nincentive to save because their contributions will be matched at a \nratio of 3 to 1 by the Federal Government and partnering private \ninstitutions. In other words, the Federal Government will put in $1, \nthere will be $2 of private money raised, and low-income couples who \nreceive marriage counseling, or as they get married, will be matched 3 \nto 1 for every dollar of savings they put in--$3 from the Federal \nGovernment and private sector. It is to encourage marriage and also to \nencourage savings for this couple. As a requirement of participation, \ncouples will receive training that helps them repair their credit, set \na budget, set savings schedules, and manage their money. Couples will \nalso receive bonuses in the MDA accounts for receiving marriage \ncounseling.\n\n  Recognizing the importance of grassroots support to ensure the \nsuccess of these efforts, this subcommittee is directing grantees to \nexpand their network of service providers by partnering with local \nchurches, faith-based organizations, and nonprofit organizations, \nproviding mentoring, couple's counseling, and community outreach.\n  It has been an interesting coming together of people from all parts \nof the political spectrum, left and right, to support this creation--we \nbelieve the first ever in the country--of marriage development accounts \nto encourage savings and marriage of low-income couples.\n  A senior fellow with the Brookings Institute testified at a recent \nhearing I held on MDAs that many researchers and practitioners who work \nwith poor couples believe that a major barrier to healthy marriages is \neconomic uncertainty. For example, Kathy Edin of the University of \nPennsylvania has concluded from her interviews with young, unmarried \nmothers that there are plenty of issues such as empathy and trust that \ninterfere with continuing the couple's relationships, but Edin and \nother researchers have come to regard poverty, unemployment, and income \nas serious barriers to healthy marriage.\n  Young, low-income couples often tell interviewers they are thinking \nabout marriage, but they want to save enough money to make a \ndownpayment on a house before they actually get married. Thus, MDAs are \nresponsive to what the couples say they need before they become serious \nabout marriage.\n  Beyond what the researchers are saying, we hear from real couples in \nthe District who have been living together, who have children, now plan \nto marry and open an MDA.\n  We must act quickly to stop the erosion of marriage in our Nation and \nparticularly in our Nation's Capital. We cannot just watch and wring \nour hands. We must act aggressively in employing as many innovative \napproaches as possible, test the results, and do a heavy monitoring. \nThat is what we have in the bill itself--a monitoring to see if this is \nworking. Our future and our children's future truly are at stake. I \nbelieve MDAs can be an important tool in helping to stabilize, \nstrengthen, and foster healthy marriages.\n  I again thank my colleague, Senator Landrieu, as the ranking member. \nShe and I share the same concerns for the children and residents who \nlive in the District of Columbia. She is a strong supporter, \nparticularly of the school system needs in this district. We both have \nconcerns regarding the public and the charter school system that are \nnot reflected in this bill. If changes are not made in DC public and \ncharter schools, we will be back next year with a bill that has more \naggressive statements and a more aggressive position from this Senate \non the public and charter school system. It is not serving the \nchildren's needs. We did not take that on this year. We met multiple \ntimes with the superintendent of the DC Public Schools and others and \nnoted the problems, but they said: Give us a little more time. The \nproblem is, time dooms our children if no successful changes are made. \nSo next year, we could be back with substantial changes.\n  I thank the staff for working with us. I know her staff, including \nKate Eltrich, has worked hard. Mary Dietrich went so far as to break \nher arm to get this bill to the Senate in a timely fashion--she \nactually was bike riding--but that did not stop her. She is here to get \nthis done. I hope we can pass this bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nKansas, Senator Brownback, to present to our colleagues of the Senate \nthis DC appropriations bill. It has been a joy and a privilege to work \nwith the Senator from Kansas. Prior to the Senator's service, as chair \nI had the great opportunity to work with the Senator from Ohio, Mike \nDeWine, who is, indeed, a pleasure to work with and a great partner.\n  This is a very important bill for our Nation. Not only does it \nmatter, of course, directly to the 500,000-plus residents of the \nDistrict, but the life and the quality of life in the District has a \ntremendous impact on this whole region, which is made up of millions of \npeople, as the District was actually\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\ncarved out of Virginia and Maryland and serves as a hub of this region.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, in his home State as well as my home \nState of Louisiana, people all over the Nation feel very warmly \nattached to their Nation's Capital, what happens in neighborhoods, in \nschools, downtown, on the riverfronts, our monuments as a tourist \nmecca. For people to seek inspiration, this is very important. This \nbill, while it is one of the smallest in terms of dollar amounts, has a \ngreat deal of interest from people all over the Nation.\n  I have been pleased to be the appropriator, and I am particularly \nhappy all of our colleagues have worked in such a cooperative manner \nthat we can bring this bill to the Senate and handle it with great \ndispatch, with very little controversy, if any at all. From my \nperspective, since I have had my time taken helping Louisiana and the \ngulf coast recover from two major storms, Rita and Katrina, and then \nthe subsequent massive levee breaks that have left the gulf coast \nregion in a great challenging state, I thank our colleagues for letting \nus take this bill up and move it forward so I personally can get back \nto the issues in front of the State of Louisiana at this moment.\n  I will be relatively brief, but I follow up Senator Brownback's \nstatements with just a few comments. I thank Senator Cochran and \nSenator Byrd, the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on \nAppropriations, who made it possible in their decision as to how to \norganize and to reorganize the Committee on Appropriations, saw fit to \nkeep some independence for the District of Columbia. That is extremely \nimportant. The outcome is something I supported, as well as others, but \nwithout Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd's support, it would not have \nbeen possible.\n  Our House colleagues have merged DC into a bigger committee. I think \nsome of the focus gets lost. The Nation's Capital deserves appropriate \nfocus and support from all, and our focus has not been lost. We in the \nSenate continue to help strengthen and develop our Nation's Capital \nappropriately as reliable partners for their progress.\n  I thank Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd.\n  In addition, I note that the large majority of the money in this bill \nis not national taxpayer money. It is local money, levied, raised, and \nappropriated to the tune of $7.3 billion of local money. The Federal \nmoney in this bill for which we have responsibility to be accountable \nis $593 million. It is a lot of money but a small percentage of the $7 \nbillion total levied and raised by the residents and citizens of the \nDistrict of Columbia. Our focus is on that $600 million portion we \nallocate in trying to be partners with city officials.\n  Because of Mayor Williams' outstanding leadership, in my view--and I \nthink it is shared by Senator Brownback and many Senators--his \noutstanding leadership as a good steward of taxpayer money, as a good \nmanager for reform, as a great salesperson, an advocate for this great \ncity, nationally and internationally, our confidence in his leadership, \nand the confidence in the management of the city, has increased \nsubstantially. So we are pleased to invest in its continued growth.\n  One major investment this Congress has made is in the establishment \nof a family court structure. I wish we could have family courts all \nover the United States. It is not an inexpensive operation. In many \nStates, the last courts to be funded are those that need the most help. \nThe courts that regulate or try to work out situations of marriage and \npersonal lives so important to people, that settle disputes about \nmarriages, wills, and estates, and most importantly, settle the issues \nof divorces or reconciliations, child custody, child abuse, and spousal \nabuse, unfortunately those courts throughout our land are the last \nfunded, the least resourced, and the most overly taxed in terms of \nresponsibility.\n  Over the course of the last few years, we have stood up, Democrats \nand Republicans, and said it is time to help our Nation's Capital \ncreate a model in the Nation, a family court that puts families first, \nthat understands that these decisions of child custody, of separation, \nof protecting women from abuse and children from abuse, are truly life-\nand-death matters and are truly important decisions to keep the fabric \nof society together. So we have invested in this family court, one \nfamily, one judge, so children are no longer lost in the bureaucracy, \nlost in the file rooms, their lives are meaningful, and they are \ntreated with dignity and respect. It has been an expensive project but \none well worth investing in the families of the District of Columbia \nand particularly the children.\n\n  We march on to improve child welfare in the District, to work with \nthe city to strengthen and improve the quality of our foster families \nand, most importantly from my perspective, promote adoption, believing \nthat every child in the District, in America, and, in fact, in the \nworld, deserves a family to call their own.\n  Governments, as I have said, do a lot of things well. Raising \nchildren is not one of them. Parents--a parent, a responsible adult--\nraise children. And we as a Nation need to do a much better job of \nconnecting these needy children of all ages--infants, toddlers, young \nchildren, teenagers, young adults--with parents wanting to give them \nthe benefit of a stable home and family. I am very proud of the \nDistrict's performance and improvement in that area.\n  Finally, one more point before I speak about education which is going \nto be the focus today. I encourage the continuing development of good \nland use in the District of Columbia. We have planned the \nrevitalization and cleaning up of the Anacostia River to be a balance \nwith the beautiful Potomac on one side, to bring the Anacostia back to \nbe a place where people can recreate--citizens and tourists alike--\nwhere there could potentially be exciting new developments of multiuse \nhousing, wonderful commercial waterfront developments that contribute \nto recreational opportunities and sporting opportunities for children.\n  The city has a tremendous vision. The Nation should be excited. \nAlthough we are able to offer a just small amount, our committee wants \nto be supportive of that effort in any way we can. That is reflected in \nthis bill.\n  Let me speak for a moment on the main subject of this, which is \neducation reform. Every city in the country and every county in the \ncountry is struggling with the challenge of providing quality education \nfor our Nation's children. We decided as a Nation many years ago to do \nthat through a public system. It has worked in large measure \nextraordinarily well over the long term.\n  There are clearly signs in America--whether urban areas, rural areas, \nor poor areas; sometimes we even find crises in wealthy areas that are \ngrowing too fast or there is too much strain in an area--that school \nsystems are really struggling. Either they do not have enough space and \ntoo many students, too many students and not enough teachers, not \nenough quality classroom space, or there is no tax base to pay for \nquality teachers, so students are failing. There are all sorts of \nchallenges to our public school system. This Congress has been spending \na lot of time--from No Child Left Behind to accountability to strategic \ninvestments--to try to fix this. Although there have been some setbacks \nand it is not perfect, from my perspective, we are moving in generally \nthe right direction with the exception that our investments have not \nmatched the rhetoric from the Federal level. But should we ever be able \nto fix that, I believe we will see increased student performance, \nincreased parental satisfaction, more choice in the public school \nsystem, and excellence across the board.\n  Why do I say this is so important? Because in this Senator's view, \nthe only way to have great cities is to have great schools. The only \nway to have great communities is to have great schools. If you do not \nhave great cities and great communities, you cannot long have a great \nnation.\n  Our forefathers said to us when we created this democracy that one of \nthe fastest ways to end it is to stop educating ourselves to the \nresponsibilities of being citizens of the Nation and the world. That \neducation, yes, begins at home, where children are educated primarily \nby their parents, their guardians, people who brought them into the \nworld. But we supplement that education of parents by offering, in \nAmerica, an education to any child wanting\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\nto take the chance to walk through that kindergarten door. We do not \nlimit it only to the wealthy. We do not limit it only to those who can \nafford it. We provide universal public education. It has been the \ncornerstone of this democracy, and it should remain that way.\n  But we have some problems because some of our schools are failing our \nchildren. Some of our systems are failing our children and the \nemployees who work in the system. So we have to change. I am very proud \nthat in this DC bill, the Members of the Senate and the House--\nRepublicans and Democrats--have come together to negotiate, to reason \ntogether, to try to see what could we do in this city to show a model \nfor some things that can work.\n  We had a very fierce negotiation and debate 2 years ago about this \nand have settled, if you will, on three approaches. One is what Senator \nBrownback spoke about, a scholarship-voucher approach that some people \nbelieve will work. A large number of us settled on negotiating for \ninvestments in charter schools, keeping the money in the public system, \nnot taking it out but providing more independence, more choice, more \nexciting options to create new models of ``coopertition,'' if you will, \nin the public system. I happen to be a very strong advocate of that \napproach to changing and reforming public education in America.\n  Then there was another group of us who negotiated for more help to \ntraditional public schools, more investments, more help, and reforming \nin a more traditional way.\n  This great experiment is underway. It is going to be a 5-year \nexperiment. We are committing $40 million a year, which is a lot of \nmoney. There will be $200 million going to this effort. That $200 \nmillion, while it sounds like a lot, is a small percentage of what the \nDistrict residents pay to support their system. But it is an important \ninvestment.\n  I want to say how proud I am of the efforts being made to expand \nopportunities for public charters, for two reasons. One, it provides \nchoice to parents. There is not one cookie-cutter approach. Some \nparents want their children in schools that have strong academics and \nathletics. Other parents like choices that stress the arts. Some \nparents like to see that their children may be in a school that may \ngive them a pre-med education and direct them more to medicine or \nscience or research.\n  I believe all parents should have more choices, that one size does \nnot fit all, that we need to get away from this industrial model. We \nmoved away from it in our economy. Why can't we move away from it in \nour school system and move to a more decentralized, more independent, \nmore entrepreneurial, more choice-driven, more consumer-directed \napproach to schools? Just because we have not done that for 200 years \nin this country does not mean we can't.\n  So that is what we are undertaking: creating opportunities for \nquality, independent public charters so the money stays in the public \nsystem. But it basically acts almost as if it were private in the sense \nthat it is independent but meeting all high standards.\n  Twenty-five percent of the public school population in the District \nis in public charter schools. That is one of the highest percentages of \nschool populations in the Nation. So this is really a laboratory to see \nwhat is working, what is not. I am proud to say we are making progress \nnot only in the increased number of charter schools but, most \nimportantly, in the quality of charter schools. It is not just quantity \nbut quality.\n  There are actions being taken now by the certification boards that if \na charter school is failing, those schools can be closed and \nreorganized and supported so that quality education is being provided. \nThat is one of the focuses of this bill. We want to not stress just the \nincrease in quantity but quality. We want to ensure accountability, and \nwe want to make sure, just as in traditional public schools, that any \nchild who walks through the door of a public charter--whether it be a \nbilingual opportunity, which has been so successful; whether it is a \nresidential Monday-through-Friday school, which has been tremendously \nsuccessful in giving people hope and raising grade levels--whatever the \nmodel, when they walk through that door, they can get a quality \neducation. That is one of our goals.\n  So we have continued to press for that $13 million piece. The charter \nschool community has come together in unison to lay out how that $13 \nmillion should be directed to this movement, a great movement for \nquality, for opportunity.\n  I will submit a summary of that for the Record.\n  One of the exciting components, from my perspective--and I will close \nwith a comment about this--is part of our charter school movement has \nbeen a new initiative called the Citybuild initiative. It is part of \nthe charter school idea that says that in many cities, including the \nDistrict of Columbia, there are certain neighborhoods that are \nrevitalizing, I would say on their own, but nothing happens on your \nown.\n  It is a combination of some public investments that are occurring, a \nchange in housing patterns, young couples, Black and White and \nHispanic, moving into a neighborhood with young children. They like the \nhousing. They like the location to their work. The only problem is, \nthey move into a neighborhood that has affordable housing, restaurants, \ntheaters, but there are no ``good'' schools or ``quality'' schools.\n  So what happens is, in 3 years or 4 years these children move, the \nfamilies put their houses up for sale and move to either another part \nof the city where they can find the quality education they are looking \nfor, or, worse, they move out of the city. That is what has happened in \nthe District of Columbia. It is what happened in New Orleans. It is \nwhat happens in Cleveland. It is what happens in Detroit. It is what \nhappens in Atlanta. It is what happens even in Houston.\n  So we have to think about a new way to encourage the development of \nquality, independent, entrepreneurial public schools, placing them in \nneighborhoods that can easily be identified as up and coming, with \nnear-term improvements, where parents, if they had a good public school \nchoice, would not leave.\n  That is what the Citybuild charter program is. So I am excited that \nthis is part of our charter school effort. We are now in the second \nyear. There have been five Citybuild charters designated by the city \nthrough a process that is open and competitive. There will be, \nhopefully, two or three more new schools placed in these neighborhoods \nthat will anchor families with small children so we can grow the \npopulation of this city and cities all over America.\n  Mayor Williams, when he came in as mayor, stated his goal that he \nwants 100,000 new residents. So we have joined him in that challenge to \nprovide more safety in the city, better transportation, better economic \nopportunity. But what most families need to stay are good schools for \ntheir children to attend. That is why we spend so much time working on \neducation reform and promoting, from my perspective, this exciting new \nopportunity for charter schools, public charters, and particularly \nCitybuild charters.\n  I thank, in closing, Deputy Mayor Robert Bobb, Council Chairperson \nLinda Cropp, DC Delegate to Congress Eleanor Holmes Norton, and Shadow \nSenator Paul Strauss, who is in the Gallery today. Specifically, I also \nthank Council Member Kathy Patterson, Superintendent of Schools \nClifford Janey, and School Board President Peggy Cooper Cafritz, and \nour staffs who are here, both Kate Eltrich and Mary Dietrich, who were \nmentioned. Without their support we could not do this bill and present \nit in a way with such limited controversy and such maximum benefit to \nthe people of the District and the people of our Nation.\n  So, again, I thank the mayor for his leadership. He makes it easy to \nwork with him. I wish him the best of luck in his future, as he, Mr. \nPresident, as you know, said he will not be running for reelection. I \nsuggested he come down South and help us. We need some help in New \nOrleans, and in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, and a good manager \nlike that could be a great help to us. We appreciate his support, and \nwe wish him the best in the future.\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record a summary of the \n$13 million investment in public charter schools in the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill.\n  The bill directs funding to specific initiatives which will \nstrengthen\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\nschools, enhance capacity, improve academic quality, and create a \nnetwork of integrated services. The committee recommended the following \ninitiatives within the amount provided for charter schools: $4 million \nfor the Direct Loan Fund for Charter Schools; $2,000,000 for Credit \nEnhancement; $2 million for continuation of the Citybuild Charter \nSchool Program; $1,500,000 for flexible grants; $2 million for grants \nfor public charter schools for improvement of public school facilities \nwhich are leased or owned by public charter schools; $400,000 for \ncollege access programming; $300,000 to create a truancy center; \n$250,000 for administration of Federal entitlement funding; $300,000 \nfor data collection and analysis; and $250,000 for administration \nwithin the State Education Office.\n  The committee report also included language to pursue access to \nfacilities for charter schools and support ongoing efforts to make \nspace available. A significant initiative of this committee, continuing \non the work started by the Congressional Control Board, was to make \nsurplus school property accessible to other educational opportunities. \nWe have required an accounting of surplus school property, encouraging \nschools to be leased or sold to charter schools, and recommend a \ndedicated account for any proceeds. I look forward to working with the \nMayor and Council to finally open these sometimes vacant, but assuredly \nunderutilized in their capacity as a schoolhouse, these surplus public \nschool buildings.\n  In addition, I would like to submit for the Record several highlights \nfrom a recent report on the impact of public charter schools on \nproviding quality public education for children across the country, as \nwell as providing healthy competition to the entire public education \nsystem.\n  The following are excerpts from the ``State of the Charter Movement \n2005, Trends, Issues, and Indicators,'' by the Charter School \nLeadership Council.\n  The Charter School Leadership Council found that:\n\n       demand for charter schools is clearly outstripping the \n     supply. The charter sector would be much bigger in the \n     absence of charter caps and if it could accommodate the \n     throngs of students on waiting lists. Charter schools are \n     concentrated in certain States and cities, though less so \n     than five years ago. Public charter schools are serving a \n     disproportionate share of minority and low-income school \n     children, and this has been the case since the beginning of \n     the charter movement. Charter schools are significantly \n     smaller than district public schools. The charter movement is \n     producing a wide array of instructional and organizational \n     models, providing lots of choices for families.\n\n  In relation to public opinion on charter schools, the Council found \nthat:\n\n       charter schools remain a mystery to much of the general \n     public. Misinformation abounds, but attitudes become more \n     favorable as knowledge grows. Twice as many registered voters \n     favor charter schools as oppose them.\n\n  By the numbers, there are 3,400 public charter schools operating \nnationwide educating one million students. That represents 2 percent of \nall students nationwide. Forty States have public charter school laws \non the books and 42 percent of charter schools are concentrated in \nthree of those States, Arizona, California, and Florida. The Council \nreport states:\n\n       The average number of charter schools per State has been \n     increasing steadily each year, from 25 in 1995, to 59 in \n     2000, to nearly 90 today. On average, over 250 charter \n     schools have been added each year for the past 12 years.\n\n  Of all the public charter schools in the country, 16 percent \nconverted from a traditional public school, 7 percent were created by a \nprivate entity, and 77 percent are newly created.\n  Dr. Brian Hassel conducted a meta-analysis of major studies and \nconcluded the following:\n\n       The existence of high quality charter schools and high \n     growth rates for charter schools, at least in many States and \n     studies, suggests that chartering holds promise as an \n     approach to getting better schools. What we have is an \n     experiment worth continuing and refining.\n       One missing element in nearly all charter studies is the \n     question of productivity: how much learning gain is produced \n     per dollar spent? A Rand study in California found that \n     ``Charter schools, particularly start-up schools, reported \n     using fewer resources per student than do conventional \n     schools . . . Most noteworthy, charter schools are achieving \n     comparable test scores despite a lower reported level of \n     revenue.'' (Ron Zimmer et al., Charter School Operations and \n     Performance: Evidence from California, Rand, 2003). According \n     to a 2004 study of ten Dayton charter schools, average per-\n     pupil funding was $7,510 vs. $10,802 for district public \n     schools, yet on average Dayton charter students outperformed \n     Dayton public school students on all portions of the 2004 \n     fourth and sixth grade State proficiency tests--in some \n     subjects by a significant margin--indicating higher \n     productivity from charters. (Alexander Russo, A Tough Nut to \n     Crack in Ohio: Charter Schooling in the Buckeye State, \n     Progressive Policy Institute, February 2005, 24).\n\n  The Council report suggests that we should be asking the right \nquestions:\n\n       Is it working? How do we know? At the moment the country is \n     not thinking clearly about these questions . . . Chartering \n     is an institutional innovation . . . With chartering we want \n     to know which pedagogical, governance, and management \n     practices succeed--and what provisions of law are \n     responsible--so policy can do more of what works better. \n     (Bryan Hassel, Studying Achievement in Charter Schools, \n     Charter School Leadership Council, January 31, 2005, 8.)\n\n  Caroline Hoxby, a professor of economics at Harvard University stated \nin her studies that:\n\n       The goal of charter reforms is not creating good charter \n     schools in the midst of mediocre public schools. The goal is \n     boosting the performance of all schools by fostering \n     competition and innovation.\n\n  In conclusion, I found this observation to be fitting to the current \nstatus of charter schools in the country. The Council report examined \nthe potential for impact and noted that Nelson Smith stated in a 2003 \nProgressive Policy Institute report, ``Catching the Wave: Lessons from \nCalifornia,'' ``Charter leaders are often asked to document the ripple \neffects of their work. But it is hard to have ripples when the lake is \nfrozen.''\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time for debate having expired, under the \nprevious order, the Brownback amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2071) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:10 \np.m. shall be equally divided between the majority leader or his \ndesignee and the Democratic leader or his designee.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nunder the quorum calls be counted equally on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2062\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, has offered. It is straightforward. \nIt would eliminate the roughly $3,100 pay raise for Members of Congress \nthat is currently scheduled to go into effect next January. That \nincrease would follow on a $4,000 pay raise this year, a $3,400 pay \nraise in 2004, a $4,700 pay raise in 2003, a $4,900 pay raise in 2002, \na $3,800 pay raise in 2001, and a $4,600 pay raise in 2000.\n  There are a number of arguments against this scheduled pay raise. The \nwar in Iraq continues to drain our Treasury at a rate of over $1 \nbillion every week. In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we face \na massively expensive relief effort. And on top of those enormous \nfiscal challenges, we are up to our necks in deficit spending. We are \npiling up billions more in debt that our children and grandchildren \nwill have to pay. At such a time, it would seem hard to justify a \nscheduled pay raise for Members of Congress. Nonetheless, I recognize \nthat some do justify it. In the end, though, the most important reason \nI joined Senator Kyl in offering this amendment is that doing so is the \nonly way to put this\n\n[[Page S11459]]\n\nbody on record with respect to our pay raise. And we should go on \nrecord on this issue.\n  Under current law, many Americans do not realize that under current \nlaw Members of Congress can get an automatic pay raise every year \nwithout lifting a finger, unless we act to stop it. It is automatic. \nThere is no requirement for a vote. All that is required is that we \nshow up to cash the check. As I have noted before in discussing this \nmatter, it is a pretty unusual thing to have the power to raise \nyour own pay. Few people have that ability. Most of our constituents do \nnot have that power. That this power is so unusual is a good reason for \nthe Congress to exercise that power openly and to exercise it subject \nto regular procedures that include a vote on the record. That is why \nthis process of automatic, stealth pay raises without accountability is \nso questionable. It is offensive. It is wrong. I believe it also may be \nunconstitutional.\n\n  The 27th amendment to the Constitution states:\n\n       No law, varying the compensation for the services of the \n     senators and representatives, shall take effect, until an \n     election of representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  That is what it says in the 27th amendment to the Constitution. I \nhave actually introduced legislation to end this automatic pay raise \nsystem, and I hope this body will pass it at some point.\n  But as the Senator from Arizona has made very clear, this amendment \ndoes not go that far. It simply stops the $3,100 pay raise that is \nscheduled for next January. I fully accept that many--even a majority--\nof my colleagues may want a pay raise. But those who want a pay raise \nshould support an open and public vote on the increase. Certainly \nhaving a vote on the record for a pay hike is better than a stealth pay \nraise that takes place with no action. Standing up and making the case \nbefore the voters is far better than quietly letting the pay raise take \neffect.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop this backdoor pay raise and then take \nthe next step by enacting legislation to end this practice once and for \nall.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for joining us in this cause that I \nhave sought to proceed with almost every year in the hopes that \nCongress and the Senate in particular will vote on the automatic pay \nraise.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nWisconsin. Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma wishes to speak in a moment. \nWhen he arrives, I will call upon him to speak.\n  Let me make a couple of comments about the reasons for this amendment \nat this time. There have been times in the past when Members have \nallowed the cost-of-living adjustment to proceed. It is not technically \na pay raise but rather a cost-of-living adjustment. That cost-of-living \nadjustment is provided for all Federal employees, including Members of \nCongress, although it is lower for Members of Congress than it is for \nother Federal employees by about half a percent. In the past, when we \nhave been in good economic times and we have had either lowered \ndeficits or even surplus conditions, Congress has allowed, most of the \ntime, though not every year, that cost-of-living adjustment to go into \neffect.\n  This year is a special circumstance. Especially since we are going to \nbe asking our colleagues and people who are recipients of Federal \nprogram benefits potentially to make a sacrifice in order to help \noffset the spending that the Federal Government is going to commit to \nthe rebuilding of the gulf coast area following Hurricane Katrina, it \nseemed to me and those of us who have cosponsored the amendment that if \nwe are going to ask others to make a sacrifice so that not all of the \nspending for Katrina recovery is added to the Federal deficit and \ntherefore the Federal debt but, rather, some of it is offset from \nprograms that we have already decided to fund, that we could start by \ndemonstrating a willingness to sacrifice a small measure ourselves.\n  It is true the $2 million that this saves is hardly noticeable in the \noverall tens of billions of dollars that are going to be spent on the \nKatrina recovery. It is symbolic. I recognize that. But sometimes \nsymbolism is important. For Members of Congress to be able to justify \nreductions in spending in other programs, where some of our \nconstituents will push back and say, Wait a minute, why should I make a \nsacrifice to rebuild after Katrina, at least we have the ability to \nsay: We all have to make a little sacrifice. Members of Congress are \nwilling to make a sacrifice as well. While it is not much money to the \noverall Federal budget, some of our families certainly recognize it as \nbeing substantially helpful to offset the cost of inflation for \nfamilies.\n  It is important for us to do this. It won't always be appropriate, \nbut it is clearly appropriate this year to make the point that we are \nready to sacrifice, and clearly it is not something that we cannot \nafford. In areas that we are going to ask for reductions in spending, \nwe will make the point that these are not areas that simply can't stand \nany kind of reduction. We are going to try to put forth maybe $50 \nbillion in spending reductions from programs that can afford to be cut \nor spending deferred for a short period of time. That is a way to at \nleast offset some of the spending that we are going to be doing for \nKatrina and yet not add further to the deficit or ultimately to our \nFederal debt. That is the reason for the amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  If the Senator from Oklahoma is prepared, I certainly yield to him at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from Arizona.\n  Because of the unique circumstances that exist today, I am going to \nbe doing something that is totally different than I normally do on this \nthe annual hypocrisy day in the Senate. I am actually going to vote for \nthis. Normally, I vote the other way. The reason I am is because--the \nSenator from Arizona and I both came here in the same year; we have \nbeen here 19 years--I have never seen a situation like there is today. \nWe have a President who inherited a military that needed to be built up \nagain. At the same time, we go into a war, and then Katrina happens. I \nthink everywhere we can we need to tighten belts. For that reason, I \nwill go ahead and support it this time, which normally I don't.\n  I say this in almost a humorous way. It is the annual hypocrisy day. \nEveryone is always down here so they can go home and say: Look what I \nhave done. I have stopped us from having a pay raise. Aren't I \nwonderful? I need to be reelected.\n  There are several dynasties in the Senate. They have been here for \nmany years. We have the Rockefeller dynasty, the Kennedy dynasty. I \nlove the people. I disagree politically with them most of the time, but \nwe have these. It is a fact. But the question I would ask is, Should \nyou have to be a Kennedy or a Rockefeller to join the Senate? I don't \nhave this problem. I have other sources of income. I am very thankful \nfor that. I have other things I put this money into, other than salary.\n  But I would say this: We have had a lot of colleagues, top-notch \npeople. I remember Dan Coats. He was a Senator from Indiana. Democrats \nand Republicans alike would say that he made some of the greatest \ncontributions to this body that anyone has ever made. Senator Dan Coats \nwas limited in his income. He found that each year that went by, they \nwould stop a cost-of-living increase. With his kids going to college, \nhe resigned. He had to retire from the Senate because of that. Do we \nwant the Dan Coatses here, or do we want just people who are wealthy in \ntheir own right?\n  I say this in a friendly way. I love everybody who is going to vote \nfor or against this thing. But in the future, we are going to change \nit. I came down last night. I was looking at my monitor in my office. I \nsaw that this amendment was coming up. I ran down to put in a second-\ndegree amendment. That second-degree amendment would have read, because \nthis is the last free ride a lot of these people are going to get \naround here, we are going to make it out in the open so everybody knows \nwhat is really going on. This idea of saying ``no but take the dough'' \nis going to be a thing of the past.\n  My amendment read:\n\n       To provide that any Member of Congress who votes for any \n     amendment (or against\n\n[[Page S11460]]\n\n     the tabling of any amendment) that prevents a cost of living \n     adjustment for Members of Congress shall not receive the \n     amount of that adjustment.\n\n  That is a very logical and responsible thing to do. I am looking for \nsomething else to put this on so that next year, when the annual \nhypocrisy day comes, we will be able to be a little bit more \nresponsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I want to voice my support for \namendment No. 2062 offered by my good friend Jon Kyl, to revoke the \nscheduled 1.9 percent salary increase for Members of Congress. As a \ncosponsor of this amendment, I believe that at this point in time it is \nnot fiscally responsible or appropriate for Members of Congress to \nincrease our pay. The Federal Government is currently running a $7.9 \ntrillion budget deficit. I do not believe that it is in the best \ninterest of the United States or the American taxpayers for Members of \nCongress to vote in favor of a congressional pay raise.\n  The annual cost of living adjustment for Members of Congress is \ndetermined by a formula which automatically takes effect unless \nCongress prohibits or revises it, which is what I hope my colleagues \nand I will accomplish today. Under the annual Member pay adjustment \nprocedure, Members are scheduled to receive a 1.9-percent increase in \nJanuary 2006. With the growing national debt, skyrocketing budget \ndeficit, and increased Federal expenditures expected as a result of the \nhurricanes this year, it is essential that we exercise fiscal restraint \nand avoid unnecessary and wasteful spending. We should first start with \nourselves and set an example for others to follow. I have been and \nremain a strong a proponent of smaller government, a balanced Federal \nbudget, and lower taxes.\n  Today, I am in my home State of Georgia with the Secretary of \nAgriculture, Mike Johanns, working to develop and promote new \ntechnologies which will increase agricultural production and expand job \ngrowth. For this reason, I am unable to be present for the vote. I \nencourage my colleagues to seize this opportunity and demonstrate \npersonal leadership in bringing the Federal budget deficit and spending \nback under control by supporting this amendment. I have consistently \nopposed a pay raise for Members of Congress throughout my tenure in \nCongress and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Kyl in sponsoring the pending amendment. This week the Senate \nbegins the difficult but necessary process of budget reconciliation. \nWhen we passed the budget resolution on April 28, 2005, we all knew \nthat tough votes were ahead as we set the Federal priorities for \nspending. However, none of us anticipated the devastation that would be \ncaused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hitting the gulf coast. The \ntremendous toll caused by those natural disasters has forced us again \nto reevaluate our priorities.\n  This amendment is something we all should support. At a time when we \nare asking the American people to tighten their belts, it is not the \ntime for members of Congress to increase our salary. We should be \nmindful of our actions and take this opportunity to do our part by \nremoving this pay increase. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat this amendment will achieve a savings of $2 million in both budget \nauthority and outlays for fiscal year 2006.\n  I intend to do my part and vote for the Kyl amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nChambliss as an original cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if there is no one else who desires to speak \nat this time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would ask to be recognized for 12 minutes as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator will note that under the previous order, a vote is \nscheduled to occur at 12:10 p.m.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK. I will quit then. Is that OK?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What was the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa wishes to be recognized \nas if in morning business until 12:10 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection. Some of us have a luncheon to go to. \nI don't want to go beyond 12:30. Of course, I will not object to the \nrequest of my friend from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized until 12:10.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12:10 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2062 offered by Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are back on the Treasury-Transportation-\nHousing and Urban Development bill. The minority Member, my partner, \nSenator Murray, and I are ready to do business. I understand we are \nwaiting for final negotiations from both sides on the potential two \nvotes that we hope will be ready to be put forward early this \nafternoon. As soon as we know something about that and can reach an \nagreement, we will advise all Senators.\n  In the meantime, the Kennedy amendment on minimum wage is pending. We \nexpect there will be an alternative amendment which will be proposed, \nand that will be voted on right after or right before the Kennedy \namendment.\n  We ask all Members who have an amendment they want to file to please \nbring it in, and we hope we can work it out with them. If it is \nsomething that can be accepted, we would like to do so because we need \nto finish this bill--the sooner the better.\n  The leaders have advised us that we will be in this week and weekend \nuntil we finish the bill. My personal preference would be to finish it \nthis week and not on Friday afternoon or Saturday.\n  It would be very helpful if they would bring in those amendments. \nVery shortly, we will be conferring with leadership on both sides to \nestablish an agreed-upon deadline for filing all first-degree \namendments.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee \nand urge all of our colleagues to bring their amendments to the floor. \nAs I stated last night, the chairman of the subcommittee was in a good \nmood. We had a great baseball game last night, from his viewpoint, for \nall of us who stayed up to watch the final home run. I think he is \namenable to talking to anyone who would like to bring their amendments \ntoday. I would suggest our colleagues get that done. I think we all \nwant to finish this bill, most importantly because we need to go to \nconference on this bill. We are again operating under a continuing \nresolution. There are many serious issues affecting our investment in \nhousing, our investment in the FAA, in transportation, highways, as \nwell as many other issues that are within this bill. We have a lot of \nwork ahead of us in terms of getting this to conference and working out \nour differences with the House.\n  I urge my colleagues to bring their amendments to the floor. We are \ngoing to be talking about a time agreement fairly soon. If Members want \ntheir issues addressed, they need to bring them to the floor.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment, the \nKennedy amendment, be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2079\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have another technical amendment to offer \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2079.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Ensures that PHAs will receive adequate funding for section 8 \n                        project-based vouchers)\n\n       On page 295, line 6, strike ``or HOPE VI vouchers'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof: ``, HOPE VI vouchers or vouchers that \n     were not in use during the 12-month period in order to be \n     available to meet a commitment pursuant to section 8(o)(13) \n     of the Act''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is rather technical, but it has to do \nwith public housing authorities and their ability to use future Section \n8 vouchers on project-based assistance needs. As many know, in the past \npublic housing was constructed when the assistance was tied to the \nproject rather than to an individual. That enabled the public housing \nauthority or other entity to get financing to build the units and then \nreceive the income from the Federal housing assistance.\n  Right now, there is a process for refining the allocation of Section \n8 vouchers to public housing authorities so they do not have unused \nSection 8 vouchers. That has been a good thing because that means the \nmoney for housing assistance goes to those who most need it. However, \nthe problem arises when public housing authorities need to put aside or \nshelve some of the needed Section 8 certificates or vouchers allocated \nto them in order to provide a basis of funding for construction of \nadditional housing.\n  In some areas--I know in my State and across the country--we can hand \nout all of the Section 8 vouchers we want for people needing housing \nassistance, and they do not do much good because there is not housing \navailable. So we have to have the flexibility for the public housing \nauthorities to take some of the vouchers allocated to them and say: We \nwill commit them to this project in order to build the housing we need.\n  This amendment includes funding for the projected use of Section 8 \nproject assistance needs of public housing agencies. Normally, for \ndeveloping housing within the project-based assistance, PHA would \nshelve the needed vouchers for the 1- to 3-year development timeline \nfor an assisted project. Under the current approach for funding \nvouchers designed to assure that there were no Section 8 certificates \nwasted, the projected funding needs related to project-based vouchers \nwould not be funded, thus removing the incentive or the ability to \ndevelop Section 8 housing, regardless of need.\n  We believe this amendment will ensure that the planned use of \nproject-based vouchers is funded without prejudice, thus allowing the \nlocal public housing authorities in communities across the country to \ndevelop project-based assisted housing where there is not otherwise \nhousing needed for the people who are homeless, who need better shelter \nin the area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are in agreement on this amendment. It \nsimply will clarify for the purposes of distributing funding from \nSection 8 housing assistance. Public housing authorities would not be \npenalized for shelving vouchers temporarily to develop a longer term \nproject. This is a fairness issue, and we are all in agreement. I urge \nits passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2079) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank all of my colleagues. If any colleagues have \ncompelling statements related to this issue which may be important in \ntheir States, we are happy to have those added to the Record with this \nvote. Again, we await the arrival of others with amendments on which we \ncan work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11461-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11461-S11468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A NEW ENERGY FUTURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I recently returned to Illinois and \ntraveled across the State. It is interesting to me that there is one \npervasive issue that you run into in every corner of my State and that \nis the cost of energy,\n\n[[Page S11462]]\n\nbecause while I was home people were still reeling from high gasoline \nprices, and announcements were being made about dramatic increases in \nnatural gas costs over the winter, which means record breaking home \nheating fuel costs. That is going to cause as great a hardship as the \nhigh gasoline prices on many individuals and families and businesses \nlarge and small. People are changing their spending habits and driving \npatterns to try to offset the high cost of gasoline. Consumers are now \npaying about $2.75 per gallon of gasoline. That is up over 80 cents \nfrom a year ago. Americans are now bracing for the record-high energy \nprices they will face when cooler weather arrives and the cold sets in.\n  The Energy Information Administration recently predicted nearly a 50-\npercent increase in home heating costs this winter. That is going to \ncause an extraordinary hardship on many people--those on fixed incomes, \nthose on very limited incomes, and those who happen to live in old \ndwellings that do not have a lot of insulation.\n  I met with families all across Illinois who are struggling with these \nhigh energy costs and their family budgets. They want to know what \nCongress is going to do. They know we spend a lot of time on the floor \nof the Senate talking about a lot of things. They would like to think \nthat 1 hour of 1 day would be spent on one issue that really makes a \ndifference in their lives, and I think if they had their choice at this \nmoment in Illinois, it would be the energy issue. They want to know how \nmuch profit is enough for ExxonMobil and BP before the former oil \nexecutives now in the Bush administration are shamed into action.\n  In the last 6 months, it is estimated that the top five oil companies \nin America collectively had $52 billion in profits--recordbreaking \nprofits. So when you start to fill up the tank and you watch that gas \npump go out of control in terms of the cost, the money is going \ndirectly to the profit margins of these oil companies. Where is the \nvoice in Washington for the consumers who are paying these gasoline \nprices? Do we just shrug our shoulders and say that is what happens in \na free market? The high profiteers step in.\n  Sadly, that is the only response we have heard from this \nadministration. These high prices are hurting everyone--families, \nfarmers, already having a tough year in my home State, small \nbusinesses, municipalities, school districts. In the meantime, these \noil and gas companies are reaping record profits. In my State of \nIllinois, consumers have already spent nearly $2.5 billion more this \nyear for gasoline than last year--$2.5 billion. By the end of the year, \nthat figure could more than double to over $5 billion--spending more \nthan $5 billion more for gasoline this year than last year, coming \nright out of family budgets and the budgets of a lot of businesses, \nlarge and small.\n  At the same time, in the first half of this year, the big oil \ncompanies--ExxonMobil, Chevron-Texaco, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Royal \nDutch/Shell--recorded a combined $52 billion in profits compared to a \nrecord $39.5 billion in the first half of 2004. They were doing pretty \nwell last year with the lower prices we were paying. Look at this \nyear--$52 billion in profit taking. That is not sales. That is $52 \nbillion in profits at a time when Americans are worrying about how they \nare going to get to work and how they are going to heat their homes \nthis winter.\n  Soon third-quarter earnings will be coming out. I suspect it is going \nto show the oil companies are doing quite well, thank you.\n  Who is paying the price? For one, airlines. Today, three airlines in \nthe United States are in bankruptcy largely because of high fuel costs. \nSecond, American consumers. Consumers are paying an additional $600 to \n$1,000 a year so they can drive to work or school. Take an average \nAmerican, someone who drives 15,000 miles a year, averages 20 miles a \ngallon. An 80-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gas this past \nyear equates to an additional $600 out of pocket for that one driver \nthis year, that's at today's gasoline price. Consider for a minute what \nthis means to people of modest means.\n  We have a pending amendment in the Chamber about raising the minimum \nwage in America. I think it has been about 8 years since we touched \nthat one. What is it, $5.15 an hour. So people get up every morning, go \nto work, doing the right thing, trying to care for their families at \n$5.15 an hour, and for 8 years we have run into resistance from people \nin the Senate who say: That is plenty. That is enough. We don't need to \nguarantee any higher minimum wage.\n  Think about it. I ran into a fellow in Illinois who said: I don't \nunderstand how a person on minimum wage filling up the tank of an old \ncar trying to get back and forth to work comes ahead at all. And that \nis the reality of life for so many people who are literally going to \nwork and falling behind every single day. And the high gasoline prices, \nsadly, are now part of the major problem these people face. At today's \ngas prices, total fuel costs for one vehicle is $2,000-plus each year. \nDouble that for a family who needs two cars to commute to work. Fuel \ncosts for that family are over $4,000.\n  Think of a low-income family. At $5.15 an hour, gross take-home pay \nfor the year is about $10,000. Now take out $2,000 for buying gasoline \nbefore you pay any income taxes or other charges against your payroll. \nImagine, if you will, these are people in our country, vulnerable \npeople who are asking if there is anybody in Washington listening. They \nare knocking on the door of the Senate, and nobody is opening the door. \nHistorically, the end of the summer driving season meant there would be \nsome relief from summer gas price hikes. While we witnessed a slight \ndrop, consumers will see no relief from energy costs.\n  Unfortunately, as I said, gasoline prices are just part of the \nproblem. Heating costs are expected to be significantly higher this \nyear. Nationwide, 55 percent of all households depend on natural gas as \ntheir primary heating fuel. In the Midwest, according to the Energy \nInformation Administration's most recent outlook, about 75 percent of \nhouseholds rely on natural gas to heat their homes. This winter, those \nhouseholds can expect to pay nearly 50 percent more than last year for \nnatural gas. Weather forecasts suggest this coming winter may be colder \nthan last year, which means even higher home heating bills. High \ngasoline, natural gas, and heating oil prices are forcing a slowdown in \nconsumer spending, an increase in consumer prices, more inflation, and \nthe greatest increase in the number of people who are delinquent in \npaying credit card bills since the 1970s energy crisis. These high \nenergy costs are rippling through the American economy, and they are \nhurting a lot of hard-working families.\n  We passed the so-called Energy bill this last August. It was signed \nby the President with great ceremony. What did that bill do? Primarily \nit funneled billions in subsidies to oil companies--to the same oil \ncompanies that are experiencing record profits? Why in the world aren't \nwe focusing on things that can literally and really make a difference \nwhen it comes to America's energy future?\n  Let me tell you the impact some of these energy prices are having. In \nthe second quarter of 2005, this year, the American Bankers Association \nreported that the percentage of credit card bills 30 days or more past \ndue reached the highest level since they began recording information 32 \nyears ago. People are falling further and further behind, and the ABA's \nchief economist cited high gasoline prices as a major factor.\n  I can't forget the fellow I ran into back in my hometown of \nSpringfield, IL, just a few days ago who said: Senator, I understand my \ncredit card company is going to require me to pay 4 percent, 4 percent \nof my balance each month. Now it only requires 2 percent. I don't know \nif I can pay 4 percent.\n  How in the world can that poor fellow and his family ever get ahead? \nTheir debt keeps increasing as they run up the cost for gasoline for \nthis fellow to get back and forth to work. There is no end in sight.\n  Earlier this year, the Democrats in the Senate offered an amendment \nto the Energy bill that would have finally put America on a path to \nreducing consumption of foreign oil imports by 40 percent in the next \n20 years. Is that a good thing for America, for us to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil? You would certainly think so. Should it be a \npartisan issue? Should Democrats and Republicans disagree on that? Why \nwould they ever disagree? But they did, all but two.\n  We are going to continue to support this measure on this side of the \naisle. I\n\n[[Page S11463]]\n\nhope that since that vote a few months ago, my friends on the other \nside of the aisle will take another look at it. This should be the \nunderpinning of our energy policy in America, to lessen our dependence \non foreign oil. We know America can do better than be held hostage to \nhigh energy bills dictated by Saudi sheiks and big oil CEOs. President \nBush even rejected a modest 1-million-barrel-per-day oil saving \nprovision that was written in the Senate Energy bill. We tried to at \nleast move just ever so slightly toward conservation, energy \nefficiency. It was rejected.\n  We understand the President and Vice President have close ties \npersonally and in their background with the oil industry. But shouldn't \nour national priority of more energy independence have been more \nimportant than that? Just before the Senate recessed to work back in \nour States, I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to President \nBush requesting him to call on his friends and allies in the oil and \ngas industry to sit down with them and make it clear that their \nprofiteering at the expense of the average person in America is killing \nthe American economy and causing extreme hardship to honest people \ngoing to work every single day. We still haven't seen the first \nindication of action from the White House.\n\n  In August, before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, when gas prices were \nabout $2.55 a gallon, I joined my colleagues, Senator Reid of Nevada \nand Senator Cantwell of Washington, in a letter to President Bush \nasking him to show Presidential leadership in reducing fuel prices, \nincluding profiteering and price gouging. Still no response from the \nWhite House.\n  We proposed a set of principles on the Democratic side of the aisle. \nWe believe these put America first. We believe that American consumers, \nbusinesses, and farmers should be better protected from multinational \ncorporations reaping record profits at the expense of the average \nconsumer and the average business in America.\n  In the next day or so, I am going to introduce legislation to help \naddress some of these issues, including a desperately needed funding \nbill for the LIHEAP program. LIHEAP is the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program. We should tax the windfall profits of these huge \noil and gas companies that are recording billions upon billions of \ndollars of profit at the expense of families and consumers across \nAmerica. We should transfer part of this money to a LIHEAP trust fund \nso that the poorest folks across America, the most vulnerable, have a \nchance to heat their homes this winter. That is pretty basic. This fund \nwould ensure that there are resources available on top of what has \nalready been appropriated by Congress for families hurt by high energy \ncosts. We are proposing other measures on the Democratic side to \nprotect consumers as well. Senator Cantwell and 26 cosponsors have \nintroduced a bill to ban gasoline price gouging and improve market \ntransparency. This all fits under the basic idea of protecting \nAmerica's consumers.\n  Senators Mikulski, Pryor, Salazar, Bill Nelson, Harkin, Corzine, \nStabenow, and Obama have introduced an amendment to the appropriations \nbill calling for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate nationwide \ngas prices that we witnessed immediately after Hurricane Katrina to see \nif there is clear evidence of profiteering.\n  Senators Kerry and Reed of Rhode Island offered an amendment to add \nfunds for the LIHEAP program so low-income families most affected by \nrecord energy prices can heat their homes this winter.\n  Senator Bingaman and 14 other cosponsors proposed an amendment to the \nEnergy bill that would require 10 percent of electricity generated be \nproduced from renewable sources by the year 2020. This measure would \nease the stress on natural gas and help to alleviate the high prices we \nhave currently witnessed.\n  Senators Schumer, Cantwell, and Lautenberg introduced a bill to \nincrease national fuel efficiency which would also save energy.\n  I have introduced a bill as well, the Strategic Gasoline and Fuel \nReserve Act of 2005. We already have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve--\nthat can hold 700 million barrels of crude oil the President can turn \nto in times of national emergency. But when we have refining capacity \ncompromised by a hurricane, crude oil is not going to be released and \nmake it to the market very quickly. So I am proposing that the United \nStates, like some European countries, create a strategic gasoline and \njet fuel reserve. Let's set aside refined product, gasoline and jet \nfuel, around the United States so the President has another tool to use \nwhen we see these price spikes to help businesses like America's \nairlines and other businesses overcome these skyrocketing prices.\n  America needs a long-term plan to diversify our energy resources. We \nhave to do this to improve energy efficiency, conservation, and to \nprevent the energy giants from market manipulation and price gouging. \nIt does not appear there is any cop on the beat in Washington. There is \nno one who is either threatening or punishing the profiteers who are \nraising the price of energy unconscionably. For a long time, the finger \nof blame was pointed at the OPEC cartel and the Saudi sheiks, but we \nknow now that their profit increase is modest, about 46 percent over \nlast year, compared to the dramatic and obscene record profit increases \nby the big oil companies of 255 percent over last year. That is where \nthe money is going. It is going to the boardrooms of the largest oil \ncompanies in America.\n  This administration and this Congress are mute. They definitely do \nnot want to rock the boat when it comes to their friends in these big \noil companies. Instead, the only response from the administration is a \nplea by the Secretary of Energy for a campaign to conserve energy. \nWell, that is a good thing. But should not the administration also be \nthere to protect consumers and to punish profiteers in addition to \npreaching conservation?\n  This is what the President said:\n\n       We can all pitch in . . . by being better conservers of \n     energy.\n\n  Here are some suggestions: Drive less, replace traditional light \nbulbs with more efficient light bulbs, keep your car well maintained, \nand your tires properly inflated, and seal leaky windows and doors; all \nvery nice and practical suggestions. But would it not be nice if these \npractical ideas of conservation were accompanied by some effort by this \nadministration to hold the oil companies responsible for profiteering \nat the expense of American consumers? Not a word.\n  I strongly support conservation efforts. Changes in that way can make \na significant difference and save Americans millions of dollars. But \nPresident Bush's plea for conservation is like putting a gallon of gas \nin a Hummer and expecting to drive 50 miles.\n  While small conservation steps will help manage the current energy \ncrisis, we need a broader policy change that includes a long-term \ncommitment to expanding and diversifying energy sources. We have to \nexpand the use and access to alternative fuels, create a more efficient \ntransportation sector, increase the efficiency of our homes, and \npromote conservation. We need energy policies that place national \ninterests before corporate interests, that put the well-being of the \nAmerican family before energy CEOs, and make investments to strengthen \nAmerica's energy security, instead of providing tax cuts to make \nAmerica's wealthiest individuals and corporations even wealthier.\n  This administration will not consider such measures, and in many \ncases they blatantly rejected them. Before the recent call for \nconservation, the Bush administration had done virtually nothing to \ndevelop long-term energy solutions and promote efficiency and \nconservation. While President Bush now calls for conservation, his own \nDepartment of Energy quietly helped prevent advancements on new \nbuilding efficiency standards for insulation, standards that would have \nincreased efficiency in new homes, saving billions of dollars in energy \ncosts for Americans over the next few decades.\n  The other thing we have to do, as a fundamental policy when it comes \nto energy in policy, is to focus on the fuel efficiency of the cars and \ntrucks we drive. When we faced the oil crisis in the 1970s, we \nunderstood we were driving cars and trucks that were not adequately \nfuel efficient. The fleet average of fuel economy for cars and trucks \nacross America was about 14 miles a gallon. So Congress knew there were\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\ntwo ways to push the automobile manufacturers toward more fuel-\nefficient cars. One was if the price of gasoline went up dramatically, \npeople would make the decision on their own they needed a more fuel-\nefficient car, but of course that involved a lot of economic pain in \nthe process. The other was to establish federally mandated standards \nfor fuel efficiency for cars and trucks in America.\n  So what was the response of the Big Three in Detroit when we said in \n1975 that they should double the fuel economy of cars and trucks in \nAmerica from 14 miles a gallon to 28 miles a gallon over 10 years? They \nsaid as follows: It is technologically impossible; the cars and trucks \nthat we build will be so unsafe you will regret the decision pushing \nfor more fuel efficiency, and this will definitely drive more imports \ninto America because the Japanese and others will focus on making those \nmore fuel-efficient cars.\n  Thank goodness Congress rejected those three arguments by the \nautomobile manufacturers and in 1975 imposed the CAFE standards. As a \nresult, 10 years later, the average fuel efficiency had doubled in the \nUnited States. All of the ominous warnings from Detroit \nnotwithstanding, we as a nation did the right thing. The one wrong \nthing we did was to carve out an exemption for trucks. It turned out \nthat exemption was so broadly worded that they drove the big old \nHummers and SUVs right into it as they were exempt from the highest \nstandards.\n  And what happened next? America got this voracious appetite for these \nhuge hunks of metal on the highway which burn up the gasoline as fast \nas the tank can be filled, and we watched the average fuel efficiency \nin 1985 go down from 28 miles a gallon to about 21 miles a gallon \ntoday. We have gone in the wrong direction. We are burning more \ngasoline for the same miles that we drove in 1985.\n  What have we done in Congress since then to establish new CAFE \nstandards for America's cars and trucks? Absolutely nothing. When I \ncalled for an amendment in the Energy bill debate to establish national \nCAFE fuel efficiency standards over the next 10 years, improving fuel \nefficiency by 1 mile a gallon each year for 10 years, the amendment was \ndefeated, with only 28 Senators supporting it. Americans I have run \ninto, and certainly people in my home State of Illinois, shake their \nhead when they are told that story. They ask, what are these Senators \nthinking? Why would we not move as a national policy toward more fuel-\nefficient vehicles?\n  Well, the automobile dealers have realized that. They have car lots \nfull of SUVs and heavy trucks that consumers are walking right by, \nsaying, well, what is the fuel efficiency of that car? How many miles \nper gallon on that truck? They are asking the hard questions now \nbecause gasoline prices are going up. I think it is time to return to \nthis debate on CAFE and to put honest fuel efficiency standards on the \nbooks in America, to demand that those in Detroit and others take into \nconsideration the fact that we need to lessen our dependence on foreign \noil and we need to give consumers an opportunity.\n  Earlier this year my wife and I were considering buying a car. We \nwanted an American car. My wife drives it more than I do. She takes it \non the highway so we wanted a larger car, but we did not want an SUV. \nTry to find that highway-type car made in America that is fuel \nefficient. We finally found one, the Ford Escape hybrid. We bought one. \nHow many were made in the United States this year? Only 20,000. There \nis a long waiting list for people to buy these cars. Ford says they \nhope in years to come they will start producing more of them.\n  Meanwhile, Japanese automobile manufacturers are making these hybrid \ncars and selling them as fast as they make them. It is a shame again \nthat Detroit was asleep at the switch and they did not see this coming. \nThey tend to react a little too late and, sadly, that is one of the \nreasons they face the financial difficulties they do.\n  While increasing efficiency of our vehicles is no longer an option, \nit is a necessity. Consumers are demanding better fuel efficiency, and \nunfortunately American auto companies are realizing a little too late \nthat they did not think ahead.\n\n  In the past month, General Motors witnessed a 24-percent decline in \nsales over the same month last year. Ford sales were down 20 percent, \nwhile U.S. sales of Japanese automobiles increased 10 to 12 percent. \nSales of hybrid vehicles soared. In the past month, Honda Civic hybrid \nsales increased 37 percent. So while the Senate does not get it when it \ncomes to fuel efficiency and fuel economy of cars, consumers get it and \nthey are saying with their checkbooks and credit cards they are going \nto buy the vehicles that make more sense.\n  I believe American ingenuity can meet this test, can produce the cars \nand trucks we need to keep our economy moving forward with safe cars \nthat are much more fuel efficient.\n  We also need to invest in the production of alternative fuels and \nprovide incentives for their use. We need to break the stranglehold of \nbig oil, open the market to real competition, and give American \nconsumers real energy choices. Ford recently announced more production \nof its dual fuel vehicles. That is good news, but we know there is only \na small number of vehicles on the road that actually use these \nalternative fuels. The gas-saving potential of these vehicles is \nlargely wasted. We should be promoting the actual use of alternative \nfuels that can reap the benefits of new gas-saving technologies.\n  The fact that we included language in the Energy bill to increase \nethanol production and biodiesel is all good, but it is only a small \npart of the battle. We need to make sure that ethanol reaches the \nmarket and that there are cars equipped for E-85 and ethanol compliance \nso consumers can take advantage of the benefits of their homegrown \nfuel.\n  America has 3 percent of the world's known oil reserves. We use 25 \npercent of the world's oil. We can never, ever drill our way out of \nthis challenge. There is no way we can find energy independence by \ndrilling away in the pristine areas that have been protected around \nAmerica, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is a sad \nindictment on this administration and this Congress that instead of \naccepting the challenge of conservation and fuel efficiency, instead of \nasking for sacrifice and a dedicated commitment from the automobile \ncompanies as well as American consumers, we are going to run willy-\nnilly into a national wildlife reserve that was created by President \nEisenhower over 50 years ago and say the only way we can meet our needs \nis to start drilling away for oil, the environment be damned.\n  The big oil companies and many of my colleagues want to open this \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. I have been there. It would be a \ntragic mistake. Sadly, if we do it, over 20 years it will produce less \nthan 1 year's worth of oil supply for the United States. This is not \nthe answer to our prayers. In fact, we should be condemned for turning \nour back on this great piece of America that we are willing to exploit \nbecause of our own bad energy policies. Instead of destroying this \nnational habitat, we should think strategically and creatively to find \nnew ways to meet our future energy needs.\n  America can do better, and when it comes to our energy policy it is \nclear we are missing the responsibility that Members of Congress should \nshare. We need to protect America's consumers. We need to punish the \nprofiteers and we need to promote, on a national scale, efficiency, \nconservation and alternative fuels. America can only do better with \nleadership and a clear energy policy and a plan. We have to look beyond \nthe quarterly profits of the big oil companies and the clout they have \non Capitol Hill and remember that we are serving the public, voters \nacross America, who have to face every single day these skyrocketing \ngasoline prices and the prospects of a very cold and expensive winter.\n  I believe in American creativity and innovation, and I know that \ntogether we can create a better future for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is very interesting to hear this speech \non energy. There were a couple of things my colleague from Illinois \nsaid that I agree with. No. 1, energy prices are a real problem. No. 2, \nLIHEAP needs to\n\n[[Page S11465]]\n\nbe reviewed by the appropriate Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee. \nNo. 3, the good things we are doing in ethanol and biodiesel need to \ncontinue. No. 4, maybe he did not say it on the floor, but he and I \nboth agree on the St. Louis Cardinals. That is about the extent of the \nthings I could find on which we agree.\n  Let me go through a few of them. First, all of us are paying more at \nthe gasoline pump. This is having a conservation impact. People are \ndriving less. Everybody is thinking about how they can take fewer \ntrips. Certainly we are in our family. I believe the statistics show \nthat people are conserving more. Talk about turning back your heat \nduring the winter, we are one of those families--I think it is 57 \npercent of the families in the United States--who heat with natural \ngas. That thermostat is not going to go down a couple of degrees; it is \ngoing to go down more than that. We are going to be pulling out the \nsweaters.\n  There are some people who cannot do anything about it. There are \nworkers who have to travel on jobs. There are small businesses that are \ntrying to keep their businesses going. There are famers who have to \nkeep up with those prices. This is a real concern for our economy. For \nsmall businesses that will be hit by increased costs of energy for \noperating their business, my colleague seems to want to add a minimum \nwage increase. When your margins are being squeezed by energy costs, \nwhat happens if the minimum wage goes up? Those young people, the \npeople just starting out in the business, the people who might be \ngetting minimum wage--and it is down around 6 percent of workers these \ndays--are probably going to be the ones let go. The people who need to \nget a start in the process, who need to get a job, are the ones who are \ngoing to lose their jobs because the minimum wage is going to put a \nfurther squeeze on the profits of small businesses. To see a \nrequirement that they pay a higher cost for entry-level workers is \neither going to eliminate existing jobs or certainly stifle the \ncreation of new jobs.\n  For those people on minimum wage, for those families, we have the \nearned-income tax credit; we have all forms of assistance and this is \nproper. We need to help those people get started because a significant \nnumber, an overwhelming number of those starting with the minimum wage \nget a 10-percent increase at the end of the first year. They have to \nlearn to work, and that is how they get started.\n  Let's go back to the problems we have with energy. We have real \nproblems in energy that came about even before Katrina and Rita hit our \nrefineries and hit the gulf coast. We concentrated our petroleum \nproduction mainly in the gulf coast region around Texas and Louisiana. \nWhy? Because too many people said, No, you can't drill here. In other \nplaces where we have oil and gas, they are being prohibited from \ndrilling. People say we can't drill for natural gas off the coast, and \nI say, Why not? We have to do so in an environmentally sound manner. We \nhave to protect the environment. But siting a natural gas rig 15 miles \nout in the sea, if it is done in an environmentally sound way, is not \nthreatening the way of life of people along our coast.\n  The occupant of the chair and I happen to come from a State where we \nmine a lot of lead. Lead mining is environmentally difficult. Everybody \nknows the problems lead can cause, but lead is absolutely critical in \nmany of the goods we produce, computers, and other things. So we \nproduce much of the lead in the United States because we have 90 \npercent of the lead that exists in the United States. I have told some \nof my friends who do not want to drill for natural gas in their States \nor off their shores, we in Missouri would be happy to trade you our \nlead for your natural gas. You can mine for the lead and we will be \nhappy to pump the natural gas. Natural resources have to be developed \nwhere they are found.\n  Ten years ago, we passed a bill authorizing the opening up of that \nsmall portion, and only a fraction of that small portion, set aside in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the development of natural \nresources. When ANWR was set up, there was a portion set aside \nspecifically for the development of natural resources. To the west of \nthere in Prudhoe Bay, they are producing oil in substantial amounts. \nThe best estimates we have heard is that if we had gone ahead, if the \nPresident 10 years ago had not vetoed the opening up of ANWR, we would \nbe getting over 900,000 barrels of oil a day from the ANWR. That is not \ngoing to solve all of our problems, but it is certainly a start. \nRegrettably, it is a lot more than even our farmers can produce in \nterms of ethanol and biodiesel.\n  We need to pursue every area. That includes conservation. That \nincludes new sources. That includes developing additional resources \nthat we have in the United States. Right now, because we are busily \nengaged in a bill that primarily doesn't have anything to do with \nenergy--and I remind my colleagues this is the TTHUD appropriations \nbill. We are talking about appropriations for Treasury, Transportation, \nHousing, and Urban Development. My colleague and I are looking forward \nto having amendments on that bill and also the Judiciary and related \nagencies.\n  There is a hearing going on in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and I would love to be there because the chairman has \nproposed a bill to fast-track permitting for refineries. It can take up \nto 20 years to get a refinery built. It is too costly. Our refinery \ncapacity for petroleum products has been stretched to the limit. When \nKatrina and Rita knocked out those facilities, we found ourselves in a \nterrible shortage. We need to streamline the process, go through all \nthe steps but do so in an orderly manner so we can bring more \nrefineries online in an efficient and environmentally friendly way.\n  Incidentally, what we need to do in that fast-track permit is to \nfast-track permitting of coal liquefaction and coal gasification. We \nare sitting on a 250-year supply of energy in the form of coal. We are \nthe Saudi Arabia of coal. Coal has been a problem because, when you \nburn it as we have in the past, it produces sulfur, nitrous oxides, \ncarbon, and mercury. But the coal we have in the Midwest, while it is \nhigh in sulfur, is high in Btu, and it can be turned into gas or turned \ninto diesel fuel or aviation fuel in a way that removes almost all, if \nnot all, of the pollutants.\n  We need to get coal refineries putting online plants to replace the \nnatural gas that is being burned in utility boilers. Wasting natural \ngas in utility boilers has come home to roost. Twenty-five years ago, I \nheard Glenn Seaborg, a Nobel Prize winner, talking about energy. He \nsaid there are some people who want to burn natural gas in combustion \nboilers to produce energy. He said using natural gas for that purpose \nis similar to taking your most prized piece of antique furniture and \nthrowing it in the fireplace to keep you warm. That is a bad use.\n\n  But environmental policies without considering energy impacts forced \nmost of the new electric generating plants in the last decade to come \nonline on natural gas. All those who are heating with natural gas are \npaying the price now. We can get a replacement for that natural gas by \nusing gasified coal, but we need to do so pretty darned quick.\n  We need to open up areas for the production of natural gas. One of \nthe things we should remember is that the natural gas problem, the \ncrisis we face, is not only brought about by constriction and \nrestriction on the ability to produce the natural gas that exists off \nour coasts, in our Federal land, in the resource-producing areas set \naside when ANWR was developed, but we are also facing a natural gas \ncrisis because we have forced utility companies to burn natural gas to \nproduce electricity. We need to be smarter and replace that natural gas \nwith coal gas.\n  We also have had hysteria over nuclear power. Nuclear power is the \nmost environmentally friendly, cheapest way to produce electricity. \nThanks to the Energy bill we passed, we are moving ahead to develop new \nnuclear power. Our nuclear power facilities are getting old. There has \nnever been a death; they are the safest means of energy production we \nhave. Look at France, not an area we normally cite as an example, but \n80 percent of their electricity is generated by nuclear. We need to go \nback to development of the new style, safe nuclear powerplants, and \nbring them online as quickly as we can.\n  My colleague had some interesting ideas. I am not surprised the \nleadership\n\n[[Page S11466]]\n\nof the other party would come forth with taxes and windfall profits and \nideas such as that, that might sound good, unless you study economics. \nThen you wonder, when was it that we passed a law making profits \nillegal? We do have laws. We have laws against restraint of trade. We \nhave laws against price fixing, that say you cannot gain a profit by \nagreeing with your competitor to fix prices. We have unfair competition \nlaws on the books at the FTC, and many States do, about price gouging. \nBut profits, No. 1, are taxed and, No. 2, are supposed to be providing \nthe investment we make in the new facilities, for example to produce \nmore oil and gas and coal, to refine it and to deliver it to market.\n  Profiteering--I am not exactly sure at what level making a profit is \nimproper or illegal. I have spent a lot of time as a lawyer on legal \ncases coming out many years ago on the windfall profits tax, and I \nfound for law firms, litigating windfall profits is a multiyear \nendeavor with more funds expended on lawyers than recovered. It is not \nan easy process and not one for which I would argue.\n  Also, the suggestion has been made that we ought to establish higher \nCAFE standards. We have had that debate. We have had that debate a \nnumber of times. If I remember correctly, a bipartisan majority got \nbehind something called the Bond-Levin or the Levin-Bond amendment, \nwhich said we need to increase our fuel efficiency standards, but we \nshould not make the same mistakes we made originally. Yes, when we \npassed CAFE standards, one of the ways the CAFE standards were met were \ncar companies building lighter weight cars, 1,000 or 2,000 pounds \nlighter. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said \nbetween 1,600 and 2,000 people a year are killed on the highways solely \nbecause of the lighter cars.\n  Yes, more cars are being imported, consumers are seeing more cars \ncoming in from abroad, and they are demanding more fuel-efficient cars, \nsuch as hybrid cars, and that is good. But we passed a law mandating \nthe NHTSA to increase the fuel standards as rapidly as technology will \npermit them to increase those standards without endangering the lives \nof the passengers by making lighter weight vehicles. So we do have an \nagency looking out for safety, looking out for the technical advances. \nTechnology has already warranted their increasing the fuel mileage on \nlight trucks and other autos.\n  If you want to, I guess my colleagues on the other side could come \nout and pass a law banning hybrids, saying you cannot buy an SUV, you \ncan't buy a small truck. Maybe you would have to get a permit if you \nwere a farmer. That is the way they did it in the Soviet Union. You \nonly got a truck if the government decided you needed a truck. I am not \nsure we want to go down that path, saying we are going to tell you what \nkind of truck you can have, and if you have a large family and want to \nbe able to transport them to school, to church, to health care, to see \nother family members, the Government is going to decide how big a car \nor how big an SUV you can have. If they want to debate that I would be \nhappy to do that. But as long as we are selling cars and trucks that \nconsumers want, I think pushing the technology as fast as we can is a \nresponsible way to get there.\n  Yes, I also agree we ought to consider LIHEAP increases to help low-\nincome seniors. That is good. We need to push ethanol and biodiesel. \nThe occupant of the chair was successful in getting the amendment \nadopted that mandated 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels be used by \n2012. All of these things are important. I believe we must get a good \nrefinery bill fast-tracking refineries.\n  In the meantime, as we think about all these energy problems, I hope \nmy colleagues will come forward with their amendments to this bill, as \nI mentioned a long time ago, the Treasury, Transportation, Housing and \nUrban Development and Judiciary.\n  Let us see if we can't get some amendments on this bill and move \nforward with that.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first commend my colleague from \nMissouri.\n  For those who are witnessing this, it is becoming dangerously close \nto real debate on the floor of the Senate. This is history in the \nmaking. It almost never happens that two Senators who disagree on an \nissue will stand and argue their point of view back and forth. One of \nthe reasons I wanted to run for this body was because I could come over \nhere and engage in debate. I certainly respect the Senator from \nMissouri. We have much different views on energy, and I think he has \narticulated his point of view as clearly as one could hope for with a \nmoment's notice. He didn't know I was coming to the floor to talk about \nenergy. He did an excellent job.\n  I would like to clarify a few things. The first point is this: It was \nthe wisdom of our Founding Fathers which said that every State in the \nUnion would have two Senators, which means the State of Missouri has \ntwo Senators and the State of Illinois has two Senators. I wish the \nvery best for the St. Louis Cardinals, and I am certain that the two \nMissouri Senators are rooting every moment of every day for their \nvictory. But this Senator from Illinois is backing an Illinois baseball \nteam known as the Chicago White Sox. They were successful in winning \nthe American League pennant. I hope they go all the way in the World \nSeries. Despite my boyhood roots, I am rooting for the Illinois \nbaseball team. I had better say that clearly on the record or I can't \ngo home.\n  The second thing I say is when it comes to energy, I listened \ncarefully to what the Senator from Missouri had to say. In virtually \nevery instance, he suggested there were ways to find new and better and \nlarger sources of energy to take care of our problem. I listened \nclosely for any suggestion from him that we should have conservation \nand efficiency as part of a national energy policy. If he said it, I \nmissed it.\n  I think it is a critical part, because we have to understand that the \nconservation of energy means not only that we reduce the costs for \nfamilies and businesses to provide the same level of goods and \nservices, we also reduce the pollution that is a product of burning \nenergy across America. It is a ``two-fer.'' If you believe we can keep \nfinding new energy sources, whether it is oil in a national wildlife \nrefuge up in Alaska or drilling off some of the coasts where \nGovernors--both Democrats and Republicans--have said we do not accept \nthat as something we want as part of our State's economy, if you keep \nlooking for these new energy sources, you are ignoring the obvious. And \nthe obvious is that fuel efficiency and fuel conservation should be \npart of what we do in America. We have learned that over the years. We \nhaven't compromised our lifestyle while we found more fuel efficiency \nin so many different areas of our life every part of every day.\n  I will concede that the Senator from Missouri did join the Senator \nfrom Michigan in putting together an amendment that at least mentioned \nthe words ``fuel efficiency'' and ``conservation'' in the last Energy \nbill. But I have to say in all fairness that is all it did. It didn't \nput any requirement on the automobile manufacturers to make more \nefficient cars and trucks across America.\n  Every time you talk about CAFE standards and fuel efficiency, we get \na history lesson about what the Soviet Government was all about--top-\ndown government, mandating these policies, forcing rugged individuals \nwho would like to go their own way to march in close rank and march in \nline.\n  I have to say I view this a lot differently. Left to their own \ndevices, the major automobile manufacturers in America made hundreds of \nthousands of cars and trucks which Americans don't want to buy. They \nare now crowding our lots with heavy trucks and SUVs, and Americans are \nwalking right past them. Instead, we should have thought long ago about \nestablishing standards that would give consumers a choice in America.\n  Why is America coming in second when it comes to automotive \ntechnology? When it came to hybrids, the Japanese automobile \nmanufacturers, Honda and Toyota, got the jump on the United States. Are \nthey smarter than we are? I don't think so. Many of their engineers and \nresearch scientists went to school in the United States and went back \nto their countries to build the cars and trucks Americans wanted to \nbuy. For some reason, Detroit is always a little behind the curve, and \nin\n\n[[Page S11467]]\n\nthis situation, it is dangerous because they are so far from \nprofitability and they have such dramatic costs that they made a \nterrible calculation by sticking with these heavy vehicles as the price \nof fuel and energy went up across America. I don't think it is the \nheavy hand of Government. I think it is good public policy for us to \nmove forward on a policy for CAFE standards that increases fuel \nefficiency. The argument that that means unsafe cars I don't accept. I \nhappen to believe that in an era of new technologies for safety and \notherwise, there are ways to improve the cars and trucks we drive in \nterms of safety without compromising fuel efficiency.\n\n  There are things we can do--creative approaches already recognized by \nthe scientific agencies in Washington--that could be part of cars and \ntrucks in the future. They are not, and they should be. For us to move \nforward on that as a national policy is to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. If you believe, as I do, that is a worthy national goal, \nthen conservation and fuel efficiency have to be part of it.\n  The second issue which I raise, and which the Senator from Missouri \nmentioned, was a bill that could come before us soon, already having \npassed the House, that would suggest that in order to have the oil we \nneed in America, in order to expand oil refinery capacity, we have to \nwaive the pollution rules when it comes to air pollution and water \npollution, and we have to waive the environmental standards refineries \nhave been held to in America. The argument is, if you do not waive \nthese environmental standards, we will not have enough gasoline, and \nyou will have to pay more. It is a classic ``your money or your life'' \nargument, because these environmental and pollution standards are there \nfor a purpose.\n  I invite my colleague from Missouri and all of my friends to visit \nany classroom of any school in America and ask the following question: \nHow many students in this classroom know someone who has asthma? Watch \nthe hands go up. Do you know why? Because across America these lung \nproblems that air pollution has some relation to are becoming epidemic. \nVisit a major hospital in St. Louis or Chicago--a children's hospital \nin particular--and ask in the emergency room what the No. 1 diagnosis \nis of children brought into their emergency room. I can virtually \nguarantee it is going to be asthma. What are we going to do? We are \nbeing asked to waive the air pollution standards for certain industries \nand for refineries so we can get cheaper gasoline while we breathe \ndirtier air. What a terrific bargain for America. Is that as good as it \ngets with this administration? They cannot meet the energy needs of \nAmerica without asking us to compromise our public health, to \ncompromise the safety and quality of water that we drink, to compromise \nenvironmental standards that have been established for years.\n  This morning, a major company from Illinois--I spoke to one of their \nrepresentatives--said several years ago under the Clinton \nadministration they agreed to a reformulation of diesel fuel in \nAmerica, a long-term project that would make diesel fuel cleaner in \nAmerica. Do you know what diesel fuel looks like, or used to look like \nas it came with billowing smoke out of the tailpipes of cars and \ntrucks? They want to move to the point where it is much cleaner. Years \nago, we made a commitment as a nation to move to reformulating diesel \nso it is cleaner for America.\n  One of the bills before the Congress today waives that reformulation \nrequirement after 6 years of investment in cleaner diesel fuel and \ncleaner diesel engines. This administration says we have to abandon \nthat, go back to more air pollution from diesel use in order to have \ncheaper gasoline we can buy across America. What a tradeoff, what an \nabdication of leadership. America can certainly do better than that.\n  To have this administration tell us that the only answer to \naffordable energy is to compromise the public health and to put up with \nmore air and water pollution is a completely unacceptable alternative. \nI wouldn't want to go to the Senator from the State of Florida, who is \nin the chair, and tell him that the Federal Government is going to \nmandate drilling off the coast of Florida. I can tell you that the \nGovernor of Florida, who happens to share the same last name as the \nPresident, doesn't think that is a very good idea.\n  For the suggestion that may have been made here that we need to start \nmoving and burning and drilling off the States that don't want oil \ndrilling and gas drilling off their coasts is a major move by this \nadministration.\n  Again, you have to ask the basic question: Why would we do anything \nthat radical from Washington to deal with energy before we even discuss \nthe possibility of conservation and fuel efficiency of the cars and \ntrucks we drive? I think we have to accept responsibility. It isn't \njust a question of answering every challenge in America by saying, \nparty on, you know we are going to find some more energy for you, just \nkeep using it up, don't pay any attention until tomorrow. I think \nAmerica understands, and our younger people understand better, that we \nneed a serious energy policy that challenges every single one of us as \nconsumers not only to turn down the thermostat, but be smarter in the \ncars and trucks we buy, challenge the manufacturers in Detroit to \nproduce cars and trucks that are mindful of energy needs across America \nand the increasing costs of that energy to families and our economy. We \nneed a government with the leadership that is responsive to this \nnational challenge.\n  The last Energy bill didn't do it. The ink was hardly dry in August \nuntil the Members of the Senate said we had better get back and write a \nnew energy bill.\n\n  For goodness sakes, that is the greatest single condemnation of the \nsubstance of that bill I can think of. We all know it is true. That \nlast energy bill didn't do it. In a few isolated areas, as I mentioned \nearlier, it is a good bill. But, by and large, it didn't address the \nfundamental problem facing us today and for years to come.\n  The last point I will make is this: America's most serious \ncompetition in the world today comes from one country, China. China \nright now is mushrooming in growth. They are building new industries \nright and left. If you walk into a Wal-Mart to buy a product, you are \nwalking into the largest importer of Chinese goods in America, Wal-Mart \nselling all across the United States. The obvious question is this: \nWhat is China doing about its energy needs? First, it is doing \nsomething we are not doing. It is imposing higher fuel efficiency \nstandards on its cars and trucks than we do in America. The Chinese are \nthinking ahead. They understand that inefficient cars and trucks are \nnot part of a bright energy future.\n  The second thing they are doing is fighting us tooth and nail in \nevery site around the world where energy can be purchased. They are now \nour competition for the purchase of energy. Twenty years ago, we didn't \neven think about it. They did not have an economy that used that much \nenergy. They weren't producing goods and services. That world has \nchanged.\n  Now, as we continue to be dependent on foreign oil, we are going to \nhave to continue to fight the Chinese and others for affordable fuel. \nThat is the reality of global competition.\n  Does it make sense for us now to take a step back and say as a \nnational energy policy we ought to figure out ways to keep the American \neconomy moving, businesses thriving, and jobs being created, but also \nbuild into that energy conservation and efficiency?\n  That to me is so obvious. Every time I bring it up in a town meeting \nin Illinois, people shake their heads and say, You are honestly \ndebating that in Washington; it seems so obvious. We are debating it. \nSo far I have lost that debate. But as energy prices go up and people \nrealize that the energy policy of this administration has failed, I \nhope we revisit this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I had not intended to extend this wonderful \ndiscussion because we were trying to get amendments on the Treasury, \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Judiciary bill. I \ninvite people to come down and offer amendments. However, since my \ncolleague and neighbor brought it up, I thought I might mention a few \nthings.\n  No. 1, while he might want to root for the White Sox in the World \nSeries, I was hoping he would not neglect and disregard and disrespect \nall of our wonderful Illinois neighbors who live in the southern part \nof the State who are St.\n\n[[Page S11468]]\n\nLouis Cardinal fans. It is with a heavy heart that I tell the people of \nsouthern Illinois that the Cardinal fans have been ``dissed'' by my \ncolleague from across the river.\n  I wouldn't normally do that, but since he misquoted what I said, I \nthought I might as well take the same liberties and misquote what he \nhad to say.\n  First, right there at the end I thought we were almost opening a new \nfront in this debate. Wal-Mart bashing; oh, that is a great liberal \nsport these days, bashing Wal-Mart. I saw just the hint of Wal-Mart \nbashing. But I am sorry, I didn't mean to attribute that to my \ncolleague. He walked away from it. So we are not into Wal-Mart bashing. \nBut he did say I wasn't interested in conservation or energy \nefficiency. Perhaps the reason he didn't vote for the Bond-Levin or \nLevin-Bond amendments to conserve energy and assure energy efficiency \nis he didn't understand that we ordered the scientists at the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration to find the new technologies and \nrequire that fuel efficiency improvements be made as technological \nadvances go forward.\n  That is the whole idea.\n  How about letting the scientists say what technology actually works? \nIt is a lot more fun on the stump making a political speech saying we \nare going to double the mileage--and, by the way, forget about it if \nthe lighter cars do kill more people. The National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration has produced those figures: the lighter cars have \nbeen killing more people.\n  The third thing he said was we are going to waive all the \nenvironmental rules. We have had continually improving air quality in \nthis country. We are making progress, and we are continuing to make \nprogress. That is extremely important.\n  Are we going to get rid of the standards? No. How about getting the \nnumber of processes? One refinery had 800 different permitting \nprocesses to go through. How many different permitting processes do you \nhave to go through? We need to hold these refineries or other new \nfacilities to the standards we are setting to make air cleaner. When \ngovernment bureaucracy and lawsuits tell them how to build and how to \noperate the facilities, we get tremendous waste. This is why I am \ntalking about economics. Economics is bringing about conservation, as \nis the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as are other \nconservation measures--new appliances with conservation standards.\n  Each one of us has the ability, in responding to the marketplace as \nto the price of energy, to make wise decisions about energy usage. The \nmarket does work.\n  If my colleague wants to have an allocation system to tell the \nAmerican public what kind of cars and trucks they can buy and dictate \nwhat cars, trucks, and SUVs can be made by auto manufacturers, let's \nhave that debate. In the meantime, let us all concede that the auto \ncompanies may have missed the mood. They may have made mistakes. They \nare paying for those mistakes in misjudging the market. But I would \nrather have the private sector taking the hit because they are in it \nfor the profit motive, and they can afford it, rather than have the \ngovernment make those decisions which cost jobs, which cost our \neconomy.\n  I am hoping a Member will have an additional amendment. I will look \nfor that.\n  I do not intend to answer my colleague from Illinois any further \nother than to say that if he cites my position, I will probably \ndisagree with his characterization of my position. But we will have \nthis debate perhaps again when we have an honest to goodness Energy \nbill, maybe one that fast-tracks refineries that would get us the oil, \ndiesel, aviation fuel, and the coal gas we need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois, from the southern \npart of Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am from all of Illinois.\n  The Presiding Officer must face the same thing in the State of \nFlorida with your loyalties for sports teams. You cannot win in the \nState of Illinois. No matter where you go you will run into \nopposition--whether a Cardinals, Cubs, or White Sox fan.\n  I think we have made that issue. At least my position on that issue \nis clear as we can.\n  I say in closing, and I certainly invite the Senator from Missouri to \nrespond, we ought to ask ourselves the basic question: If you have a \nbusiness in America that is unsuccessful, and the business has a loss \nin one given year, we provide in our Tax Code that business can carry \nthat loss forward from the year that it was experienced, so next year's \nprofits can be reduced accordingly. Your tax liability is reduced \naccordingly. It is a carry-forward provision for business losses.\n  It seems to me consistent to say that those corporations which have \nextraordinary profit taking--as we see with these major oil companies--\nwould be subject to additional taxes.\n  I am sure the Senator from Missouri disagrees with me. But we have \nnow seen virtually--I am trying to figure the calculation--roughly 30 \npercent increase in profits for the major oil companies in the United \nStates of America, over the last 6 months, over last year. Last year \nwas a big year for them. Last year, in the same 6-month period, they \nhad about $39 billion in profits. This was with $40-a-barrel oil. This \nyear it is up 30 percent over last year's profits.\n  Why? We know why. When we go to the gas station, we know why. The \nprice at the pump has gone up dramatically.\n  The Senator from Missouri thinks this is holy ground, that we should \nnot touch that money: My goodness, these people were brave enough and \ncreative enough and entrepreneurial enough to raise gasoline prices, \nand we ought to accept that as the reality of capitalism.\n  But the Tax Code says even if you are profitable you pay taxes. My \nposition is that if you have these windfall profits at the expense of \nour economy and families and businesses you should face a windfall \nprofits tax. The money should come back to consumers. The money should \ncome back to fund the LIHEAP program. The money should come back to \ncreate an incentive for automobile manufacturers to make fuel-efficient \ncars. I don't think that is an unreasonable position to take.\n  If the oil companies know that every dollar they make in profits by \nraising the price of gasoline at the pump is subject to a 50-percent \ntax, maybe they will slow down a little bit. Maybe they will not raise \nthe prices as high next time. Wouldn't that be nice if there was some \ndisincentive for these prices being skyrocketed and kited on the \naverage family and business? I don't think it is unreasonable. When we \nconsider the alternatives we are facing in this town right now, it \nmakes a lot of sense.\n  We have arguments being made now that to pay for Hurricane Katrina we \nhave to cut basic programs in this country for the most vulnerable \nAmericans. The idea of cutting food stamps and health care for the \npoorest people in our country in order to pay for the victims of \nHurricane Katrina strikes me as unfair to the nth degree. Why in the \nworld would we help the poor people of Katrina by hurting other poor \npeople in America and look the other way when it comes to the profits \nof oil companies?\n  For goodness' sake, a windfall profit tax I have proposed could \ngenerate about $40 billion. That is a big chunk of the $60 billion we \nhave heard appropriated for Hurricane Katrina.\n  Is it unreasonable that these oil companies would help to pay for the \ngreatest natural disaster in modern memory? At least something good \nwould come of it, and we would not be cutting the programs and the \nbasic policies that help the most vulnerable people in America.\n  I didn't mean to try to get the last word in. I wanted to give the \nSenator from Missouri that opportunity, but because he is chairman of \nthe subcommittee it means he will ultimately have the last word on this \nbill and anything else that comes before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11468-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11468-S11472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               AVIAN FLU\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is another issue which is timely, \none that is growing in interest and intensity across America; that is, \nthe challenge of avian flu. Public health officials have been worrying \nabout this for the last several years. But an avian flu epidemic is not \nyesterday's news. Sadly, it\n\n[[Page S11469]]\n\nmay be tomorrow's news. It is our duty to prepare for it today.\n  Poultry have been susceptible to various strains of avian flu for a \nlong time. Public health officials started to get worried when avian \nflu was noted in Indonesia, Romania, and other countries as well. This \nform of flu may be transferrable to humans. That is what is being \nmonitored very carefully.\n  Unfortunately, humans do not have a natural resistance to this form \nof the flu. Remember that in previous flu epidemics they usually warned \nthat the people who needed flu shots would be children, the elderly, \nand people in a compromised health situation. They are the most \nvulnerable for most ordinary flu strains.\n  In this particular case, everyone is vulnerable. None of us have a \nbuilt-in resistance. It is unlike a typical flu that makes you feel bad \nfor a few days and then you are back up and going strong. This, sadly, \nattacks fast and hard and kills. Over half of the people who have been \ndiagnosed with avian flu around the world perished because of that \nexposure.\n  Last week we learned the virus is not just in Asia, but it has been \nfound in Turkey and Romania. Romanian officials reacted quickly and \nbelieve they have done what needs to be done to eradicate the spread of \nflu in their area.\n  But Romania's Danube Delta is one of Europe's largest bird reserves. \nHundreds of thousands of migratory birds are expected to arrive in the \ncoming days. It is possible, maybe likely, that some of these birds \nwill be carriers of avian flu.\n  If this H5N1 flu mutates into a form that transmits easily from \nperson to person, we have been told to expect the worldwide pandemic \nthat could kill tens of millions of people.\n  Dr. Andrew Pavia of the Infectious Disease Society of America said:\n\n       We may sound like we are hyperventilating, but in our heart \n     of hearts we know this is a serious possibility.\n\n  That is why we added $3.9 billion to the Defense appropriations bill. \nIf we are going to prepare for a pandemic of avian flu, we cannot wait. \nWe have to start now.\n  That is why I join my colleague from Illinois, Senator Barack Obama, \nas well as Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, and many others in introducing \nthe Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act, which lays out the \nnecessary steps to prepare this country for the flu. It would take \nimmediate steps to improve surveillance of this infectious disease so \nwe can track it around the world and begin to contain it immediately.\n  Second, it expands current research and development at the National \nInstitutes of Health to exhaust the possibilities for developing \neffective vaccines and antiviral drugs.\n  Third, it creates a Director of Pandemic Preparedness in the \nExecutive Office of the President. The Director will oversee the \nresponse of States and all involved Federal agencies so that we \ncoordinate what we do, that we are organized, and we set out to save as \nmany lives as possible. We do not want the response of Hurricane \nKatrina to be repeated if we face this avian influenza.\n  Avian influence is not a new thing, but it is not yesterday's news. \nAn avian flu that develops into a pandemic flu is virtually certain to \nbe tomorrow's news. Let's enact the pandemic preparedness legislation \nand move immediately, today, before this Senate goes home, to prepare \nfor this possible.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kennedy amendment is the pending \namendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2063, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2063), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MINIMUM WAGE.\n\n       (a) Increase in the Minimum Wage.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(1) except as otherwise provided in this section, not \n     less than--\n       ``(A) $5.70 an hour, beginning 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2005;\n       ``(B) $6.25 an hour, beginning 12 months after that 60th \n     day; and\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall take effect 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  This is a modification of our amendment which was to raise the \nminimum wage to $7.25. It seemed to me that in an attempt to try to \nfind some common ground with our friends on the other side, we would \nmodify this amendment to reflect what had been the position of the \nRepublican side the last time we had the debate on the increase in the \nminimum wage and that was $1.10.\n  There were other provisions in the Santorum amendment, but the \noverall figure that was included in the alternative amendment to my \nlast amendment was $1.10. That is what this amendment effectively does. \nIt says that in 6 months after enactment, we would have an increase in \nthe minimum wage of 55 cents and then a year after another 55 cents. \nThat would be the way it would be phased in over this period of time.\n  I will not take a great deal of time again on the Senate floor to \nurge the consideration of the increase in the minimum wage. It has been \n9 years. We have increased our own salaries some six times in that 9-\nyear period. We have not increased the minimum wage. We know the total \nnumber of children who have fallen into poverty, the total number of \nfamilies who have fallen into poverty, some 5 million Americans--5 \nmillion Americans have fallen into poverty during the Bush \nAdministration. And we saw at the time of the Katrina tragedy the fact \nthat so many of our fellow citizens have been left out and left behind, \nlost opportunity, and certainly lost income.\n  As I have mentioned many times, the minimum wage applies to men and \nwomen of dignity. These are men and women who work hard, who try to do \na job, try to take care of their children. More often than not, the \nminimum wage worker has two or even three jobs, and rarely has a chance \nto spend much time with their family. They are men and women of \ndignity. They are the men and women who clean the great buildings of \nAmerican commerce. They are helpers to schoolteachers in the school \ndistricts around the country. They work in our nursing homes to look \nafter our senior citizens who have in so many instances sacrificed to \npermit their children to have a better and a happier future. Now \nminimum wage workers are looking after our seniors who have done so \nmuch to make this country the great Nation that it is. So this is about \nmen and women of dignity. That is the most important point. They should \nnot be held back and should not be held down.\n  We have seen that this has very substantial support, as it should. It \nhas support in blue States and in red States. It is reflected in votes \nin Florida and also out West in Nevada in these last elections by a \nvery substantial margin.\n  This is basically a women's issue because 60 percent of those who \nwould benefit from a minimum wage increase are women. More than one-\nthird of those women have children. So it is a children's issue. It is \na family issue. An increase in the minimum wage is a family issue. It \nis a children's issue. It is a women's issue. It is a civil rights \nissue because so many of the men and women who receive the minimum wage \nare men and women of color.\n  Most of all, it is a fairness issue. If there is one thing the \nAmerican people understand it is fairness. The American people believe \nthat anyone who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, should not \nhave to live in poverty. This very small step is to try to address the \nneeds and the well-being of these families. That is what this debate is \nreally all about.\n  As I have pointed out at other times, this has been bipartisan. I was \nhere when President Ford supported an increase in the minimum wage. I \nwas\n\n[[Page S11470]]\n\nhere when President Bush 1 supported an increase in the minimum wage. I \nhave been here when we have had bipartisan support for this effort. \nThis is an attempt now to basically move, as our amendment did, from \n$5.15 to $7.25, increase it 70 cents a year over a 3-year period to \neffectively cut that in half, to try to reach out to those on the other \nside. Hopefully we can accept this downpayment and let me give the \nassurance that it is just a downpayment and move forward.\n  At the appropriate time, we will have a chance to go through some of \nthe reasons for the increase. I will mention just a few now. I know \nsome of our colleagues desire to speak at 5:15, and when they arrive I \nwill yield the floor.\n  I will just review what has happened since 2001: the increased cost \nof gasoline; health insurance; housing up 44 percent; increase in \ncollege tuition. Basically, the increases are making it prohibitive for \nfamilies to be able to own cars or be able to afford health insurance. \nHousing has become prohibitive, and college tuition is out of sight.\n  This is what has happened over the period of recent years, that more \nthan 41 million Americans--that is 30 percent of our workforce--work \nmore than 40 hours a week. Nearly 1 in 5 workers work more than 50 \nhours a week. Is that not extraordinary? When one looks at the fact of \nthe work habits of the American workforce, 30 percent work more than 40 \nhours and 1 in 5 more than 50 hours. More than 7 million Americans are \nworking 2 or more jobs, and 259,000 of them hold 2 full-time jobs. So \nAmericans are working longer and they are working harder than any other \nindustrial nation in the world.\n  Productivity has increased dramatically over the period of these last \nyears--from 1965 up to the present time, a 115-percent increase in \nproductivity. So we have workers working longer and harder. We have \nseen an explosion in productivity, but it is not reflected in any \nincrease in the minimum wage. That is troublesome. It should be.\n  We have actually seen the purchasing power of the minimum wage \ndecrease by some 31 percent. To give our colleagues some idea of what \nhas happened to the minimum wage, we see the purchasing power of the \nminimum wage over the period of recent years. These are in real \ndollars, in 2004 dollars. It would have been close to $9 in 1965. Look \nhow this has gradually declined to $5.15. We had proposed up to $7.25. \nNow it will just increase $1.10, so it will go to $6.25. This is what \nthe issue is about, and we will have an opportunity to address it.\n  We have been interested in getting a vote. We understand it is \ngermane to the legislation. We only needed 50 votes to be able to pass \nthis. We have had that in previous votes, but we have been unable to \nget the consideration for it. In an attempt to move this debate on the \nminimum wage forward, we have made this very significant--and it is \nvery significant--adjustment and change in this proposal. Hopefully \nthis will result in the willingness to accept it and the beginning of \nthe process to make sure many families will be treated more fairly and \nequitably in the future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Salazar and Mr. Burr are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, here it is quarter to 6 on the day after \nthis bill has come to the floor. We have had two votes on technical \namendments. We have another technical amendment we can offer. But my \ncolleagues have filed about 40 amendments. While there are discussions \ngoing on over two different minimum wage amendments, we have set those \naside in order for us to go back to work on other amendments relating \nto this bill. I ask on behalf of leadership on this side and my partner \nthat Members who have amendments which they have filed to please come \nforward and offer those they wish to offer, or talk with us about ones \nthat might be acceptable.\n  The leader said we are going to be here this week until we finish \nthis bill. It is my hope, with the tremendous workload we have to \naccomplish, if we are to get out of here prior to Thanksgiving, that we \nmove forward on this bill. We will be ready for business tomorrow \nmorning. If Members do not come forward, my colleague and I will \nconsider asking the bill go to third reading.\n  We still have time to deal with another amendment tonight if anyone \nwishes to come in and bring it before us. Otherwise, I would ask all \nour colleagues who want to pursue amendments which they have filed to \ncome forward and do so tomorrow.\n  It is possible, if they will do so in an orderly manner and tell us \nwhich ones they do not wish to pursue, we could finish this tomorrow \nnight and be ready to move on to the many other challenging pieces of \nlegislation and appropriations measures we have to deal with.\n  This is an urgent request to Members on both sides who have \namendments filed to come forward--staff met with us on those \namendments--and let us know which ones they wish to pursue.\n  We are operating on a continuing resolution for all of the important \nagencies covered by this bill. Many of these agencies truly need the \nnew appropriations for fiscal year 2006 in which we are operating. Some \nof the provisions we have in this bill will significantly improve the \noperation of the Federal Government.\n  It is going to be a very difficult bill to conference because of the \ndifferent parts of it. It is going to take us several weeks to complete \nthe conference on the bill. We cannot go to conference until this bill \nis passed. With any amendments that are agreed to after this, we still \nbelieve this is important for the functioning of the Federal Government \nand the service it provides.\n  There is much talk about Amtrak and what we need to do on Amtrak. Let \nus be clear: There are some Amtrak reforms in this bill. They do not go \nas far as we would hope to see in Amtrak legislation which is coming \nout of the Commerce Committee. It should be debated on this floor. But \nit will provide $1.45 billion for the operation of Amtrak and begin to \nreform some of the significant problems we see in Amtrak. For those who \nare interested in improving the operation of the passenger rail \nservice, I hope you will join with us in moving forward to completion \nof this bill so we can get the Amtrak funding done and those reforms \nwhich are included in this bill. The system will work better if this \nmeasure is passed.\n  Similarly, for the Treasury Department, we are funding vitally needed \nresources to stop illicit financing of the terror trade. The Treasury \nhas an important responsibility to do that. That is in our national \ninterest.\n  We have additional funds available to make sure that the taxes \nalready on the books and owed are collected.\n  Obviously, for housing, there are many important things for taking \ncare of the needs of those who need assisted housing.\n  The Judiciary has important measures in it as do the other related \nagencies.\n  It is time we move forward on this bill. We reported it out of \ncommittee in July. It is now here on the floor and ready to go. We \nearnestly ask that our colleagues join us and offer amendments, debate \nthem, if necessary, and we will vote on them so we can move this bill \nto conference and get on with the business of the Federal Government.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S11471]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2109\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2109.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide the Judicial Branch with certain procurement \n                              authorities)\n\n       Insert the following on page 356, after line 4, and \n     renumber accordingly:\n       ``Sec. 408. (a) Section 604 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding section (4) at the end of section \n     ``(g)'':\n       ``(4) The Director is hereby authorized:\n       (A) to enter into contracts for the acquisition of \n     severable services for a period that begins in one fiscal \n     year and ends in the next fiscal year to the same extent as \n     the head of an executive agency under the authority of \n     section 253l of 41 U.S.C.; and\n       (B) to enter into contracts for multiple years for the \n     acquisition of property and services to the same extent as \n     executive agencies under the authority of section 254c of 41 \n     U.S.C.; and\n       (C) to make advance, partial, progress or other payments \n     under contracts for property or services to the same extent \n     as executive agencies under the authority of section 255 of \n     41 U.S.C.''\n       (b) Section 612 of title 28, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking the current language in section (e)(2)(B) and \n     inserting ``such contract is in accordance with the \n     Director's authority in section 604(g) of 28 U.S.C.; and,''\n       (c) The authorities granted in this Section shall expire on \n     September 30, 2010.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is an amendment to reform the \njudiciary's ability to procure things. It is a procurement authority. \nThe amendment actually establishes greater parity for the judicial \nbranch by giving it the same procurement authorities that were given to \nthe executive branch through acquisition reform legislation in the \n1990s. We found this saved money. It gives the taxpayers a better bang \nfor their buck. They can procure over several years.\n  Currently, the judiciary's procurement authority is limited when \ncompared to the executive branch. This limitation increases the cost of \ndoing business. Specifically, these limitations are on multiyear \ncontracting, severable services contracts, and the timing of contract \npayments and, thus, prevent the judicial branch from taking advantage \nof the best prices offered for some goods and services. As an example, \na typical information technology contract will extend for several \nyears. It is far more efficient for the executive branch and it is more \nefficient for the judicial branch to be able to make these contracts \nover several years.\n  Simply put, this amendment gives the judicial branch authority it \nshould already possess, and I believe makes good business sense for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this amendment would extend to the \njudicial branch certain procurement authorities that are parallel with \nthe authorities that have already been granted to the executive branch \nand would allow the judiciary to achieve certain cost efficiencies that \nI think we all want.\n  This amendment has been cleared by the Judiciary Committee with the \nsunset provision that limits the authority to 5 years.\n  I encourage an aye vote from all of our colleagues.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2109) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleague.\n  We are still open for business--maybe not for much longer--but I hope \nall Senators will take the fact that we intend to either vote on \namendments tomorrow or have third reading. It doesn't make any \ndifference to us one way or the other. We want to finish this bill.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few \nwords while we are contemplating the Transportation appropriations \nbill. A special thanks to our ranking Democrat and chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee for the work that their staff and others on \nthe subcommittee have done.\n  One of my primary issues of interest is energy independence. This is \nan issue that, in this Nation today, we all have to be interested in. \nToday, roughly 60 percent of the oil we will use to drive our cars, \ntrucks, and vans will be from foreign sources. A lot of the oil is \ncontrolled by people who, frankly, are not that friendly to us and some \nof whom, I am convinced, would do us ill if they had the opportunity.\n  Meanwhile, as we pump more and more money out of our economy into the \nhands of folks in other countries, who may or may not wish us well, we \nneed to pause and reflect on the wisdom of that.\n  One of the elements in this Transportation appropriations bill is \nmoney to continue to fund passenger rail service in this country. I \nwill talk for a moment about whether that is an energy-efficient \napproach to part of our transportation challenge.\n  We are gathered in Washington, DC. Believe it or not, we can move one \nton of freight by rail from Washington, DC, where we are located, up to \nBoston, MA, using one gallon of diesel fuel by train. Think of that. We \ncan move one ton of freight by rail from Washington, DC, to Boston, MA, \nby simply using one gallon of diesel fuel.\n  In a day and age when almost 60 percent of the oil we use is from \nforeign sources, to be able to have that efficiency using rail--whether \nfor freight or, in many cases, by passenger--we are wise to more fully \nutilize that transportation mode.\n  Today we were having a hearing in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, where I serve, as does Senator Bond. We were having a \nhearing on the question of whether or not we should make it easier for \nfolks to locate a refinery, to build a refinery on military bases that \nhave been made available through the BRAC process.\n  While we go forward and explore that option, I suggested to my \ncolleagues and to those who were witnesses before the committee today \nthat we might be wise, as we again try to reduce our reliance on \nforeign oil, to take a look to the south of our country, down to \nBrazil, to see what they are doing to reduce their reliance on foreign \noil. In Brazil, they have learned how to meet, in an increasing way, \ntheir need to drive their cars, trucks, and vans not by importing oil, \nnot by pumping oil but by growing sugarcane, soybeans, in some cases \ncorn, grass, different kinds of grass, and being able to transform \nthose crops into fuel for their cars, trucks, and vans. I understand \nnow over a quarter of the fuel needs of Brazilians, as they are driving \naround their country today and tonight, are met by the crops they grow.\n  I am proud to say, in Delaware, during the time I was privileged to \nbe their Governor, we decided to try an experiment with our DelDOT \nvehicles. The experiment was one where we said, Why don't we use a \ncombination of soybean oil--we raise a lot of soybeans in Delaware--use \nsome of our soybean oil and mix it with diesel fuel and see if it works \nin powering our DelDOT vehicles. It worked fine and it ran well.\n  Actually, there were environmental consequences: The air pollution \nconsequences were better with the mixture of soybean oil and diesel \nfuel, and we reduced our reliance on oil to some extent.\n  That experiment has given way to a broader experiment in our State, \nwhere we use a combination of soybean oil and diesel fuel to power an \never broader number of vehicles that are diesel powered, including farm \nequipment and I believe now some schoolbuses and other larger trucks.\n\n[[Page S11472]]\n\n  We are building a refinery in Delaware today. It is not a traditional \nkind of refinery. We have a big oil refinery along the Delaware River \nin a town called Delaware City. This is a refinery where we are going \nto bring soybeans to the refinery and create, again, a blend of soybean \noil and diesel fuel to help power those DelDOT vehicles and other \nvehicles normally diesel powered.\n  In the next year or so, new EPA requirements for cleaner, leaner, \nlow-burning emission diesel engines will be phased in, Tier II \nrequirements. As we face those requirements, we will find that diesel-\npowered vehicles, which used to belch black smoke pulling away from \nintersections and traffic lights, leaving a huge black plume of \nparticulate and pollutants--those days are, at least with respect to \nnew vehicles on the road, those days will be gone for the most part \nnext year. We will see more diesel-powered vehicles which, in many \ncases in the future, will be clean burning, as lean burning, as low \nemission as our internal gas-powered engines that can take advantage of \nthe refinery we are building north of Dover, DE, and other folks that \nare building similar biodiesel refineries in their own States.\n  We did a couple smart things in the Energy bill that we enacted early \nthis year. They also relate to enhancing our ability to reduce our \nreliance on foreign oil. We have expanded the tax credit for people who \nbuy hybrid-powered vehicles, a combination of internal combustion \nengine with the electric motor.\n  Under current law, the tax credit for people buying hybrids is about \n$1,000, a flat $1,000. I don't believe it is bigger if you have a \nvehicle that gets 60 miles per gallon as opposed to one that gets 30. \nThe tax credit for hybrid-powered vehicles will change on January 1. \nBeginning that day, people who buy a hybrid-powered vehicle, ones that \nare highly energy efficient, get a tax credit worth up to as much as \n$3,400. For hybrid engine vehicles that are less energy efficient, the \ntax credit goes down.\n  Similarly, we are going to begin to offer, on January 1 of next year, \na tax credit--again, a variable tax credit--for folks who buy lean-\nburning, clean-burn, low-emission, highly fuel-efficient diesel-fueled \nvehicles.\n  The head of Daimler Chrysler in North America, Juergen Schrempp, will \nhead up Daimler Chrysler around the world and was here hosting a \nreception off of Capitol Hill and brought with him folks from Daimler \nChrysler. Vehicles were, in some cases, internal combustion engines and \nother cases diesel powered. He brought with him a concept passenger \ncar. They have not built it yet but they are hoping. My hope is that \nthey will. The vehicle gets 60 miles per gallon in the city and 80 \nmiles per gallon on the highway. The combination overall is about 70 \nmiles per gallon. The vehicle will meet Tier II diesel requirements for \nlower emissions, as well.\n  We have seen our friends from GM and Daimler Chrysler create a \npartnership early this year for developing the next generation of \nhybrid-powered vehicles.\n  My hope is that one of the concepts they will come up with, one of \nthe engines and power systems they will come up with, is something that \nmarries together this notion of a low-emissions, highly energy \nefficient diesel-powered engine with an electric engine. It will be a \ndiesel hybrid. GM has already introduced that kind of technology quite \nsuccessfully with respect to buses. We have thousands of buses that are \nnow roaming the streets of America that are diesel powered but also \nhave a hybrid counterpart, too, to provide better efficiency and lower \nemissions.\n  I think it would be terrific for consumers and those of us who are \ninterested in cleaner air and for those of us who are interested in \nreducing our reliance on foreign oil to take that same concept of a \ndiesel engine with an electric hybrid motor--putting them together--and \nbeing able to introduce that kind of propulsion system in our cars, \ntrucks, and vans, as we have--at least by GM--in larger vehicles.\n  Nobody in this country should be comfortable with the state we find \nourselves in today, with this huge and growing reliance on foreign oil. \nWe can do better. On behalf of all of us in this country, and \nespecially our kids, the folks to whom we are leaving our trade deficit \nand our budget deficit, we have to do better than this.\n  About a quarter of our trade deficit is attributable to the cost of \noil, the importation of oil. We cannot continue on a course, in my \nview, that has $300 billion or $400 billion budget deficits and $600 \nbillion or $700 billion trade deficits. That is not sustainable. One of \nthe ways we can at least take a big bite out of that trade deficit is \nto move toward energy independence, maybe by the year 2020--it would be \ngreat if we could do it sooner; that may not be realistic--but at least \nby 2020.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back my time and thank the Chair.\n\n\n                            notice of intent\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I submit the following notice in writing: \nIn accordance with rule V of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby \ngive notice in writing that it is my intention to move to suspend \nparagraph 4 of rule XVI for the purpose of proposing to the bill H.R. \n3058 amendment No. 2078.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak regarding the \nrepeal of expanded Federal Government micro-purchase limits, as well as \nto speak regarding recent regulatory action taken by the Office of \nManagement and Budget on this matter.\n  We are all deeply concerned with the recent events surrounding \nHurricane Katrina and the massive rebuilding and reconstruction efforts \nongoing in the gulf coast.\n  While we all agree that help is needed, many have argued how best to \nprovide this help. The second supplemental emergency appropriation for \nHurricane Katrina included a number of provisions to help provide for \nrebuilding and reconstruction--including nearly $61 billion.\n  This money will help rebuild the gulf coast, yet there were some \nprovisions in that second supplemental that leave the rebuilding effort \nvulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer dollars.\n  One such provision was the repeal of the limitations on micropurchase \nspending authority. Micropurchases represent delegated buying authority \nfor Federal agencies and were designed to save money by providing \nflexible spending. Micropurchases are usually small--averaging $600--\nand are most often made through Government credit cards.\n  By law these Government credit card micropurchases were originally \ncapped at $2,500 per purchase. This limit was raised following 9/11 for \nemergency purposes only, to $15,000 domestically and $25,000 abroad.\n  The second Hurricane Katrina supplemental raised this emergency rate \nfrom $15,000 to $250,000, per purchase. This change represents a nearly \n1600 percent increase. Imagine a Government bureaucrat being able to \nwalk into a store, purchase an item for $250,000 without prior \napproval, and say, ``Put it on the taxpayer's tab.''\n  History has proven that these Government credit cards are prone to \nfraud, waste and abuse of taxpayer funds. I began looking into this \nissue several years ago. Working with the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, and the various inspectors general over the years, I have \nuncovered hundreds of millions of dollars lost to fraud, waste, and \nabuse due to inadequate controls on Government credit cards.\n  This history of abuse prompted my immediate attention and \nintervention\n\n[[Page S11473]]\n\nwith OMB regarding the increased threshold. Through negotiations during \nthe critical early hours following the passage of the micropurchase \nincrease, OMB agreed to issue guidance which provided a temporary limit \non who could utilize the new limits. This guidance helped to prevent \nundocumented spending and potential abuse; however, it only served as a \ntemporary stop-gap measure.\n  On September 15, I introduced legislation on this topic. The bill \nintroduced, S. 1716--the Emergency Health Care Relief Act of 2005--\ncontained a provision that would roll back the increased micropurchase \nthresholds to a responsible level while maintaining flexibility for \nthose providing relief in the impacted Gulf States. I included this \nprovision in the bill I introduced because of my experience in fighting \nfraud, waste, and abuse that has occurred as a result of Government \ncredit cards.\n  Unfortunately, S. 1716 has been held up in this body for too long, \npreventing legislation from fixing this potential giveaway and delaying \nhealth care to those most desperately in need.\n  I was pleased to hear that Senators Dorgan and Wyden have voiced \ntheir concerns by recently introducing legislation on this matter. I am \nalso pleased that legislation which was introduced by Senators Collins \nand Lieberman on this matter was recently reported out of Committee in \na favorable voice vote. Both of these bills represent what I believe is \nthe sense of Congress, that this increased limit must be reduced \nstatutorily.\n  On October 3, OMB revised its guidance for micropurchases, reducing \nthe increased limits from $250,000 to $2,500, the same correction \nsought in the different legislation introduced by Senators Collins and \nLieberman and the subsequent legislation by Senators Dorgan and Wyden. \nI applaud OMB for stepping forward and taking corrective action; \nhowever, I remain concerned that this limit could be changed by OMB at \nany time as the increased limit still remains in the law.\n  Fortunately, OMB has listened to my recommendations and recognized \nthe need to rescind this provision and is now supporting efforts to \nprovide a legislative fix. I have learned from OMB that all agencies \nwithin the Government have agreed that the higher limit is unnecessary \nand also support reducing the increased limit.\n  The micropurchase threshold increase needs to be repealed permanently \nby Congress and not merely corrected through regulatory guidance. As \nthis body continues to hold up action on S. 1716, the best option for \nquick and decisive action to reduce this increased credit limit is to \nsupport the legislation introduced by Senators Collins and Lieberman \nwhich was recently voted out by the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs.\n  S. 1716 remains an important piece of legislation providing health \ncare for those who have been affected by the tragedy in the Gulf \nStates. By no means should my support of this legislation be seen as \nreducing the need to pass S. 1716 however; it just makes sense for this \nbody to move quickly in closing this potential loophole for fraud, \nwaste, and abuse.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting quick passage of \nboth S. 1716 and the legislation offered by Senators Collins and \nLieberman, to help prevent relief dollars from being lost to fraud, \nwaste, and abuse and provide the much needed health care to the region \ndevastated by Hurricane Katrina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11473-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \ncommemorate Hispanic Heritage Month. I was proud to support, along with \nmy Senate colleagues, a resolution recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month \nand celebrating the vast contributions that Hispanic Americans have \nmade to the strength and culture of our Nation.\n  I would like to take a moment now to honor the contributions of the \nLatino community in the great State of New Jersey. New Jersey's 1.3 \nmillion Hispanic Americans are an integral and vital part of our State, \ncontributing to every aspect of life, from business to culture. \nHispanic or Latino Americans represent nearly 15 percent of the \npopulation of my State. They are the largest and fastest-growing \nminority group in the Nation and in New Jersey.\n  As the son of immigrants who came to this country for the \nopportunities it offers, I am proud of the way our Latino neighbors \nhave worked to make a better life for themselves and for their \nchildren.\n  New Jersey is home to more than 50,000 Latino-owned businesses, \nranging from big corporations like Goya Foods, which is based in \nSecaucus, to small mom-and-pop bodegas. Through their energy and \ntalent, these Hispanic businesses in New Jersey generate more than $9 \nbillion in economic activity and support 167,000 jobs.\n  Latinos contribute to our economy, to our culture, and also to our \npublic life. Hispanic Americans serve our Nation and the State of New \nJersey at all levels of government--as mayors and municipal council \nmembers, county freeholders, and in countless elected and appointed \ncapacities throughout the State.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On April 27, 1998, Stephen Goedereis, was killed by two teens near \nhis home in Miami, FL. Goedereis was walking down the street, when he \ncomplimented one of the two teens. The teens then beat Goedereis, who \nsubsequently died 2 days later in the local hospital. The teens were \nconvicted of second degree murder and robbery, both of which were \nclassified as hate crimes. I believe that the Government's first duty \nis to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come \nout of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that \ncan become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and \nchanging current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11473-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11473-S11474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LIBERIA'S ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I commend the Liberian people on their \nrecent Presidential and parliamentary elections. News reports of people \ncamping outside polling areas to vote, strong voter turnout, and a free \nand fair democratic process in Liberia are inspiring. Following a 14-\nyear-long civil war and the regime of former Liberian leader Charles \nTaylor, who fled in exile in August 2003, the war-tired people of \nLiberia deserve our support as they work to bring about a legitimate, \nrepresentative government in that country.\n  However, Liberia's elections are not the silver bullet for stability. \nThere remains much work to be done to build long-term stability in this \ncountry, and the U.S. has a meaningful role to play. We must remain \nengaged in Liberia to help rebuild and strengthen institutions. The \nlegitimacy of government is contingent upon the public's confidence, \nand lasting stability depends on such steps as rooting out corruption \nand providing transparency in government. The Liberian people deserve \nour unflagging support in those endeavors. Too much is at stake to turn \nour back and allow Liberia to regress into a state that houses a \ncorrupt and abusive government and further destabilizes West Africa.\n  In looking forward, Liberians must also reconcile with the past. \nYears of horrible violence and conflict and the drastic decline of \nhumanitarian conditions in the country under the regime of Charles \nTaylor need resolution. We also know now that Charles Taylor's\n\n[[Page S11474]]\n\ndesire for power and wealth extended beyond the borders of Liberia. I \nfirmly believe that Charles Taylor is a war criminal, and I maintain \nthat he should stand trial before the Special Court for Sierra Leone. \nThe U.S. and the international community have a responsibility to \nensure that the circle of violence and impunity in Liberia does not \ncontinue in its nascent government. And we must continue to help the \nLiberian people combat corruption, because no new leadership can bring \nlasting change if that fundamental problem is not addressed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11474-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO JUDGE TOMMY JEWELL\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a man \nof hope and deep conviction who has displayed a tireless commitment to \nimproving the lives of New Mexicans. After serving the State of New \nMexico for 22 years, Judge Tommy Jewell stepped down from the bench on \nSeptember 30, 2005. With his resignation, New Mexico lost one of its \nfinest, most compassionate public servants.\n  Judge Jewell began his career by breaking down barriers. In 1983, he \nbecame the first African American ever appointed to the New Mexico \nbench. In 1991, after serving for 8 years in Metropolitan Court as \nChief Judge, Judge Jewell was appointed to Children's Court in New \nMexico's Second Judicial District. Judge Jewell approached each case \nand each child who came before him with the same underlying philosophy: \nno one is beyond the reach of hope and everyone is capable of turning \nhis or her life around and moving it in the right direction.\n  In dealing with juvenile offenders in the Children's Court, Judge \nJewell emphasized the need for these young people to take \nresponsibility for their actions. However, he also conveyed his strong \nbelief that, by acknowledging their mistakes and owning up to the \nconsequences, the troubled teens with whom he dealt could find power \nwithin themselves to change their life for the better. While striving \nto keep a firm hand and not let serious offenses go unmet by serious \nconsequences, Judge Jewell believed that there was a degree of goodness \nin every person who stood before him. Moreover, he was unrelenting in \nhis contention that children would learn more about themselves and how \nto contribute positively to society by working in recovery programs \nthan they ever could while sitting on a bench behind jail bars.\n  Well liked and respected by his colleagues, Judge Jewell was honored \nfor Outstanding Judicial Service by the State Bar of New Mexico in 1997 \nand, in 2001, was named Outstanding Judge by the Albuquerque Bar \nAssociation.\n  Judge Jewell's work in the legal field prior to becoming a judge \nhelped him develop skills that contributed to his success while serving \non the bench. He was a partner in the successful law firm of Jewell, \nKelly, and Kitson. After graduating from the University of New Mexico \nSchool of Law in 1979, Judge Jewell went to work as a staff attorney \nwith the Legal Aid Society, which provides essential legal services to \nthe poor.\n  In addition to his success as a dedicated public servant, Tommy \nJewell is also a man of many interests and talents. Judge Jewell is an \navid musician and drummer in a band. As an undergraduate, he was a \nmember of the New Mexico State University football team. Judge Jewell \nis also a dedicated family man. He and his wife Judge Angela Jewell, \nalso a longtime public servant, have two children, Thomas and Taja.\n  During his career as a public servant, Judge Jewell has broken racial \nbarriers and empowered many young New Mexicans by helping them believe \nin themselves. With his resignation, New Mexico loses one of its most \ncommitted and effective judges, but there is no doubt in my mind that \nJudge Tommy Jewell will continue to serve his State with great passion \nand success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11474-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO IOWA'S 2005 ``PRIME TIME AWARDS'' WINNERS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Experience Works is a national \nnonprofit organization dedicated to helping seniors get the training \nand assistance they need to find good jobs in their communities. Each \nyear, Experience Works uses its Prime Time Awards program to recognize \nexemplary older workers. This year, two Iowans have been honored. \nDwight Hauff of Sioux City, who is 100 years old, has been selected for \na national award as America's Oldest Worker. And Milt Roth of Waterloo, \nwho is 87, has been selected as Iowa's Outstanding Older Worker.\n  Mr. Hauff is the owner of a chain of sporting goods stores that \nincludes Hauff Mid-America Sports, Dakota Sports, Inc., and the Iowa \nSports Supply Company. He opened his first sporting goods store in \nSioux City in 1933 at the height of the Great Depression. For 73 years, \nMr. Hauff has supplied schools, athletic leagues, and businesses with \nquality sports equipment and apparel. In the 1960s, Dwight served as \npresident of the National Sporting Goods Association. He is a past \npresident of the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic \nEquipment, and is a current member of the Iowa High School Girls and \nBoys Athletic Association. At age 100, Mr. Hauff is still going strong. \nHe spends 6 days a week at his sporting goods store in downtown Sioux \nCity, where he is a much respected and beloved member of the community.\n  Mr. Roth is the owner and operator of Roth Jewelers, which his father \nfounded in 1931, and which is now the second oldest retail business in \ndowntown Waterloo. During the Second World War, Mr. Roth served in the \nU.S. Army and was initially assigned to the Armored Cavalry Unit at \nFort Riley, KS. He attended Officers Candidate School, was commissioned \nas a lieutenant, and served with an ordnance unit in the European \nTheater. After the war he returned to Waterloo, and took over ownership \nof Roth Jewelers from his father. These days, well into his ninth \ndecade, Mr. Roth still regularly puts in 40 or more hours a week at his \nstore. He remains very much engaged in his community, where he has \nserved on the Allen Memorial Hospital Board of Directors, and has been \nan active member of the Waterloo Chamber of Commerce and the Kiwanis \nClub. He has been a generous supporter of scholarships, local colleges, \nand the performing arts.\n  Someone once said that we make a living by what we get, but we make a \nlife by what we give. Dwight Hauff and Milt Roth have been blessed with \nwork that they love, and, in return, they have given so much to their \ncommunities. I congratulate them on their richly deserved honors from \nExperience Works. And I wish them many more years of continued \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11474-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLIE YATES\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S11474, October 18, 2005, the following title appeared: \nHONORING THE LIKE OF CHARLIE YATES\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: HONORING THE LIFE \nOF CHARLIE YATES\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Yesterday, the city of Atlanta, the State of \nGeorgia and the game of golf lost a legend and a friend, Charlie Yates.\n  Charlie Yates won the national college golf championship in 1934, and \nwas a Walker Cup competitor twice. In 1938 Charlie Yates won the \nBritish Amateur Championship at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n  Charlie Yates was a close friend of the late Bobby Jones, and a \nconstant playing partner with Jones at their beloved East Lake Golf \nClub. Yates played in eleven Masters tournaments, and was a member of \nthe Augusta National Golf Club.\n  Charlie Yates's contributions were not limited to the game of golf. \nHe served as president of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra from 1962 to \n1965, and then chaired the Atlanta Arts Alliance which became the \nWoodruff Arts Center, one of America's great centers for the Arts.\n  Under Yates's leadership the Woodruff Arts Center's overall budget \nrose from $3.8 million in 1973 to $163 million in 1983, and he led the \neffort that raised $5.4 million for the center's endowment.\n  Charlie Yates touched the lives of many Georgians, including this \nSenator, through his efforts on behalf of our community and through his \nwonderful family. I am honored to pay tribute to a great American, \nCharlie Yates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11474-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11474-S11475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      2005 SOLAR DECATHLON WINNER\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and \npride that I commend the University of Colorado\n\n[[Page S11475]]\n\nSolar Team on taking overall honors in the 2005 Solar Decathlon on the \nNational Mall in Washington, DC. With their strong work ethic, vision, \ncreativity and commitment to energy conservation and efficiency, the CU \nSolar Team has successfully designed, engineered and constructed a \nnational model for an attractive, energy-efficient solar-powered home, \nwhile outshining esteemed competitors from such prestigious \ninstitutions as Cornell University and the California Polytechnic State \nUniversity.\n  The 2005 Solar Decathlon was an international competition between 18 \ncompeting collegiate teams, sponsored by the Department of Energy's \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL, in Golden, CO. \nParticipants came from all over the United States, and as far away as \nPuerto Rico, Canada and Spain. Teams competed in 10 areas, including \narchitecture, livability and comfort, as well as how well the homes \nprovide energy for space heating and cooling, hot water, lighting and \nappliances. Home designs were also required to produce enough extra \nenergy to power an electric car.\n  The CU Solar Team is a tight-knit group of students and faculty from \nthe colleges of architecture, engineering, and environmental studies. \nCharged with the task of integrating natural materials and innovative \ntechnology into an environmentally conscious, publicly accessible and \nenergy efficient modular home design, architecture students began to \n``think like engineers'' and engineering students were placed in the \nrole of architect. In the end, the team rose to the challenge and \nsuccessfully achieved an exceptional solar design which included \nfeatures such as a rooftop photovoltaic system composed of 32 SunPower \n200-watt solar panels, and made of building materials such as soy, \ncorn, sunflower and canola.\n  At a time when our Nation's energy policy continues to be heavily \ndependent on foreign oil, and when home heating costs are rising to \nunbearable levels, I commend the ambitious work of these students in \nenvisioning, designing and successfully creating a model for energy-\nefficient mobile home design. Their achievement stands as a testament \nto the world-class research and innovation produced at the University \nof Colorado, which is one of the nation's most accomplished research \nuniversities.\n  I also want to briefly pay tribute to NREL. It is no exaggeration to \nsay that NREL holds the key to our Nation's long-term energy security. \nFor nearly 30 years, NREL has been at the forefront of alternative \nenergy research and development, and their sponsorship of research \nprojects like the decathlon helps ensure that our young engineers and \nscientists have opportunities to channel their education, creativity, \nand talent towards solving our Nation's energy challenges.\n  The work done by this team of 14 students at CU Boulder is \nimpressive, important and will help lead the United States to a future \nof greater energy independence and greater security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11475-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DR. C. DeLORES TUCKER\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe passing of a great Pennsylvanian, and great American, Dr. C. \nDeLores Tucker. Throughout her distinguished life, Dr. Tucker \ndemonstrated an incredible amount of courage, selflessness, and \ncompassion, as well as an unquenchable thirst for equality for all \nAmericans. Dr. Tucker lived her life in a manner we should all aspire \nto, and she will be sorely missed.\n  Born in Philadelphia on October 4, 1927, the child of a north \nPhiladelphia pastor, Dr. Tucker was truly a daughter of Pennsylvania. \nShe attended Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania-\nWharton School, and in 1951 married Mr. William Tucker, a successful \nPhiladelphia real estate agent.\n  Dr. Tucker had a significant, renowned history in the civil rights \nmovement. Her involvement included raising funds for the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, participating in the \n1965 march in Selma, AL with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and founding \nthe National Political Congress of Negro Women, now known as the \nNational Congress of Black Women, and the Philadelphia Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Association for Nonviolence, Inc. Her devotion to obtaining \nequal rights for African Americans altered the future of this Nation, \nand history will remember C. DeLores Tucker as a patriot, a \nrevolutionary thinker, and a credit to America.\n  Dr. Tucker, a pioneer so often throughout her life, became the first \nAfrican-American secretary of state for the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania in 1971. In assuming this position, Dr. Tucker also became \nthe first African-American woman secretary of state in America's \nhistory. Dr. Tucker often walked upon the road less traveled, and while \non this path, paved the way towards a better life for those that \nfollowed.\n  Following her time as secretary of state, Dr. Tucker took up an \nintense interest in protecting our children, the future of America. She \nwas founder and president of the Bethune-DuBois Institute, Inc., an \ninstitution with the goal of enhancing the cultural and intellectual \ndevelopment of African-American youth through scholarships and \neducational programs. Dr. Tucker was a firm believer in the \npreservation of values in our culture, and fought hard against the \ninclusion of explicit lyrics in rap and hip-hop music, citing their \ndetrimental effect on the youth of this Nation.\n  Personally, I had the pleasure to work with Dr. Tucker in her \ncapacity as national chair of the National Congress of Black Women, \nInc. Dr. Tucker and the organization she founded established the \nSojourner Truth Crusade, an effort to put the likeness of Sojourner \nTruth on the Suffrage Monument that now stands in the Capitol Rotunda. \nIn working with Dr. Tucker, I was able to see first-hand the \ndedication, the joy, and the passion that she brought to both her work \nand her everyday life.\n  America has lost a great citizen with the passing of C. DeLores \nTucker, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has lost one of its \nbrightest stars. While we will surely miss Dr. Tucker and all that she \nbrought to the lives of each person she touched, there is no question \nthat her legacy will live on for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11475-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GEORGE HALE\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

With a career in sports, \nGeorge provides the listener with the personal stories of triumph that \nmake competition enthralling.\n  Maine can not take all the credit for George Hale. Born in Cleveland, \nOH, George had to decide whether to come to Bangor and work in \ntelevision or accept a desk job in New York City. By my estimation, he \nmade the right decision subsequently establishing himself as one of \nMaine's premier broadcasting personalities.\n  The most famous story about George is the time that he predicted snow \nflurries in the evening weather forecast and the next day Bangor awoke \nto find itself buried in the biggest snowstorm in its history. To this \nday, residents refer to him as ``Flurries Hale''.\n  I extend my most sincere congratulations to Mr. Hale on this \nmilestone accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11475-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 6:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 55.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the Old Mint at San Francisco otherwise known \nas the ``Granite Lady'', and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today to join my colleagues \nSenators Boxer and Ensign to introduce legislation to authorize the \nUnited States Mint to issue a commemorative coin that will honor the \nSan Francisco Old Mint and help restore this historic building in \ndowntown San Francisco.\n  The San Francisco Old Mint Building is an important historical \nlandmark for San Francisco, the State of California, and the United \nStates.\n  Beginning its operations in 1854, the Old Mint Building was \nestablished to take advantage of the plentiful gold and silver mined in \nthe West during the California Gold Rush. At one point, more than half \nof the money minted in the United States came from the San Francisco \nMint, and it once held a third of the Nation's gold supply.\n  The Old Mint Building, located in the heart of the city, has been \nstanding for more than 125 years as the oldest stone building in San \nFrancisco.\n  The Greek-revivalist design of the Old Mint Building was created by \narchitect Alfred B. Mullet, who also designed the U.S. Treasury \nBuilding and the Old Executive Office Building in Washington, DC. The \nSan Francisco Old Mint building is also listed on the National Register \nof Historic Places.\n  Aided by its magnificent stone structure, the Old Mint Building was \nable to survive the terrible San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. \nIn fact, the Mint was the only financial institution that remained \noperable after the earthquake and the building was used as the treasury \nfor the city's disaster relief funds.\n  The San Francisco Old Mint Building minted coins until 1937 when the \nbuilding became too small and its operations moved to a larger space \nelsewhere in San Francisco. In the years since then, the building has \ndeteriorated.\n  In 1994, the Bureau of the Mint closed the Old Mint because it could \nnot afford the then-estimated $20 million seismic retrofit to bring the \nbuilding up to code. Since 2003, the General Services Administration \ntransferred ownership of the building to the City of San Francisco.\n  The San Francisco Museum and Historical Society has proposed an \nexciting project to restore and rejuvenate the Old Mint Building in \ndowntown San Francisco. A fine history museum supported by shops and a \nvisitor's center will combine to make the building a striking and \nviable destination.\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue \n100,000 $5 gold coins and 500,000 $1 silver coins emblematic of the San \nFrancisco Old Mint Building and its importance to California and the \nUnited States.\n  Proceeds generated from the sale of these commemorative coins will be \npaid to the San Francisco Museum and\n\n[[Page S11479]]\n\nHistorical Society for the restoration of the Old Mint Building.\n  The San Francisco Old Mint is venerated by coin collectors, \nCalifornians, and millions of Americans as a national treasure and I \nbelieve it is worthy of a commemorative coin.\n  I believe honoring and restoring the San Francisco Old Mint building \nis an important historic preservation project.\n  Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of the building's survival \nof the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.\n  No other mint has been commemorated and because issuance of these \ncoins would make a vital contribution to preserving this national \ntreasure, the San Francisco Old Mint merits commemoration at this time.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me to support this legislation to help \npreserve and restore this majestic building and honor the important \nrole it played in rebuilding the great ``City by the Bay''.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real \nProperty Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to assist property owners and \nFederal agencies in resolving disputes relating to private property; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President: I rise today to introduce S. 1883, the \nEmpowering More Property Owners with Enhanced Rights Act of 2005, or \nthe EMPOWER Act, a bill that amends the Uniform Relocation Assistance \nand Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (the Uniform Act). \nThe EMPOWER Act will assist property owners and Federal agencies in \nresolving disputes relating to private property outside of the courts. \nI am joined by my colleague Senator Baucus as lead cosponsor of this \nbill.\n  In the wake of the Supreme Court decision Kelo v. New London, \ncitizens around the country are calling members of Congress asking if \ntheir homes, small businesses, and family farms are safe from the power \nof the government. While this legislation doesn't address Kelo \ndirectly, the EMPOWER Act will enhance the rights of private property \nowners, when their property becomes a target of the federal government.\n  The Uniform Act applies to all Federal agencies, and was passed by \nCongress to ``provide for uniform and equitable treatment of persons \ndisplaced from their homes, businesses or farms by Federal and \nfederally assisted programs. . . .'' The Act was amended in 1987 to \ndesignate the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) as the Lead \nAgency, requiring it to coordinate with other Federal agencies to issue \ngovernment-wide standards for eminent domain actions.\n  The EMPOWER Act would super-size the Uniform Act by assigning the DOT \nstronger responsibilities in protecting the rights of property owners. \nIt accomplishes this goal in two significant ways. First, it \nestablishes a Property Owners' Bill of Rights, adding new powers to \nproperty owners. Second, it establishes a Private Property Ombudsperson \nto act as a neutral party to assist property owners, small businesses, \nand family farms when they are subject to Federal or federally assisted \nactions that affect their property.\n  The property owners' ``Bill of Rights'' includes those rights already \nenumerated in the Uniform Act, such as the right to just compensation, \nreplacement housing, and relocation assistance. However, the bill would \nadd several new rights that would significantly enhance the power of \nthe Uniform Act. These are: the right to full\n\n[[Page S11480]]\n\ndisclosure of the government's appraised value of the property in \nquestion; the right to an independent second appraisal; the right to \nparticipate in mediation or, if necessary, arbitration as an \nalternative to costly and time-consuming litigation; the right to be \ninformed about their rights and access to assistance; and the right to \nassistance from a Property Rights Ombudsperson.\n  The Property Rights Ombudsperson established by the EMPOWER Act would \nassist property owners in negotiating the Federal bureaucracy and to \nact as a third-party neutral in resolving disputes. The Ombudsperson \nwould inform the public of their rights and actively work to help \nproperty owners take full advantage of those rights. The Ombudsperson \nwould call for mediated disputes; force arbitration if necessary; work \nwith Federal agencies to advise them about their actions which affect \nprivate property; ensure that agencies inform affected property owners \nof their rights; and provide information to private citizens, citizen \ngroups, and other interested parties regarding rights and \nresponsibilities relating to property rights.\n  The EMPOWER Act is modeled after a highly successful program in Utah, \nwhich has led the Nation in the area of property rights. After 8 years \nin effect in Utah, this program has taken a great deal of the acrimony \nand pain out of the process of eminent domain. It has saved the state \nmillions of dollars in litigation fees and reduced the condemnation \nrate by half. Most important, it has considerably improved government \nto citizen relations. The vast majority of those using this program in \nUtah are homeowners and the program has provided them with considerable \nrelief.\n  The EMPOWER Act adapts the Utah model to the Federal Government. The \nAct does not change the rules of Federal acquisition of private \nproperty, but it does provide significant assistance to private \nproperty owners, small businesses, and family farmers when they are \nfaced with a daunting Federal bureaucracy and the possibility of \nprivate property loss.\n  The EMPOWER Act goes a long way toward protecting our citizens from \noverbearing federal action with regard to private property rights. It \ntakes nothing away from government but does empower citizens, and \nrequires agencies to ensure that property owners are treated fairly. I \nurge my colleagues to support this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mrs. Dole, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \n        Smith, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Levin, Mr. Corzine, and \n        Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1885. A bill to encourage the effective use of community resources \nto combat hunger and the root causes of hunger by creating opportunity \nthrough food recovery and job training; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Food \nEmployment Empowerment and Development Act or FEED Act along with my \ncolleagues Senators Dole and Lincoln. This important, bipartisan \nlegislation will award grants to qualified programs that effectively \ncombat hunger while creating opportunity through food rescue programs \nand job training.\n  This legislation is inspired by some of the great work that food \nrescue programs in my State of New Jersey, such as Table to Table in \nEnglewood Cliffs, Elijah's Promise in New Brunswick; the Food Bank of \nMonmouth and Ocean Counties, in Spring Lake; and the Community Food \nBank of New Jersey in Hillside are doing.\n  It is a tragedy that in the United States, a country where food is \nplentiful, more than 34 million people are either going hungry or \nliving on the edge of hunger. Thirteen million of those are children.\n  While on average New Jersey is one of the wealthiest States in the \nNation, nearly 12 percent of all New Jersey households experience \neither hunger, food insecurity or both. Low wages, unstable employment \nand the high cost of living in the State leave many people in need. \nSenior adults in particular, faced with high housing costs, rising \ntaxes and significant medical expenses miss meals to help make ends \nmeet.\n  That is why we believe the FEED Act is so important. The FEED Act \nwould provide eligible entities with a maximum grant of $200,000 per \nyear to carry out food rescue and job training activities.\n  Food rescue programs collect food from restaurants and businesses and \nturn it into nutritional meals for seniors, children, and low-income \nfamilies. In turn, these meals can be distributed and served to hungry \npeople at homeless shelters, community and youth centers, children's \nafter-school programs, and senior citizen programs.\n  Such programs have proven to be very successful, encouraging \npartnerships between existing social service programs like welfare-to-\nwork, meals-on-wheels, the school lunch program, and after school \nprograms with the preparation of nutritious meals for people in need. \nFood rescue programs often maximize use of existing school, community, \nor private food service facilities and resources to run programs.\n  But just addressing the immediate problem of hunger by providing food \nis half the battle. Hunger and poverty are closely related. With hunger \non the rise in America, we need to go further and address the root \ncauses of hunger by encouraging self sufficiency and responsibility. We \nneed to focus on opportunities that will provide for a living wage \nthrough job training and education.\n  Programs supported by FEED are designed to provide long-term hunger \nrelief by helping participants find employment in the food service \nindustry. In the food service industry, the average wage for starting \njobs is $8.81--over three dollars higher than the Federal minimum wage.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Together \nwe can make progress by finding innovative, cost-effective ways to use \nfood to feed the hungry while working to break the cycle of poverty by \ntraining the homeless and unemployed in food service preparation and \ndelivery.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1885\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Food Employment Empowerment \n     and Development Program Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Food \nEmployment Empowerment and Development (FEED) Act. I am proud to join \nmy good friends and colleagues, Senators Lautenberg and Dole in \nintroducing this legislation that aims to help feed hungry Americans \nand provide job training to low-income Americans in search of self-\nsufficiency.\n  The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that Americans \nthrow away 96 billion pounds of food each year. This number includes \nthe food we throw away after meals, food that loses its shelf life and \nfood that never makes it to store shelves. Meanwhile, 36 million \nAmericans, including 13 million children, don't know where their next \nmeal is coming from. Many of these children will go to bed tonight on \nan empty stomach. This is a paradox in a land of plenty.\n  Several blocks from this magnificent and historic Capitol building, \nthere is a kitchen located in the basement of a building that houses \nsocial services. In that kitchen, every day, over 4,000 meals are \nprepared by low-income, recovering drug addicts or unemployed persons \nwho are training to be chefs. The dozen men and women are in a 12-week \nculinary arts training program and once completed, they will earn their \nculinary arts certification which will empower them to find a job in \nthe culinary industry. The over 4,000 meals produced at the DC Central \nKitchen each day come from a combination of donated, rescued or \npurchased food and are delivered to hundreds of agencies in the \nWashington metro area that in turn feed hungry adults and children.\n  America's Second Harvest has a national network of foodbanks which \nconduct similar programs called ``Community Kitchens'' that achieve the \nsame goals.\n  These types of programs are smart and responsible uses of resources \nand Senators Lautenberg and Dole and I recognize a great model when we \nsee one. We believe that by infusing some Federal support with private \nbusiness, foundations, and faith-based and local non-profit resources, \nwe can grow similar programs all across the Nation.\n  Again, we are taking rescued food, food that would otherwise be \nwasted, turning it into meals that are being prepared by people who are \ntraining to get a job to help support themselves and their family, and \nusing the meals to feed hungry American adults and children.\n  I believe that all of us that are committed to helping end hunger in \nAmerica agree with the old adage: ``Give a man a fish and he eats for a \nday; teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime.'' And it is this \nsimple concept that is the impetus for the FEED Act.\n  I am hopeful that this legislation will help local anti-hunger \norganizations in Arkansas and across the Nation who want to use this \nmulti-pronged approach to feed the hungry, empower the unemployed and \nmaximize food resources.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bi-partisan bill \ntoday\n\n[[Page S11482]]\n\nand I appreciate those Senators who have joined us in sponsoring this \ncommonsense legislation. I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues to ensure its speedy consideration and passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11482-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 275--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 6, 2006 AS \n    ``NATIONAL TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION WEEK''\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nAkaka, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Biden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 275\n\n       Whereas 1 in 3 female high school students reports being \n     physically abused or sexually abused by a dating partner;\n       Whereas over 40 percent of male and female high school \n     students surveyed had been victims of dating violence at \n     least once;\n       Whereas violent relationships in adolescence can have \n     serious ramifications for victims, who are at higher risk for \n     substance abuse, eating disorders, risky sexual behavior, \n     suicide, and adult re-victimization;\n       Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners \n     has been shown to increase if the pattern was established in \n     adolescence;\n       Whereas 81 percent of parents surveyed either believed \n     dating violence is not a problem or admitted they did not \n     know it is a problem; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``National Teen Dating \n     Violence Awareness and Prevention Week'' will benefit \n     schools, communities, and families regardless of socio-\n     economic status, race, or gender: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of February 6, 2006 as ``National \n     Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States, especially \n     high schools, law enforcement, local, and State officials, \n     and interested groups to observe the week with appropriate \n     activities that promote awareness and prevention of the crime \n     of teen dating violence in our communities.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution in a critical \nand too often overlooked subject--teen dating violence. For many \ndecades the tragic crime of domestic violence in the United States went \nlargely unacknowledged by the public face that our society wears. \nBehind smiling couples and seemingly carefree children lurked something \nthat was better left unspoken, or so many were convinced. Fortunately, \nin recent years, this dreadful violence that makes a home a prison \nwhere rights, human dignity and freedom are eclipsed by fear and rage \nis now something that society is more willing to acknowledge, talk \nabout and report to proper authorities. As we expose domestic violence \nto the light of truth and hold perpetrators accountable for their \nviolent actions and destructive words, it is important to address the \nreality of the transgenerational nature of this crime within families.\n  I've always liked the adage, ``Children learn what they live.'' Never \nis this more true than in the case of abuse and domestic violence. When \nchildren begin to enter their teen years, the relationship norms they \nlearned watching those in parental roles become their own. The results \nin many junior high, high schools, and colleges across our Nation are \nchilling: 20 percent of surveyed male students reported witnessing \nsomeone they go to high school with physically hit a person they were \ndating; 58 percent of rape victims report having been raped between the \nages of 12-24; 81 percent of parents surveyed either believe teen \ndating violence is not an issue or admit they don't know if it is an \nissue; There is a clear link between adolescent dating violence and \nadult marital violence.\n  Clearly, the crime of teen dating violence, including physical, \nemotional, and sexual assault, is a reality for many American \nteenagers. Like drug abuse, it's a reality of which many parents are \nunaware. It makes sense to have the people most affected by this \ninsidious disease leading the efforts to raise awareness of and prevent \nthe further spread of it.\n  The Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Initiative is a \nmovement spearheaded by teenagers across the nation to make a stand and \nput a stop to teen dating violence. Led by the American Bar \nAssociation's Steering Committee on the Unmet Needs of Children and co-\nsponsored by dozens of other organizations, teenagers from 20 State \nTeams attended a national awareness and education summit in 2004. At \nthat time, they developed Teen Dating Violence Prevention and Awareness \nToolkits to distribute to high schools across the Nation in conjunction \nwith a proposed National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention \nWeek in early 2006.\n  Today, I am submitting a resolution declaring February 6-10, 2006, \nNational Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week. Many \ngovernors, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice \nhave already pledged to work with the goals and activities that are \npart of the Initiative. This resolution calls on government \nrepresentatives and agencies, private organizations and public \nofficials to promote activities in their respective communities that \nraise awareness of the high incidence of teen dating violence that \noccurs among our teens every day, as well as prevention strategies. I \nthank my colleagues, Senators Cantwell, Murray, Lieberman, Murkowski, \nDurbin, Akaka and Biden in joining me in raising awareness of the \nproblem. This is one major step we can take toward the goal of \neliminating the tragedy of children hurting children, and I am \nprivileged to be in a position to help lead this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11482-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 276--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nATTACHMENT THERAPY TECHNIQUE KNOW AS REBIRTHING IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE \n                        AND SHOULD BE PROHIBITED\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Burr, and Mrs. Dole) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 276\n\n       Whereas ``rebirthing'' is the most dangerous form of \n     attachment therapy, a controversial and scientifically \n     unsupported form of therapy that claims to treat emotionally \n     disturbed children by using physical restraints;\n       Whereas rebirthing techniques attempt to reenact the birth \n     process by restraining a child with blankets or other \n     materials and forcing the child to emerge unaided;\n       Whereas rebirthing techniques are based on the erroneous \n     assumption that a reenactment of the birth process will treat \n     children with reactive attachment disorder, a psychiatric \n     condition characterized by the inability to form emotional \n     attachments, by purging the child of rage resulting from past \n     mistreatment and allowing the child to form stronger \n     emotional attachments in the future;\n       Whereas attachment therapists claim rebirthing techniques \n     create new bonds between adopted children and adoptive \n     parents and often use rebirthing techniques in therapy \n     sessions with adoptive families;\n       Whereas in 2000, Candace Newmaker, a 10-year-old child from \n     North Carolina, died from suffocation, after being wrapped in \n     flannel sheets, covered with pillows, and leaned on by 4 \n     adults to simulate contractions, when Candace became trapped \n     by the sheets because she was forcibly restrained by these \n     adults and could not emerge through her own efforts to be \n     reborn into her adoptive family;\n       Whereas between 1995 and 2005, at least 4 other children in \n     the United States have died from other forms of attachment \n     therapy;\n       Whereas the American Psychiatric Association, a national \n     medical specialty society that focuses on the diagnosis, \n     treatment, and prevention of mental illnesses, maintains that \n     no scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of \n     rebirthing techniques;\n       Whereas in 2002, Paul S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. __02.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 277 which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 277) supporting the goals of Red \n     Ribbon Week.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I rise today in support of a resolution that \ncommemorates the annual ``Red Ribbon Week.'' I am pleased to have Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Biden, Mr. Talent, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Dominici, \nand Mr. Chambliss join me in introducing this resolution. The purpose \nof Red Ribbon Week is to educate and advocate a commitment to a drug-\nfree lifestyle. Red Ribbon Week also remembers the contribution of one \nsoldier in the war against drugs, Drug Enforcement Administration \nSpecial Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena. I am honored to be here to \nseek the Senate's recognition and support again for the annual Red \nRibbon Week Campaign.\n  In Alaska, Red Ribbon Week will be a statewide celebration involving \nthousands of school children and those people and organizations who \ncare about the welfare of our children and communities. On October 24, \nthe city of Anchorage of will celebrate with a series of Red Ribbon \nevents coordinated with the Anchorage School District, the Alaska \nNational Guard, the Alaska State Troopers, the mayor of Anchorage, the \nBoys & Girls Clubs of Alaska, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the \nlocal U.S. Attorney's Office, many PTA groups and many others \nthroughout the community.\n  Throughout the week, Alaskans will be encouraged to show gratitude \nfor everyone who remains drug-free and pledges to live a safe and drug-\nfree life and remember those we have lost in the fight against drugs.\n  The Red Ribbon Week Campaign was started in 1988 by the Federation of \nParents. It was organized as an 8-day event and was then chaired by \nthen-President and Mrs. Reagan. The event began as a tribute to DEA \nSpecial Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena who was kidnapped, tortured, \nand murdered by drug traffickers in 1985. Those who advocate that drug \naddiction is a\n\n[[Page S11498]]\n\nvictimless crime should talk to the widow and children of Agent \nCamarena. His sons, Erik and Enrique, Jr. continue to honor their \nfather and work to help children and families who are victims of drug-\nrelated crimes.\n  The Red Ribbon that we wear during Red Ribbon Week is a symbol of \nzero tolerance for illegal drug use and a commitment to drug abuse \nprevention. The ribbon will be worn or displayed in the upcoming Red \nRibbon Week by millions of Americans in an act of unity and remembrance \nof Agent ``Kiki'' Camarena.\n  The distribution and abuse of illicit drugs is not a private matter. \nDrugs harm children. Drugs harm our communities. Illegal drugs only \nfacilitate dependency, addiction and the breakdown of families.\n  We must encourage our children to make better choices by making the \nsame commitment in our own lives. We as parents and leaders must set \ngood examples.\n  Our children are growing up in a culture that continues to send \nconfusing and mixed signals. Therefore, our children are confronting \ndifficult choices on a continuous basis. Celebrities in the media, \nmovies, television, and music often encourage them to make the wrong \ndecisions. The Red Ribbon Campaign is one effort to help our children \nmake the right decisions.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me in support of this resolution to \nhelp illustrate the Senate's commitment in ensuring that our children \nknow the benefits of a drug-free lifestyle and encouraging all people \nto live such a lifestyle.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President. I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Murkowski in sponsoring a resolution commemorating the annual \n``Red Ribbon Week.'' Celebrated October 23-31, Red Ribbon Week \nencourages individuals, families, and communities to take a stand \nagainst alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drug use. I hope the rest of the \nSenate will join in supporting this resolution and support this very \nimportant campaign.\n  The tradition of Red Ribbon Week now in its twentieth year of wearing \nand displaying red ribbons started following the assassination of U.S. \nDrug Enforcement Agency Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena. In an \neffort to honor his memory and unite in the battle against drug crime \nand abuse, friends, neighbors, and students from his home town began \nwearing red ribbons. Shortly thereafter, the National Family \nPartnership took the celebration nationwide. Since then, the Red Ribbon \ncampaign has reached millions of children, families, and communities \nacross the country, spreading the message about the destructive effects \nof drugs.\n  In my State of Iowa, this year's theme for Red Ribbon Week is ``Take \na Stand--Be Drug Free.'' Schools and community groups across the State \nare organizing a variety of activities including pledges, contests, \nworkshops, rallies, theatrical and musical performances, and other \nfamily and educational events all designed to educate our children on \nthe negative effects of drugs and promote a drug-free environment.\n  Research tells us that the longer a child stays drug-free the less \nlikely they will become addicted or even try illegal drugs. This is why \nit is so important to maintain a coherent anti-drug message that begins \nearly in adolescence and continues throughout the growing years. Such \nan effort must involve parents, communities, and young people. Red \nRibbon Week provides each of us the opportunity to take a stand by \nhelping our children make the right decisions when it comes to drugs.\n  In light of the growing epidemic of methamphetamine abuse throughout \nthe Nation and especially in State of Iowa, this year's Red Ribbon Week \nholds greater importance. I urge colleagues to join us in passing this \nresolution to demonstrate our commitment to raising awareness about \ndrugs and encourage everyone to make healthy choices.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 277) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 276, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 276) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the attachment therapy technique known as \n     rebirthing is a dangerous practice and should be prohibited.\n\n\n[[Page S11500]]\n\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a resolution \nI have introduced with my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Burr. \nThis resolution encourages States to prohibit a controversial procedure \nknown as ``rebirthing.''\n  Today's action sheds light on the death of a North Carolina child \nbrought to Colorado to undergo the ``rebirthing'' procedure.\n  Like many, I first learned of this intervention procedure known as \n``rebirthing'' when information about the death of Candace Newmaker was \nreported in Colorado newspapers.\n  Rebirthing is a procedure which attempts to reenact the birth process \nby restraining a child with blankets and forcing a child to emerge \nunaided.\n  Candace, a 10-year-old, was brought to my State to undergo \n``rebirthing,'' which was supposed to help her form a bond with her \nnewly adoptive mother. Instead, this dangerous procedure, which is \nsupported by no scientific evidence, and is in fact condemned by the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, cut short a life full of \npossibilities.\n  Her adoptive mother believed that this procedure would help her \nestablish a stronger relationship with Candace, who was having \ndifficulty adjusting to her new home and who had been in and out of the \nfoster care system.\n  By paying $7,000 for someone to diagnose and to treat Candace, her \nadoptive mother believed that she would establish a connection with her \nnew daughter. After a few days, the hired ``experts'' decided that \n``rebirthing'' would erase Candace's childhood memories so that she \ncould form a lasting mother-daughter relationship.\n  Candace was wrapped in flannel blankets, held down by the weight of \nfour adults, who bounced her and squeezed her to simulate contractions. \nWhen Candace begged for the procedure to cease, the adults holding her \ndown ignored her pleas. When she told the strangers restraining her \nthat she felt she was going to die, they ignored her.\n  In April 2001, when Candace was brought to Children's Hospital in \nDenver, she was unconscious. She had been restrained under blankets for \nover an hour. Tragically, she suffocated to death.\n  I was Colorado's Attorney General at the time this tragedy occurred. \nWhen one of the therapists was convicted for the death of Candace, my \noffice successfully upheld that conviction upon appeal.\n  As I stated then, and still believe today: adults are responsible for \ntheir criminal recklessness when caring for a child, regardless of \nwhether it is called ``therapy'' or some other form of unusual care or \ntreatment.\n  We cannot take back the actions of the past and bring Candace back, \nbut we can take action to ensure that her life was not lost in vain.\n  Her grandparents, David and Mary Davis, have been the primary force \nbehind efforts to honor the life of Candace. Through their advocacy, \nthe States of Colorado and North Carolina have passed laws banning \nrebirthing.\n  The Davis family also worked with their representative in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives to pass a resolution encouraging States to \noutlaw rebirthing.\n  With the introduction of this resolution, the Senate is poised to \nact.\n  Candace's grandparents and several members of her extended family are \nwith us today. I welcome the Davis family and sincerely appreciate \ntheir presence. I am honored to join with Senator Burr to support this \nresolution.\n  It is my hope that our actions today will prevent further pain and \nsuffering.\n  I urge the Senate to promptly act on this resolution in the name of \nCandace Newmaker and all children who could potentially be victimized \nby this life-threatening procedure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado. It is \nseldom we have an opportunity to effect a change for a specific \nindividual. We have an opportunity to do that today for an individual \nwe will never meet, an individual who might be placed in the same \nsituation as Candace. In fact, in 2001, Candace Newmaker, the \ngranddaughter of David and Mary Davis of Vale, NC, was killed. She was \nkilled during a so-called rebirthing therapy session. This dangerous \npractice involves therapists, as my colleague said, wrapping sheets and \ntowels and pillows around a patient who almost always is a young child, \nwho is curled in a fetal position. The therapists attempt to recreate \nthe child's birth by physically restraining and pushing against the \nchild, urging the child to escape.\n  The stories are horrendous. Rebirthing has resulted in numerous \ninjuries as well as the suffocation and death of five children. If \nthere was ever a time that called out for us to act on a resolution \nlike this, this is it; to reach out to States and say: Do what North \nCarolina did, do what Colorado did--outlaw this practice.\n  In 2003, North Carolina did outlaw this unsafe therapy, largely due \nto the Davises' efforts. Today, Senator Salazar and I urge other States \nto do exactly that. The Candace Newmaker resolution encourages States \nto examine the rebirthing technique and enact laws prohibiting this \ndangerous practice. Organizations such as the American Psychological \nAssociation fully support the ban of this technique. The possible loss \nof another child to this harmful therapy should be enough reason for \nthe Senate to pass this resolution; if we can affect one child with our \naction, a child we have not met who might be exposed to this, we should \ndo so.\n  The House of Representatives, led by my colleague, Representative Sue \nMyrick, passed a similar resolution on December 17, 2002. The Davises \nare here today, and I thank them personally for their passion and for \ntheir commitment to have rebirthing outlawed. Their dedication to this \ncause is a reflection of the amount of love and loss they feel toward \nCandace.\n  Mr. President, I proudly join my colleague, Senator Salazar, to raise \nawareness of this resolution and to urge our colleagues in this body \nfor a quick consideration.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, that any statements relating thereto be printed \nin the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 276) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 276\n\n       Whereas ``rebirthing'' is the most dangerous form of \n     attachment therapy, a controversial and scientifically \n     unsupported form of therapy that claims to treat emotionally \n     disturbed children by using physical restraints;\n       Whereas rebirthing techniques attempt to reenact the birth \n     process by restraining a child with blankets or other \n     materials and forcing the child to emerge unaided;\n       Whereas rebirthing techniques are based on the erroneous \n     assumption that a reenactment of the birth process will treat \n     children with reactive attachment disorder, a psychiatric \n     condition characterized by the inability to form emotional \n     attachments, by purging the child of rage resulting from past \n     mistreatment and allowing the child to form stronger \n     emotional attachments in the future;\n       Whereas attachment therapists claim rebirthing techniques \n     create new bonds between adopted children and adoptive \n     parents and often use rebirthing techniques in therapy \n     sessions with adoptive families;\n       Whereas in 2000, Candace Newmaker, a 10-year-old child from \n     North Carolina, died from suffocation, after being wrapped in \n     flannel sheets, covered with pillows, and leaned on by 4 \n     adults to simulate contractions, when Candace became trapped \n     by the sheets because she was forcibly restrained by these \n     adults and could not emerge through her own efforts to be \n     reborn into her adoptive family;\n       Whereas between 1995 and 2005, at least 4 other children in \n     the United States have died from other forms of attachment \n     therapy;\n       Whereas the American Psychiatric Association, a national \n     medical specialty society that focuses on the diagnosis, \n     treatment, and prevention of mental illnesses, maintains that \n     no scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of \n     rebirthing techniques;\n       Whereas in 2002, Paul S. Appelbaum, M.D., President of the \n     American Psychiatric Association, condemned rebirthing \n     techniques as ``extreme methods [that] pose serious risk and \n     should not be used under any circumstances''; and\n       Whereas several States have enacted or are considering \n     legislation to prohibit the use of rebirthing techniques: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) rebirthing, an attachment therapy technique that \n     reenacts the birth process by\n\n[[Page S11501]]\n\n     physically restraining a child and forcing the child to \n     emerge unaided, is dangerous, potentially life-threatening, \n     and unsupported by scientific evidence; and\n       (2) each State should enact laws prohibiting the use of \n     rebirthing techniques.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/18/senate-section/article/S11501-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
