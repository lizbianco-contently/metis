Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, is designated to read \nWashington's Farewell Address.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I am honored today to take part in the \nSenate's annual tradition of reading George Washington's farewell \naddress to the Nation. I am truly humbled to add my name to the list of \nSenators who have been privileged to read the address.\n  The address, delivered by Washington in the form of an open letter to \nhis fellow countrymen, appeared in newspapers across our young Nation \nover 200 years ago. Then, as now, we struggle sometimes with \nWashington's words. We debate meaning and we debate intent, but perhaps \nour discourse is what Washington himself intended. Our independence and \nour freedom is, in fact, the source of our strength.\n  I believe that the address is President Washington's call for \nAmericans to look beyond divisions and to gain strength in our unity of \npurpose.\n  Washington's Farewell Address to the people of the United States of \nAmerica:\n\nTo the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\nfor your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction that the \nstep is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\nstrength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign \npower, must be intrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its bands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nits greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\nthe animosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n     GEO.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncontributions of the more than 8,000 Catholic elementary and secondary \nschools nationwide. These schools, which serve over 2.6 million \nstudents, are a vibrant force in our country's educational and \nspiritual life.\n  During the month of February every year, communities throughout \nNevada and the Nation celebrate National Catholic Schools Week. \nSponsored by the National Catholic Educational Association and the \nUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops, this annual national \ncelebration provides an opportunity to acknowledge the important work \nof these schools in helping educate our Nation's children.\n  One day during this week, National Appreciation Day for Catholic \nSchool Teachers, specifically recognizes the hard work and dedication \nof the more than 163,000 educators who work in Catholic schools. The \nwork of our Nation's educators is too often overlooked, but it could \nnot be more important. I know I would not be where I am today without \none of my high school teachers, Mike O'Callaghan. I am glad that \nNational Catholic Schools Week provides an opportunity to acknowledge \nthe work of those individuals who serve as the foundation of our \nschools.\n  Nevada's Catholic schools have contributed significantly to the \neducation of my State's students for several decades. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to recognize a few of the schools that will be \ncelebrating special anniversaries this year.\n  The only Catholic high school in Nevada, Bishop Gorman High School, \nwill celebrate its 50th anniversary this year. The oldest Catholic \nschool in Nevada, however, is St. Joseph School, which will celebrate \nits 58th anniversary this year. St. Christopher, St. Francis de Sales, \nand St. Viator Elementary Schools also will all mark their 40th \nanniversary this year. These and the other Catholic schools in the \nState have long served Nevada well, and I am sure they will continue to \nfor many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1708-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1708-S1709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n Ms. SNOWE. I rise today as lead cosponsor of S.J. Res. 5, the \nFeinstein-Snowe joint resolution that authorizes the Secretary of State \nto engage in efforts with other Federal agencies to lead international \nnegotiations to mitigate the impacts of global warming. Our resolution \nencourages the United States to take actions to reduce manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions believed by the majority of internationally \nrenowned scientists to be causing climate changes around the globe.\n  I support this resolution because ongoing scientific peer-reviewed \nresearch demonstrates that climate change is one of the most \nsignificant environmental and economical issues of the 21st century. \nYet, I have grave concerns that our government, to borrow from the \nimage of Nero, is fiddling as the planet warms.\n  On Wednesday, February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol on climate change \nofficially entered into force, with 141 States and regional economic \nintegration organizations depositing instruments of ratifications, \naccessions, approvals or acceptances with the United Nations. The \ntreaty, which will require mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions \nin 35 participating developed countries starting in 2008, represents a \nwatershed moment for international action on climate change.\n  The Protocol was agreed to by governments at a 1997 U.N. conference \nin Kyoto, Japan, to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by \ndeveloped countries by 5.2 percent of 1990 levels between 2008 and \n2012.\n  Even with the Kyoto Protocol going into effect, it is obvious that \nnew and longer term ideas for securing international cooperation are \nnecessary as we cannot get to the heart of this global problem without \nthe world's major economies at the table. The United States and \nAustralia have not ratified the Protocol, and developing countries, \nwhile signatories to Kyoto, are not required to make cuts. This \nincludes large, rapidly industrializing economies such as China, India, \nand Brazil. Clearly, as the causes of climate change are global and the \natmosphere knows no boundaries, the challenge can only be met with all \nthe countries of the world working together.\n  That is why, this past year, when asked by three major independent \nthink tanks--the Center for American Progress in the US, the Institute \nfor Public Policy Research in the U.K. and the Australia Institute--I \naccepted the co-chairmanship of the high level International Climate \nChange Taskforce--the ICCT--to chart a way forward on climate change on \na parallel track with the Kyoto process.\n  This led me to meetings both in Washington and London with my co-\nchair, the Rt. Honorable Stephen Byers of the U.K. Mr. Byers told me \nthat Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed the creation of the taskforce \nand looked forward to its climate change recommendations that he could \ntake forward as he assumed the presidency of the G8 and also the EU in \n2005. In fact, Prime Minister Blair has made the issue of climate \nchange a centerpiece of his agenda for the G8 meeting in July in \nGleneagles, Scotland, and, recently, he included some of our \nrecommendations in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, \nSwitzerland.\n  We have achieved our goals for recommendations for the taskforce, \nwhich is an international, cross-party, cross-sector collaboration of \nleaders from public service, science, business, and civil society from \nboth developed and developing countries. We set out a pathway to solve \nclimate change issues in tandem--collaboratively finding common ground \nthrough recommendations that are both ambitious and realistic to engage \nall countries, and, critically, including those not bound by the Kyoto \nProtocol and major developing countries. We hope our proposals will be \na prelude to the international dialogue and, ultimately, set the score \nfor lasting change.\n  Our ICCT report, Meeting the Climate Challenge, recommends ways to \ninvolve the world's largest economies in the effort, including the U.S. \nand major developing nations, focusing on creating new agreements to \nachieve the deployment of clean energy technologies, and a new global \npolicy framework that is both inclusive and fair. The report also calls \nfor the establishment of a long-term objective of preventing global \naverage temperature from rising more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit--(2 \ndegrees Centigrade)--above the pre-industrial level by the end of the \ncentury, and this same provision is contained in the Feinstein-Snowe \nResolution.\n\n  Mr. President, the taskforce arrived at the 2 degrees Centigrade--or \n3.6 degree Fahrenheit--temperature increase\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\ngoal on the basis of an extensive review of the relevant scientific \nliterature that shows that, as the ICC report states, ``Beyond the 2 \ndegree Centigrade level, the risks to human societies and ecosystems \ngrow significantly. It is likely, for example, that average temperature \nincreased larger than this will entail substantial agricultural losses, \ngreatly increases numbers of people at risk of water shortages, and \nwidespread adverse health impacts.''\n  Our report goes on to say that, ``Climate science is not yet able to \nspecify the trajectory of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse \ngases that corresponds precisely to any particular global temperature \nrise. Based on current knowledge, however, it appears that achieving a \nhigh probability of limiting global average temperature rise to 2 \ndegrees C will require that the increase in greenhouse-gas \nconcentrations as well as all the other warming and cooling influences \non global climate in the year 2100, as compared with 1750, should add \nup to a net warming no greater than what would be associated with a \nCO2 concentration of about 400 parts per million (ppm)''.\n  I am pleased that the S.J. Res. includes the ICCT's first \nrecommendation: Establishing a long-term objective for a global average \ntemperature increase. This comports well with the McCain and Lieberman \nClimate Stewardship Act introduced last week, for which I am a \ncosponsor. This bill would create a domestic market-based cap-and-trade \nsystem to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Again, the ICCT Taskforce \nrecommends that all developed countries introduce national mandatory \ncap-and-trade systems for carbon emissions, and to construct them to \nallow for their future integration into a single global market.\n  The Feinstein-Snowe resolution includes other goals of the ICCT \ntaskforce, encouraging the U.S. to carry out reasonable and responsible \nactions to ensure significant and meaningful reductions in emissions of \nmanmade greenhouse gases, particularly through generating climate-\nfriendly technologies to promote sustained economic growth. \nImportantly, like the ICCT Report, it also calls for international \nnegotiations under the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, \nUNFCCC, which was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1992, and this should \nbe done for the post-Kyoto period, or after 2012.\n  Mr. President, even with the Kyoto Protocol going into effect, it is \nobvious that new ideas for securing international cooperation are \nnecessary as we cannot get to the heart of this global problem without \nthe world's major economies at the table. We have a choice between an \neven greater treacherous path of increased environmental damage and \neconomic harm, or an upward path to a better future for our planet, and \nenhanced competitiveness for our industries. Again, the ICCT report \naddresses this, calling for the formation of a G8 plus Climate Group I \nbetween the G8 and the major developing countries to pursue technology \nagreements and related initiatives that will truly lead to large global \nemissions reductions.\n  To mitigate further losses, the U.S. should actively engage in the \ndiscussions at the upcoming G8 Summit, offering viable recommendations \nand realistic goals for further domestic and international emissions \nreductions. The U.S. can ensure the protection of the competitiveness \nof U.S. industry while at the same time joining with others to take \npositive action to tackle global warming. The U.S. has the opportunity \nto re-engage as a world leader, serving as a model for developing \nnations such as China and India, whose unchecked CO2 \nemissions will soon rival those of the United States.\n  The urgency is clear as climate change is no longer an abstract \nconcept. Polar ice caps are melting. Sea levels are rising. And the \nearth's temperature is undeniably climbing--with ten of the warmest \nyears on record since 1990. Documented by countless scientific studies, \nthe world bears witness to the effects of climate change. A result of \nincreases in manmade carbon dioxide emissions, climate change appears \nto be impacting the planet's weather patterns, resulting in more \nsevere, sustained storm systems, floods, heat waves, and droughts.\n  Earlier this month, an international conference of scientists \nrecommended that action must be taken now to reduce emissions in order \nto stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. \nTheir report warned that a delay of even five years could be \nsignificant. And, beyond environmental devastation, climate change \ndictates serious economic and human costs.\n  Mr. President, it has been a privilege to work on this Senate Joint \nResolution with Senator Feinstein of California, and I urge my \ncolleagues to give our resolution full consideration as the rest of the \ndeveloped world strives not only to protect today's environment and \neconomies but to bequeath a healthy and sustainable planet to future \ngenerations. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1709-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING THE 652D ENGINEER COMPANY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I congratulate the Army Reserve's \n652d Engineer Company from Ellsworth, WI, for winning the 2004 \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, Reserve Family Readiness Award. This award \nis given by DOD to only one unit from each Reserve component in \nrecognition of their exceptional family support program.\n  Our men and women in uniform continue to serve courageously around \nthe world and make great sacrifices to do so. We owe these folks a \ngreat debt of gratitude. However, they are not alone in making these \nsacrifices--their families, too, bear a great burden. The families must \nnot only deal with the emotional toll of having their loved ones \nserving in a dangerous area, they must also deal with the daily tasks \nthat keep a family functioning. The toll can be especially great on \nReserve Component families who have to deal with all sorts of \nchallenges when their loved ones transition to active duty.\n  The members of the 652d Engineer Company and their families \npersonally know about sacrifice. Four of its members were killed in \naction during Operation Iraqi Freedom, including 2 on Christmas Day \n2003, and 20 received Purple Heart Medals. The 652d Engineer Company's \nFamily Readiness Group, FRG, provided crucial support to the families \nof these soldiers. We must also remember the confusion and uncertainty \nthat was particularly acute with the early deployments. The FRG was key \nin helping families navigate through the many pre- and post-deployment \nissues. Their excellent work was an essential factor in allowing the \n652d Engineer Company to carry out its mission.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to thank the 652d Engineer Company and the \nFRG for their service and to congratulate them again on receiving this \naward and on a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1709-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1709-S1710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate \nBlack History Month.\n  This month celebrates the accomplishments of African Americans, \nhonors the tremendous sacrifices they have made to promote the strength \nof our great nation, and recognizes their enormous contributions to our \ndiverse American culture.\n  Black History Month is a time to reflect on the accomplishments and \nheroes of the past, as well as a time to salute the leaders of today.\n  The first Negro History Week took place in 1926 and was coordinated \nby Dr. Carter G. Woodson, the son of former slaves, the second African \nAmerican ever to earn a PhD from Harvard University, and founder of the \nJournal of Negro History. Dr. Woodson's goal was to raise awareness of \nand funding for the study of black culture and history in America.\n  The second week of February was chosen for Negro History Week to \nhonor the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln, who promulgated the \nEmancipation Proclamation, and Frederick Douglass, one of the most \nprominent black abolitionists.\n  In 1972 Negro History Week was changed to Black History Week to \nreflect the changing social attitudes toward race in America, and in \n1976 February officially became Black History Month.\n  The theme of this year's Black History Month is ``The Niagara \nMovement: Black Protest Reborn, 1905-2005.''\n\n[[Page S1710]]\n\n  The Niagara Movement was the forerunner to the National Association \nfor the Advancement of Colored People. It was founded in 1905 by a \ngroup of black intellectuals, led by W.E.B. DuBois, John Hope, and \nWilliam Monroe Trotter, who called for full civil liberties, an end to \nracial discrimination, and recognition of human brotherhood.\n  In my home State of California, you will find many African American \nleaders who have contributed to the legacy set forth by the Niagara \nMovement. They are true humanitarians and epitomize the ideals of the \ncivil rights movement.\n  I would first like to recognize Roy Willis, a resident of my hometown \nof San Francisco, for his 35 years of history-making contributions to \nCalifornia and over 45 years of service to our nation as a civil rights \npioneer.\n  In 1958, Roy Willis ended racial segregation at the University of \nVirginia by becoming its first African American student.\n  In 1967, he went on to Harvard Business School to earn his MBA. While \nat Harvard he organized and co-founded the Harvard Business School \nAfrican American Student Union over strenuous objection from the \nschool's administration. Despite their objections, the AASU was able to \nconvince the administration that it needed to do much more to recruit \nAfrican American students.\n  Thanks to the pioneering efforts of Mr. Willis, the Harvard Business \nSchool AASU has helped to graduate thousands of African American MBAs \nover the past 36 years. It has produced many of today's brightest \nleaders, and continues to create the leaders of tomorrow.\n  Roy moved to northern Californian after earning his MBA in 1969. In \nthe early 1970s he became one of the founding members of BAPAC, the \nBlack American Political Association of California, which has become \none of California's largest and most effective organizations in the \nareas of voter registration, homeownership and economic development.\n  He has enjoyed a successful career in real estate development, and \ndedicates himself to creating projects that enhance the community.\n  The next great Californian I would like to recognize is Bishop Hamel \nHartford Brookins, better known as Bishop H. H. Brookins.\n  He is truly a living legend. Bishop Brookins ascended to positions of \ninternational leadership as a champion of black political and economic \nempowerment, Third World liberation, business enterprise development, \nand church growth.\n  After graduating from the University of Kansas, Bishop Brookins was \nthrust into the civil rights arena in 1954 in the wake of hostile \nreactions by Wichita citizens to the historical Supreme Court decision, \nBrown vs. the Board of Education. Bishop Brookins organized and was \nelected President of a 200 member interracial ministerial alliance \nwhich was committed to the peaceful effective implementation of the \ndesegregation decision. From Kansas, Bishop Brookins was appointed to \nthe prestigious First AME Church of Los Angeles where he was a major \nforce in quelling the Watts riots of 1965.\n  At the 1972 General Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal \nChurch, he was elected 91st Bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal \nChurch. His assignments as Bishop have taken him across the country and \naround the world.\n  One of his biggest accomplishments has been establishing the first \nmodern day economic development program in the African Methodist \nEpiscopal Church. Under his inspired leadership, church members have \ninvested more than $1,000,000 in ``The People's Trust Fund,'' which \nprovides loans to black entrepreneurs who have been denied bank loans, \nenables churches to obtain loans at reduced rates, provides \nscholarships to black theology students, and assists the elderly and \nindigent with emergency funds.\n  Outside the church, Bishop Brookins demonstrates his zealous concern \nfor meaningful social action through his Chairmanship of the Board of \nDirectors of the South Los Angeles Development Corporation, a $6 \nmillion state funded job training program which has successfully placed \nmore than 4,000 black teenagers in jobs in the electronics and word \nprocessing fields. In addition, he is one of the founding members of \nOperation PUSH and has served as a national board member of \nTransAfrica, an organization that lobbies on behalf of African and \nThird World countries.\n  Bishop Brookins is a local hero in Los Angeles. Because of his \npassion for social justice and racial equality, African Americans in \nthe City of Los Angeles have moved forward in the areas of housing, \npublic education, health, and unemployment.\n  The story of struggles and triumphs of African Americans cannot be \ntold without including the pastor of the First African Methodist \nEpiscopal Church of Los Angeles, the Rev. Cecil L. ``Chip'' Murray.\n  In 1977 Dr. Murray was assigned to First AME Church, the oldest black \nchurch in Los Angeles. His new church family had 300 active members \nwhen he arrived, but under his leadership the congregation has \nmultiplied to over 17,000 members.\n  Reverend Murray has helped First AME Church to develop a program \ncalled ``Beyond the Walls,'' which consists of close to 40 task forces \nthat help deal with issues affecting the congregation and community as \na whole. Each member joins a task force to help take the effort to \nevery corner of the community.\n  Dr. Murray has exhorted his congregation to go beyond Bible studies \nand reach out to build 2,000 units of low-income housing, provide \nthousands of jobs, expand neighborhood food programs and educate young \npeople through college scholarships and its own elementary schools.\n  Though Reverend Murray retired last year, ending his illustrious 27-\nyear tenure as leader of First AME Church, he has left an indelible \nmark on the community.\n  Each of these leaders has made a profound impact which reaches far \nbeyond their local communities. They are just a few of the many who \nhave given their blood, sweat, and tears to make America a better place \nfor themselves and for their children.\n  They have had many successes, but the struggle is not over. We can \nalways do better, and these heroes fight every day to continue the \nlegacy of the civil rights movement and to make America a more perfect \nunion.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to take the time today during Black \nHistory Month to honor these individuals and the many tremendous \ncontributions that African Americans make every day to our \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1710-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1710-S1712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AgJOBS ACT OF 2005\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on February 10, I introduced S. 359, \nthe Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of 2005--\nAgJOBS. I ask that materials I am submitting in support of that bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n          The Need for AgJOBS Legislation--Now, February 2005\n\n       Americans need and expect a stable, predictable, legal work \n     force in American agriculture. Willing American workers \n     deserve a system that puts them first in line for available \n     jobs with fair, market wages. All workers deserve decent \n     treatment and protection of basic rights under the law. \n     Consumers deserve a safe, stable, domestic food supply. \n     American citizens and taxpayers deserve secure borders, a \n     safe homeland, and a government that works. Yet we are being \n     threatened on all these fronts, because of a growing shortage \n     of legal workers in agriculture.\n       To address these challenges, a bipartisan group of Members \n     of Congress has introduced the Agricultural Job Opportunity, \n     Benefits, and Security (AgJOBS) Act of 2005. This bipartisan \n     effort builds upon years of discussion and suggestions among \n     growers, farm worker advocates, Latino and immigration issue \n     advocates, Members of both parties in both Houses of \n     Congress, and others. In all substantive essentials, this \n     bill is the same as S. 1645/H.R. 3142 in the 108th Congress.\n\n\n                              The Problems\n\n       Of the USA's 1.6 million agricultural work force, more than \n     half is made up of workers not legally authorized to work \n     here--according to a conservative estimate by the Department \n     of Labor, based, astoundingly, on self-disclosure in worker \n     surveys. Reasonable private sector estimates run to 75 \n     percent or more.\n       With stepped-up documentation enforcement by the Social \n     Security Administration and the Bureau of Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement (the successor to the old INS), persons \n     working here without legal documentation are not leaving the \n     country, but just being scattered. The work force is being \n     constantly and increasingly disrupted. Ag\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\n     employers want a legal work force and must have a stable work \n     force to survive--but Federal law actually punishes ``too \n     much diligence'' in checking worker documentation. Some \n     growers already have gone out of business, lacking workers to \n     work their crops at critical times.\n       Undocumented workers are among the most vulnerable persons \n     in our country, and know they must live in hiding, not \n     attract attention at work, and move furtively. They cannot \n     claim the most basic legal rights and protections. They are \n     vulnerable to predation and exploitation. Many have paid \n     ``coyotes''--labor smugglers--thousands of dollars to be \n     transported into and around this country, often under \n     inhumane and perilous conditions. Reports continue to mount \n     of horrible deaths suffered by workers smuggled in enclosed \n     truck trailers.\n       Meanwhile, the only program currently in place to respond \n     to such needs, the H-2A legal guest worker program, is \n     profoundly broken. The H-2A status quo is slow, bureaucratic, \n     and inflexible. The program is complicated and legalistic. \n     DOL's compliance manual alone is over 300 pages. The current \n     H-2A process is so expensive and hard to use, it places only \n     about 30,000-50,000 legal guest workers a year--2 percent to \n     3 percent of the total ag work force. A General Accounting \n     Office study found DOL missing statutory deadlines for \n     processing employer applications to participate in H-2A more \n     than 40 percent of the time. Worker advocates have expressed \n     concerns that enforcement is inadequate.\n\n\n                      The Solution--AgJOBS Reforms\n\n       AgJOBS legislation provides a two-step approach to a \n     stable, legal, safe, ag work force: (1) Streamlining and \n     expanding the H-2A legal, temporary, guest worker program, \n     and making it more affordable and used more--the long-term \n     solution, which will take time to implement; (2) Outside the \n     H-2A program, a one-time adjustment to legal status for \n     experienced farm workers, already working here, who currently \n     lack legal documentation--the bridge to allow American \n     agriculture to adjust to a changing economy.\n       H-2A Reforms: Currently, when enough domestic farm workers \n     are not available for upcoming work, growers are required to \n     go through a lengthy, complicated, expensive, and uncertain \n     process of demonstrating that fact to the satisfaction of the \n     Federal government. They are then allowed to arrange for the \n     hiring of legal, temporary, non-immigrant guest workers. \n     These guest workers are registered with the U.S. government \n     to work with specific employers and return to their home \n     countries when the work is done. Needed reforms would replace \n     the current quagmire for qualifying employers and prospective \n     workers with a streamlined ``attestation'' process like the \n     one now used for H-1B high-tech workers, speeding up \n     certification of H-2A employers and the hiring of legal guest \n     workers. Participating employers would continue to provide \n     for the housing and transportation needs of H-2A workers. New \n     adjustments to the Adverse Effect Wage Rate would be \n     suspended during a 3-year period pending extensive study of \n     its impact and alternatives. Other current H-2A labor \n     protections for both H-2A and domestic workers would be \n     continued. H-2A workers would have new rights to seek redress \n     through mediation and Federal court enforcement of specific \n     rights. Growers would be protected from frivolous claims, \n     exorbitant damages, and duplicative contract claims in State \n     courts.\n       The only experience our country has had with a broadly-used \n     farm guest worker program (used widely in the 1950s but \n     repealed in the 1960s) demonstrated conclusive, and \n     instructive, results. While it was criticized on other \n     grounds, it dramatically reduced illegal immigration while \n     meeting labor market needs.\n\n\n                 Adjustment of workers to legal status\n\n       To provide a ``bridge'' to stabilize the ag work force \n     while H-2A reforms are being implemented, AgJOBS would create \n     a new earned adjustment program, in which farm workers \n     already here, but working without legal authorization, could \n     earn adjustment to legal status. To qualify, an incumbent \n     worker must have worked in the United States in agriculture, \n     before January 1, 2005, for at least 100 days in a 12-month \n     period over the last 18 months prior to the bill's \n     introduction. (The average migrant farm worker works 120 days \n     a year.)\n       This would not spur new immigration, because adjustment \n     would be limited to incumbent, trusted farm workers with a \n     significant work history in U.S. agriculture. The adjusting \n     worker would have non-immigrant, but legal, status. \n     Adjustment would not be complete until a worker completes a \n     substantial work requirement in agriculture (at least 360 \n     days over the next 3-6 years, including 240 days in the first \n     3 years).\n       Approximately 500,000 workers would be eligible to apply \n     (based on current workforce estimates). Their spouses and \n     minor children would be given limited rights to stay in the \n     U.S., protected from deportation. The worker would have to \n     verify compliance with the law and continue to report his or \n     her work history to the government. Upon completion of \n     adjustment, the worker would be eligible for legal permanent \n     resident status. Considering the time elapsed from when a \n     worker first applies to enter the adjustment process, this \n     gives adjusting workers no advantage over regular immigrants \n     beginning the legal immigration process at the same time.\n       AgJOBS would not create an amnesty program. Neither would \n     it require anything unduly onerous of workers. Eligible \n     workers who are already in the United States could continue \n     to work in agriculture, but now could do so legally, and \n     prospectively earn adjustment to legal status. Adjusting \n     workers may also work in another industry, as long as the \n     agriculture work requirement is satisfied.\n\n\n                    AgJOBS is a Win-Win-Win approach\n\n       Workers would be better off than under the status quo. \n     Legal guest workers in the H-2A program need the assurance \n     that government red tape won't eliminate their jobs. For \n     workers not now in the H-2A program, every farmworker who \n     gains legal status finally will be able to assert legal \n     protection--which leads to higher wages, better working \n     conditions, and safer travel. Growers and workers would get a \n     stable, legal work force. Consumers would get better \n     assurance of a safe, stable, American-grown, food supply--not \n     an increased dependence on imported food. Law-abiding \n     Americans want to make sure the legal right to stay in our \n     country is earned, and that illegal behavior is not rewarded \n     now or encouraged in the future. Border and homeland security \n     would be improved by bringing workers out of the underground \n     economy and registering them with the AgJOBS adjustment \n     program. Overall, AgJOBS takes a balanced approach, and would \n     work to benefit everyone.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of 2005--\n     Overview and Summary of Significant Provisions, February 2005\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       The Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security \n     Act of 2005 is, in all substantive essentials, the same as S. \n     1645, which attracted 63 Senate cosponsors in the 108th \n     Congress.\n\n\ntitle i--adjustment of agricultural workers to temporary and permanent \n                            resident status\n\n       Title I establishes a program whereby agricultural workers \n     in the United States who lack authorized immigration status \n     but who can demonstrate that they have worked 100 or more \n     days in a 12 consecutive month period during the 18-month \n     period ending on December 31, 2004 can apply for adjustment \n     of status. Eligible applicants would be granted temporary \n     resident status. If the farmworker performs at least 360 work \n     days (no less than 2,060 hours) of agricultural employment \n     during the six-year period after the date of enactment, \n     including at least 240 work days (no less than 1,380 hours) \n     during the first three years following adjustment, and at \n     least 75 days (no less than 430 hours) of agricultural work \n     during each of three 12-month periods in the six years \n     following adjustment to temporary resident status, the \n     farmworker may apply for permanent resident status.\n       During the period of temporary resident status the \n     farmworker is employment authorized, and can travel abroad \n     and reenter the United States. Workers adjusting to temporary \n     resident status may work in non-agricultural occupations, as \n     long as their agricultural work requirements are met. While \n     in temporary resident status, workers may select their \n     employers and may switch employers. During the period of \n     temporary resident status, the farmworker's spouse and minor \n     children who are residing in the United States may remain in \n     the U.S., but are not employment authorized. The spouse and \n     minor children may adjust to permanent resident status once \n     the farmworker adjusts to permanent resident status. \n     Unauthorized workers who do not apply or are not qualified \n     for adjustment to temporary resident status are subject to \n     removal. Temporary residents under this program who do not \n     fulfill the agricultural work requirement or are inadmissible \n     under immigration law or commit a felony or three or more \n     misdemeanors as temporary residents are denied adjustment to \n     permanent resident status and are subject to removal. The \n     adjustment program is funded through application fees.\n\n\n     titles ii and iii--reform of the h-2a temporary and seasonal \n                      agricultural worker program\n\n       This section modifies the existing H-2A temporary and \n     seasonal foreign agricultural worker program. Employers \n     desiring to employ H-2A foreign workers in seasonal jobs (10 \n     months or less) will file an application and a job offer with \n     the Secretary of Labor. If the application and job offer meet \n     the requirements of the program and there are no obvious \n     deficiencies the Secretary must approve the application. \n     Employers must seek to employ qualified U.S. workers prior to \n     the arrival of H-2A foreign workers by filing a job order \n     with a local job service office at least 28 days prior to \n     date of need and also authorizing the posting of the job on \n     an electronic job registry.\n       All workers in job opportunities covered by an H-2A \n     application must be provided with workers' compensation \n     insurance, and no job may be filled by an H-2A worker that is \n     vacant because the previous occupant is on strike or involved \n     in a labor dispute. If the job is covered by a collective \n     bargaining agreement, the employer must also notify the \n     bargaining agent of the filing of the application. If the job \n     opportunity is not covered by a collective bargaining \n     agreement, the employer is required to provide additional \n     benefits, as follows.\n       The employer must provide housing at no cost, or a monetary \n     housing allowance where\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\n     the Governor of a State has determined that there is \n     sufficient migrant housing available, to workers whose place \n     of residence is beyond normal commuting distance. The \n     employer must also reimburse inbound and return \n     transportation costs to workers who meet employment \n     requirements and who travel more than 100 miles to come to \n     work for the employer. The employer must also guarantee \n     employment for at least three quarters of the period of \n     employment, and assure at least the highest of the applicable \n     statutory minimum wage, the prevailing wage in the occupation \n     and area of intended employment, or a reformed Adverse Effect \n     Wage Rate (AEWR). If the AEWR applies, it will not be higher \n     than that existing on January 1, 2003 and if Congress fails \n     to enact a new wage rate within 3 years, the AEWR would be \n     indexed to changes in the consumer price index, capped at 4 \n     percent per year, with increases applied beginning the first \n     March 1 following three years from the date of enactment. \n     Employers must meet specific motor vehicle safety standards.\n       H-2A foreign workers are admitted for the duration of the \n     initial job, not to exceed 10 months, and may extend their \n     stay if recruited for additional seasonal jobs, to a maximum \n     continuous stay of 3 years, after which the H-2A foreign \n     worker must depart the United States. H-2A foreign workers \n     are authorized to be employed only in the job opportunity and \n     by the employer for which they were admitted. Workers who \n     abandon their employment or are terminated for cause must be \n     reported by the employer, and are subject to removal. H-2A \n     foreign workers are provided with a counterfeit resistant \n     identity and employment authorization document.\n       The Secretary of Labor is required to provide a process for \n     filing, investigating and disposing of complaints, and may \n     order back wages and civil money penalties for program \n     violators. The Secretary of Homeland Security may order \n     debarment of violators for up to 2 years. H-2A workers are \n     provided with a limited federal private right of action to \n     enforce the requirements of housing, transportation, wages, \n     the employment guarantee, motor vehicle safety, retaliation \n     and any other written promises in the employer's job offer. \n     Either party may request mediation after the filing of the \n     complaint. State contract claims seeking to enforce terms of \n     the H-2A program are preempted by the limited Federal right \n     of action. No other state law rights are preempted or \n     restricted.\n       The administration of the H-2A program is funded through a \n     user fee paid by agricultural employers.\n\n\n           technical adjustments made in the 2005 agjobs bill\n\n       Several technical adjustments have been made to update or \n     clarify provisions, relative to the predecessor bill \n     introduced in 2003 (S. 1645). They include the following:\n       Relevant dates associated with H-2A and earned adjustment \n     provisions have been updated to reflect the passage of time \n     since the original bill's introduction. Affected provisions \n     remain substantively equivalent. The AEWR in 2009 and \n     thereafter would be the same as if the 2003 bill (S. 1645) \n     had been enacted in 2003.\n       Time frames associated with the H-2A adverse effect wage \n     rate and study, and future work requirements under the earned \n     adjustment program, have been modified from ``hard dates'' to \n     fixed time periods after date of enactment to ensure that the \n     effect of the provisions remains constant regardless of \n     timing of enactment.\n       Language regarding eligibility for adjustment or grounds \n     for removal for various acts has been added to clarify that \n     the spouse or minor children of an alien applying for or \n     working under temporary residency are held to the same strict \n     standards for lawful behavior, and are excludable or \n     deportable under the same standards that apply to the alien \n     worker.\n       New language clarifies that the bill does not limit the use \n     or release of information contained in files or records of \n     the Department of Homeland Security regarding criminal \n     convictions or other information for immigration enforcement \n     or law enforcement purposes.\n       Clarifying language has been added to conform with the \n     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity (Welfare Reform) \n     Act of 1996, to ensure that adjusting AgJOBS workers have no \n     advantage over other, legal immigrants, with regard to the \n     timing and eligibility of means-tested public benefits.\n       Technical clarifications have been made to carry out the \n     authors' original intent only to authorize appropriations, \n     not create or imply mandatory spending, to administer the \n     Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1712-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1712-S1714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CARDINAL THEODORE McCARRICK\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the end of last year, Marcelle \nand I attended an event at Georgetown University where Cardinal \nTheodore McCarrick was awarded a honorary degree.\n  Everyone present at this ceremony was captured by the remarks that \nthe archbishop gave in accepting the degree. He artfully wove us \nthrough three ``stories'' to demonstrate the importance of a Catholic \nuniversity in the Jesuit tradition.\n  So that all of my colleagues have an opportunity to review the \nremarks of Cardinal McCarrick, and because of the admiration I have for \nhim, I ask that his acceptance speech at the award of his honorary \ndegree from Georgetown University be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Remarks by Theodore Cardinal McCarrick, D.D., Ph.D., Archbishop of \n    Washington, on the Occasion of His Receiving a Honorary Degree, \n                Georgetown University, December 1, 2004\n\n       As Father Brian [McDermott] was reading those wonderful \n     words and as the president repeated them, I thought of the \n     wonderful Jewish expression, ``From your mouth to God's \n     ears.'' I just hope the Lord doesn't get mad that you said \n     all those nice things about me. Dr. President, Dr. Villani, \n     Chairman of the Board, members of the board, Your Excellency, \n     The Apostolic Nuncio [Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo] and my \n     brother bishops, my--I guess I should say my Georgetown \n     family now--and I say that with great joy.\n       I want to begin by telling you sincerely how honored I am \n     in receiving this degree from Georgetown. I've long regarded \n     this institution as one of the finest educational \n     institutions in the United States. During my four years in \n     Washington, I've always felt part of it in a very special \n     way. To receive its degree now is a very special joy for me, \n     and I want you all to know how much I do appreciate it.\n       I have tremendous respect for your president, Dr. DeGioia. \n     I was privileged to be present at his inauguration, and to \n     prophesy at that time that he would lead this institution to \n     greater heights of excellence and to a continuing growth in \n     the realization of its mission as a Catholic university in \n     the Jesuit tradition. My prophecy is coming true every day.\n       My respect for the Society of Jesus goes back to my early \n     years of high school when I admired the Jesuits so much that \n     I found myself going to two of their high schools, not at the \n     same time, but one after the other until I finally got it \n     right and received my diploma. My own education in high \n     school and college has been much enhanced by the excellence \n     of the ratio studiorum and by its challenges. It has been an \n     education for which I am so very grateful, and through which \n     I have been so very blessed. As a matter of fact, since the \n     rector of Georgetown is my personal theologian, I'm still \n     learning from the Society and appreciating that wisdom and \n     insight so very much.\n       My relationship to Georgetown, as I began to intermit a \n     moment ago, is not of a visitor in a Catholic institution. \n     The local bishop is always part of any enterprise which is \n     related to the Church. A university such as ours is clearly \n     one of the great boasts and glories of our Catholic community \n     here in Washington. I have been here many times during the \n     last four years. I've enjoyed that privilege. I've been here \n     for academic celebrations, for lectures, for interfaith \n     moments of prayer, at times of national crisis, for meetings \n     with students, and often for Mass in your chapels. In the \n     beginning, I was happy to be welcomed by all of you at the \n     University. Now I no longer see myself just as a welcomed \n     visitor, but as part of the family. It is therefore always \n     a joy when I hear someone say instead of ``Welcome to the \n     University,'' ``It's nice to have you back.''\n       Georgetown University, in its stated mission, sees itself \n     truly and essentially as a Catholic institution in the Jesuit \n     tradition. That fact opens its life to many wonderful \n     challenges and many great opportunities. It is a place where \n     Catholic scholars may freely exercise a faithful witness to \n     what the Church teaches. It is a place where non-Catholic \n     scholars and professors, who add so much to the life of this \n     institution, can pursue their own fields of study with the \n     assurance that truth is the master here, and that its pursuit \n     is always welcome. Their understanding of the mission of this \n     institution adds so much to society's understanding of what \n     Georgetown is all about. I pray that those who are not \n     Catholic, both in the faculty and the student body, will \n     always find inspiration an example from the Catholics who \n     teach here, both cleric and lay, as well as a deeper \n     understanding of what we're all about, and what our mission \n     is--not just in the Church but in society and in the world at \n     large.\n       The preparation of Catholic leaders for the future of our \n     nation is a noble role. The preparation of those who are not \n     Catholic in their own burgeoning opportunity to play roles of \n     leadership in our country, has an equal importance because it \n     enables the leaders of tomorrow to learn about us, about the \n     Church, and to appreciate our own Catholic mission in this \n     complex society. This has always been one of the great roles \n     of the Society of Jesus, and I pray it will continue always \n     to be so here at Georgetown. May those of the immediate \n     family always be challenged to holiness, and those of the \n     wider family allowed to see what our life in the Lord and in \n     His church is all about. In the religious life of the \n     students and faculty at Georgetown, may there always be this \n     quest for holiness since this has to be the role within any \n     Catholic institution. The example of the Jesuits, according \n     to the rule of the great Ignatius, must always be a \n     challenge, not just to holiness of life, but to priests in \n     religious vocations both for the Society and for the Diocesan \n     in priesthood, and for religious life as well. I always \n     rejoice\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\n     in a special way to find graduates of Georgetown hearing the \n     Lord's call to service in priestly and religious ministry. \n     This, too, is a measure of our Catholic life and of our deep \n     Jesuit tradition.\n       I want to speak briefly tonight about the global importance \n     or the international aspect of a Catholic university in the \n     Jesuit tradition. Basically, there are three points I want to \n     make. First is that the mark of every great university is \n     caring. The mark of every great Catholic university is \n     wonder. The mark of every great Catholic university in the \n     Jesuit tradition is adventure.\n       The first, caring, demands that there be a background of \n     authentic humanism in the very nature and mission of every \n     university, a sense of caring. A great university such as \n     Georgetown is called to manifest this in a world that tends \n     so much to be mechanistic and ideological. Secondly, the role \n     of a Catholic university demands a sense of wonder, of \n     mystery, and appreciation that everything in this world is \n     not able to be subjected to positivistic criteria. We believe \n     that there is a reality beyond the mere material that calls \n     for recognition of the spiritual, the wonderful. And finally, \n     the Jesuit tradition of this institution calls for it to be \n     adventurous, innovative, inventive in the deepest sense. I \n     believe the young people of today would say with great \n     solemnity, the ability to think outside the box.\n       I would like briefly to develop these three points by three \n     stories. They are stories which have made a difference in my \n     life. They are perhaps three stories that have been my \n     instruction in where I am today. The first, the one which we \n     can call the humanistic, the caring, takes place in Africa, \n     and challenges us to understand the deep relationship which \n     each of us has with every other human being on the planet, \n     reminding us that we are all brothers and sisters in God's \n     one human family. The second which takes place in Asia, and \n     which is the only one that I relate second hand, is a story \n     that reminds us of the need for wonder in every Catholic \n     life. And finally, the story of an extraordinary Catholic \n     educator, who is a Jesuit, a story from Eastern Europe, \n     will bring us out of the box. Let me tell you these three \n     stories.\n       Years ago when I was a young bishop, I was sent on a \n     mission to the Sudan for Catholic Relief Services. I tell \n     this story because I think it is a big moment in my own life \n     and has made a change. I see in my growth what may affect the \n     university and its life. I was fascinated by the Sudan. I had \n     never been in that part of Africa. I met priests. I met \n     bishops. I met Muslim leaders. I met the poor. One day, one \n     of the priests said, ``If you have half a day, we'll go \n     across the Nile and go beyond Umderman.'' (Umderman, if you \n     used to go to the old movies is where Kitchener had that \n     great battle and Lord Gordon was killed.) So I said, \n     ``Sure.'' We went across the Nile, which itself is a great \n     experience, got to the other side and said, ``What are we \n     going to see?'' He said, ``No, we're not going to stop \n     here.'' We went about 25 more miles west into the desert. \n     There, after the city of Umderman had long since passed, we \n     saw a huge city of tents. We went in to see some of the \n     families, and translated, I heard several things.\n       We're all members of God's one human family, but I never \n     saw it more clearly than there. These were the people, \n     probably some from Dafur, but this is 20 years ago, who when \n     the drought came and there was no water, could not do any \n     farming, could not take care of their flock. So they gathered \n     up their families and went toward the river, the Nile, where \n     water will always be. Now they couldn't get to the Nile. They \n     had to stop 25 miles away because they were not allowed to go \n     there. They would have overwhelmed, so the government said, \n     the facilities. And so they stayed there, and every day they \n     paid some entrepreneurs who drove little trucks to the Nile, \n     filled them up with water, and then came back. Of course, \n     they didn't come back for free. And gradually, these people \n     paid all the money that they had with them until it was gone. \n     And after the money was gone, they began to sell their \n     furniture. And after their furniture was gone, they began to \n     sell their animals. And after their animals were gone, they \n     began to sell their children.\n       Listening to the families, for whom the sacrifice of an \n     older child had to be made so that younger children could \n     survive, it is a story that is engrained in my heart because \n     I think that it showed me that all life has to have caring in \n     it. All life has to have a sense of who we are as God's \n     people. A university has to have that, any university, \n     because if we are training people without understanding that \n     we are all related, that we're all one family, then we are \n     training them for a world that does not exist. That's the \n     first lesson. A university must be involved in caring and in \n     showing people how to care. I think Georgetown is.\n       The second story happened in East Timor. I had gone to East \n     Timor for some other reason, and it was maybe three months \n     after the elections, and two months or one month after the \n     whole country had been in a state of terrible turmoil, and \n     those who did not want East Timor to be free began to kill \n     all the leaders. Anyone who taught in school, anyone who had \n     a good job, anyone who had any kind of an education was a \n     target for these militias.\n       The Catholic Church had been very important to these \n     people. Eighty-five percent of the people had been Catholic, \n     surprisingly, in one of these small islands of Indonesia. A \n     great bishop, Bishop Belo, who won the Nobel Prize, was \n     guarding the flock and taking care of them all. One day I \n     went to visit him. I went to visit him in the charred ruins \n     of his house, and then they told me the story.\n       About a week before, there had been marauding bands, always \n     armed and always dangerous and violent. The people began to \n     become afraid. The bishop's house was a place with a large \n     lawn. The people came into the lawn trying to seek protection \n     from him who was a leader and from being together. Maybe \n     1,000 people were gathered there in the lawn, and the bishop \n     came out and began to talk to them. While they were there, \n     suddenly a band of militia came in with their guns, pushing \n     the people aside, pushing the bishop aside. We heard all \n     kinds of different things that may have been said, but \n     ultimately they lit a fire and threw it in the bishop's \n     house. The bishop went to try to save it, but he was held \n     back. The people were awed, and scared, and afraid to do \n     anything. While the bishop was watching the destruction of \n     his house, and while the people in desperate fear were \n     just standing around, a young man came out of the crowd. \n     It was dark except for the flames. He went to the bishop, \n     tried to move him away from the flames. A soldier came up, \n     pushed the young man away, and stuck his gun in the \n     bishop's back, and got ready to pull the trigger. There \n     was a hush, and almost a scream at the same time among the \n     people. The young man came back and gently pushed the \n     bishop forward and stood behind him, between the gun and \n     the bishop and did not move. The man with the gun didn't \n     know what to do, and there was silence. Where did this \n     fellow come from, this young man? Nobody knew him. But \n     somehow he found courage that nobody else had. Somehow he \n     found an ability to, in a world full of violence and \n     anger, he found a sense of wonder and mystery. The man \n     with the gun became embarrassed because he didn't know \n     what to do. So, he hit the young man, pulled his gun back, \n     and walked back to the soldiers. The moment was enough to \n     break the tension, so the militia left. The bishop turned \n     around to thank the young man. He wasn't there anymore. He \n     had disappeared into the crowd.\n       I thought, there is a sense of wonder and mystery in your \n     life when people find courage to do things that one would \n     never expect, when people find the ability to stand up for \n     something that they believe, even if it threatens their life \n     or everything they have. A Catholic university has to prepare \n     people for that. A Catholic university has to somehow enhance \n     in every human being that sense of wonder, that sense of \n     mystery, that sense that you can do what you never thought \n     you could do. You can rise above yourself, and your spirit \n     can be enflamed, and enhanced by the needs that you see in \n     your brothers. A university that is truly Catholic, has to \n     pass that lesson along. I think Georgetown does.\n       The third and last story is a different kind of story. It's \n     a story of a Jesuit; an extraordinary Jesuit. In Slovakia, at \n     the time of the communist persecution, only a certain number \n     of priests were allowed to be ordained. To ordain outside \n     that number, the bishop would be thrown into prison and the \n     priest as well. There was a young Jesuit who had commissioned \n     to be a priest called Jan Chryzostom Korec. Korec was \n     ordained at maybe 26 years-old, and began to serve as a \n     priest. The Jesuit provincial of Slovakia who was living in \n     disguise and living underground as so many were, came to see \n     him one day. He said, ``Father Korec, Bishop Hnilica--who was \n     an underground bishop--has permission to consecrate you a \n     bishop. And we feel that you should accept.'' Well, this is a \n     man now 27 years old, but unless somebody accepted this \n     burden, the Church could disappear. So ultimately he said, \n     ``Yes, I will do whatever you think is right.'' So, in the \n     kitchen of a friend the next night, he was consecrated a \n     bishop. Then he once again disappeared and continued to work \n     as a priest.\n       About six months later, the provincial came to him again \n     and said, ``Korec, we have a man now who is ready to be \n     ordained a priest, a man of the Society. Will you ordain \n     him?'' He said, ``Okay.'' and he ordained the young man in a \n     park at twilight. Unfortunately, the young man was not as \n     careful as he should have been, and the authorities found out \n     that he was a priest. They brought him in and they began to \n     put him under all kinds of tortures and difficulties. \n     Finally, he said, ``I was ordained a priest quietly, \n     secretly.'' And they said, ``Who did it?'' After more \n     torture, he said, ``Korec.'' So they went and called Korec \n     in, and they said, ``Are you a bishop?'' Without going into \n     any kind of Jesuitical subtleties, he said, ``Me, a bishop, \n     that's the silliest thing I've ever heard!'' He kept saying \n     that and they let him go. He didn't look like a bishop. Well, \n     six months later, the provincial came back and he said, ``We \n     have another man. Will you ordain him?'' Korec ordained him \n     in somebody's living room. And this man, too, unfortunately, \n     after some months was caught, brought in, tortured, revealed \n     Korec, and so then they had him. They sent him away to prison \n     in solitary confinement. He was there 18 years. And then \n     finally in the Prague spring, they allowed him to come out \n     and to work. They gave him a job working in a chemical \n     factory, unpacking chemical things and spillage: a very \n     dangerous job. He did it quietly. Now he no longer had the \n     right to be a priest, so they gave him these other jobs. \n     He's an interesting man, and gradually people looked for \n     him. Gradually, he began quietly to be a priest again. \n     They weren't\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\n     sure of him, so the lamp in his one-room bedroom apartment \n     was wired. They listened to all of his conversations.\n       He has wonderful stories to tell about playing the radio so \n     loud that the neighbors complained, but at least he could \n     have conversations then. Gradually, he began to do things \n     that no one else has been able to do. When the iron curtain \n     fell, he was acknowledged as a bishop. He went down to see \n     the Holy Father. The Holy Father told him that he was to be \n     given given the Diocese of Nitra, which is the diocese of St. \n     Methodius, of the great Sts. Cyril and Methodisum, one of \n     those great wonderful sees.\n       About two years after that I was in Slovakia and I was \n     talking to one of the vice-presidents of the Slovak \n     parliament who was a Catholic. We were talking about those \n     tough days of the communist regime. And I said, ``How did you \n     ever get your education?'' He said, ``I went to the \n     university.'' I said, ``Which one?'' He said, ``I went to \n     Korec University.'' I said, ``What do you mean?'' He said, \n     ``Every Saturday when we had off--because they had to work on \n     Sunday. Every Saturday which was our day off, we'd pack some \n     salami and some beer and go up into the hills and Father \n     Korec would come. All day long, we would sit, and he would \n     teach us about the Church, about Catholic Social Thought, \n     about philosophy, about theology.'' And this man said to me, \n     ``I know more about these things than if I had gone to the \n     university for four years because we never missed a Saturday. \n     Dozens of us would go. He would write on pieces of paper what \n     we had to know, and he would make 50 copies all in his own \n     handwriting.'' I've seen them.\n       To be adventurous. To be inventive. Not to let the world \n     make it impossible for you to grow, and live, and enjoy. \n     Always to listen to that other voice that says you can do it: \n     find a way. I think that's the mark of a Jesuit tradition, \n     and I think we find it here at Georgetown.\n       I've kept you too long with these stories of mine, but I \n     feel that a story, like a picture, is worth a thousand words. \n     These stories, as I said at the beginning, have moved me, \n     maybe hopefully a little further in my understanding of what \n     education is. Maybe it will give us all an understanding of \n     what I mean when I say a great Catholic university in the \n     Jesuit tradition has to be.\n       Every university should teach its students and its faculty \n     and administration that we live in a world of brothers and \n     sisters, not as strangers and enemies, but that we all share \n     a common dignity, and that all lives are precious, everyone's \n     life. Secondly, to be truly Catholic, we must be open to \n     wonder, to mystery, the mysteries of our faith, the mysteries \n     of love, the mysteries even of science which will always be \n     searching for greater clarity. As Catholics, we must never be \n     afraid of mystery, of that wonder that causes us to do things \n     we never thought we could do. Our faith is built on mystery, \n     and to be truly wise, and truly educated, we must be men and \n     women who accept wonder as an essential element of our \n     existence. And finally, in the story of Cardinal Korec (who \n     ultimately became a cardinal), we are challenged to see what \n     a university can also be when circumstances and the \n     challenges of the world around us call us all to find in \n     different ways the great things that are essential for our \n     lives and vital for our growth and wisdom. I find these \n     things here at Georgetown. I pray that they always will be \n     here. I pray, too, that these elements of deep human concern \n     of wonder and adventure, may be even more developed, more \n     understood and embraced, under great leadership with great \n     men and women in a brilliant future which will always be part \n     mystery and even always part out of the box. Thank you very \n     much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1714-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LYLE RYMER II\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today, I would like to rise and \npay tribute to the life of Army Specialist Lyle Rymer II. Lyle Rymer \nwas the type of person his family and friends knew they could always \nrely upon. Despite his easygoing nature and quiet demeanor, he was a \ngo-getter who always did more than was asked or expected of him. He was \na loving husband and proud father who devoted himself to his family and \ntheir well-being. He was also a brave soldier with a devotion to his \ncountry, who died a hero while protecting his fellow soldiers.\n  As the youngest of three children, Specialist Rymer was born and \nspent his early childhood in Fort Smith, AR. He was a shy kid but had a \ngift for making others laugh and was always quick to make friends. In \nmany ways, he was a typical teenager, who enjoyed hanging out with his \nfriends, with whom he shared a love for fishing and hotrods. He was a \nhard-working student who went to high school in Roland, OK, a small \ntown just 5 miles west of Fort Smith. Although he studied small engines \nat a vocational tech school half a day during his junior and senior \nyears, he remained focused on getting his high school diploma on time, \nwith his friends and with his class. In 1999, he did just that.\n  Following high school, Specialist Rymer worked construction and later \njoined the Arkansas Army National Guard. His grandfather had retired \nfrom the Air Force, and he began considering enrolling in airborne \nschool or making a career out of the Army. He was proud to serve his \ncountry but, more importantly, he wanted to make a better life for him \nand his family; his wife LaTisha and son Sean.\n  March of last year brought a welcome addition to the Rymers: a baby \ndaughter Jasmine. What should have been a joyous time for the family \nproved to be bittersweet. Just as Jasmine was born into the world, her \nfather was on a plane heading for Kuwait and service in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  Specialist Rymer was assigned to the National Guard's 239th \nEngineering Company under the 39th Infantry Brigade, based out of \nBoonesville. Although he was a world away, he was proud to serve in \nIraq with the 39th, a Brigade made up of 4,200 soldiers, including over \n3,000 Arkansans. He also found comfort in the regular conversations he \nhad with his family, usually on the weekends, when he could check on \ntheir welfare and let them know about the experience he was having.\n  In November, Specialist Rymer was granted a 2-week leave and returned \nhome. It gave him a chance to visit with family and friends, spend time \nwith LaTisha and Sean, but also to see his beautiful baby daughter, \nJasmine, for the very first time. He would cherish this all too short \ntime with his loved ones and, upon his return to Iraq, made sure to \ntell his fellow soldiers just how proud he was of the family that was \nawaiting his return.\n  The 239th, in which Specialist Rymer served as a heavy equipment \noperator, would play a vital role in American efforts to bring security \nand stability throughout Baghdad, completing more than 1,800 missions \nin the area. In spite of the dangerous environment and stressful \nconditions he and his comrades often worked under, Specialist Rymer \nalways found a way to brighten a mood and bring smiles to their faces. \nHe grew to love the soldiers he served with, and they loved him in \nreturn. As often happens in times of war, many of these soldiers, \nserving thousands of miles from home, began to consider themselves much \nmore than fellow soldiers; they were a family and they would do \nabsolutely anything for each other.\n  Tragically, on January 28, a few short weeks before Specialist Rymer \nwas to return home, he was killed in action. The 239th was securing an \narea near a Central Baghdad marketplace in preparation for the upcoming \nIraqi National elections. Specialist Rymer was guarding the members of \nhis unit as they were helping place concrete traffic barriers. He was \nstruck and killed by a single bullet from a nearby sniper.\n  The loss of this special young man, the first fatality for the 239th, \nwas felt deeply by the troops who served with him. To honor Specialist \nRymer, over 150 of them attended a memorial service at their brigade's \nchapel on base, just north of Baghdad. At the service, they all raised \ntheir right hands in salute to their fallen comrade, whom they loved \nand respected, and who gave his life in the protection of theirs. The \ncompany commander, CPT Jason Meharg, echoed the unspoken sentiment of \nhis troops, ``We'll refocus and continue . . . But we won't forget.''\n  Even more deeply, the loss of Specialist Rymer will be felt by the \nfamily and the many friends he leaves behind. On February 7 at the Fort \nSmith National Cemetery, over 100 people showed up to his gravesite \nservice to pay respects and to honor this fallen hero.\n  To many of us, the awards Specialist Rymer earned for his service \nwill serve as a reminder of the courageous and selfless way in which he \nlived his life. To LaTisha, memories of the time shared with her \nhusband and the pride felt in the family they built together will \nremind her of so much more. Although Sean and Jasmine may not be able \nto fully comprehend the meaning of their father's sacrifice or realize \nthe impact he had on so many others, they will one day be old enough to \nunderstand, from the words of their mother and those who knew Lyle \nRymer best, just how very much he loved them.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the Rymer family and with all those \nwhose lives were touched by this special young man. We will be forever \ngrateful for his service and for the sacrifice he made on behalf of us \nall.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1715-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRIAN HOPPER\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today, I rise with a heavy heart \nto honor the life of a courageous young man from the State of Arkansas, \nand to pay tribute to the sacrifice he made on behalf of our way of \nlife. Brian Hopper lived his life with an energy, sense of adventure, \nand courage that we can all admire. These were the qualities he \ndisplayed throughout his childhood, playing and hunting in the woods \naround his home in northeast Arkansas. They were also the qualities \nthat ultimately drew him to military service, bravely defending freedom \nin a land he had never known.\n  Lance Corporal Hopper grew up just outside of the small Arkansas town \nof Wynne. Like other boys his age, he enjoyed growing up in the \ncountryside; spending his time in the woods and trails near his home. \nMuch of this time was spent with his hunting buddy, his father Rob, who \ntaught him how to shoot when he was six. Together, they could often be \nfound fishing or looking for deer, squirrels, and rabbits.\n  At Wynne High School, Lance Corporal Hopper was a member of the drama \nclub and the school's broadcast journalism class, where he helped with \nthe daily news program. He graduated in the Spring of 2002, and it was \nclear to friends and family that his next step would be enlistment in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps. Although he was turned down by Marine Corps \nrecruiters in Arkansas because of recent reconstructive knee surgery, \nthis resilient young man would not be detoured. Instead, he made the \ntrip to neighboring Mississippi and met with a new set of recruiters. \nHe never mentioned his knee surgery and was allowed to enlist in \nSeptember of 2002. He would go on to attend the School of Infantry in \nJanuary of 2003, where he trained to become a rifleman.\n  Lance Corporal Hopper made a brief trip home during Christmas of \n2003, following the completion of boot camp. It was quickly apparent to \nhis family that he not only matured physically, but he also spoke and \nacted differently. The young man they had watched grow up over the \nyears was now truly a marine, and his father couldn't have been more \nproud.\n  As a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Lance Corporal Hooper was \ndeployed to the war-torn nation last summer and quickly earned the \nreputation of a tough, loyal soldier who repeatedly rose above the call \nof duty. During military operations in Fallujah, he earned his first \nPurple Heart after taking on incoming fire. The flak jacket he was \nwearing saved him from serious injury, and possibly death. Soon after, \nhe earned yet another Purple Heart from much more severe wounds. After \nraiding an Iraqi home and shooting an armed insurgent, he was struck by \nan explosion from a fallen grenade that left shrapnel in his knee, leg, \narm, and face. Although his wounds were severe enough to have him \nairlifted to Germany, he chose to stay in Iraq with his unit. His \npersonal safety was an afterthought to the loyalty he had for his \ncomrades and the mission before them. Although he still carried pieces \nof shrapnel in him, he would carry on the fight. It was a testament to \nthe courage and the heart of this brave marine.\n  On January 26, he boarded a CH-53E helicopter on a routine mission to \nhelp guard the Syrian border for the Iraqi elections. Tragically, the \nhelicopter crashed amid severe weather conditions in western Iraq. All \n31 soldiers aboard were killed, and it was destined to become the \ndeadliest day of the war thus far for American forces.\n  Lance Corporal Hopper's brother, Patrick, who was also serving in \nIraq as a marine lance corporal, would accompany his brother's body on \nthat final flight home from Dover Air Force Base to Memphis. Emergency \nvehicles would shut down every intersection between Memphis and Wynne \nand allow the two brothers to return home to their family.\n  On the day of Lance Corporal Hopper's funeral, the State flag was \nflown at half-mast over the State Capitol in Little Rock. Along the 12-\nmile procession from the memorial service to Harris Chapel Cemetery, \nfriends, neighbors and mourners lined the streets to show their respect \nand to honor this fallen Arkansas hero. Many held American flags high, \nmany saluted, and others held their right hands over their heart.\n  At his final resting place, Lance Corporal Hopper was buried with \nfull military honors. It was just a short walk from the home and the \nwoods where he had spent his childhood, and it served as a reminder of \nhow very far he had come in his life. The courageous and honorable way \nin which he lived his 21 years is a testament to the kind of person he \nwas. When we think of Brian Hopper, we will think of this legacy, and \nwill be reminded of how we are forever grateful to this brave young man \nfor the sacrifice he made on behalf of freedom, and on behalf of us \nall. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, and to all \nthose who knew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1715-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1715-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/18/senate-section/article/S1715-4", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MEASURES REFERRED--THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2005\n\n  The following bill was read the first and the second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 418.

A bill to require the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget to issue guidance for, and provide oversight of, the \nmanagement of micropurchases made with Governmentwide commercial \npurchase cards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nRuss Feingold, to introduce the ``Purchase Card Waste Elimination Act \nof 2005,'' to help eliminate wasteful spending that can occur when the \nGovernment neglects to pay attention to where it makes its purchases.\n  Last year, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, now the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, explored the \nGovernment's use of purchase cards and we learned about ways to save an \nestimated $300 million annually through better management of purchase \ncards. Purchase cards are, in essence, credit cards that agencies give \nto its employees for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for \nthe Federal Government. In fact, under Federal acquisition law, \npurchase cards are the Government's preferred method for making what \nare known as ``micropurchases''--that is items costing $2,500 or less. \nAlthough Government employees spend billions of dollars with purchase \ncards each year, Federal agencies do very little to analyze the items \nobtained with purchase cards in an attempt to get a better price for \nthe Government.\n  The American people have the right to expect the Federal Government \nto spend their tax dollars carefully and wisely. While this is true at \nall times, it is never more so than today when the Government is \nrunning large budget deficits. The Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs has a special role to play in \nreducing wasteful spending, and I have made this role a priority at the \nCommittee. This legislation is one aspect of our committee's efforts to \nreduce waste, fraud and abuse in Government spending.\n  Purchase cards came into Federal Government-wide use in 1989. They \nallow Government employees to easily and efficiently purchase routine \nitems such as office supplies, computers and copying machines. While \nthey are generally used for small purchases, they accounted for more \nthan $16 billion in Federal spending in 2003. In 1994, they accounted \nfor only $1 billion.\n  This increase in use is good news because it means that more \nGovernment spending is being executed in an expeditious manner that \nreduces red tape and saves on administrative costs. At the same time, \nthe use of purchase cards should enable us to conduct comprehensive \nanalysis of how this $16 billion is spent and where. This information \ncould be analyzed and used to further reduce the Federal Government's \ncosts. At present, however, this is not being done.\n  Last year, Senator Feingold, Representative Schakowsky and I released \na report by the Government Accountability Office identifying missed \nopportunities for savings. According to that report the missed savings \nwere due to both a lack of training and a lack of management attention \nand oversight. According to GAO, too many purchase cardholders failed \nto obtain readily available discounts on purchase cards buys. Even \nwhere the Government and the vendor had negotiated a discounted price \nfor items through the General Services Administration schedules, \nFederal employees with purchase cards failed to take advantage of the \ndiscounted prices and their managers were completely unaware of those \nlost\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\nopportunities to save. One example of a repeated lost opportunity to \nsave was the Department of the Interior's purchases of printer toner \ncartridges. One GSA schedule vendor offered the toner for only $24.99. \nYet, of the Department's 791 toner cartridge purchases, only two were \nat or below that price. Some cartridges were purchased for $34.99, \nwhich is about 40 percent higher than the GSA schedule price.\n  In addition to failing to use available schedule prices, GAO found \nthat agencies failed to negotiate lower prices with vendors with whom \nthey frequently used purchase cards. In the private sector, most \ncompanies that use the same vendor for a lot of purchases would \nnegotiate some sort of volume discount. But before they would attempt \nto negotiate savings the company would first need to understand its \nspending patterns. Because Federal agencies lack a comprehensive \nunderstanding of where its employees are using Government purchase \ncards, Federal agencies are unable to replicate this practice.\n  At my request, GAO analyzed purchase card use at the six Federal \nagencies that account for 85 percent of Government purchase card usage. \nAs a result of that analysis, GAO estimated that $300 million per year \ncould be saved if agencies improved their purchase card buying \npractices.\n  Under our legislation, the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, \nwould direct agencies to better train their cardholders and more \neffectively analyze their spending data. It would also direct the GSA \nto increase its efforts to improve its efforts to secure discounts with \nvendors and provide agencies with more guidance to reduce wasteful \nspending.\n  The American people have the right to expect the Federal Government \nto spend their tax dollars wisely. I urge our colleagues to cosponsor \nand support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Jeffords, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 458. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto give States the option to create a program that allows individuals \nreceiving temporary assistance to needy families to obtain post-\nsecondary or longer duration vocational education; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Pathways to \nSelf-Sufficiency Act of 2003.'' I am pleased to be joined in \nintroducing this important legislation by my colleagues Senators \nBaucus, Bingaman, Jeffords and Rockefeller. \n  This legislation is based upon the highly esteemed Maine program \ncalled ``Parents as Scholars''. This program, which uses State \nMaintenance of Effort, MOE, dollars to pay TANF-like benefits to those \nparticipating in post-secondary education, is a proven success in my \nState and is a wonderful foundation for a national effort.\n  We all agree that the 1996 welfare reform effort changed the face of \nthis Nation's welfare system to focus it on work. To that end, I \nbelieve that this legislation bolsters the emphasis on ``work first''. \nLike many of my colleagues, I agree that the shift in the focus from \nwelfare to work was the right decision, and that work should be the top \npriority. However, for those TANF recipients who cannot find a good job \nthat will put them on the road toward financial independence, education \nmight well be the key to a successful future of self-sufficiency.\n  As we have seen in Maine, education has played a significant role in \nbreaking the cycle of welfare and has given parents the skills \nnecessary to find better paying jobs. And we all know that higher wages \nare the light at the end of the tunnel of public assistance.\n  ``The Pathways to Self-Sufficiency Act of 2005'' provides States with \nthe option to allow individuals receiving Federal TANF assistance to \nobtain post-secondary or vocational education. This legislation would \ngive States the ability to use Federal TANF dollars to give those who \nare participating in vocational or post-secondary education the same \nassistance as they would receive if they were working.\n  We all know that supports like income supplements, child care \nsubsidies, and transportation assistance among others, are essential to \na TANF recipient's ability to make a successful transition to work. The \nsame is true for those engaged in longer term educational endeavors. \nThis assistance is especially necessary for those who are undertaking \nthe challenge and the financial responsibility of post-secondary \neducation, in the hopes of increasing their earning potential and \nemployability. The goal of this program is to give participants the \ntools necessary to succeed into the future so that they can become, and \nremain, self-sufficient.\n  Choosing to go to college requires motivation, and graduating from \ncollege requires a great deal of commitment and work--even for someone \nwho isn't raising children and sustaining a family. These are \nsignificant challenges, and that's even before taking into \nconsideration the cost associated with obtaining a Bachelor's degree. \nThis legislation would provide those TANF recipients who have the \nability and the will to go to college the assistance they need to \nsustain their families while they get a degree.\n  The value of promoting access to education in this manner to get \npeople off public assistance is proven by the success of Maine's \n``Parents as Scholars'', PaS, program. Maine's PaS graduates earn a \nmedian wage of $11.71 per hour after graduation up from a median of \n$8.00 per hour prior to entering college. When compared to the $7.50 \nmedian hourly wage of welfare leavers in Maine who have not received a \npost-secondary degree, PaS graduates are earning, on average, $160 more \nper week. That translates into more than $8,000 per year--a significant \ndifference.\n  Furthermore, the median grade point average for PaS participants \nwhile in college was 3.4 percent, and a full 90 percent of PaS \nparticipants' GPA was over 3.0. These parents are giving their all to \npull their families out of the cycle of welfare.\n  Recognizing that work is a priority under TANF, and building upon the \nsuccessful Maine model, the ``Pathways to Self-Sufficiency Act'' \nrequires that participants in post-secondary and vocational education \nalso participate in work. During the first 2 years of their \nparticipation in these education programs, students must participate in \na combination of study time, employment or work experience for at least \n24 hours per week--the same hourly requirement that the President \nproposes in his welfare reauthorization proposal.\n  During the second 2 years--for those enrolled in a four year \nprogram--the participant must work at least 15 hours in addition to \nclass and study time, or engage in a combination activities, including \nstudy time work or work experience, and training, for an average of 30 \nhours per week. And all the while, participants must maintain \nsatisfactory academic progress as defined by their academic \ninstitution.\n  The bottom line is that if we expect parents to move from welfare to \nwork and stay in the work force, we must give them the tools to find \ngood jobs. For some people that means job training, for others that \ncould mean dealing with a barrier like substance abuse or domestic \nviolence, and for others, that might mean access to education that will \nsecure them a good job and that will get them off and, importantly, \nkeep them off of welfare.\n  The experience of several ``Parents as Scholar'' graduates were \ncaptured in a publication published by the Maine Equal Justice \nPartners, and their experiences are testament to the fact that this \nprogram is a critically important step in moving towards self-\nsufficiency. In this report one graduate said of her experience, ``If \nit weren't for `Parents as Scholars' I would never have been able to \nattend college, afford child care, or put food on the table. Today, I \nwould most likely be stuck in a low-wage job I hated barely getting by \n. . . I can now give my children the future they deserve.''\n  Another said, ``By earning my Bachelor's degree, I have become self-\nsufficient. I was a waitress previously and would never have been able \nto support my daughter. I would encourage anyone to better their \neducation if possible.''\n  These are but a few comments from those who have benefited from \naccess to post-secondary education. Giving States the option use \nFederal dollars to support these participants will make a tremendous \ndifference in their ability\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\nto sustain these programs which have proven results. In Maine, nearly \n90 percent of working graduates have left TANF permanently and isn't \nthat our ultimate goal?\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to include this \nlegislation in the upcoming welfare reauthorization. It is a critical \npiece of the effort to move people from welfare to work permanently and \nit has been missing from the federal program for too long.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Cochran):\n  S. 459. A bill to require a study and report regarding the \ndesignations and construction of a new interstate route from Savannah, \nGeorgia to Knoxville, Tennessee; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today we are introducing legislation, \ntwo bills that I hope will pave the way to correct a half a century of \ntransportation inequity in the Southern United States.\n  First, I am introducing a bill, supported by Senators Isakson, Lott, \nand Cochran, that proposes a new interstate highway, Interstate 14 or \n``I-14,'' linking Augusta, Macon and Columbus, GA connecting through \nMontgomery, AL and going all the way to Natchez, MS.\n  Second, my colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson and I are \nproposing the creation of Interstate 3 or ``I-3'', linking Savannah and \nAugusta, GA to Knoxville, TN.\n  In the 108th Congress, Senator Miller and I introduced these bills. \nIf passed, they would require the Secretary of Transportation to study \nand report to the appropriate committees of Congress, before December \n31, 2005, the steps and estimated funding necessary to designate and \nconstruct these new interstate highways.\n  These proposals are multi-purpose plans. They would naturally improve \nthe interconnectivity and highway safety for those in the Deep South. \nAlso, they would help provide the badly needed economic development to \nareas of the South ignored by our current interstate grid, and improve \nthe national defense highway linkage for which our interstate system \nwas originally designed. In addition, they could help provide critical \nenvironmental improvements for the entire Sunbelt region by reducing \nthe air pollution and traffic congestion in some of our major \ngridlocked southern cities.\n  The honorary name of the ``I-14'' plan helps to provide symbolic \nrecognition to the promise of economic parity to freed slaves which was \nimplied with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868. As the South \nstruggled to overcome four years of devastating war and find a way to \nintegrate the newly emancipated slaves into the full benefits of \ncitizenship, Congress passed this amendment, guaranteeing equal rights \nfor all Americans.\n  I am convinced that this area remains largely isolated from the \neconomic expansion that transformed much of the rest of the South \nstarting in the 60s. Many in this region still suffer from the lack of \neconomic parity with America. Eighty percent of jobs in America are \nlocated within 10 miles of an interstate. In this case, there are \nregions where there is no interstate. It is my hope that the addition \nof I-14 will help bring and provide the promising economic development \nand much needed jobs to this region.\n  The 3rd Infantry Division Highway Initiative Act is named for the \nU.S. Army 3rd Infantry Division of Fort Stewart--division that served \nas the ``Tip of the Spear'' in the War on Terror in Iraq and whose \nsoldiers conquered Najaf, seized Saddam International Airport and \nSaddam Hussein's palaces, and led the fighting on the day of Baghdad's \nhistoric liberation. The proposed route for ``I-3'' would provide a \nhighway link between strategic defense interests in our region \nincluding Fort Gordon, Eisenhower Army Regional Medical Center, the \nAugusta Veterans Administration Hospitals, Fort Stewart, Hunter Army \nAirfield, and the Port of Savannah among others. In the process, we \nwill provide long-needed North-South interstate access for Augusta, \nwhich happens to be Georgia's second largest city. It will also provide \na direct interstate link between Fort Gordon in Augusta and Fort \nStewart and Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, which would serve both \nfacilities well in warding off base closures now and in the future.\n  It may take a decade to bring these projects to full completion. They \nare not a quick or easy fix, however they are the necessary, equitable \nand common sense solution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 460. A bill to expand and enhance benefits for members of the \nArmed Forces and their families, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I recently returned from Iraq where I am \nproud to report that the men and women of the American military \ncontinue to perform magnificently. They are the best of America, and we \nowe them and their families a special debt of honor and gratitude.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to strengthen our military and \nenact a ``Military Family Bill of Rights.'' My hope is that Congress \nwill act quickly to build the military ready to meet the challenges of \nthis century. That requires a larger Army, a larger Marine Corps, and \nbetter policies for Americans in uniform and their families.\n  We must begin by building a military sized and shaped for the \nchallenges of the future. The military today, in particular the Army \nand the Marine Corps, is too small for the missions it faces. The \nevidence is everywhere.\n  In the past, the Army gave units 2 years to reset, re-train, and \nprepare between combat deployments. Instead the 3rd Infantry Division \nis headed back to Iraq after only one year. The 101st Airborne and the \n4th Infantry Divisions are headed back later this year after less than \n2 years. The First Marine Expeditionary Force is already in the middle \nof its second deployment to Iraq.\n  Even with this timetable, we have made ends meet only through large \ncontributions from the National Guard and Reserve. But in planning the \nnext rotation of U.S. forces, we are running out of Guard and Reserve \nunits to call on because they've already been deployed. Fourteen of the \nNational Guard's 15 most combat-ready units are either in Iraq now, \nrecently demobilized, or on alert for duty in the coming year. Of the \n205,000 Army Reservists, only about 37,000 remain available for \ndeployment for the types of missions needed in Iraq. Last year the Army \ndipped into the Individual Ready Reserve. More recently, the Army has \neven begun to call back military retirees, ranging in age from their \nmid-40s to their late 60s.\n  The situation is so grave that Lt. General James Helmly, chief of the \nArmy Reserve, recently warned that the reserves are ``rapidly \ndegenerating into a broken force''--and cautioned that at this rate we \nwill not be able to meet the needs of ``future missions.''\n  The war on terror--which we know requires a comprehensive approach--\nwill have a military component. Surprises happen and our armed forces \nmust be ready to meet those challenges, wherever and whenever they \noccur.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, every major commitment of American \nmilitary power, including the ``Air War'' in Kosovo, has required a \nsizeable commitment of American ground forces, at the very least to \nprovide post-conflict security and stability. There's no technological \nsubstitute for boots on the ground, and we must always plan for the \nworst, so we never expose our troops to the unintended consequences of \nwishful thinking.\n  The CIA's internal think-tank, the National Intelligence Council, \nrecently drew an important conclusion about conflict over the next 15 \nyears: ``Weak governments, lagging economies, religious extremism, and \nyouth bulges will align to create a perfect storm for internal conflict \nin certain regions.'' That's a warning about the danger of failed \nstates--and this should be a wake-up call for American strategy.\n  Failed states can become havens for terrorists. It was a failed state \nin Afghanistan that provided a training ground for al-Qaida. It was a \nfailed state where al-Qaida made its plans, grew its forces, and \nemerged to threaten our national security.\n  We need a comprehensive foreign policy strategy to deal with failed \nstates, but we must also have a military ready to act if necessary. For \nthe foreseeable future, the United States will need a\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\nlarger ground force. Failure to build one now will only diminish our \nnational security in the future.\n  The war in Iraq proved that a lightning-fast, high-tech force can \nsmash an opposing Army and drive to Baghdad in three weeks. But there \nis no substitute for a well-trained and equipped infantry to win the \npeace or secure a failed state. Those missions require an investment in \nthe men and women of the American military--to expand their number, and \nto increase the number of forces that specialize in certain skills.\n  To meet these needs, this legislation will expand the Active Duty \nArmy by 30,000 and the Marines by 10,000 personnel.\n  The men and women of the American military are sustained by the bonds \nthey share within their unit, and by the love and strength they draw \nfrom home--from their families, their spouses, their children, their \nparents. Military families are unsung heroes who receive neither medals \nnor parades--giving everything they can to the men and women they love, \nmen and women who have been called to war. They answered the call. And \nso must we--with a new commitment to smarter defense policies, like \nthose I outlined earlier, and better care for military families.\n  So the legislation I offer today also includes a Military Family Bill \nof Rights, a set of policies enshrined in law, to provide assistance to \nthe families of the American military.\n  Investing in military families isn't just an act of compassion--it's \na smart investment in America's military. Good commanders know that \nwhile you may recruit an individual soldier or Marine, you ``retain'' a \nfamily. Nearly 50 percent of America's service members are married \ntoday. If we want to retain our most experienced service members, \nespecially the non-commissioned officers that are the backbone of the \nArmy and Marine Corps, we have to keep faith with their families. If we \ndon't, and those experienced, enlisted leaders begin to leave, America \nwill have a broken, ``hollow'' military.\n\n  We can begin by increasing the financial support military families \nreceive. We can help them meet the increased expenses every military \nfamily faces when a loved-one is deployed. Thousands of reservists, for \nexample, take a cut in pay when called to active duty. Some employers \nmake up the difference in lost wages. We should reward those patriotic \nbusiness leaders. And since small businesses don't have the workforces \nthat make it possible to spread such costs, we should offer a Small \nBusiness Tax Credit to those who make up the difference between a \nreservist's civilian and military pay. This legislation would also \nestablish Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Grants to \nbuttress existing loan programs that help small-businesses survive when \na vital employee, or even the owner, is mobilized. It also creates the \nReservists Enterprise Transition and Sustainability Task Force to help \nsmall businesses prepare for and cope with the mobilization of \nreservist-employees and owners. For all service members, this \nlegislation permits penalty free withdrawals from Individual Retirement \nAccounts for deployment-related expenses, such as increased child-care \nand other costs.\n  As many as one-in-five members of the National Guard and Reserves \ndon't have health insurance. That is bad policy and bad for our \nnational security. When units are mobilized, they count on all their \npersonnel. But when a member of the National Guard or Reserve is \nmobilized, and unit members fail physicals because they haven't seen a \ndoctor in 2 years, that's bad for readiness and that's bad for unit \neffectiveness. As part of the Military Family Bill of Rights, we will \nextend military health insurance eligibility to all members of the \nNational Guard and Reserve, whether mobilized or not.\n  One of the unfortunate truths about war is that it takes lives--and \nmostly young lives. For their survivors, much of life remains, and we \nmust be generous in our efforts to help them put their lives back \ntogether. Almost a year ago, I proposed increasing the military's death \nbenefit to $250,000. When combined with the Servicemembers Group Life \nInsurance, a family would receive $500,000 when a loved-one dies in the \nservice of our nation. No one can ever put a price on a life, but we \nought to do what we can to help families coping with the worst of news. \nThe President recently embraced a formula to reach the $500,000 \nthreshold, and I'm glad he has joined this effort.\n  Our generosity must not stop there. At present, survivors of those \nkilled in action have 180 days to move out of military housing. But for \nthose with young children in school, 180 days may mean starting a \nschool year in one State, and finishing it in another. With all the \ndisruption the loss of a parent will bring to their lives, survivors \nshould have the flexibility to stay in their homes for one year after \nthe death of a service member. It's the least we can do for those who \nhave paid the ultimate price.\n  But let's be honest: No piece of legislation will ever anticipate all \nthe needs of America's military families. Someone will always fall \nthrough the cracks. And the legislation I intend to offer will try to \nfix that. Take the case of Jay Briseno. Jay was wounded in Iraq and \nleft paralyzed from the neck down. The law authorizes the VA to provide \n$11,000 to modify a disabled veteran's vehicle, but it doesn't provide \nthe resources a family needs to buy the specially out-fitted vehicle \nJay needed. In his case, a generous member of the community donated the \nvan the Briseno's now use to drive Jay to doctors appointments and \nhospital visits. And we are all grateful for that act of generosity. \nBut no family should ever have to be so dependent on charity to meet a \nbasic need.\n  Americans will do everything in our power to help military families. \nBut not all Americans can afford to buy modified minivans for wounded \nveterans, and not all military families have the same needs. So as part \nof my Military Family Bill of Rights, we will establish a Military \nFamily Relief Fund. Every American who pays taxes will be able to \ncontribute by checking a box on their income tax returns. Just as we \nlet Americans donate a few dollars to finance our presidential \nelections on their tax forms, we should give them this opportunity to \nsay thank you to our troops. The program will meet the needs we can't \nexpect with the flexibility and responsiveness our service members, \nveterans, and their families deserve.\n  Supporting military families must also extend beyond service in \nuniform--with programs across government to help with jobs, VA \nbenefits, healthcare, and education.\n  Veterans possess great leadership and technical skills, but they \noften lack the financial resources to turn that potential into a viable \nenterprise. A recent report by the Small Business Administration stated \nthat 22 percent of veterans plan to start or are starting a business \nwhen they leave the military. For service-disabled veterans, this \nnumber rises to 28 percent. So the legislation I introduce today will \ncreate a new program, administered by the Small Business \nAdministration, to provide very-low interest loans, up to $100,000, to \nhelp veterans start new small businesses.\n  But in this time of war, we have another obligation to meet the needs \nof those suffering with the experience of war.\n  The Pentagon believes that as many as 100,000 new combat veterans \nacross the country will need some level of mental health care. The New \nEngland Journal of Medicine has reported as many as 1 in 6 soldiers \nreturning from Iraq show symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. \nFewer than 40 percent of those sought help. Military officials and \nmental health providers predict that up to 30 percent of returning \nsoldiers will require psychiatric services associated with their \nexperience in war. Through July of last year, 31,000 veterans of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom had applied for disability benefits for \ninjuries--and 20 percent of those claims were for psychological \nconditions. These are levels not seen since the Vietnam War.\n  Our VA medical facilities are not ready for increased demands for the \ntreatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. In fact only 86 of 163 VA \nMedical Centers have PTSD treatment centers. We must do better. The \nwounds of war are not always visible, and we cannot sit back and wait \nfor people to ask for help. We have to be proactive.\n  Soldiers and Marines returning from war want to go home. They don't \nwant to do anything that could jeopardize\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\ntheir homecoming. That's what happened to Jeffrey Lucey, a Marine \nReservist from Belchertown, MA. When he was leaving Iraq, his first \ninstinct was to report traumatic memories of things he had seen in the \nwar. But someone told him it might delay his return home, so Jeff kept \nquiet. But the safety, security, and joy of homecoming eluded Jeff. \nHaunted by the war and what he had seen, he began to drink heavily. He \nwas plagued by recurring nightmares, and began talking about suicide. \nLast summer, Jeff took his own life. Jeff's story is a preventable \ntragedy, and a call to action. As part of the legislation I plan, \nkeeping faith with Jeff's family who have become committed advocates in \nhis memory, we will expand PTSD programs within the VA and require \noutreach efforts to find the veterans who need the care.\n  Our obligation is to keep faith with the men and women of the \nAmerican military and their families--whether they are on active duty, \nin the National Guard or Reserves, or veterans.\n  Those who have stood for us should know that we stand with them, \ntoday and always. Each of us can do something to ease their burden--but \ntruly supporting our troops requires that we act not just as \nindividuals, but as a nation. We owe our troops the opportunity to \nserve in the best-planned, best-equipped, and best-led military force \nin the world, and we owe them the peace of mind that comes from knowing \nthat they and their families will be taken care of if they sacrifice \nlife, limb or the ability to sleep without war's nightmares. We owe \nthem not just thanks and best wishes, but action here in Congress. In \ntoday's ever-changing and perilous world, there is not a moment to \nlose.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 461. A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to require that \na member of the uniformed services who is wounded or otherwise injured \nwhile serving in a combat zone continue to be paid monthly military pay \nand allowances, while the member recovers from the wound or injury, at \nleast equal to the monthly military pay and allowances the member \nreceived immediately before receiving the wound or injury, to continue \nthe combat zone tax exclusion for the member during the recovery \nperiod, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, \nSenator Kennedy, to introduce the Senate companion to the Crosby-Puller \nCombat Wounds Compensation Act.\n  This legislation is designed to help our soldiers who are returning \nfrom combat with serious wounds to maintain their pay during their \nrecovery. Too often, young wounded soldiers are struggling to recover \nfrom wounds of combat and, simultaneously struggling financially as \nwell.\n  A soldier's pay may be cut in half just as they are sent to the \nhospital. This adds to their stress and worries. It also can mean that \nfamily, including wives and children, cannot afford travel to the \nhospital to be nearby and support in the recovery.\n  Congressman Markey introduced this bill during the last Congress, and \nhe has introduced it this year. This legislation will maintain the full \npay that the soldier received immediately prior to their injury, until \nthey are discharged or regain active duty status.\n  Over 5,700 soldiers have been seriously wounded in Iraq, and there \nhave been others in combat areas around the globe, and sadly we must \nacknowledge that there will be more. Recovering soldiers and their \nfamilies deserve our admiration and respect, and our full support. As \nthey cope with the loss of a limb, or vision or mobility, they should \nnot have to cope with bill collector or financial hardship. In my view, \ncaring for our wounded soldiers and their families is a moral \nobligation and part of the cost of combat.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 461\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crosby-Puller Combat Wounds \n     Compensation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NO REDUCTION IN MONTHLY MILITARY PAY AND ALLOWANCES \n                   FOR MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES WOUNDED \n                   OR INJURED IN COMBAT ZONES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (b) of section 310 of title 37, \n     United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) No Reduction in Monthly Military Pay for Wounded or \n     Injured Members.--\n       ``(1) Effect of wound or injury in combat zone.--For each \n     month during the period specified in paragraph (2), the total \n     amount of monthly military pay paid to a member who was \n     wounded or otherwise injured while assigned to duty in an \n     area for which special pay was available under this section \n     at the time the member was wounded or otherwise injured shall \n     not be less than the total amount of military pay paid to the \n     member for the month during which the member was wounded or \n     otherwise injured.\n       ``(2) Duration.--Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to \n     a wounded or injured member until the end of the first month \n     during which any of the following occurs:\n       ``(A) The member is found to be physically able to perform \n     the duties of the member's office, grade, rank, or rating.\n       ``(B) The member is discharged or separated from the \n     uniformed services.\n       ``(C) The member dies.\n       ``(3) Military pay defined.--In this subsection, the term \n     `military pay' has the meaning given the term `pay' in \n     section 101(21) of this title, except that the term includes \n     allowances under chapter 7 of this title.''.\n       (b) Retroactive Effective Date.--Subsection (b) of section \n     310 of title 37, United States Code, as amended by this \n     section, shall apply with respect to any pay period ending on \n     or after September 11, 2001, for members of the uniformed \n     services described in paragraph (1) of such subsection who \n     were wounded or otherwise injured on or after that date.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \nproject for the mitigation of shore damage attributable to the project \nfor navigation, Saco River, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 466. A bill to deauthorize a certain portion of the project for \nnavigation, Rockland Harbor, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I rise today to reintroduce five different bills important \nto my State of Maine that were included in the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, WRDA, last year. Unfortunately, that larger Corps of \nEngineers reauthorization legislation did not see action before the \nSenate adjourned the 108th Congress, but I am pleased that the Chairman \nof the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently stated \nthat WRDA is on the committee's agenda for consideration soon. My hope \nis that all five bills will once again be included in the WRDA \nlegislation in the 109th Congress.\n  All of my bills are non-controversial, and, importantly, are \nsupported by the various townspeople and their officials, and State \nofficials, who view these harbor deauthorizations and river \nimprovements as engines for economic development. The bills also have \nthe support of the New England District of the Corps of Engineers.\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\n  The first bill, S. 462, pertains to Tenants Harbor, St. George, \nMaine. Deauthorizing the Federal Navigation Channel, FNC, would be of \ngreat help to the town in appropriately managing the Harbor to maximize \nmooring areas. Over the years there have been mounting problems with \nthe Army Corps of Engineers' mooring permit process as people seeking \npermits for moorings that have existed for 30 years continue to be \nnotified that the mooring locations are prohibited because they fall \nwithin the federal navigational channel.\n  My second bill, S. 463, concerns Northeast Harbor in Mt. Desert, \nMaine. The language will not only allow for more recreational moorages \nand commercial activities, it will also be an economic boost to \nNortheast Harbor, which is surrounded by Acadia National Park, one of \nthe nation's most visited parks--both by land and by water. The removal \nof the harbor from the FNC will allow the town to adapt to the high \ndemand for moorings and will allow residents to obtain moorings in a \nmore timely manner. The Harbor has now reached capacity for both \nmoorings and shoreside facilities and has a waiting list of over sixty \npeople, along with commercial operators who have been waiting for years \nto obtain a mooring for their commercial vessels.\n\n  My third bill, S. 464, addresses the Union River in Ellsworth, Maine. \nThe bill supports the City of Ellsworth's efforts to revitalize the \nUnion River navigation channel, harbor, and shoreline. The modification \ncalled for in my legislation will redesignate a portion of the Union \nRiver as an anchorage area. This redesignation will allow for a greater \nnumber of moorings in the harbor without interfering with navigation \nand will further improve the City's revitalization efforts for the \nharbor area.\n  My fourth bill, S. 465, will carry out a project for the mitigation \nof shore damage at Camp Ellis, Maine, attributable to the Saco River \nnavigation project. The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Army to \ncarry out the project, under the River and Harbor Act of 1968, to \nmitigate shore damage attributable to the Saco River project, waiving \nthe funding cap requirement for congressional authorization set forth \nin that Act. The legislation is needed to complete the project as it \nwill cost more than authorized under current law, and is the preferred \nproject by non-Federal interests.\n  My fifth bill, S. 466, will make the mooring of an historic \nwindjammer fleet in Rockland Harbor a reality. Originally a strong \nfishing port, Rockland retains its rich marine heritage, and it is one \nof the fastest growing cities in the Midcoast area. Like many of the \nport cities on the eastern seaboard, Rockland has been forced to \nconfront an assortment of financial and environmental changes, but \nhappily, the city has been able to respond to these challenges in \npositive and productive ways.\n  The City of Rockland has hosted the Windjammer fleet since 1955, \nearning a well deserved reputation as the Windjammer Capital of the \nWorld. Rockland's Windjammers are now National Historic Landmarks, and \nas such, are vitally important to both the City and the State. The \nimage of The Victory Chimes, one of five vessels slated to be berthed \nat the new wharf and a vessel whose historical designation I supported, \ngraces the Maine quarter. This beautiful fleet of windjammers \nsymbolizes the great seagoing history of Maine as well as the sense of \nadventure that we have come to associate so closely with the American \nexperience.\n  Lermond Cove is perfectly situated in the Rockland Harbor to be the \nnew and permanent home for these cherished vessels. The proposed \nWindjammer Wharf will also provide a safe harbor from storms, as it is \ntucked nicely near the Maine State Ferry and Department of Marine \nResources piers.\n  The State of Maine capitalizes on the visual impact of the \nWindjammers to promote tourism, working waterfronts and the natural \nbeauty that distinguishes our landscape. Over $300,000 is spent yearly \nby the Maine Windjammer Association to advertise and promote these \nbusinesses. Deauthorizing that part of the federal navigational channel \nwill clearly trigger significant and unrealized economic benefits for \nthe region, providing many beneficial dollars to the local area and the \nState of Maine. According to the Longwood study, which uses a \nmultiplier of 1.5, the economic impact of this spending is $3.8 million \na year. Conservatively, the Windjammers spend over If $2.5 million a \nyear in the state.\n  I want to thank the New England Corps of Engineers for their help in \ndrafting the language and working with the Maine Department of \nTransportation, which runs the ferry line, and also the Rockland city \nofficials, the Rockland Port District, and the Captains of the \nWindjammer vessels--Mainers and businesspeople with the vision and \ncommitment we need to complete Windjammer Wharf and create a permanent \nhome for this historic fleet of windjammers in Rockland Harbor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Corzine, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Reed, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Clinton, \n        Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Carper, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Chambliss, \n        and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 467.
