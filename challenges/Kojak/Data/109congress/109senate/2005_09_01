Mr. President, on behalf of my colleagues and fellow \nAmericans, I come to the Senate floor to extend my heartfelt sympathies \nto the victims of Hurricane Katrina and to reassure the thousands of \nfamilies suffering from this tragedy that we are committed to providing \nall of the relief and support necessary to get through this terrible \nand ongoing crisis. It is unprecedented, and it is unfolding before our \neyes. Thus, this is a highly unusual emergency session we are \nconducting tonight.\n  As the President has said, our first priority is saving lives. At \nthis very moment, relief organizations and faith-based volunteers are \nworking valiantly to provide food, shelter, water, and\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\nmedical care. FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has \ndelivered essential sustenance and supplies. It has supplied and \ncontinues to supply generators and thousands of cots and blankets and \nhas deployed over 1,800 personnel to save lives and render medical \nassistance.\n  Our action, coupled with the House action tomorrow, will ensure that \nall necessary funds are immediately available to respond to this \nongoing crisis.\n  The Army, Navy, National Guard, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, and Air \nNational Guard are hard at work conducting rescue operations and \nproviding aid. Twenty thousand guardsmen are on the ground right now. \nThousands more are on the way.\n  Volunteers from my home State of Tennessee have been on the front \nlines all week. I think of Tennessee Baptist Disaster Relief, a \nministry of 3,000 Southern Baptist Tennessee churches. They are working \naround the clock on rescue missions, at relief stations, cooking \nthousands of meals and providing emergency care. And they are offering \nsomething else, something desperately needed in this time of tragedy: \nthe hope and the love and the compassion of a Nation--of all of us \npulling together as one.\n  As Norma Jones, a 63-year-old volunteer from Indian Mound, told a \nnewspaper, ``Most of the time, the rescue survivors just want to be \nhugged.''\n  Hundreds of storm victims have found refuge in Nashville and middle \nTennessee. Many are staying with relatives until it is safe to return, \nwhich, as we all know, may not be for months.\n  The ongoing crisis has become a crisis of refugees, a crisis of \nrefugees the likes of which this country has never seen. In Memphis, \nTN, actually a long way from the gulf, there are 10,000 refugees as we \nspeak, and over the course of tonight they are expecting 4,000 more \nrefugees in that town alone.\n  On the television, we see families wading waste-high for dozens of \nblocks in search of food or dry land or clean water. We see those \nfamilies marooned on those rooftops, as floodwaters swirl past, \nwriting, inscribing with whatever they have available: ``Need \ninsulin.'' ``Diabetic.'' ``Please help''--reaching out for hope, \nreaching out to be saved.\n  Our very own colleague and friend, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, \nlost his family home in this disaster. He returned recently--about 2 \ndays ago--to his family home and found nothing. Our deepest sympathies \ngo out to him and his family as they face this difficult time and to so \nmany others in this body and, indeed, all around this country who face \nthese personal challenges.\n  Towns, cities, communities, and shorelines have been decimated and \nreduced to rubble, to debris. We have a public health crisis that is \njust beginning, an ongoing crisis, but one that will increase almost \nwith certainty over the coming days and weeks.\n  New Orleans, one of America's most vibrant cities, will take years to \nrecover. Hundreds of helpless people remain trapped on highway \noverpasses and in the city center with nowhere to go, no food, no \nwater, no sanitation, and security has been tough, as we have all seen \nover the course of the day.\n  Most of Mississippi is without power, without electricity. Towns, \nvillages have been totally destroyed.\n  The darkness of the night will be not just dramatic but, as we heard \nover the last several hours, haunting underneath those bridges, in \nrural areas with no lights for blocks, for miles, just human suffering.\n  Our rescue teams are working hard, and we see that. We are so proud \nof them, and they deserve our praise--our enormous praise--for their \ncourage, for their boldness, for their dedication. People are still \nstranded. They are reaching their breaking point, and they need our \nhelp now. That is why at 10 o'clock tonight we are acting. That is why \nwe are convening tonight in this urgent session for an emergency \nsupplemental, operating by unanimous consent. FEMA needs additional \nfunds now to continue their relief efforts and to continue the \nrecovery.\n  Over the course of the last several days, we have had numerous calls \nwith President Bush, and the Democratic leader and I just several hours \nago received a call from President Bush requesting these funds. We \napplaud President Bush. He moved early to get emergency supplies \nprepared and ready to go. We have been in constant contact. He and his \nadministration have been working tirelessly to meet this daunting \nchallenge.\n  We all recognize we have much to do. There are a lot of frustrations \nthat have bubbled up over the course of the last several days to do \nmore or things are not going well, and we feel those frustrations. We \nfeel that pain. We feel that suffering. Again, that is why we are here \ntonight--to support, to deliver, to answer those challenges.\n  I also thank our State and local leaders for their tremendous \ndedication and commitment. We, this body, our Federal Government, stand \nbehind them 100 percent. Helping the victims of this hurricane disaster \nis our highest priority.\n  Hurricane Katrina and her aftermath is, as we now know, one of the \nworst catastrophes this country has ever seen. But this is America, and \nin America we face our toughest challenges together as one, united and \nlifted up by our compassion and our strength.\n  Even in our darkest hour, our humanity shines through, millions of \ncitizens, millions of Americans committed to one another, to the care \nand well-being of all.\n  Inscribed in this very Chamber just above the Presiding Officer is \n``E Pluribus Unum,'' out of many, one.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/01/senate-section/article/S9594-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I begin by offering my thoughts and my \nprayers to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. They have experienced \nuntold horrors in the past few days, and the road to recovery will be \nlong and hard. As we approach the start of our regular fall work \nperiod, there can be no more important challenge facing this body in \nthe days ahead than providing relief to the victims of this \ncatastrophe. It will be weeks before we know the full toll this storm \nhas exacted. The only thing we know for sure is that we have \nexperienced a national crisis, and the people of the Gulf Coast need \nand deserve our help.\n  In these crucial hours, thousands of Americans are engaged in search \nand rescue efforts. I hope these brave men and women performing these \nheroic duties know that they, too, are in our thoughts and our prayers.\n  Tonight, in the Senate, we are taking a critical first step toward \nbringing relief to the victims of this disaster. I support President \nBush for submitting this $10.5 billion request, and I thank my \ncolleagues for permitting us to take up and pass this important \nlegislation tonight.\n  Our unified response sends a powerful signal to victims of this \ntragedy, looking for signs that their Government sees their plight and \nstands with them during this dark time.\n  In these days ahead, it is important we continue to send a strong \nunified message. We must work together--not together as Democrats and \nRepublicans but as Americans--united in helping families torn apart by \nthis devastating storm.\n  It is my hope that our actions following the 9/11 attacks will be a \nmodel for what we do tonight and in the future. Our action after 9/11 \nwas bipartisan. It was our top priority, and it moved significant \nresources to the victims of the terrorist attacks, and in a timely \nmanner.\n  Our response to the tragedy of September 2005 must be every bit as \nbipartisan and direct as the tragedy of September 2001. We did not \nhandle 9/11 with a Democratic or Republican aid package, and we should \nnot handle this crisis any differently. This is not the time for \npartisanship. The victims of this terrible tragedy come first.\n  With that principle guiding us, it is important we begin to consider \nour next steps. The $10.5 billion we are sending now represents a good \nfirst effort, but we all know much more needs to be done. I am deeply \nconcerned about the security situation on the ground as I speak. Unless \nwe establish security in this area, we cannot mount\n\n[[Page S9595]]\n\nan effective rescue operation, let alone begin rebuilding.\n  We have all seen the images of families stranded in the Superdome or \nsitting outside the Convention Center in filth and squalor. They do not \nhave food. They do not have water. They do not have medicine. They are \nliving in unsanitary conditions, and because we cannot keep the area \nsafe, they have been unable to get out. They are trapped. This is not \nacceptable.\n  This is America. These are Americans we see suffering. We must find \nways to get them the resources they need and bring them to safety. We \nmust restore security, accelerate our rescue operations, and expedite \nour relief efforts as soon as possible. We must get these people the \nhelp they need and they deserve.\n  When we reconvene on Tuesday, just a few hours from today, the \nsecurity and safety of the Gulf Coast residents must be our first order \nof business. These families are counting on us. They are suffering, and \nthey have nowhere else to turn. We owe it to them to make their \nsurvival our top priority, and we should give them nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me first of all thank the majority \nleader, who is now presiding over the Senate, for responding so quickly \nto the request of the President for a supplemental appropriations bill \nproviding needed funds to the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration and to the Department of Defense to carry on the \ndisaster relief efforts that they have begun in the States that were so \nseriously affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  The President has submitted a letter describing the reasons for the \nrequest for this appropriations bill. Rather than reading the entire \nletter, which has been made available to everyone--the letter is \nactually addressed to the Speaker of the House--I will just read the \nfirst two paragraphs:\n\n       As I informed the Nation yesterday, we are dealing with one \n     of the worst natural disasters in our country's history. \n     Residents of the Gulf Coast states affected by the hurricane \n     have lost loved ones, have lost homes, and have been \n     displaced from their communities. My Administration is \n     committed to ensuring that they will have the full support of \n     the Federal Government.\n       Due to the catastrophic nature of Hurricane Katrina, I am \n     asking the Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed \n     request totaling $10.5 billion, for an emergency FY 2005 \n     supplemental appropriation for the Departments of Homeland \n     Security and Defense. These funds will ensure that Federal \n     response and recovery efforts continue uninterrupted.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nPresident be printed in full in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                September 1, 2005.\n     The Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: As I informed the Nation yesterday, we \n     are dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our \n     country's history. Residents of the Gulf Coast states \n     affected by the hurricane have lost loved ones, have lost \n     homes, and have been displaced from their communities. My \n     Administration is committed to ensuring that they will have \n     the full support of the Federal Government.\n       Due to the catastrophic nature of Hurricane Katrina, I am \n     asking the Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed \n     request, totaling $10.5 billion, for an emergency FY 2005 \n     supplemental appropriation for the Departments of Homeland \n     Security and Defense. These funds will ensure that Federal \n     response and recovery efforts continue uninterrupted.\n       I hereby designate this proposal in the amount requested \n     herein as an emergency requirement. This request responds to \n     urgent needs associated with immediate response and recovery \n     efforts associated with Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi, \n     Louisiana, Alabama and other affected areas.\n       The enclosed request requires immediate action by the \n     Congress to ensure that the Federal response to this disaster \n     continues uninterrupted. I anticipate making a further \n     request in the coming weeks that will provide for a \n     comprehensive response and recovery effort after fully \n     assessing the impact of the hurricane.\n       The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed \n     letter from the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W. Bush,\n                                                  The White House.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the letter also contains a copy of a \nletter to the President from the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget, Joshua B. Bolton. In this letter, he delineates \nspecifically where the funds are needed, when they will be exhausted \nunder current authority, and why this emergency appropriation is needed \nso that we can continue the aggressive disaster relief efforts in the \ncoming weeks. And then he suggests:\n\n       I anticipate recommending to you an additional request in \n     the coming weeks to provide for a comprehensive response to \n     this hurricane, once reliable estimates can be developed that \n     recognize the extent of this disaster.\n       This request fulfills known and urgent requirements that \n     cannot reasonably be met under the current [fiscal year] 2005 \n     funding levels. I recommend that you designate the proposal \n     contained in this transmittal as an emergency requirement.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the letter from the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget to the President be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 1, 2005.\n     The President,\n     The White House.\n       Submitted for your consideration is a request for fiscal \n     year 2005 supplemental appropriations totaling $10.5 billion \n     to fund immediate emergency response and recovery needs \n     associated with Hurricane Katrina.\n       Immediate Federal response and recovery efforts to date \n     have been extensive. The Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA) has deployed more than 50 Disaster Medical Assistance \n     Teams, more than 25 Urban Search and Rescue task forces, \n     eight swift water rescue teams, and two Incident Support \n     Teams to the region. FEMA is also delivering water, meals, \n     medical supplies, generators, tents, and tarps and is working \n     to help relocate those displaced by the hurricane.\n       The Department of Defense (DOD) is moving significant \n     military resources into the Gulf States to aid in rescue and \n     recovery. Eight Navy ships have moved into the area with \n     water, food, medicine, hospital facilities, berthing, and \n     more. DOD has responded to all FEMA requests and is providing \n     logistical help, including strategic lift support for search \n     and rescue efforts. Other agencies are also participating in \n     response and recovery efforts. For example, Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) Secretary Mike Leavitt has declared a public \n     health emergency and HHS has delivered requested medical \n     supplies to Louisiana, including basic first aid materials, \n     blankets and patient clothing and comprehensive lifesaving \n     medical equipment. HHS has placed 415 Public Health Service \n     Officers on standby for deployment to support medical \n     response in the affected states and CDC officials are working \n     with local officials to identify hospital facilities, \n     distribute medical supplies, and execute a public health plan \n     to control disease and other risks to public health.\n       The funds that I recommend you request today will ensure \n     that these immediate response and recovery efforts continue \n     uninterrupted. The $10 billion requested for the Department \n     of Homeland Security will enable FEMA to continue ongoing \n     response efforts, including assistance to families and \n     individuals so that they can be sheltered, fed and provided \n     with emergency medical care. These funds will also support \n     emergency protective measures and debris removal in the \n     affected areas, and urgent response activities performed by \n     other Federal agencies, as delegated by FEMA under the \n     Stafford Act.\n       The $500 million requested for DOD will enable DOD to cover \n     the costs associated with deployment of military personnel to \n     assist communities, save lives, and provide relief supplies \n     for the next several weeks. DOD's immediate crisis response \n     costs include immediate facilities repairs of DOD property, \n     evacuation of DOD personnel debris clean-up, transportation \n     costs, and emergency utility costs.\n       I anticipate recommending to you an additional request in \n     the coming weeks to provide for a comprehensive response to \n     this hurricane, once reliable estimates can be developed that \n     recognize the extent of this disaster.\n       This request fulfills known and urgent requirements that \n     cannot reasonably be met under the current FY 2005 funding \n     levels. I recommend that you designate the proposal contained \n     in this transmittal as an emergency requirement.\n       I have carefully reviewed this proposal and am satisfied \n     that it is necessary at this time.

Mr. President, I commend the majority leader, with the \nconcurrence and support of the minority leader, for calling the Senate \ninto session tonight under these emergency conditions, to approve as if \npassed by the House, and when passed by the House and it is received \nhere in the Senate, an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to \nfund disaster relief efforts.\n  These efforts are ongoing. We have all had an opportunity to see on \ntelevision sets and to hear and read newspaper accounts of the work \nthat has been going on the last several days. I had the opportunity to \ntravel to my State of Mississippi yesterday and spent the day touring \nthe ravaged areas along the Mississippi Gulf Coast and then traveled to \nJackson, the Capitol of the State, where I was able to meet with \nGovernor Haley Barbour and his disaster assistance team that he had \nassembled and was supervising in their efforts to make all of the \nresources of our State government available to disaster victims and to \nhelp them in the effort to recover from this terrible hurricane.\n  I have never seen any storm inflict such great damage as I saw \nyesterday. I was on the Gulf Coast immediately following Hurricane \nCamille in 1969. I was a practicing lawyer at the time. We were trying \nto help one of our clients ensure that the employees of their company, \nStandard Oil Company refinery, were able to present their claims to \ntheir insurance companies and otherwise be compensated, as they were \nentitled to under their policies, for the damages sustained throughout \nthe area where those employees were living along the Gulf Coast. That \nwas the worst storm that anybody in my age group had ever heard of, \nbefore or since--until Hurricane Katrina.\n  I can tell you, looking along the coastline, flying in a Mississippi \nNational Guard helicopter, the whole coastline, the whole coastal area \nof the State has been virtually destroyed. There are a few buildings \nthat are left standing--a few. Those may not be habitable, and the \nbusinesses that they house may not be able to continue to function \nuntil extensive repairs are made on those buildings, so it is virtually \nall a total loss for blocks and blocks beyond the beach area.\n  Everything was quiet. There was nobody moving around; it wasn't until \ntoday that many people could have access to the areas where those \nhouses once stood. It was quiet. It was eerie. It was a horrible sight \nto behold. I don't know of anything that has depressed me more than \nseeing what I saw yesterday in my State of Mississippi.\n  So I am confident the Senate will continue to follow the progress of \nthe disaster assistance effort to be sure that we make available to all \nFederal agencies and departments the funds they need to do the job to \nhelp in the recovery efforts in Mississippi and in Alabama and \nLouisiana and in the other States. There have been damages in Florida \nand Georgia and Texas as well.\n  The primary use of the funds that we give to the Department of \nHomeland Security, as requested by the President, will be used to \nreimburse Federal agencies for providing the relief effort that we have \ncome to appreciate. The Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, Health \nand Human Services Department, Housing and Urban Development--all are \nable to share in these funds that will be disbursed to reimburse those \ndepartments for participating in the disaster relief effort. So it is \nnot only this one agency but others that will be sustained and assisted \nas they continue to work in this effort.\n  The President has appointed this task force as we all know now: \nSecretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff is chairing the task \nforce on Hurricane Katrina; Mike Brown, the Director of FEMA, has been \non the ground since the very beginning of this effort, coordinating the \nactivities on the ground. Fifty-two counties in Mississippi have been \nidentified as eligible for disaster declarations; thirty-two parishes \nin Louisiana; six counties in Alabama. The three Governors of those \nStates have requested that the President waive cost-share requirements \nbecause of the expensive nature of these expenses for emergency \nresponse activities, and the President has granted this waiver.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a description of the challenges and \naccomplishments of this disaster relief effort be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Life-Saving Efforts\n\n       Over 3,000 people have been rescued by the United States \n     Coast Guard and other operations. The Coast Guard has \n     deployed 57 aircraft and 27 cutters.\n       More than 25 urban search and rescue task forces are \n     operating with 1,800 personnel.\n       More than 50 National Disaster Medical System teams have \n     deployed to deal with medical needs.\n       1,700 trucks have been mobilized to supply water, ice, \n     food, medicine, and medical supplies.\n       450 buses are moving people out of the affected areas in \n     Louisiana.\n       Over 78,000 people are in shelters across the region.\n       13.4 million liters of water and 3.4 million pounds of ice \n     have been shipped to the impacted areas.\n\n                           Electricity/Energy\n\n       2.3 million citizens are without power in the Gulf Coast \n     States.\n       Gasoline and diesel fuel is being routed to emergency \n     personnel and services first.\n       The Department of Energy has authorized the release of oil \n     from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency has temporarily waived \n     standards for gasoline and diesel fuels to make sure that \n     more fuel is available for emergency services.\n\n[[Page S9597]]\n\n                                Military\n\n       State and local law enforcement and the National Guard are \n     working to restore order throughout the affected areas.\n       13,000 National Guard are stationed in Mississippi, \n     Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida, under control of the \n     Governors. Approximately 6,000 members of the National Guard \n     are stationed in Mississippi.\n       The total number of National Guard is expected to increase \n     to more than 20,000 by Friday.\n       The Department of Defense has sent eight Navy ships to the \n     area, including a hospital ship with 100 beds and 800 medical \n     personnel.\n       The Department of Defense has provided over 20 million \n     ready-to-eat meals.\n\n                             Infrastructure\n\n       The Army Corps of Engineers is coordinating efforts to \n     repair levees in New Orleans and remove water from the city.\n       Federal and State departments of transportation are working \n     to repair and reopen highways and interstates.\n       Interstates 55, 59, 49, and 20 have been reopened in \n     Mississippi. Interstate 10 is open with one lane of traffic \n     for emergency vehicles only.\n\n                       Health and Human Services\n\n       The Department of Health and Human Services has declared a \n     public health emergency in the affected areas.\n       A network of 40 medical shelters with 10,000 beds is \n     staffed by 4,000 medical personnel.\n       2,600 beds have been identified in the immediate area, with \n     40,000 more beds nationwide.\n\n                              Agriculture\n\n       USDA's Food and Nutrition Service is providing shelters and \n     mass feedings sites and issuing emergency food stamps and \n     infant formula.

Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent \nthat notwithstanding the recess or adjournment of the Senate, the \nSenate may receive from the House an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill for relief of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, the \ntext of which is at the desk, and that the measure be considered read \nthree times and passed and a motion to reconsider laid on the table; \nprovided that the text of the House bill is identical to that which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I want the record to be spread with the fact that the \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Robert Byrd, \nhas indicated he fully supports the action tonight and stands arm-in-\narm with the chairman of the committee, Senator Cochran, to move \nforward any other requests that would come down from the \nadministration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, my particular thoughts go to our \ncolleague from Mississippi, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, who has experienced visiting such devastation.\n  I have some idea of how he feels because less than 4 years ago--a \nlittle more than 4 years ago--I experienced the same in New York.\n  Tonight, our Nation is experiencing one of the most tragic and \nheartrending natural disasters in our history. Entire towns have been \ndestroyed, lives upturned, families lost, and the chaos we have all \nwatched unfold continues even tonight.\n  Our hearts go out to the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, \nand all of the other Gulf States affected by Hurricane Katrina. Our \nprayers go out most of all to those still stranded and to those who \nhave lost loved ones. The images on television are devastating--hungry, \nweeping children sitting on the street amidst garbage; family members \nreturning to the destroyed remains of their neighborhoods discovering \nthey have lost everything they have ever owned, from precious family \nkeepsakes to their houses, cars, and livelihoods; and angry, frightened \npeople with nowhere to go and no rescue in sight.\n  I join with all Americans and people all over the world in praying \nfor the safe rescue of all the victims of this heartbreaking tragedy.\n  Four years ago, my city of New York faced a devastating attack, and \nAmerica stood with us in our time of need. New Yorkers will stand with \nthe people of the gulf region now as they stood with us then.\n  The love and support New Yorkers received from the rest of the \ncountry after 9/11 meant so much in the wake of those attacks and the \nlong, difficult road to recovery. I want the people of New Orleans, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and the rest of the gulf to know we will \nsupport them, too, no matter how long and difficult their recovery may \nbe. We will do whatever it takes to help now, tomorrow, and into the \nfuture.\n  Our first step comes tonight, when the Senate will agree to provide \n$10.5 billion in desperately needed disaster relief funding to the \ndevastated region. And we will stand unified with President Bush and \nready to provide everything and anything that New Orleans and the rest \nof the gulf region will need to rebuild and recover. Just as we did \nafter 9/11, this body and the entire Nation will work together to \novercome this disaster. The American people are strong, and we will \npersevere.\n  Like so many Americans, I have been watching the terrible images on \ntelevision, and I worry about the thousands of people still stranded in \nthe Superdome and throughout the city and region without food, water, \nsanitary facilities, or medical treatment. I worry so very much about \nthe desperately ill people, including small babies and frail seniors \nwho need medical care, and the people who may still be trapped in \nplaces rescuers have not reached, people in attics who retreated to the \nattics as the waters rose and then were stuck there.\n  I know firsthand how difficult it can be to organize a massive rescue \nand recovery effort, and clearly this disaster is unprecedented in its \nscope and difficulty.\n  Tonight, a lot of people's lives still hang in the balance. Money for \nthe long run is necessary, and that is why we are here tonight. But \nthere is much more we must do immediately. We must focus all our \nefforts on rescuing those who are in need of medicine, who are hungry, \nthirsty, and frightened and despairing. We must get these people to \nshelter and to medical facilities immediately. We must fly in food, \nwater, clothing, blankets, medicine, and whatever else is needed. We \nmust get as many ships, buses, and trucks as we can, from wherever we \ncan get them, to transport the victims and to begin clearing the \nwreckage. We must provide the soldiers and law enforcement needed to \nrestore law and order--however many it takes.\n  This is literally a life-and-death crisis, where every moment of \ndelay has a human price. There is not a minute to lose, no matter the \ncost.\n  I know the phones have been ringing off the hook in my office and \nthose of my colleagues. Many have called asking where they can \ncontribute. That act of generosity is also noted. We are hearing from \nour constituents who have heartfelt questions about what went wrong in \nthis tragedy and what else could have been done to prevent it. At the \nmoment, we must keep our total focus on saving lives. But I want them \nto know that their questions are not falling on deaf ears. In due time, \nafter we have done everything to save those whose lives hang in the \nbalance, we will ask those difficult questions--not to lay blame but to \nlearn from the mistakes that were made so that the Nation will be \nbetter prepared for the next disaster we might face.\n  But now is the time for action, for solving these problems, and for \nsaving the lives that hang in the balance. In the days and months \nahead, this Nation will pull together united as we did after 9/11. We \nwill do everything we can to help the victims and repair and rebuild \nthe cities and towns in the gulf, especially the much beloved city of \nNew Orleans.\n  Just as we did in New York, we will face difficulties and great \nsorrow, but I know I join all of my colleagues in the Senate in \npledging assistance--financial and beyond--that the gulf region needs \nand anything else in our power to help our fellow citizens.\n  Tonight, our prayers--our fervent prayers--are with them.\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with sadness in my \nheart, yet\n\n[[Page S9598]]\n\nfirm in my resolve to due whatever is necessary in order to be of \nassistance to the citizens of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and \nFlorida. No amount of Federal compensation can ever make up for the \nlosses that have been suffered or for the tragic circumstances \nsurrounding this event. Lives have been changed forever. However, now, \nas we have always done in the past, we will band together as a nation \nand begin the process of healing the wounds caused by this \nunprecedented tragedy.\n  I know I speak for all the citizens of Utah when I extend my State's \nheartfelt sympathies to all who have suffered. The Governor of Utah has \ngraciously volunteered to open our State's doors to the refugees from \nthe New Orleans area, by providing them with shelter, food, and other \nappropriate assistance. We are all anxious to help and provide as much \nrelief and comfort as possible to these good people.\n  As a member of our Nation's Federal Government, I pledge my full \nsupport to provide assistance to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. I am \nalso grateful for the President's leadership. He has done an \nextraordinary job of organizing land deploying our Nation's resources \nin a timely and expeditious manner. Currently, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency is spending $500 million a day to help these \ncitizens. This is a staggering amount of money, but these are \nstaggering times and when we pledge our assistance, we pledge all the \nassistance we can possibly muster.\n  The suffering and pain felt by our citizens in the South is abhorrent \nand I am, once again, in awe of the commitment, selflessness, and skill \nof our Nation's first responders, disaster agency personnel, military \npersonnel, local volunteers, local leaders, and everyday heroes who \nare--right now--doing all they can to help. I am also indebted to our \ncongressional leadership for bringing the Congress together in an \nunprecedented fashion to provide Federal aid in a timely manner so \nrescue and relief efforts can continue unobstructed.\n  I am resolved to do everything I can. I know millions of citizens \nthroughout the country are similarly resolved. To those heroes who wish \nto alleviate the suffering in the South, please heed the President's \nrequest and donate cash to the groups that are providing direct \nassistance in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Information \ncan be found at the FEMA Web site or by calling the American Red Cross \nat 1-800-HELP-NOW.\n  The compassion and humanitarian efforts going on in this country are \nastounding. Thank you to all those citizens who have offered assistance \nand prayers. I know we can count on every American to do their part in \nthis hour of need.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, like all Americans, my thoughts \nare with those struggling to cope with the terrible effects of \nHurricane Katrina. The devastation brought by the storm is absolutely \nheart-wrenching and beyond description. Many of my constituents are \ndeeply concerned by the scenes of suffering they are witnessing and I \nshare their desire that the Government do all it can to get help to \nKatrina's victims as soon as possible.\n  I commend the majority leader and minority leader for acting to make \nsure that the Federal help is available to deal with Katrina's \naftermath. I hope that the emergency supplemental we are passing will \nhelp to ensure that disaster relief efforts proceed as smoothly and \nexpeditiously as possible. I will continue to work with my colleagues \nin Congress and with the President to make sure that the Federal \nGovernment does all it can to assist those who have lost so much in \nthis national tragedy.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, even though we have all been \nscattered across the country during this past week as the Senate has \nbeen in recess, we have all witnessed through television the \ndevastating scenes from Louisiana and Mississippi. My heart goes out to \nall of those who have been affected by Hurricane Katrina--those who \nhave lost friends and family members; those who have lost homes; those \nwhose lives have been completely upended. My thoughts and my prayers \nare with them all.\n  Having represented California in the Senate for the past 12\\1/2\\ \nyears, I have been through my share of disasters--of earthquakes, \nfloods, mudslides, and fires. I know a little of what they are going \nthrough right now in the South. But no matter how many disasters I have \nwitnessed first hand in California, I must admit, these are some of the \nmost disturbing and catastrophic scenes I have ever seen.\n  And here we are, several days after the hurricane struck, and it does \nnot appear to be getting much better. Tens of thousands of people \nremained stranded and trapped--there is a critical lack of food and \nwater--and people are dying. It is truly a desperate situation.\n  So I am pleased to support this legislation to provide emergency \nfunding to help the relief efforts. I doubt it will be enough, and I \nsuspect we will need to do more. I trust that the action we are taking \ntonight will be just the first step--and will serve to underscore our \ndesire to take care of the people of the Gulf States.\n  The bill (H.R. 3645) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.
