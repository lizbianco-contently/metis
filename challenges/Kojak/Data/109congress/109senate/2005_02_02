Mr. President, I will close by making a few very brief \nremarks on Judge Alberto Gonzales. The opportunity is being provided \nfor all Senators to express themselves on this very important \nnomination. I am confident that the nomination will be confirmed \ntomorrow afternoon or tomorrow evening. The debate is important, and I \nencourage all of our colleagues to keep it civil and nonpartisan, as \nmuch as practically possible, over the next 48 hours.\n  I will talk very briefly about a topic the President will speak to \ntonight, I am quite certain, and that is restoring commonsense balance \nto our legal system and to our tort system. I mention that because as \nthe Democratic leader and I have agreed, we will be coming to an \nimportant aspect of class action reform next week.\n  I think of Dr. Chet Gentry of the Cumberland Family Care Clinic in \nSparta, TN, who does not deliver babies anymore, does not practice \nobstetrics anymore. When one asks him why, without any hesitation, \ncrystal clear, it is because his insurance premiums grew too high. \nSimply, he could not afford to deliver babies, and by dropping \nobstetrics he cut the insurance premiums he has to pay for this \nprivilege of practicing medicine by two-thirds, down from $38,000 a \nyear to $14,000 a year. So by not delivering babies, he cuts his \ninsurance premiums down that dramatically. There is an incentive to not \ntake care of moms when they are going through this wonderful process of \ngiving birth.\n  In a rural community as small as Sparta--and it has a relatively \nsmall population, only 5,000 people--losing Dr. Gentry's services for \nfamilies is a huge blow. Eighteen months ago, that town had five family \nphysicians. Today, there are three doing obstetrics, delivering babies, \nand only two of them will perform C-sections.\n\n  Dr. Gentry--again, I use him as an example--warns:\n\n       In this small community of Sparta, which serves several \n     surrounding rural counties, the cost of malpractice insurance \n     is affecting access to care. It's already difficult to \n     recruit physicians to rural areas, and the malpractice crisis \n     threatens to make it worse.\n\n  The issue is not just cost, it is not just money, it is access to \ncare, whether it is trauma care or finding an obstetrician who will \ntake care of you through the 9 months of pregnancy and deliver your \nbaby. It is an access issue.\n  This out-of-control litigation is reaching a crisis point in \nTennessee. In\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\n29 other States it has already reached a crisis point. Seventy percent \nof doctors who have practiced in Tennessee for more than 10 years have \nhad a claim filed against them. Does that mean that 7 out of 10 doctors \nin one State are conducting malpractice, bad health care? No, of course \nnot.\n  If one looks at the studies of obstetrics, OB/GYN, 92 percent have \nhad a claim against them. That is 9 out of every 10 doctors who have \nbeen delivering babies for more than 10 years. For cardiac surgeons, \nheart surgeons, not a higher risk but in some ways a higher risk field, \none of the more common operations done across the country today is \ncardiac surgery--92 percent out of the physicians, 9 out of 10 \nphysicians who have practiced more than 10 years, have had a suit filed \nagainst them.\n  Average malpractice insurance premiums have increased, so it is a \nproblem, but it is a problem that is getting worse. Look over the last \n5 years; these premiums have increased by 84 percent. The premiums go \nup because when the frivolous lawsuits increase, it creates a heavier \nburden and that is passed on, of course, to physicians. In Tennessee, \nOB/GYNs can expect to pay $60,000 a year in insurance premiums; heart \nsurgeons, about $55,000; and general surgeons, $40,000. All of that is \nhigh. That is just to pay for the insurance. Remember, Tennessee is not \nyet a crisis State. If a doctor is in Pennsylvania, Ohio, or down in \nFlorida, they are paying two to three times that. Some neurosurgeons, \ntrauma surgeons, are having to pay insurance of $300,000, some even \n$400,000, a year for the privilege of taking care of people in the \nevent there is an accident.\n  Dr. Martin Olsen, chair of OB/GYN division at East Tennessee State \nUniversity, reports that their clinic in the rural town of Mountain \nCity, TN, had to shut down because of unaffordable insurance costs. \nCocke County meanwhile has lost 7 of its 12 doctors who deliver babies.\n  The problem is not limited to Tennessee. It is not even limited to \nthe practice of medicine. I use that as an example because the impact \nthese litigations costs and frivolous lawsuits have on medicine and \nhealth care is so dramatic to me as a physician, as I look at my \nphysician colleagues.\n  Across the country, American businesses, doctors, plaintiffs, court \nsystems, and taxpayers, are all being victimized by frivolous \nlitigation, by out-of-control litigation. Now is the time to change \nthat. That opportunity is before us.\n  In 2003, the tort system cost about $250 billion overall. Much of \nthat, maybe half of that--I do not even know what the figure is--is \nobviously well spent. What we want to do is squeeze the waste, the \nfrivolous lawsuits, out of the system. That figure of $250 billion \nmeans of an unnecessary tax of about $850 for every man, woman, and \nchild. So it is bad now. At the current rate of increase, which \noutpaces the growth of our GDP, gross domestic product, it is estimated \nthat per capita cost will go above $1,000 by 2006. That means for a \nfamily of 4, there is a tort tax of about $4,000.\n  The tort system accounts for about 2.23 percent of our GDP. That is \nequal to the entire economy of the State of Washington or more than \nthat of the State of Tennessee, my own State. Where does all that money \ngo? Unfortunately, less than half of it gets to the victims, the people \nwho have been victimized and hurt. They need to be fully compensated. \nWe all agree with that. The problem is, less than half of the money \ngoes to the victims, which is the purpose of the tort system, and the \nother half of it goes to administrative costs and, of course, to the \ntrial lawyers, the personal injury lawyers.\n  There are lots of different examples. Take the case of the Coca-Cola \napple juice dispute. It is really on the apple juice end of this, that \nthe plaintiffs' lawyers charged that the drink company was improperly \nadding sweeteners to its apple juice. So as compensation, the attorneys \nmanaged to secure a 50-cent coupon for each of the apple juice victims \nwhile at the same time the lawyers walked away with $1.5 million for \nthemselves.\n  The system is out of balance. We will bring it back into balance. \nSmall businesses get dragged into this irrational tort system. There is \nexample after example that we all have. The system clearly needs to be \nreformed. Cherry-picking favorable counties to land billion-dollar \nsettlements undermines the core principles of our legal system. Those \nprinciples are fairness and equity. These are the sorts of issues that \nthe Judiciary Committee will be addressing tomorrow in committee and \nthat we will be addressing on the floor of the Senate next week.\n  As our distinguished colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, has \nexplained on the Senate floor, too many lawsuits are filed in local \ncourts that have no connection to the plaintiff, the defendant, or the \nconduct at issue. If the case affects the Nation as a whole, it should \nbe heard in a Federal court.\n  We have other areas of litigation that need to be addressed and \nhopefully will be addressed in the near future. Asbestos litigation has \nbankrupted 70 companies; 18 companies have been bankrupted in the last \n24 months. It means job losses--60,000 jobs have been lost, with \nbillions of dollars taken out of our economy without the patients or \nindividuals with cancer being adequately compensated in a timely way. \nSo squeeze the waste and abuse and in some cases the fraud out of the \nsystem--that is our goal--and return these systems back into systems of \nintegrity.\n  I am very excited about where we are going in terms of addressing the \ntort issues in a balanced, bipartisan way. We will justly compensate \nthose who have been injured by careless or reckless actions, and we \nwant to hold those who commit these actions to account.\n  Since our country's founding, the tort system often has been a force \nof justice and positive change, but today that justice is being junked \nby trial attorneys looking for these multimillion-dollar windfalls, and \nthat is what we need to address. We will take action to end the abuse \nin these lawsuits on the floor of the Senate. It will be done for the \nsake of true victims who deserve fair compensation, for the prosperity \nand health of our people, and for the integrity of our Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/02/senate-section/article/S834-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S834-S873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        NOMINATION OF ALBERTO R. GONZALES TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume executive session for the consideration of Executive Calendar \nNo. 8, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Alberto R. Gonzales, of Texas, \nto be Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until \n4:30 p.m. shall be equally divided for debate between the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the division basically is going to be \nfrom 9:30 we will have Republican speakers and from 10:30 to 11:30 \nthere will be Democratic speakers and then we will be going back and \nforth.\n  I am pleased to be able to open today's discussion on the nomination \nof my friend, Alberto Gonzales. I am pleased because I know Alberto \nGonzales personally and have been able to work with him both during the \ntime he was a distinguished supreme court justice in my home State of \nTexas, and as White House Counsel.\n  As the senior Senator from Texas and formerly the junior Senator from \nTexas, I have had a lot of commerce with Alberto Gonzales. I can tell \nthe American public without reservation: He is honest. He is a straight \nshooter. He has told me some things I didn't want to hear on more than \none occasion. But I was absolutely assured that he was doing what he \nsaid he was going to do and that he had reasons for what he did.\n  On the other hand, I have been able to persuade him on issues where \nour views differed, because he listened. He is not rigid and \nimpenetrable, as some people have described him. Again, he is a person \nwho listens, who is thoughtful, who is a straight shooter, and someone \nfor whom I have the utmost respect.\n  I am proud to be able to start the floor debate today on Alberto \nGonzales, who was nominated and is to be confirmed as Attorney General \nof the United States.\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\n  Alberto Gonzales is the American story. He is the American dream. He \nis the American dream, not because he wants his piece of the pie. He is \nthe American dream because he worked hard, never complained. Without \nmany advantages growing up, he persevered, maintained a positive \nspirit, and it is fair to say, Alberto Gonzales made it. He made it on \nhis own because he prepared himself and because he didn't act like a \nvictim. He understood that this country is filled with opportunities \nand he took responsibility and seized that opportunity.\n  He grew up in Humble, TX. Alberto Gonzales was one of seven siblings \nliving in a two-bedroom house that was built by his father and his \nuncles. His father was a migrant worker, as was his mother. They did \nnot have an education beyond elementary school. But Judge Gonzales \nlearned through his parents' example that, with dreams and commitment \nand hard work, you can be rewarded in this country.\n  He excelled in the public schools around Houston, TX. He was a star. \nHe was a star on his own merit because he studied, worked hard, and was \nalways looking for that extra thing he could do to make himself better. \nBecause of that, he was accepted into one of our Nation's most \nprestigious universities, Rice University in Houston, TX.\n  He was not only a graduate of a great university, he was the first \nperson in his family to graduate from college and from a great \nuniversity such as Rice. From there he went on to Harvard Law School, \nwhere he earned his law degree. He served in the Air Force. He was a \npartner at Vinson & Elkins, a prestigious international law firm. He \nthen became general counsel to Governor George W. Bush, and that is \nwhere they came to have the bond that has been so important in their \nrelationship through the years.\n\n  Then-Governor Bush appointed Alberto Gonzales to be secretary of \nstate of Texas. The secretary of state is the person in charge of \nrunning elections, making sure we have fair elections in Texas and that \nthe elections are well publicized so we would have a strong voter \nturnout. He also served as Governor Bush's liaison to Mexico.\n  It has become a tradition of Governors in our State to have a \nsecretary of state who will work on border issues and issues with \nMexico, because that is such an important bilateral relationship for \nour State as well as our Nation.\n  Then Governor Bush appointed Alberto Gonzales to the Supreme Court of \nTexas. He had a distinguished career. He gained experience and respect \nevery step of the way. When the George W. Bush became the President, he \nbrought Alberto Gonzales with him to Washington to be his White House \nCounsel.\n  As White House Counsel, the President wanted someone he could trust \nand someone who knew the law, someone he knew was smart, would do \nthorough research, would not shoot from the hip. He wanted someone who \ncould be a steady hand at the wheel in the White House Counsel's \nOffice. So, Alberto Gonzales came to the White House with the President \nand did an outstanding job as White House Counsel, and adviser to the \nPresident. He made sure the President knew all of the options and his \nperspective, but also provided him with the views and perspectives of \nothers. This is very important.\n  I think Alberto Gonzales sometimes, because he is so fair-minded, \nwould give the President options even though he personally disagreed \nwith some of them. That is what made him such a trusted lawyer for the \nPresident. He wanted the President to make the decisions and he wanted \nthe President to make the decisions with the best possible information \nhe could have--whether he believed in that particular option or not. \nHis loyalty to the President was, of course, absolute.\n  Judge Gonzales answered a very important question about his service \nas White House Counsel as opposed to the different role he would have \nas Attorney General. I think it is important because I think some of \nthe criticism that has been made in the Senate Judiciary Committee and \non the floor has revolved around the role of a White House Counsel and \nthe very different role that the Attorney General of the United States \nwould play. Alberto Gonzales understands the difference. He knows there \nis a difference. He agrees that there is a difference.\n  As White House Counsel he had one role, loyal adviser to the \nPresident of the United States, and he fulfilled that role superbly. He \ngave the advice; he gave different options; he let the President make \nthe decisions. But he knows that the Attorney General of the United \nStates is not just loyal to the President. Of course, he is in the \nPresident's Cabinet. Of course, he will be loyal to the President. But \nthat is not his primary function. I want to read his response because \nit addresses exactly what the Attorney General's role should be, in my \nopinion. I agree with Alberto Gonzales, and I think he is right on the \nmark.\n\n       I do very much understand that there is a difference in the \n     position of Counsel to the President and that of the Attorney \n     General of the United States. . . . As Counsel to the \n     President, my primary focus is on providing counsel to the \n     White House and to White House staff and the President. I do \n     have a client who has an agenda, and part of my role as \n     counsel is to provide advice so that the President can \n     achieve that agenda lawfully. It is a much different \n     situation as Attorney General, and I know that. My first \n     allegiance is going to be to the Constitution and the laws \n     of the United States.\n\n  Judge Gonzalez in a written response later said: ``All government \nlawyers should always provide an accurate and honest appraisal of the \nlaw, even if that will constrain the Administration's pursuit of \ndesired policies.''\n  Judge Gonzales said if he becomes Attorney General, he will no longer \nrepresent only the White House, he will represent the American people. \nHe is absolutely right on that point. That is what all of us expect and \nthat is what he intends to deliver.\n  I think it is the most important point.\n  As we look at history and as we look at past Attorneys General, \nsometimes the impression is that an Attorney General is only loyal to \nthe President. Of course, the Attorney General will be loyal to the \nPresident, but that will not override his loyalty to the Constitution, \nthe law, and the American people.\n  Of course, the President too wants to do what is right for the \nAmerican people. But the Attorney General is the one who will make the \ndetermination if something is lawful. And I know that Judge Gonzales \nwill do a great job in representing the law and the American people.\n  I am disappointed some have suggested that maybe Judge Gonzales has \nnot been responsive enough in his confirmation hearings about his role \nas White House Counsel. He was at the committee hearings for over 6 \nhours of questioning, and 450 questions were submitted to him after the \nhearings. He answered all of them--over 200 pages of single-spaced \nresponses to Senators.\n  To put this in context, President Clinton's nominee, Janet Reno, \nreceived 35 questions. Alberto Gonzales received 450 questions.\n  I think it is a very important point to make that Judge Gonzales has \nbeen forthcoming. He has answered every question, either in the open \nforum, or in 6 hours of hearings, or in the 200 pages of written \nanswers to questions that were submitted after the hearings by \nSenators. No one can claim this man has not been forthcoming.\n  In an article in the December 25, 2004, Christmas Day, Houston \nChronicle entitled, ``A Dem on Gonzalez,'' a Democrat and former \ncolleague of Judge Gonzales, Lynne Liberato, now a partner in the \nHouston office of Haynes and Boone wrote: `` . . . in the back of my \nmind [over the past four years] I have taken solace in the fact that \nthe President had an adviser like Al. Certainly, I wish he were a \nDemocrat, appointed by a Democratic President. But we lost. This \nPresident has the right to appoint the attorney general, and I do not \nthink the President could have done better.''\n  In addition, I have to say how very impressed I am with the new \nSenator Salazar from Colorado, who I am told made a speech in his \ncaucus yesterday in which he said, Please vote for Alberto Gonzales. I \ndo not know firsthand what he said or exactly what his words were, but \nSenator Salazar has taken a position on principle. He took a position \non principle on behalf of Dr. Condoleezza Rice and has done so with \nAlberto Gonzales. I must say I respect and admire his willingness to \nstep up to the plate and talk about the record\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nand the principle of giving the President his nominee, and I commend \nSenator Salazar for that bipartisan effort.\n  I hope my colleagues will not use this debate to continue to attack \nthe President. I hope today is filled with speeches about Alberto \nGonzales, about his qualifications, and about his background. I hope we \nwill stay on the issue of Attorney General of the United States. I have \nseen the rhetoric go in a different direction, both for Secretary of \nState Dr. Condoleezza Rice and for our nominee for Attorney General, \nAlberto Gonzales. I don't think this is the time to be attacking the \nPresident. There is plenty of opportunity to disagree with the \nPresident of the United States. Our duty today in this body is to give \nadvice and consent on the nomination of Judge Alberto Gonzales to be \nAttorney General of the United States.\n\n  I am very hopeful we will be able to take this opportunity to do the \nright thing, to confirm Judge Gonzales as Attorney General of the \nUnited States, the first Hispanic American who will hold the office of \nAttorney General. He is a remarkable leader. He has shown great \nstrength and resolve during a difficult time for our country. \nFurthermore, he has a record of public service over years that shows \nhis remarkable character. He is a man who will be a great Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  I think it is going to be a very important vote that we will see \ntomorrow.\n  I hope during the debate yesterday the Democratic colleagues decided \nthey will say their peace, hopefully on the merits or whatever they \nthink of the qualifications of Judge Gonzales, and I hope the vote will \ncome soon. We need to allow the President to fill his Cabinet so they \ncan take over in a reasonable time frame.\n  I hope we can have the full debate today. It would be my hope we \nwould have an early vote tomorrow. If people do not have anything else \nto say, let us have a vote. Let us allow Alberto Gonzales to be \nconfirmed and take the oath of office and get about the business of our \ncountry.\n  There is no reason to hold him up. He is going to be confirmed. I \nthink it was a mistake to hold Condoleezza Rice for hours and hours and \nhours. It was not the right thing for our country. I hope that for \nAlberto Gonzales we realize there is going to be a huge responsibility \non his shoulders and he needs to be able to start. He needs to put a \ndeputy in place, to see what is happening in the Department and have \nthe time to make the appropriate adjustments. The Attorney General of \nthe United States is essential to an efficient Justice Department. \nThere are many issues he faces. The sooner he gets started, the better.\n  I hope the President's State of the Union speech tonight will allow \nhim to lay out his case for the future of our country, and then I hope \nwe can early tomorrow confirm Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General \nof the United States.\n  I am very pleased one of our new Senators from the State of Florida \nhas arrived on the floor. He is certainly a person, having served in \nthe President's Cabinet, who knows how important it is to have a fair \ndiscussion and then go forward.\n  I would like to yield the floor to Senator Martinez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, good morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent to deliver a portion of my remarks in \nSpanish, and that a copy of my speech in English and in Spanish appear \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Judge Alberto Gonzales to be our next Attorney General of \nthe United States.\n  As a freshman Senator, I was frankly hoping to wait a little longer \nbefore speaking for the first time on the Senate floor. It is a \nprivilege I take very seriously. However, I could not fail to speak in \ndefense of Judge Gonzales. I am disappointed that he has been the \nsubject of such partisan attack, and today I rise in the defense of a \ngood man and a good friend.\n  Al Gonzales is a very dedicated public servant and exceptionally \nqualified to serve our Nation as our next Attorney General.\n  In January of 2001, President Bush chose Judge Gonzales to be Counsel \nto the President, and he has served his Nation well in that position.\n  Judge Gonzales was appointed to the Texas Supreme Court in 1999, and \nfrom December of 1997 to January of 1999, he served as Texas's 100th \nSecretary of State.\n  I am so proud.\n  Judge Gonzales also has received a number of awards. He was inducted \ninto the Hispanic Scholarship Fund Alumni Hall of Fame in 2003, and he \nwas honored with the Good Neighbor Award from the United States-Mexico \nChamber of Commerce.\n  I was honored when he and I both received the President's awards from \nthe United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and from the League of \nUnited Latin American Citizens, probably the largest Hispanic \norganization in America.\n  These are just a handful of many professional accolades Judge \nGonzales has been awarded over the course of his very distinguished \ncareer.\n  I know a lot has been said about Judge Gonzales's life story. It is a \nstory of the fulfillment of the American dream. It is a story that \nresonates with all Americans, but especially with Hispanic Americans. \nWe view his story with pride and many view it with hope for their own \nlives.\n  As a fellow Hispanic American, I want to put this nomination of Judge \nAlberto Gonzales in a very specific perspective. Our Hispanic community \nhas broken key racial barriers in both Government and industry. I am so \nproud to have been part of that progress, thanks to the help of many \nwho have opened doors and others who have been enlightened enough to \nmake opportunities available to Hispanic people in America.\n  I was honored to serve as this Nation's twelfth Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development. I am thrilled to represent the great State of \nFlorida as our Nation's first Cuban-American Senator. It is a wonderful \nhonor, but I also feel a tremendous weight of responsibility from that \nvery important opportunity.\n  In the case of Attorney General, no Hispanic American has ever been \nin the position of Government at that level. No Hispanic American has \never served in one of the four premier Cabinet positions. I have sat at \nthat Cabinet table, and I know what an immense privilege it is to sit \nin with the Counsel of the President of the United States. But I also \nknow very well that there are four seats at that Cabinet table that \nhave never before been occupied by a Hispanic. They are the Secretary \nof State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, and Attorney \nGeneral. These are the original Cabinet positions. These are the \npositions that are at the heart of the most important positions of our \nGovernment. Never in the history of our Nation has the Hispanic \nAmerican or Latino had the opportunity to occupy that seat. Judge \nGonzales will be the first Hispanic American to serve in one of the \nCabinet's top four positions when he becomes our next Attorney General. \nThis is a breakthrough of incredible magnitude for Hispanic Americans \nand should not be diluted by bipartisan politics.\n  Judge Gonzales is a role model for the next generation of Hispanic \nAmericans in this country--a role model to our young people who, \nfrankly, have too few.\n  Just this past weekend, Congresswoman Sue Kelly was relating a story \nto me of something that happened with her recently at a school she was \nvisiting in her district. She told me of something that I know to be a \nfact; it has happened in my own life. She said, While I was visiting \nthere, one of the young people came to me, a Latino, a Hispanic, a \nyoung person, and said to me, Do you know we now have our own Senator. \nThat young person was speaking of me or perhaps of Senator Salazar from \nColorado. But this young person knew and took pride in the fact that we \nwere here as role models for them, as someone who could signal the \nopportunities that lie ahead in their own life. Attorney General \nGonzales will resonate through the Hispanic community just as he has \nresonated throughout our community; that he has been the President's \nlawyer--not an insignificant thing for him to have done.\n  He is already and will continue to be an inspiration to these young \nstudents.\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\nThere will be Hispanic boys and girls across the country who will now \naspire to be lawyers because of Judge Gonzales's example of what is \npossible and how it is possible that someone with his very humble \nbeginnings could achieve all he has achieved if only they dare to dream \nin our great Nation.\n  And to Hispanic Americans throughout our Nation:\n  Y a los Hispano-Americanos a lo largo y ancho de esta gran nacion: \ntanto a nuestros ninos, como a nuestros estudiantes de Derecho y los \npadres y abuelos que han venido a America a crear una vida mejor para \nellos y sus familias, hoy les tengo un mensaje:\n  El Juez Gonzales es uno de nosotros. El representa todos nuestros \nsuenos y esperanzas para nuestros hijos. Debemos reconocer la \nimportancia de este momento--sobre todo para nuestra juventud. No \npodemos permitir que la politiqueria nos quite este momento que nos \nenorgullece a todos. Apoyemos a Alberto Gonzales.\n  From our schoolchildren, to law students, to parents and grandparents \nwho came to America to create a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies in the United States, I have this message for you today: Judge \nGonzales is one of us. He represents all of our hopes and dreams for \nour children and for all of us as Hispanic Americans. Let us \nacknowledge the importance of this moment, especially for our young \npeople. We cannot allow petty politicking to deny this moment that \nfills all with such pride. Let us all support Alberto Gonzales.\n  I am honored to have my first remarks on the Senate floor be in \npraise of a friend, Alberto Gonzales, to be our next and I think \nexceptional Attorney General. Not only have I known Mr. Gonzales as a \ncolleague in government service where I have known of his incredible \ndedication, the incredibly long hours he has put in, the very difficult \ndays we all faced in the days following the tragic moments after \nSeptember 11 when our Nation was attacked, the tremendous weight of \nresponsibility that fell on him in the months and years that came after \nthat, but I look forward to casting my vote in the Senate for our \nNation's first, and in this historic moment, our next Attorney General, \nthe first Hispanic to occupy that office.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Judge Gonzales's nomination. \nI urge them to rise above the moment to see the greatness of this \nopportunity, to not lose this moment that we can all make history.\n  We can all make history. I look forward to being a part of that with \nmy vote for Judge Gonzales.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I congratulate our new colleague, Senator Martinez, on \nhis initial speech in the Senate. I bet the Senator will be cited by \nSenator Byrd who is an encyclopedia of statistics. I am sure this is \nthe first time we have had a bilingual speech in the Senate.\n  I say to my colleagues, the Senator could not have picked a more \nimportant topic upon which to first speak on the Senate floor. We are \ngrateful he is here. We listened carefully to every word, and we thank \nyou for what you are doing for the nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, while the Senator from Florida is still in \nthe Senate Chamber, I congratulate him for his first speech in the \nSenate. I have come to know him as an exceptional public servant. It is \nfitting he should speak to this issue, the nomination of Judge Alberto \nGonzales to be Attorney General of the United States in his first \nspeech. Frankly, I am honored to follow his remarks. They will be not \nnearly as eloquent, but I hope, nevertheless, persuasive in support of \nJudge Gonzales's nomination.\n  This is a historic opportunity for America, and especially for me and \nthe constituents in my State, so many of whom are Spanish, are \nHispanic, and can understand how significant it is for a young man to \nrise literally from Humble, TX, where Alberto Gonzales grew up, to \nreach the pinnacles of power in American Government. They know it does \nnot come easy. Many of them have suffered the same kind of background \nthat could limit a person like Alberto Gonzales but in his case did not \nbecause of the support and love of his family and the strength and \nfortitude that he characterizes and the hard work that enabled him to \nprogress from these humble beginnings, literally in Humble, TX, all the \nway through our finest educational institutions into one of the finest \nlaw firms of this country, and eventually into government when then-\nGovernor George Bush discovered this fine young lawyer and asked him to \nfill a number of appointed positions in the State of Texas.\n  I was struck by one of the stories that has probably been repeated. \nIt bears repeating. Senator Salazar, in introducing Alberto Gonzales to \nthe Judiciary Committee, on which I sit, for his hearing, related the \nstory of how Judge Gonzales had recalled in his upbringing the fact \nthat during his high school years he never asked his friends to come \nover to his house because, he said: Even though my father poured his \nheart into that house, I was embarrassed that 10 of us lived in a \ncramped space with no hot running water or telephone.\n  That is the situation in which this young man grew up. Yet, as I \nsaid, he was the first person in his family to go to college. He ended \nup graduating from Rice. As a young man he sold pop in the grandstands, \ndreaming one day of attending that university and graduated from \nHarvard Law School. After joining a prestigious law firm in Texas, he \ncaught the eye of George Bush, who appointed him general counsel and \nthen secretary of state, and eventually to the Supreme Court of the \nState of Texas and, of course, as counsellor to the President of the \nUnited States when he was elected President.\n  President Bush has had the opportunity to take the measure of this \nman and to work with him over many years and to appreciate the talents \nhe can bring to the Department of Justice of the United States. \nFrankly, it is for that reason I think even though some on the other \nside of the aisle have reservations about Judge Gonzales, they \ncertainly ought to give this man the benefit of the doubt. If anyone \ndeserves the benefit of the doubt it is a person like Alberto Gonzales.\n  Is he perfect? No; none of us are. It seems to me the President, \nhaving known this man for so long and having relied upon him \npersonally, would be given some deference in the selection of his \nnominee, especially given the fact that against great odds Alberto \nGonzales has achieved so much in his life.\n\n  One word about some of the opposition. I don't think people who are \nwatching should be overly concerned about the attacks relating to the \nsubject of terror with respect to Judge Gonzales. They have nothing to \ndo with Judge Gonzales. Their way of articulating frustration and \nopposition to the President's policies with respect to the war in \nIraq--and it is unfortunate that sometimes these political statements \nand opposition are reflected in the context of a nominee for office--\nthis is an opportunity for members of the opposition to make their case \nagainst the President when they have an opportunity to speak to the \nSecretary of State's nomination or the Attorney General's nomination or \nother public officials.\n  But it is too bad for those public officials because, as I said in \nthe case of Alberto Gonzales, most of what has been said has nothing to \ndo with him. He is accused in one case of offering advice to the \nPresident with respect to a treaty, and that advice was absolutely \ncorrect. In the other case, he is accused regarding the content of a \nmemo he did not author, and therefore it is not his responsibility.\n  Do not be deceived by some of these discussions that might cause you \nto wonder what does this subject of terror have to do with Judge \nGonzales. In this case, the answer is essentially nothing.\n  Back to the point that was the central theme of the Senator from \nFlorida, there are a lot of people in this country who are qualified to \nbe Attorney General of the United States--a relatively small number but \nnevertheless a lot of people the President could have chosen. It is \nsignificant he chose Alberto Gonzales. He is clearly qualified. When \nsomeone is qualified and has the confidence of the President, as \nAlberto Gonzales does, it seems to me those in this body--unless there \nis some highly\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\ndisqualifying factor brought to our attention--should accede to the \nPresident's request for his nomination and confirm the individual.\n  There is an extra special reason this is meaningful to me. That is \nbecause of the number of Hispanics in my State of Arizona and their \naspirations and their pride at the achievements they have accomplished.\n  As the Senator from Florida pointed out, it is important for this \ncountry to recognize the kind of talent Alberto Gonzales represents and \nto hold that up as an inspiration to young people to let them know, \nregardless of their race or ethnicity, if they work hard, even when \nthey come from humble beginnings, this country offers opportunities \nthat are not available in any other country, and regardless of their \nbackground they have the opportunity to become the Attorney General of \nthe United States of America.\n  That is a tremendous testament to this country. It is a testament to \nthe Senate which has allowed people like Alberto Gonzales to have an \nopportunity, to the President for his perspicacity in nominating such \nan individual for Attorney General. It would be a very strong message \nnot only around this country but around the world for the Senate to \nconfirm the nomination of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, a member of the Judiciary Committee, who has done a wonderful \njob on that committee. It is a tough committee, but he has done a \nterrific job. That was an outstanding statement on behalf of Alberto \nGonzales.\n  Looking at this man's incredible background and how far he has come \nclearly shows the great country that America is and the great \nperseverance and intellect that Alberto Gonzales has.\n  I yield the time he may consume to the Senator from New Hampshire, \nMr. Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to rise today in support \nof a native son of Texas. The Senator represents Texas so well in this \nChamber.\n  Alberto Gonzales, as has been outlined by many of the speakers, is an \nAmerican success story. What an incredible story. There is no point in \nplowing ground that has already been plowed numerous times, but still \nit is nice to see this happen. It is nice to see someone of such \nextraordinary capability rise to such success. It is the American way \nto reward ability. We as a nation open our arms to people who are \nproductive, concerned citizens who are willing to give of themselves \nnot only to produce a better life for them and their family but also to \nproduce a better life for their fellow citizenry, which is exactly what \nJudge Gonzales has done.\n  With his talent he could have simply gone out and made a huge amount \nof money. The dollars that might have been available to him in private \npractice, it is hard to anticipate how much that would be, but it would \nhave been considerable. Instead, at considerable financial sacrifice, I \nsuspect, he has been willing to participate in public service. He has \nexcelled at it both as a judge in Texas and as a counsel to the \nPresident in Washington.\n  Now he has been put forth as the nominee of the President to serve as \nAttorney General. I think it is an unfortunate reflection of the \npartisanship on the other side, to be very honest, that his character \nhas been impugned, that his purposes have been impugned, that his \nintegrity has been questioned, and that his record of commitment to \npublic service has been brought into question, not necessarily, I \nthink, because of what he has done, because what he has done has been \nas an extraordinarily successful public servant and exceptional \njustice, an exceptional counsel to the President, but simply because I \nbelieve Members on the other side wish to highlight their political \ndifferences, using Judge Gonzales as their stalking-horse to accomplish \nthat, and have been willing to attempt to undermine such an American \nsuccess story for the purposes of promoting what amounts to petty \npolitical gain.\n  It is unfortunate, unfortunate indeed, because the office of Attorney \nGeneral has a tradition in this Nation, and especially in the post-\nWorld War II period, of being an office which has always had appointed \nto it high-quality individuals who have been very close to the \nPresidency. That also is a logical choice.\n  I think it is important to focus on that fact, that the Attorney \nGeneral's position, in the post-World War II period at least, has been \na position which has come to play a little different role than maybe it \nhas historically played in the sense that it has been a position where \nPresidents have chosen people who they have had absolute personal \nconfidence in, not people who necessarily are chosen because they \nbalance a political ticket or political theme or regional need. The \nimportance of having an Attorney General in whom a President has \nconfidence has been the critical element of choosing that individual.\n  I guess the best example of that, of course, is the Presidency of \nJohn Kennedy, when he chose his brother Robert Kennedy, who clearly had \nvery little experience. He had, of course, been counsel for hearings \nhere in the Senate dealing with corruption and labor corruption issues \ninvolving the Teamsters Union, but he had not had a great breadth of \nexperience. He was a fresh face, to be kind, in the area of public \npolicy. He was chosen by President Kennedy, which was a choice of \nsignificant implications in that the President of the United States \nwould actually choose his brother to serve as Attorney General.\n  It turned out to be a great choice. Robert Kennedy was probably one \nof the strongest and most effective Attorneys General, certainly of \nthat period, who drove a great deal of the important issues that were \ndecided in the area of civil rights and in the area of fighting \ncorruption, especially organized crime, organized crime in labor union \nactivity.\n  The reason that Robert Kennedy is sort of the prototypical \nappointment in the post-World War II period is because it reflected the \nfact that the President, President John Kennedy, felt so strongly that \nhe needed in the Attorney General's position someone in whom he had \nabsolutely unequivocal confidence and who was going to be there as an \nassistant and as a force to carry forward his policies.\n  That attitude has moved forward throughout this period. Attorney \nGeneral Reno, who I had the opportunity to work with extensively during \nher term in office, initially started out in that role also, I believe. \nCertainly John Ashcroft has had that position. Now, in sort of a \nrestatement, in a way, of the Robert Kennedy role, President Bush has \nchosen his closest legal adviser, Alberto Gonzales, who has a much \nstronger resume than Robert Kennedy had but who has the same historic \nposition in that he is going to be able to carry forth the decisions of \nthis President and operate as a confidant of this President in a manner \nwhich is uniquely important to the Attorney General's role.\n\n  Obviously, the Attorney General has an obligation to be the law \nenforcement officer of our Nation, to be a fair arbiter, to be a \nspokesperson who has integrity on issues, and to speak clearly to the \nadministration of what is right and wrong, and how it should move \nforward effectively on issues, in a way that does not compromise the \nadministration. Judge Gonzales has done that. He has done that time and \ntime again in his role as White House Counsel. He understands his new \nrole as Attorney General in that context.\n  But the attacks on Judge Gonzales do not go to this role, they go \nmore to a disagreement which people from the other side have over this \nadministration's policy relative to Iraq in an attempt to bootstrap \nJudge Gonzales's nomination into a major confrontation on the issues of \nwhether we are doing correct things in Iraq. That, to me, is \ninappropriate relative to the confirmation process.\n  There is no question we should debate Iraq. That should be a matter \nof open and continuous debate in this Senate. It is the most important \ninternational policy issue we have going on today. I have no hesitation \nabout debating it. But I do not believe we should use an individual who \nis a nominee for a major office within the Cabinet as a stalking-horse \nfor the purposes of making attacks on the Presidency, unless there is \nsome clear relationship there. In this case there is none that is so \nsubstantive and appropriate that it rises to the level of opposition of \nthe\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\nAttorney General nominee, in my opinion.\n  The individual we have before us as a nominee, Judge Gonzales, is \nsuch a unique and extraordinary success story, who so eloquently \ndefines the American dream, as we all love to profess to our different \nconstituencies, to talk about how people succeed in attaining the \nAmerican dream. Whenever I go into a classroom, especially an \nelementary or middle school classroom, I talk about how you can be \nanything. All you have to do is work hard, stay in school, study hard, \nand make a commitment to being an honest person, a person who has high \nvalues, and a person who is committed to working hard, and you can \naccomplish just about anything.\n  That is what we say to our youth in this country. That is what we say \nto people who come to our land as immigrants. Judge Gonzales \npersonifies that statement. For some Members of this Senate to be \ntaking such a negative approach in addressing his nomination, and \ndefining his individual characteristics as not fulfilling those \nconcepts of the American dream is, I think, a disservice to the people \nwho, like Judge Gonzales, have succeeded in America.\n  This is a unique person whom we are very fortunate to have as a \nnominee to be Attorney General of the United States. His confirmation \nwill stand as a statement of opportunity to tens of thousands, hundreds \nof thousands, potentially millions of Americans, especially Americans \nwho have come here from Hispanic cultures, that America is a land of \nopportunity, that the American dream does exist for you, that if you \nwork hard, that if you are a person of integrity, that if you commit \nyourself to your goals, you can succeed, and America will reward you in \nthat success and acknowledge it.\n  So I believe very strongly that the choice of Judge Gonzales is an \nextraordinarily strong one, that it is consistent with the tradition of \nAttorney General choices in the post-World War II period, and that, \nmore importantly, it is a statement by this President that he \nunderstands the American dream is personified in Judge Gonzales, and \nthat it should be rewarded and should be respected.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the \nRepublican time to the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nChambliss, and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to speak \nuntil 10:32 or until the Democrats arrive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \ngreat leadership on this issue, particularly organizing the support on \nthe floor this morning for Judge Gonzales.\n  I do rise in support of Alberto Gonzales to be confirmed as the next \nAttorney General for the United States. I had the pleasure of serving \non the Judiciary Committee for the past 2 years, having gone off at the \nbeginning of this session. But during the course of my 2 years as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, I had the opportunity to be involved \nin the hearings, the discussions, and the review of a number of issues \nto which Judge Gonzales has spoken during the course of his \nconfirmation process.\n  One of those issues is the administration's policy on torture, for \nwhich the judge has been unduly criticized by folks who are in \nopposition to his nomination. I want to respond to some of the \nridiculous accusations of those who are opposed to this confirmation, \nand talk about some of the actual facts involved, which seem to be \nmissing from the conversations on the floor coming from his critics and \nfrom those who are opposed.\n  I do not think Judge Gonzales nor could the administration be more \nclear than they have been on the policy and the subject of torture. As \nPresident Bush stated at his January 26, 2005, press conference:\n\n       Al Gonzales reflects our policy, and that is we don't \n     sanction torture.\n\n  In all of his statements and responses, Judge Gonzales has emphasized \nthat there is a distinct difference between what the law would allow \nand what the administration policy is. No matter how the obligations of \nthe United States under the Constitution, treaties, and various \nstatutes have been interpreted, the President has said he would never \norder or condone torture. That is the policy. That is what Alberto \nGonzales has represented and does represent today.\n  President Bush's February 7, 2002, memorandum to, among others, the \nVice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the \nAttorney General, and the Director of Central Intelligence \nunequivocally required those detained by the U.S. Armed Forces to be \ntreated humanely. The President stated:\n\n       Of course, our values as a Nation, values that we share \n     with many nations in the world, call for us to treat \n     detainees humanely, including those who are not legally \n     entitled to such treatment. Our Nation has been and will \n     continue to be a strong supporter of Geneva and its \n     principles. As a matter of policy, the United States Armed \n     Forces shall continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the \n     extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in \n     a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva. . . . I \n     hereby reaffirm the order previously issued by the Secretary \n     of Defense to the United States Armed Forces requiring that \n     the detainees be treated humanely and, to the extent \n     appropriate and consistent with military necessity, \n     consistent with the principles of Geneva.\n\n  It could not be clearer. It absolutely could not be clearer. And it \nis not something that he said which is the subject of interpretation; \nit is something which the President committed to writing and for which \nJudge Gonzales stands.\n  Judge Gonzales has unmistakably, forcefully, and consistently made \nclear before, during, and after his confirmation hearing that it is not \nthe policy of the United States to condone torture and that he \npersonally does not condone torture.\n  At a June 22, 2004, press briefing, before his confirmation hearing--\nindeed, well before he was even a nominee--Judge Gonzales stated:\n\n       The administration has made clear before, and I will \n     reemphasize today that the President has not authorized, \n     ordered or directed in any way any activity that would \n     transgress the standards of the torture conventions or the \n     torture statute, or other applicable laws.\n\n  He continued later:\n\n       [I]f there still remains any question, let me say that the \n     U.S. will treat people in our custody in accordance with all \n     U.S. obligations including federal statutes, the U.S. \n     Constitution and our treaty obligations. The President has \n     said we do not condone or commit torture. Anyone engaged in \n     conduct that constitutes torture will be held accountable.\n       The President has not directed the use of specific \n     interrogation techniques. There has been no presidential \n     determination of necessity or self-defense that would allow \n     conduct that constitutes torture. There has been no \n     presidential determination that circumstances warrant the use \n     of torture to protect the mass security of the United States.\n\n  I have several more pages of statements that were made by Judge \nGonzales in his confirmation hearing that directly apply to this issue. \nThey have been consistent. They have been very clear. They have been \nconcise to the effect that Judge Gonzales has never condoned the use of \ntorture. It is not the administration policy to condone torture. Why in \nthe world folks on the other side continue to criticize this man for \nsomething he has not said or has not condoned should be pretty obvious \nto the American people. There is a reason for it, but the reason simply \ndoesn't hold water.\n  Who is this man? That is the more important question. Who is Alberto \nGonzales? Is he qualified to become Attorney General of the United \nStates? Judge Gonzales grew up as a humble man. He is a Hispanic \nAmerican who grew up, interestingly enough, in a two-bedroom house in \nHumble, TX, that his father and uncle built and where his mother still \nresides. His parents were never educated beyond elementary school, and \nhe was the first person in his family to go to college. He is a \ngraduate of Texas public schools, Rice University, and Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  Judge Gonzales served in the U.S. Air Force between 1973 and 1975 and \nattended the U.S. Air Force Academy between 1975 and 1977. He is \nmarried and has three sons. While his family lived in Houston, TX, he \npracticed with one of the best firms in America, and having practiced \nlaw for 26 years myself\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nand having associated with the firm of which he was a member, not \nknowing that in fact he was, I am very familiar with the firm. It is \nnot just one of the best firms in Texas; it is one of the best firms in \nAmerica. They don't hire lawyers who are not competent and capable to \nget the job done. That is exactly what Judge Gonzales is--competent and \ncapable.\n  He was commissioned as Counsel to President George W. Bush in January \nof 2001, obviously showing what kind of confidence the President of the \nUnited States has in the man. Prior to serving in the White House, he \nserved as a justice of the Supreme Court of Texas. Before his \nappointment to the Texas Supreme Court in 1999, he served as Texas's \n100th secretary of state; that being from December of 1997 to January \nof 1999.\n  Among his many duties as secretary of state, he was a senior adviser \nto then-Governor Bush, chief elections officer, and the Governor's \nliaison on Mexico and border issues.\n  Simply stated, this man, unlike a lot of folks coming out of the same \nkinds of conditions in which he grew up, made a decision that he wanted \nto improve the quality of life for himself and for his family. He \nworked hard. He studied hard. He became a lawyer, something that nobody \nelse in his family could ever do before him. He practiced law in one of \nthe largest States in our country with one of the largest law firms in \nthat particular State. He was a dadgum good lawyer. Obviously the \nPresident of the United States has confidence in him from the \nstandpoint of looking to him for legal advice.\n  All of the criticisms directed at him have nothing to do with his \nability to operate and practice as a lawyer, and in his capacity as \nAttorney General, he will be the No. 1 lawyer in the country. I submit \nto all of my colleagues that he is qualified for this job. I ask for \ntheir support of Judge Gonzales to be confirmed as the next Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, after every war, history is written. There \nare stories of courage, compassion, and glory, and stories of cruelty, \nweakness, and shame.\n  When history is written of our war on terrorism, it will record the \nmillions of acts of heroism, kindness, and sacrifice performed by \nAmerican troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other nations. And it will \nrecord as well the stunning courage of Iraqi men and women standing in \nline last Sunday, defying the terrorist bullets and bombs to vote in \nthe first free election of their lives.\n  But sadly, history will also recall that after 9/11, and after the \ninvasion of Iraq, some in America concluded our Nation could no longer \nafford to stand by time-honored principles of humanity, principles of \nhumane conduct embodied in the law of the land and respected by \nPresidents of both political parties for generations.\n  Next to the image of Saddam Hussein's statue dragged from its \npedestal to the dirt below will be the horrifying image of the hooded \nprisoner at Abu Ghraib, standing on a makeshift pedestal, tethered to \nelectrical wires.\n  Alberto Gonzales is a skilled lawyer. His life story is nothing short \nof inspiring. I have the greatest respect for his success, for what he \nhas achieved, and for the obstacles he has overcome.\n  But this debate is not about Mr. Gonzales's life story. This debate \nis about whether, in the age of terrorism, America will continue to be \na nation based on the rule of law, or whether we, out of fear, abandon \ntime-tested values. That is what is at issue.\n  The war in Iraq is more dangerous today because of the scandal at Abu \nGhraib prison. Our conduct has been called into question around the \nworld. Our moral standing has been challenged, and now we are being \nasked to promote a man who was at the center of the debate over \nsecretive policies that created an environment that led to Abu Ghraib.\n  What happened at Abu Ghraib? What continues to happen at Guantanamo? \nWhat happened to the standards of civilized conduct America proudly \nfollowed and demanded of every other nation in the world?\n  Some dismiss these horrible acts as the demented conduct of only a \nfew, the runaway emotions of renegade night shift soldiers, the \ninevitable passions and fears of men living in the charnel house of \nwar. But we now know that if there was unspeakable cruelty in those \ndimly lit prison cells, there was also a cruel process underway in the \nbrightly lit corridors of power in Washington.\n  At the center of this process, at the center of this administration's \neffort to redefine the acceptable and legal treatment of prisoners and \ndetainees was Alberto Gonzales, Counsel to President George W. Bush. \nAnd with the skill that only lawyers can bring, Mr. Gonzales, Assistant \nAttorney General Jay Bybee and others found the loopholes, invented the \nweasel words and covered the whole process with winks and nods.\n  At the very least, Mr. Gonzales helped to create a permissive \nenvironment that made it more likely that abuses would take place. You \ncan connect the dots from the administration's legal memos to the \nDefense Department's approval of abusive interrogation techniques for \nGuantanamo Bay, to Iraq and Abu Ghraib, where those tactics migrated.\n  Blaming Abu Ghraib completely on night shift soldiers ignores \ncritical decisions on torture policy made at the highest levels of our \nGovernment, decisions that Mr. Gonzales played a major role in making. \nIf we are going to hold those at the lowest levels accountable, it is \nonly fair to hold those at the highest levels accountable as well.\n  Let's review what we know.\n  First, Mr. Gonzales recommended to the President that the Geneva \nConventions should not apply to the war on terrorism. In a January 2002 \nmemo to the President, Mr. Gonzales concluded that the war on terrorism \n``renders obsolete'' the Geneva Conventions. This is a memo written by \nthe man who would be Attorney General.\n\n  Colin Powell and the Joint Chiefs of Staff objected strenuously to \nthis conclusion by Alberto Gonzales. They argued that we could \neffectively prosecute a war on terrorism while still living up to the \nstandards of the Geneva Conventions.\n  In a memo to Mr. Gonzales, Secretary of State Colin Powell pointed \nout that the Geneva Conventions would allow us to deny POW status to \nal-Qaida and other terrorists and that they would not limit our ability \nto question a detainee or hold him indefinitely. So, contrary to the \nstatements by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \ncomplying with the Geneva Conventions does not mean giving POW status \nto terrorists. Colin Powell knew that. The Joint Chiefs of Staff knew \nthat. Alberto Gonzales refused to accept that.\n  In his memo to Mr. Gonzales, Secretary Powell went on to say that if \nwe did not apply the Geneva Conventions to the war on terrorism, ``it \nwill reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice . . . and \nundermine the protections of the law of war for our own troops . . . It \nwill undermine public support among critical allies, making military \ncooperation more difficult to sustain.''\n  The President rejected Secretary Powell's wise counsel and instead \naccepted Mr. Gonzales's counsel. He issued a memo concluding that ``new \nthinking in the law of war'' was needed and that the Geneva Conventions \ndo not apply to the war on terrorism.\n  And then what followed? Mr. Gonzales requested, approved, and \ndisseminated this new Justice Department torture memo. This infamous \nmemo narrowly redefined torture as limited only to abuse that causes \npain equivalent to organ failure or death, and concluded that the \ntorture statute which makes torture a crime in America does not apply \nto interrogations conducted under the President's Commander in Chief \nauthority. That was the official Government policy for 2 years.\n  Then relying on the President's Geneva Conventions determination and \nthe Justice Department's new definition of torture, Defense Secretary \nRumsfeld approved numerous abusive interrogation tactics for use \nagainst prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, even as he acknowledged that some \nnations may view those tactics as inhumane. These techniques have \nOrwellian names such as ``environmental manipulation.''\n  The Red Cross has concluded that the use of these methods at \nGuantanamo\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\nwas more than inhumane. It was, in the words of the Red Cross, ``a form \nof torture.''\n  We have recently learned that numerous FBI agents who observed \ninterrogations at Guantanamo Bay complained to their supervisors about \nthe use of these methods, methods which began at the desks of Alberto \nGonzales and the Department of Justice, moving through the Department \nof Defense to Guantanamo Bay. In one e-mail that has been released \nunder the Freedom of Information Act, an FBI agent complained that \ninterrogators were using what he called ``torture techniques.'' This is \nnot from a critic of the United States who believes that we should not \nbe waging a war on terrorism. These are words from the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation.\n  Let me read the graphic language in an e-mail written by another FBI \nagent about what he saw:\n\n       On a couple of occasions, I entered interview rooms to find \n     a detainee chained hand and foot in a fetal position to the \n     floor, with no chair, food or water. Most times they urinated \n     or defecated on themselves, and had been left there for 18-24 \n     hours or more. On one occasion, the air conditioning had been \n     turned down so far and the temperature was so cold in the \n     room, that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold. . . \n     . On another occasion, the [air conditioner] had been turned \n     off, making the temperature in the unventilated room well \n     over 100 degrees. The detainee was almost unconscious on the \n     floor, with a pile of hair next to him. He had apparently \n     been literally pulling his hair out throughout the night. On \n     another occasion, not only was the temperature unbearably \n     hot, but extremely loud rap music was being played in the \n     room, and had been since the day before, with the detainee \n     chained hand and foot in the fetal position on the tile \n     floor.\n\n  These are the words of an agent of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, who viewed the interrogation techniques at Guantanamo, \ntechniques that flowed from the memo that came across Mr. Gonzales's \ndesk to the Department of Defense down to these dimly lit cells. And \nthe Red Cross and the FBI agree that they are torture.\n  I asked Mr. Gonzales: Of the 59 clemency cases he coordinated, how \nmany times did he either recommend clemency, a stay of execution, or \nfurther investigation to resolve any doubts about a condemned inmate's \nguilt?\n  He replied that he could not recall what advice he may have given \nthen-Governor Bush on any of the 59 cases.\n  He also said he never once recommended clemency because he believed \nthat he and the Governor were obligated to follow the recommendations \nof the State Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n  Relying so heavily on the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles might \nnot be troubling if the board's record itself was not so troubling. \nBetween 1973 and 1998, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles received \nmore than 70 appeals of clemency denials. In all those cases, the board \nnever once--not one time--ordered an investigation or held a hearing or \neven conducted a meeting to try to resolve any possible doubts about a \ncase.\n  In fact, according to a 1998 civil suit, some board members do not \neven review case files or skim correspondence they are required to read \nbefore voting on clemency petitions. U.S. District Court Judge Sam \nSparks, who presided over that lawsuit, found, in his words:\n\n       There is nothing, absolutely nothing--that the Board of \n     Pardons and Paroles does where any member of the public, \n     including the Governor, can find out why they did this. I \n     find that appalling.\n\n  Typically, Mr. Gonzales presented a clemency memo to Governor Bush on \nthe day that the inmate was scheduled to be executed. Mr. Gonzales \nwould spend about 30 minutes at some point during the day briefing the \nGovernor before this person was led to execution--30 minutes.\n  Let me tell you about 2 of the 59 people whose clemency requests Mr. \nGonzales handled.\n  Irineo Tristan Montoya was a Mexican national executed in 1997. In \n1986, in police custody, Mr. Montoya signed what he thought was an \nimmigration document. In fact, it was a murder confession. Mr. Montoya \ncould not read a word of it. He spoke no English.\n  Under the Vienna Convention of Consular Affairs, which the U.S. \nratified in 1969 and accepted as our law of the land, Mr. Montoya \nshould have at least been told that he had the right to have a Mexican \nconsular officer contacted on his behalf. He was never informed of this \nright.\n  Mr. Gonzales's clemency memo mentioned none of these facts--not one. \nNews accounts say Mr. Montoya was convicted almost entirely on the \nstrength of this confession, a confession which he signed that he could \nnot read or understand.\n  Then there is the case of Carl Johnson. It has become infamous. Mr. \nGonzales's memo on Mr. Johnson's clemency request neglected to mention \nthat Mr. Johnson's lawyer had literally slept through much of the jury \nselection.\n  Mr. Gonzales claims that omission of critical facts such as these do \nnot matter because ``it was quite common that I would have numerous \ndiscussions with the Governor well in advance of a scheduled \nexecution.''\n  However, Governor Bush's logs generally show one, and only one, 30-\nminute meeting for each execution. Thirty minutes for each life. And \nthat meeting generally took place on the scheduled day of the \nexecution.\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing, Mr. Gonzales said: If I were in \ntalking to the Governor about a particular matter and we had an \nopportunity, I would say, ``Governor, we have an execution coming up in \n3 weeks. One of the bases of clemency I'm sure that will be argued is, \nsay, something like mental retardation. These are the issues that have \nto be considered.''\n  The Texas death house was a busy place when Mr. Gonzales was general \ncounsel. In the 6 days from December 6 to December 12, 1995, for \nexample, there were four executions. In the 9 days from May 13 to \nMay 22, 1997, there were six executions. In the 8 days from May 28 to \nJune 4, 1997, there were five executions. In the week from June 11 to \nJune 18, 1997, there were four executions. And during one 5-week period \nfrom May 13 to June 18, 1997, in the State of Texas, there were 15 \nexecutions.\n\n  Even if Mr. Gonzales found an opportunity, as he says, to mention \ncritical details of upcoming executions during meetings on other \ntopics, is that an appropriate or sufficient way to provide a Governor \nwith information he needs to make a life-or-death decision?\n  Did Mr. Gonzales really expect the Governor to be able to keep track \nof these details that were discussed weeks in advance of a decision on \nclemency? Is that reasonable when a person's life is hanging in the \nbalance?\n  Regardless of how one feels about the death penalty, no one--\nabsolutely no one--wants to see an innocent person executed. That is \nnot justice.\n  Over 2,000 years ago, Roman orator Cicero said: Laws are silent in \ntime of war. The men and women who founded this great Nation rejected \nthat notion. They understood that freedom and liberty are not \nweaknesses; they are, in fact, our greatest strengths.\n  In times of war or perceived threat, we have sometimes forgotten that \nbasic truth. And when we have, we have paid dearly for it.\n  In the late 1700s, a war with France seemed imminent. Congress \nresponded by passing the Alien and Sedition Acts. These patently \nunconstitutional laws empowered the President to detain and deport any \nnon-citizen with no due process and made it illegal to publish \nsupposedly ``scandalous and malicious writing'' about our Government.\n  President Lincoln, whom I regard as the greatest of all American \nPresidents, suspended the great writ of habeas corpus during the Civil \nWar.\n  The first red scare during World War I accelerated into the Palmer \nraids after a series of bombings on Wall Street and in Washington, DC. \nPalmer, the U.S. Attorney, ordered roundups of suspected ``reds'' and \nsummarily deported thousands of aliens, often with little evidence of \nwrongdoing and no due process.\n  We all know the tragic story of Japanese immigrants and U.S. citizens \nof Japanese ancestry being rounded up and placed in internment camps \nduring World War II.\n  Another moment that I recall, as I stand here today, is when I served \nin the House of Representatives and heard two of my colleagues who were \nCongressmen at the time, Japanese Americans, come forward to explain \nwhat happened to them, how they were literally told the night before in \ntheir homes in California by their parents to pack up their little \nbelongings, put them in a suitcase, and be prepared to\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\nget on a train in the morning. Bob Matsui was one of those. He just \npassed away a few weeks ago.\n  Bob Matsui understood what discrimination could really be. What was \nhis sin? He was born of Japanese American parents. That is a fact of \nlife, and it was a fact that changed his life dramatically. He and \nothers were taken off to internment camps without a trial, without a \nhearing, simply because they were suspected of being unpatriotic.\n  During the Cold War, our Nation, fearful of communism, descended into \na red scare of McCarthyism, witch hunts, and black lists that destroyed \nthe lives of thousands of decent people.\n  In the 1960s, the Government infiltrated many organizations and \ncompiled files on its own citizens simply for attending meetings of \ncivil rights or antiwar organizations.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle have compared Mr. Gonzales to one \nof our great Attorneys General, Robert Kennedy. With all due respect to \nMr. Gonzales, he is no Robert Kennedy. Unlike Mr. Gonzales, Robert \nKennedy understood the importance of respecting the rule of law to \nAmerica's soul and our image around the world.\n  Listen to this quote from a speech that Robert Kennedy gave at the \nheight of the Cold War and the civil rights movement. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       We, the American people, must avoid another Little Rock or \n     another New Orleans. We cannot afford them. It is not only \n     that such incidents do incalculable harm to the children \n     involved and to the relations among people, it is not only \n     that such convulsions seriously undermine respect for law and \n     order and cause serious economic and moral damage. Such \n     incidents hurt our country in the eyes of the world. For on \n     this generation of Americans falls the burden of proving to \n     the world that we really mean it when we say all men are \n     created equal and are equal before the law.\n\n  Those were the words of Robert Kennedy, and if you replace Little \nRock and New Orleans with Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, those words ring \ntrue today. Mr. Gonzales does not seem to understand, as Robert Kennedy \ndid, the impact such scandals have on America's soul and image.\n  Today is a critical moment for our Nation. Overseas, our Nation's \nactions and character are being questioned by our critics and our \nenemies. Here at home, we want to feel safer and more secure.\n  There are some who want to repeat the mistakes of our past. They \nthink the best way to protect America is to silence the law in this \ntime of war.\n  Let me tell you about one man who disagrees. His name is Fred \nKorematsu. More than 60 years ago, Mr. Korematsu was a 22-year-old \nstudent and was one of the 120,000 Japanese-American citizens and \nimmigrants who was forced from their homes into these prison camps, \ninternment camps.\n  After Pearl Harbor, Mr. Korematsu tried everything he could think of \nto be accepted as American. He changed his name to Clyde, and even had \ntwo operations to make his eyes appear rounder. He was still forced \ninto Tule Lake, an internment camp in California.\n  He challenged his detention, taking his case all the way to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. In a decision that remains one of the most infamous \ndecisions in the Court's history, the Supreme Court rejected Mr. \nKorematsu's claim and failed to find the internment of Japanese \nAmericans unconstitutional.\n  It would be another 40 years until an American President, Ronald \nReagan, officially apologized for that terrible miscarriage of justice \nand offered small restitution to its victims.\n  Today, Mr. Korematsu is nearly 85 years old. He is recovering from a \nserious illness, but he still loves America and is deeply concerned \nthat we not again abandon our most cherished principles and values. So \nhe has raised his voice, warning his fellow Americans we should not \nrepeat the mistakes of the past.\n  I respect and admire Alberto Gonzales for his inspiring life story \nand the many obstacles he has overcome. Some of my colleagues suggested \nhis life story embodies the American dream. But there is more to the \nAmerican dream than overcoming difficult circumstances to obtain \nprominence and prosperity. We also must honor Fred Korematsu's dream \nthat our country be true to the fundamental principle upon which it was \nfounded: the rule of law.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that the opposition to Al \nGonzales's nomination is all about partisan politics. That could not be \nfurther from the truth. This is about our ability to win the war on \nterrorism while respecting the values that our Nation represents.\n  I cannot in good conscience vote to reward a man who ignored the rule \nof law and the demands of human decency and created the permissive \nenvironment that made Abu Ghraib possible.\n  When the history of these times are recorded, I believe that Abu \nGhraib and Guantanamo will join the names of infamous Japanese-American \ninternment camps such as Manzanar, Heart Mountain, and Tule Lake where \nFred Korematsu and over thousands of others were detained. I cannot in \ngood conscience vote to make the author of such a terrible mistake the \nchief law enforcement officer of our great Nation and the guardian of \nour God-given and most cherished rights.\n  So, Mr. President, I will vote no on the nomination of Alberto \nGonzales to serve as Attorney General of the United States. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of \nAlberto Gonzales to be the next United States Attorney General.\n  It is disappointing to have to oppose this nomination, but based on \nhis record, I believe there is no other choice.\n  Judge Gonzales's life story is a shining example of the American \ndream.\n  From humble beginnings he rose to serve on the Texas Supreme Court, \nbecome counsel to the President of the United States, and has now been \nnominated for one of the three highest Cabinet positions in the United \nStates.\n  His life story is compelling and admirable, but that alone is not \nenough to support someone for the position of Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  The Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer of the \nFederal Government, and serves as the face for truth and justice in \nthis country.\n  This individual should and must be committed to the sanctity of the \nlaw, protecting the rights and liberties of all people, and ensuring \nthat the laws are obeyed.\n  I believe Judge Gonzales's work as counsel to the President shows him \nto be unfit to perform the duties of the Attorney General.\n  My concern centers on three events during Judge Gonzales's tenure as \ncounsel to the President.\n  His actions during these times cause me to question whether he can \nfulfill the duties of the Attorney General as I just outlined.\n  The first event involves Judge Gonzales asking the United States \nDepartment of Justice to prepare a legal opinion on acceptable \ninterrogation standards that would be allowed under the Convention \nAgainst Torture.\n  This memo became the basis for the standards developed by the Defense \nDepartment's working group on detainee interrogation, which \nsubsequently have been used in Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, and Iraq.\n  The Justice Department memo ignores significant contrary case law, a \nplain reading of the statute, and the legislative history of the law.\n  In doing so, the memo created such a narrow definition of torture \nthat only actions that cause ``equivalent in intensity to the pain \naccompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment \nof bodily function, or even death'' would be considered torture.\n  The analysis included in the memo has been called weak and reckless \nby other lawyers, human rights groups, former officials from this \nadministration, military officers, and military lawyers.\n  However, it appears that Judge Gonzales had no misgivings with the \nmemorandum at the time.\n  In fact, it appears that Judge Gonzales continues to have no concerns \nwith the conclusions of this memo, even though prior to his Senate \nJudiciary Committee hearing, the Department of Justice issued another \nsuperseding memorandum that reaches a much different conclusion.\n  According to the new memorandum, torture is defined as physical \nsuffering ``even if it does not involve severe physical pain.''\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\n  Second, in a memo Judge Gonzales wrote to the President, he advised \nthat the Geneva Conventions did not apply to captured members of al-\nQaida and the Taliban.\n  This was a reversal of longstanding United States policy and practice \nof adhering to the Geneva Conventions.\n  This conclusion is a misstatement and misinterpretation of the Geneva \nConventions.\n  The Geneva Conventions require humane treatment of all captives, \nwhether soldiers, insurgents, or civilians.\n  Additionally, Judge Gonzales also requested a memo concerning the \nGeneva Conventions' effect on the transfer of protected persons from \noccupied territory.\n  This memo led to the creation of the ``ghost detainee program'' in \nIraq, a practice that is against the spirit, plain reading, and any \ninterpretation of the Geneva Conventions.\n  Finally, and most disturbingly, Judge Gonzales has advised the \nPresident that if a legal statute infringes on the authority of the \nPresident as the Commander-In-Chief, then that statute should be \nconsidered unconstitutional and the President could refuse to comply \nwith the law.\n  Such a position is contrary to settled separation of powers case law, \nand has most recently been repudiated by the United States Supreme \nCourt in its decision last year on the rights of detainees.\n  These events lead me to question the willingness of Judge Gonzales \nto, as required, protect the sanctity of the law; protect the rights \nand liberties of all people, not just some, but all; ensure that \nFederal laws are obeyed, and, effectively perform the duties of \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  I am truly saddened to have to oppose the nomination of an Attorney \nGeneral for the first time in my career.\n  However, the Nation's chief law enforcement officer must be required \nto show, beyond any doubt, the utmost respect for the law and an \nunwavering determination to defend the law.\n  Instead, Judge Gonzales's record as counsel to the President points \nto repeated attempts to skirt the law rather than uphold it.\n  I must conclude that given the record before us, Judge Gonzales is \nnot qualified for the job.\n  Following the Iraq prison scandal, Secretary Rumsfeld stated that \npeople should not base their opinion of the United States on the events \nthat occurred there, but on the actions we take thereafter.\n  Therefore, what will be the world's opinion of the United States if \nwe elevate one of the architects of the policies that led to the Iraq \nprison abuses to the position of chief law enforcement officer of our \ncountry?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this morning we have heard many excellent \nspeeches. I commend my colleague from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, for his \nstatement. Yesterday I listened to Senators Feinstein, Schumer, \nKennedy, Mikulski, Dayton and Stabenow on our side, and I thought their \nstatements were very good. Both Senator Durbin of Illinois and I were \nat a hearing this morning and left to come over here. I think his \nstatement was straightforward and comprehensive and compelling. I \nappreciate what has been said.\n  I have also listened to the statements of those who support this \nnominee, most from the other side. I would say one thing, I am glad \nthat none of them are defending torture. I never expected they would. \nNone of them defend what happened at Abu Ghraib. I didn't expect they \nwould. None of them are defending the Bybee memorandum, with its narrow \nlegalistic interpretation of the torture statute. I never thought any \nof them would.\n  None of them defend the outrageous claim that the President of the \nUnited States is above the law. I don't know how anybody could defend \nthat position. One of the things we have learned, from the first George \nW., George Washington, to the current President, is that no President \nis above the law, not even this one. None of us are. Senators are not. \nJudges are not. Nobody is.\n  In fact, some of the people who have spoken have been explicitly \ncritical of the Bybee memo. Unfortunately, the nominee has not joined \nin that criticism. Instead, he told me at his hearing that he agreed \nwith its conclusions. We know that for at least 2 years he did not \ndisagree with the secret policy of this administration.\n  Water flows downhill and so does Government policy in this \nadministration. Somewhere in the upper reaches of this administration a \nprocess was set in motion that rolled forward until it produced \nscandalous results.\n  We may never know the full story. The administration circled the \nwagons. They stonewalled requests for information from both Republicans \nand Democrats. What little we do know, we know because the press has \ndone a far, far, far better job of oversight than the Congress itself. \nWe know it from international human rights organizations because they \nhave done a far better job of oversight than Congress has. We owe it to \na few internal Defense Department investigations, and of course the \nFreedom of Information Act litigation. Thank goodness we have the \nFreedom of Information Act, because Congress, this Congress especially, \nboth bodies, has fallen down for years on their oversight \nresponsibility. It failed, actually refused, to do oversight of an \nadministration of their own party. It is fortunate the Freedom of \nInformation Act is there.\n  Every administration, Democrat and Republican, will tell you all the \nthings they believe they have done right. None will tell you the things \nthey believe they have done wrong. Normally it is the job of the \nCongress to root that out. We have not been doing our job. Fortunately \nthe press and others, through the Freedom of Information Act, have.\n  Despite repeated requests both before and during and after judge \nGonzales's confirmation hearing, there is much we still do not know. We \ngave this nominee every possibility before, during, and after his \nhearing to clarify this. I even sent to him and to the Republicans on \nthe committee, well in advance of the hearing, a description of the \ntypes of questions I would ask on this particular matter so there would \nbe no surprises and so that he would have a chance to answer them. He \ndidn't.\n  We do know that he was chairing meetings and requesting memos and \nchecking up on those memos as various Government agencies were being \ntasked with eroding long-established U.S. policy on torture.\n  Just this week, the New York Times reported the Justice Department \nproduced a second torture memo to address the legality of specific \ninterrogation techniques proposed by the CIA. So much for the \nproponents' argument that these memoranda were research memos with \nlittle real-world impact.\n  That second torture memo, which the administration refused to provide \nto the Judiciary Committee, reportedly used the very narrow and thus \npermissive interpretation of the torture statute outlined in the first \nmemorandum. The administration will not come clean from behind the \nstone wall it has constructed to deter accountability for its actions. \nDoes anyone believe this memo was generated without knowledge of the \nWhite House, without its approval?\n  The President said he chose Judge Gonzales because of his sound \njudgment in shaping the administration's terrorism policies. But the \nglimpses we have seen of secret policy formulations and legal \nrationales that have come to light show that his judgements have not \nbeen sound.\n  Look at his role with respect to the Bybee memo. This is the memo \nthat noted legal scholar Dean Koh of the Yale Law School called, \n``perhaps the most clearly erroneous legal opinion I have ever read.'' \nHe went on to say it is ``a stain upon our law and our national \nreputation.''\n  In remarks yesterday, Republican Senators, quite correctly in my view \nand the view of many others who studied it, said the Bybee memo was \n``erroneous in its legal conclusions. . . .'' They call the memo's \ninterpretation of what constitutes torture ``very, very extreme . . . \ncertainly not a realistic or adequate definition of torture which would \nwithstand legal analysis or legal scrutiny.''\n  I commend them for doing that. I commend them for saying the \nmemorandum was ``extreme and excessive in its statement and \narticulation of executive power.'' I would feel far better if\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\nthe man who they are supporting for Attorney General had taken the same \nposition, as have many of my colleagues in the Senate, on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Even supporters of Judge Gonzales distance themselves from the Bybee \nmemo's conclusion that the President has authority to immunize those \nwho violate the law knowing that ``certainly is not lawful.''\n  These are the statements of Republican Senators, but they should not \nbe confused with the statements of Judge Gonzales, who has refused to \ncriticize its legalistic excuses for recalibrations of decades of law \nand practice.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of \nnewspaper articles and editorials that bear on this nomination, \nincluding one that appears in today's Rutledge Herald, a prize-winning \nnewspaper in Vermont.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 2, 2005]\n\n                             No on Gonzalez\n\n       One of the best ways the U.S. Senate could assure the world \n     that the United States is serious about democracy and human \n     rights would be to reject the nomination of Alberto Gonzalez \n     as attorney general.\n       The Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were united \n     in opposing Gonzalez, who received a vote of 10-8 from the \n     committee. Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the \n     committee, was firm in opposition to Gonzalez. Democrats have \n     flirted with the idea of a filibuster to block Gonzalez's \n     confirmation, but on Tuesday they rejected that idea.\n       It is a difficult to understand how the Arab world or \n     anyone else could take seriously President Bush's high-flown \n     rhetoric on behalf of freedom or democracy if Gonzalez became \n     part of his cabinet. Gonzalez has become known as Mr. \n     Torture. His low-key, equable manner before the committee \n     should not disguise the fact that during long hours of \n     testimony he refused to say that it was illegal for the \n     president to authorize torture of prisoners in the hands of \n     the U.S. military.\n       It is well known that Gonzalez was the author of memos \n     defining the ways that it was permissible for U.S. troops to \n     torture their captives. He was behind numerous policies since \n     ruled unconstitutional and illegal, such as the detention of \n     prisoners without charge and without access to a lawyer. He \n     was behind the military tribunals established to deal with \n     prisoners at the Guantanamo naval base, which have also been \n     thrown out by the courts.\n       Continuing revelations reveal that torture and other \n     mistreatment were the work of more than a few miscreants at \n     Abu Ghraib in Iraq. The International Red Cross has charged \n     that torture of prisoners is widespread. New reports continue \n     to emerge, such as that describing the sexual taunting of \n     prisoners by female interrogators. It is degrading for the \n     prisoners and for the U.S. military, and it shows the world a \n     face of the United States that ought to shame all Americans.\n       Is Alberto Gonzalez responsible for these violations? Yes. \n     He is not alone, of course. President Bush bears ultimate \n     responsibility, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is \n     culpable as well. But Gonzalez was responsible for the \n     twisted interpretations that gave a legal gloss to policies \n     that spread from Guantanamo to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       Gonzalez is likely to win approval from the Senate. As \n     Leahy noted at the time of Gonzalez's nomination, the present \n     Senate would probably give the nod to Attila the Hun. But a \n     strong voice of disapproval by senators concerned about the \n     way that Gonzalez and Bush have abused our democratic ideals \n     would remind the world that America is not unanimous in \n     support of the inhumane policies of the Bush administration.\n       Bush has pledged his support for democratic movements all \n     around the world. A no vote on the Gonzalez nomination would \n     show the world the United States, too, is struggling to be a \n     democracy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 26, 2002]\n\n                     Gonzales Rewrites Laws of War\n\n                          (By Jeanne Cummings)\n\n       Washington.--Most people assume Attorney General John \n     Ashcroft is the Bush appointee responsible for legal \n     decisions that critics say place national security above \n     civil liberties. But the real architect of many of those \n     moves is someone most Americans have never heard of: White \n     House Counsel Alberto Gonzales.\n       Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the former commercial-real-\n     estate attorney from Texas has been rewriting the laws of \n     war. From his corner office in the White House, he developed \n     the legal underpinnings for presidential orders creating \n     military commissions, defining enemy combatants and dictating \n     the status and rights of prisoners held from Afghanistan \n     battles. And he may well hold the most sway in President \n     Bush's coming decision on whether to begin appointing \n     military commissions to prosecute Afghanistan war prisoners.\n       He believes he is striking the right balance between \n     American security and personal liberties. But his methods \n     have evoked outrage from the State Department and even the \n     Pentagon, which say they resent being cut out of the process.\n       Career Pentagon lawyers in the Judge Advocate General's \n     Office were furious that they read first in news reports that \n     Mr. Gonzales had devised the legal framework for military \n     commissions. National Security Council legal advisers \n     unsuccessfully tried in January to stall his controversial \n     decision asserting that the Geneva Convention didn't apply to \n     Afghanistan detainees. And Secretary of State Colin Powell \n     launched an intense internal campaign to undo that decision.\n       ``Essentially, a bunch of strangers are deciding the issues \n     and you're outside the door not being heard,'' complains \n     retired Rear Adm. John Hutson, who served as the Navy's judge \n     advocate general until 2000 and who remains close to his \n     former colleagues at the Pentagon.\n       The 47-year-old Harvard Law School graduate remains secure \n     in his post mainly for one reason: President Bush. ``I love \n     him dearly'' was how Mr. Bush introduced his former Texas \n     chief counsel last year. Because of that bond, Mr. Gonzales \n     is considered a likely candidate for nomination to the U.S. \n     Supreme Court.\n       What makes the San Antonio native's role remarkable is his \n     willingness to go toe-to-toe against Defense Secretary Donald \n     Rumsfeld's department lawyers and Mr. Powell himself--to try \n     to bend powerful insiders to the will of his client, Mr. \n     Bush. Mr. Gonzales is the president's final sounding board \n     on issues that in previous administrations were largely \n     handled by experts in the National Security Council or the \n     departments of State and Defense. ``There is a reason you \n     have trusted aides in key positions. It's to get their \n     judgment after hearing everyone else's judgment,'' says \n     Dan Bartlett, the president's communications director.\n       The way Mr. Gonzales sees it, the war on terrorism requires \n     a re-examination of the conventional rules, and it is his job \n     to push Congress, the courts, and the international community \n     to do that. ``Some of these principles have never been \n     addressed in a court of law,'' says Mr. Gonzales. ``People \n     think it is obvious that an American citizen, for example, \n     would have a right to counsel if detained as an enemy \n     combatant. But that's not so obvious.''\n       Before Sept. 11, Mr. Gonzales's only brush with the Geneva \n     Conventions was in death-penalty appeals, such as the 1997 \n     case of Mexican native Tristan Montoya. Under the Geneva \n     agreement, Mr. Montoya had a right to contact his consulate \n     office, but Texas authorities failed to inform him of that \n     right. Mr. Gonzales argued that omission wasn't significant \n     enough to overturn Mr. Montoya's murder-robbery conviction. \n     He asserted Texas was under no obligation to enforce the \n     agreement anyway since the state wasn't a party in ratifying \n     it. Mr. Montoya was executed and the U.S. State Department \n     sent a letter of apology to Mexico for the agreement's \n     violation.\n       After the terrorist attacks, Mr. Gonzales took a new look \n     at those agreements. The reference book ``The Laws of War'' \n     is the newest addition to his research shelf. It was given to \n     him by John Yoo, a former University of California, Berkeley \n     professor now serving in the Justice Department's Office of \n     Legal Council. Mr. Yoo built a formidable reputation in elite \n     international law academic circles--the ``academy'' as they \n     call themselves--for his provocative writings asserting \n     profound presidential powers during time of war. He quickly \n     became the White House counsel office's ``go to guy,'' says \n     Mr. Gonzales.\n       But the Gonzales team's first venture into the \n     international-law arena was a rocky one. On Nov. 13, 2001, \n     Mr. Bush announced his intention to revive World War II-style \n     military commissions. He released a framework that excluded \n     explicit assurances of unanimous verdicts, rights to appeal, \n     public trials, and a standard of proof beyond a reasonable \n     doubt. The legal community--particularly military experts--\n     exploded.\n       Over the next four months, Pentagon attorneys, who had \n     complained about being kept out of the loop, wrote \n     regulations for the commissions that guaranteed most of those \n     rights. Still lacking, critics say, is the right to appeal to \n     an outside court. ``Our political leaders just can't have the \n     ultimate say on guilt and innocence,'' says Tom Malinowski, a \n     Washington advocate and director of Human Rights Watch.\n       Mr. Gonzales was ``surprised'' by the sharp reaction to the \n     commission ruling, but acknowledged it may have been written \n     and released too hastily. He says he conducts wide-ranging \n     consultations, but that there are times when others within \n     the administration just don't agree with his final \n     recommendation for action.\n       Two months after the commission order, Mr. Gonzales was \n     readying another critical wartime recommendation--that the \n     president deny Geneva Convention coverage to detainees housed \n     in a makeshift prison in Cuba's Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. \n     National Security Council lawyers tried to slow the order, \n     but, on Jan. 18, Mr. Bush adopted that stand. ``They are not \n     going to become POWs,'' Mr. Gonzales said.\n       The move immediately drew objections from the State \n     Department. Mr. Powell, fearing captured U.S. servicemen or \n     spies could face reprisals, demanded the president\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\n     reconsider the ruling. The secretary's discomfort was \n     compounded by a Jan. 25 memo written by Mr. Gonzales that \n     misstated Mr. Powell's position and concluded that the \n     secretary's arguments for ``reconsideration and reversal are \n     unpersuasive.''\n       Mr. Powell argued that while the detainees didn't deserve \n     prisoner-of-war status, the administration must use the \n     Geneva Conventions to reach that conclusion. After two \n     intense NSC meetings, Mr. Bush opted to reverse course--but, \n     for Mr. Gonzales, it was only a technical loss.\n       Today, federal judges are grappling with Mr. Gonzales's \n     interpretation of the rights of U.S. citizens, the ``enemy \n     combatants,'' who have been held for months without charges \n     or access to attorneys. That is an issue that is unlikely to \n     be resolved until it reaches the Supreme Court.\n       Mr. Gonzales readily admits the White House might lose some \n     ground in those court cases. While being ``respectful'' of \n     constitutional rights, the administration's job ``at the end \n     of the day'' is ``to protect the country,'' he says. \n     ``Ultimately, it is the job of the courts to tell us whether \n     or not we've drawn the lines in the right places.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the National Journal, Nov. 13, 2004]\n\n          Opening Argument--The Problem With Alberto Gonzales\n\n                         (By Stuart Taylor Jr.)\n\n       White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales is an amiable man with \n     an inspiring personal story. One of eight children of \n     uneducated Mexican-American immigrants, he grew up in a Texas \n     house with no hot water or telephone. He would be the first \n     Hispanic attorney general. He has the complete trust of the \n     president, whom he has loyally served for four years in \n     Washington, and in Texas before that. He is far less divisive \n     and confrontational than the departing John Ashcroft.\n       The problem with Gonzales is that he has been deeply \n     involved in developing some of the most sweeping claims of \n     near-dictatorial presidential power in our nation's history. \n     These claims put President Bush literally above the law, \n     allowing him to imprison and even (at least in theory) \n     torture anyone in the world, at any time, for any reason that \n     Bush associates with national security. Specifically:\n       Gonzales played a central role in developing Bush's claim \n     of unlimited power to seize suspected ``enemy combatants''--\n     including American citizens--from the streets or homes of \n     America or any other nation, for indefinite, incommunicado \n     detention and interrogation, without meaningful judicial \n     review or access to lawyers.\n       He presided over the preparation of the poorly drafted \n     November 2001 Bush order establishing ``military \n     commissions'' to try suspected foreign terrorists for war \n     crimes.\n       He signed the January 25, 2002, memo to the president \n     arguing that the 1949 Geneva Conventions offer no protection \n     to any prisoners seized in Afghanistan; the memo dismissed \n     some of the Geneva provisions as ``quaint.'' This memo \n     signaled Bush's break--over vigorous objections from \n     Secretary of State Colin Powell--with the generous \n     interpretation of the Geneva Conventions used under every \n     president from Harry Truman through Bill Clinton. It also led \n     to Bush's refusal to provide the individual hearings \n     required, both by Geneva and by Army regulations, for the \n     hundreds of alleged ``unlawful combatants'' at his Guantanamo \n     Bay prison camp.\n       He was the addressee of, and apparently had a role in \n     vetting, the August 1, 2002, Justice Department memo \n     asserting that the commander-in-chief has virtually unlimited \n     power to authorize indiscriminate use of torture in wartime \n     interrogations--tearing off fingernails, branding prisoners' \n     genitals with red-hot pokers, you name it.\n       Here is how these profoundly unwise claims have worked out:\n       The no-due-process ``enemy combatant'' policy brought Bush \n     an 8-1 rebuff from the Supreme Court on June 28, in Hamdi v. \n     Rumsfeld. The majority asserted that ``a state of war is not \n     a blank check for the president.'' Antonin Scalia, the \n     justice whom Bush has said he most admires, stressed in a \n     concurrence that ``the very core of liberty secured by our \n     Anglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from \n     indefinite imprisonment at the will of the executive.''\n       The ``military commissions'' have been a fiasco in practice \n     (as detailed in my September 11, 2004, column) and were held \n     to be unlawful in important respects on November 8 by Judge \n     James Robertson of the U.S. District Court for the District \n     of Columbia. (The administration plans to appeal.)\n       Bush's spurning of the Geneva Conventions and refusal to \n     provide hearings for Guantanamo detainees probably explain \n     his 6-3 defeat in another June 28 Supreme Court decision, \n     Rasul v. Bush, which rejected Bush's claim of power to detain \n     non-Americans at Guantanamo without answering to any court. \n     And Judge Robertson wrote that the administration ``has \n     asserted a position starkly different from the positions and \n     behavior of the United States in previous conflicts, one that \n     can only weaken the United States' own ability to demand \n     application of the Geneva Conventions to Americans captured \n     during armed conflicts abroad.''\n       The Justice Department torture memo, together with a \n     similar Pentagon memo in March 2003 and the Abu Ghraib \n     photos, have brought the United States worldwide opprobrium \n     for authorizing torture as official policy (which Bush did \n     not do) while making the CIA and the military newly wary of \n     using even mild, legally defensible forms of coercion to \n     extract information from captured terrorists.\n       If Senate Democrats (and Republicans) are not too cowed by \n     Bush's election victories to do their jobs, the confirmation \n     proceeding for Gonzales will drag us more deeply than ever \n     through the torture memos, Abu Ghraib, the evidence of \n     torture and killing of prisoners by U.S. forces in \n     Afghanistan, and all that. Will that be good for Gonzales? \n     For Bush? For the country?\n       At the very least, Democrats should demand a full \n     accounting of Gonzales's role in the development of these \n     torture memos. And when Bush claims confidentiality, the \n     answer should be: If you must cloak in secrecy your counsel's \n     role in shaping your own grandiose claims of power, then \n     don't ask us to confirm him.\n       Here is a far-from-complete history of the torture memos, \n     as reconstructed from anonymous sources and news reports:\n       The CIA began using various forms of duress to extract \n     information from captured Qaeda leaders overseas in late 2001 \n     and early 2002. But agency officials were concerned that they \n     might be prosecuted by some future administration or \n     independent counsel, and that the CIA itself might be \n     attacked for abusing its powers, as it was during the 1970s. \n     So CIA Director George Tenet requested a legal memo assuring \n     interrogators and their superiors sweeping presidential \n     protection from any future prosecution under an anti-torture \n     law that Congress had adopted in 1994 to comply with the \n     United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, \n     Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n       The task was assigned to the Justice Department's Office of \n     Legal Counsel. The Bush-appointed head of OLC, Jay Bybee, now \n     a federal judge, and some other Justice Department and White \n     House lawyers were reluctant to make such a bold and \n     unprecedented claim of presidential power. But under apparent \n     pressure from their superiors, Bybee and his staff produced \n     the August 1, 2002, memo, addressed to Gonzales. Earlier \n     drafts had been carefully vetted by the offices of Gonzales, \n     Ashcroft, and David Addington, Vice President Cheney's \n     counsel.\n       I have been unable to determine how deeply Gonzales was \n     involved in the details. The Senate should demand to know.\n       Aside from the OLC memo's indefensible claims of \n     presidential power to order torture, it also claims that \n     rough treatment of prisoners does not even fit the definition \n     of torture unless ``equivalent in intensity to the pain \n     accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, \n     impairment of bodily function, or even death.''\n       There is no evidence that the administration ever approved \n     ``torture,'' as thus defined, as a matter of policy. It did \n     approve a number of highly coercive, still-classified \n     interrogation methods, such as feigning suffocation and \n     subjecting prisoners to sleep deprivation and ``stress \n     positions,'' which apparently helped extract valuable \n     information from Qaeda leaders. And in 2003, the Pentagon \n     adopted the Justice Department's analysis--initially devised \n     for CIA interrogations of a few high-level terrorists--to \n     justify coercive interrogations of prisoners at Guantanamo \n     and, later, in Iraq. This came despite strong objections from \n     top military lawyers, based on their long-standing view that \n     rough interrogation methods are ineffective, arguably \n     illegal, and likely to become indiscriminate and excessive.\n       How much all of this had to do with bringing about the now-\n     documented torture, abuses, and killings of prisoners in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan is in dispute. What's clear is that the \n     leaked torture memos, as well as the Abu Ghraib photos, \n     disgraced our nation--so much so that Gonzales and other \n     White House officials, at a June 22 news conference, sought \n     to blame the OLC lawyers for what Gonzales called their \n     memo's ``overbroad'' and ``unnecessary'' passages. The Senate \n     should now explore whether (as has been suggested to me) the \n     OLC lawyers had only been following orders from the same \n     White House officials who later ran for cover.\n       This is not to deny the difficulty of the issues presented \n     to Gonzales and his colleagues by the unprecedented magnitude \n     of the terrorist threat. Nor is it to deny the need for \n     judicious use of preventive detention and coercive \n     interrogation techniques (short of torture) to prevent mass \n     murders. But the torture memos are emblematic of a Bush White \n     House that has consistently failed to strike a wise balance \n     between the demands of security and of liberty.\n       Gonzales's role in all of this appears to be to tell Bush \n     what Bush wants to hear. With the dubious benefit of such \n     advice, Bush has not only shown little appreciation for civil \n     liberties but also provoked a judicial and international \n     backlash that has hurt the war on terrorism. Gonzales does \n     have many fine qualities. But is this the attorney general we \n     need?\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 24, 2005]\n\n                       Abu Ghraib Accountability\n\n                            (By Nat Hentoff)\n\n       Although there was considerable media coverage of Alberto \n     Gonzales's confirmation hearing for attorney general, a look \n     at the full transcript still raises, for me, serious \n     questions about his fitness to be our chief law enforcement \n     officer.\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\n       At the start, Mr. Gonzales told the senators and the rest \n     of us: ``I think it is important to stress at the outset that \n     I am and will remain deeply committed to ensuring that the \n     United States government complies with all of its legal \n     obligations as it fights the war on terror, whether those \n     obligations arise from domestic or international law. These \n     obligations include, of course, honoring Geneva Conventions \n     whenever they apply.''\n       Sen. Ted Kennedy asked the nominee if the media reports \n     were accurate that Mr. Gonzales had chaired meetings that \n     covered specific ways to make detainees talk. For example, \n     having them feel they were about to be drowned or buried \n     alive. Mr. Gonzales answered: ``I have a recollection that we \n     had some discussions in my office.'' But, he said, ``it is \n     not my job to decide which types of methods of obtaining \n     information from terrorists would be most effective. That job \n     falls to folks within the agencies.''\n       So, ``the agencies,'' including the CIA, can do whatever \n     they consider effective; and Mr. Gonzales suggests that he \n     had no role as to the lawfulness of those methods when he was \n     counsel to the president, our commander in chief? Should he \n     not have told the president that the Geneva Convention \n     Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading \n     Treatment or Punishment forbids ``any act by which severe \n     pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is \n     intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as \n     obtaining from him or a third person information or a \n     confession''? And should he not have been interested in \n     trying to find out how many of those detainees had been \n     sufficiently screened when captured in order to indicate \n     whether they actually were terrorists or suspects or \n     indiscriminately rounded up?\n       Sen. Russ Feingold asked Mr. Gonzales whether the president \n     has ``the authority to authorize violations of the criminal \n     law under duly enacted statutes (by Congress) simply because \n     he's commander in chief.'' Mr. Gonzales said: ``To the extent \n     that there is a decision made to ignore a statute, I consider \n     that a very significant decision, and one that I would \n     personally be involved with . . . with a great deal of care \n     and seriousness.'' ``Well,'' Mr. Feingold said, ``that sounds \n     to me like the president still remains above the law.'' When \n     Mr. Kennedy asked the same question, Mr. Gonzales said it was \n     ``a very, very difficult question.'' So, what does he believe \n     about the separation of powers?\n       Another question from Mr. Kennedy: ``Do you believe that \n     targeting persons based on their religion or national origin \n     rather than specific suspicion or connection with \n     terrorist organizations is an effective way of fighting \n     terrorism? And can we get interest from you [that[, as \n     attorney general, you'd review the so-called anti-\n     terrorism programs that have an inordinate and unfair \n     impact on Arab and Muslim?'' Mr. Gonzales responded: ``I \n     will commit to you that I will review it. As to whether or \n     not it's effective will depend on the outcome of my \n     review.'' But Mr. Gonzales didn't answer the first crucial \n     part of the question: Is targeting people based on \n     religion, without specific suspicion, effective? And, I \n     would add, isn't it broadly discriminatory?\n       Asked by Sen. Patrick Leahy about increasing reports of \n     abuse of detainees in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Mr. Gonzales \n     said: ``I categorically condemn the conduct that we see \n     reflected in these pictures at Abu Ghraib.\n       ``I would refer you to the eight complete investigations of \n     what happened at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, and there are \n     still three ongoing,'' he added. But none of the \n     investigations have gone so far up the chain of command as \n     the Defense Department and the Justice Department to \n     determine the accountability of high-level policy-makers \n     there.\n       As The Washington Post noted in a lead editorial on Jan. 7, \n     ``The record of the past few months suggests that the \n     administration will neither hold any senior official \n     accountable nor change the policies that have produced this \n     shameful record.'' Nor did the senators ask themselves about \n     Stuart Taylor's charge in the Jan. 8 National Journal that \n     ``Congress continues to abdicate its constitutional \n     responsibility to provide a legislative framework'' for the \n     treatment of detainees. The White House strongly resists \n     Congress' involvement.\n       ``No longer,'' Mr. Taylor insisted, ``should executive fiat \n     determine such matters as how much evidence is necessary to \n     detain such suspects (and) how long they can be held without \n     criminal charges.'' As U.S. attorney general, will Mr. \n     Gonzales move to reinstate the constitutional separation of \n     powers to prevent further shame to the United States for the \n     widespread abuses of detainees under the executive branch's \n     parallel legal system of which Alberto Gonzales was a \n     principal architect?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about a man \nwhose life and career embody principles that are uniquely, and proudly, \nAmerican. He is the grandson of immigrants who overcame language and \ncultural barriers to carve out an existence through manual labor and \nfaith. Through his commitment to education, his firm belief in the law, \nand a dedication to public service, he has risen to the top of his \nprofession and now seeks to serve his country at the highest level. Mr. \nPresident, I rise this morning to speak about Alberto Gonzales and to \nurge bipartisan support for his confirmation as Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Alberto Gonzales's qualifications speak for themselves. He is a \ngraduate of Harvard Law. He served as Secretary of State for the State \nof Texas and as a justice on Texas' Supreme Court before being named \nWhite House Counsel by President Bush in 2001. Mr. Gonzales was \nrecently inducted into the Hispanic Scholarship Fund Alumni Hall of \nFame and has been honored with the Good Neighbor Award from the United \nStates-Mexico Chamber of Commerce.\n  Henry Cisneros, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, calls Alberto Gonzales a person of sterling character and \nsays that Mr. Gonzales's confirmation by this body will be part of \nAmerica's steady march toward liberty and justice for all.\n  It is a march that, for Alberto Gonzales, started in a two-bedroom \nhouse shared by ten people with no hot running water or telephone. But \nwhat Alberto Gonzales and his family lacked in comfort they made up for \nin vision and hard work.\n  Alberto was the first person in his family to go to college. He \nserved in the United States Air Force and attended the United States \nAir Force Academy.\n  But Alberto Gonzales is about more than an impressive resume. Each \nexperience in his life has prepared him for the great honor of serving \nas the next Attorney General of the United States--a job he is \nextremely qualified for and a job that I know he will perform with \nhonor and dignity.\n  As the Nation's chief law enforcement officer, Alberto Gonzales will \ntake the lessons from his positions as Counsel to the President, Texas \nSupreme Court Justice, Texas Secretary of State, and General Counsel to \nthe Governor and work to protect Americans from terrorism while \nprotecting our Constitutional rights. He will also work to reduce \ncrime, reform the FBI, and protect Americans from discrimination.\n  Alberto Gonzales has come a long way since his days growing up in \nHumble, Texas. He has accomplished so much, but he has never forgotten \nfrom where he came. He has been committed to the Latino community \nthroughout his career, and they have recognized him for his community \nservice and the impact he has made. Today, many of the largest national \nLatino organizations are standing in staunch support of his nomination \nand looking forward with great anticipation to the swearing-in of the \nfirst Latino Attorney General for the United States.\n  For Alberto Gonzales, the march toward liberty and justice started in \nHumble, TX, and continued through many ambitious goals. Alberto \nGonzales has defied the odds and surpassed expectations time and time \nagain. His successes have created a foundation that will serve our \nNation well and inspire a new generation to aspire and conquer.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me as we continue the march toward \nliberty and justice by voting to confirm Alberto Gonzales as the next \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nfine comments about Judge Gonzales.\n  We have gotten to know Judge Gonzales over the years. He is a good \nand decent man, a fine lawyer who respects the rule of law, who is \nproud to be an American. He wants to see our country strong and free. \nHe led the effort in the fight against terrorism. He did the things we \nwanted him to do.\n  He has a background that excites our pride. We are pleased to see how \nmuch he has achieved. He went to Harvard and was hired by one of \nAmerica's great law firms. He served the Governor of Texas, was a judge \nin Texas--and all of his credential are wonderful.\n  We know he is a good, decent, honorable, and honest man.\n  If you listen to the comments made here today, by some Democrats, \nabout him, you would not recognize the man we know.\n  It is not right. What has been done here is wrong.\n  If you have a disagreement with the policy of the President of the \nUnited States, OK, we will talk about it and\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\nwe will see what the differences are. But it is not right to demean and \nmischaracterize the nature of Judge Gonzales. I feel strongly about \nthat.\n  I served in the Department of Justice for 15 years. I would like to \nshare a few thoughts to give us some perspective about the role Judge \nGonzales has played.\n  Judge Gonzales was legal counsel to the President. He was the \nPresident's lawyer. Of course, everyone who is a lawyer--I am a lawyer \nand a good number in this body are lawyers--knows that lawyers protect \nthe legal prerogatives of their clients. You do not want to in \nmemorandum and public statements make statements that constrict the \nultimate power of the institution of the Presidency of the United \nStates. That is a fundamental thing. That is what you have to do. That \nis what you are there for.\n  When 9/11 happened and we were taken aback by the viciousness of the \nattacks, we were worried, rightly, that throughout this country there \nwould be terrorist cells continuing to plot as they were perhaps in \nArizona, or in other places, as we have learned. We wanted to be sure \nwe were defending this country well. We had to make some decisions.\n  We went after al-Qaida in Afghanistan. A lot of legal questions \narose.\n  I serve on the Judiciary Committee. We had hearing after hearing \nregarding these issues.\n  Let me tell you what I think Judge Gonzales did not do. Not I think; \nI know he did not do. He did not approve of torture. He has always \nsteadfastly opposed it. His position has consistently been that we \ncomply with the laws of the United States and our treaty obligations. I \nwill talk about that in a minute.\n  But that was not his call at that point in time. He did not privately \ntell the President, or call up the Secretary of Defense, or call the \nguard at Abu Ghraib and say torture these prisoners. He sought a formal \nlegal opinion concerning the powers and responsibilities of the \nPresident of the United States as a lawyer for the President. He made \nthat request of the Office of Legal Counsel, a senatorial-confirmed \nposition of the U.S. Department of Justice, a position that is given \nthe responsibility to opine on matters of this kind. They are not to \nset policy. They are not to say what torture is other than what the law \nsays. They do not express their own views. But he asked them what the \nlegal responsibilities and powers of the President were. They \nresearched the law. They sent back a memo. That is the memo being \ncomplained of, a memo not written by Judge Gonzales, a memo written by \nthe Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice and their \nstaff that worked on it at some great length. We have had complaints \nabout it.\n  Judge Gonzales later on said: There have been complaints about this \nmemorandum. You need to redo it.\n  He suggested that, I guess, on behalf of the President, and they \nrewrote it. They constricted the issues they discussed. They didn't \nspeculate on what the ultimate powers of the President might be. They \ndid that less in the second memorandum than they did in the first.\n  That is how this came about. It was their opinion, not his. They say \nhe circulated it. Well, do you want him to circulate his personal \nviews? Do you want him to circulate some politician's views? Or do you \nwant him to circulate the duly drafted opinion of the Office of Legal \nCounsel of the U.S. Department of Justice which researched our history, \nthe treaties, the Constitution, and the court cases of the United \nStates?\n  We need to get our mind in the right perspective and remember the \ncircumstances we are operating under. I will repeat, Judge Gonzales has \nnever supported torture. We have Members who have said Judge Gonzales \nadvised the President of the United States that torture was acceptable. \nThat is false, inaccurate, and wrong. Anyone who said that ought to \napologize for it. Do we have no sense of responsibility in what we say? \nAre we irresponsible, that we can attack this fine man, a son of \nimmigrants who worked his way up through the entire legal system to be \nnow nominated to that great office of Attorney General of the United \nStates? He deserves a fair shake. He has not been getting it.\n  They say he abandoned the rule of law. He did not do that. He sought \na legal opinion from the duly constituted Office of Legal Counsel which \nis supposed to render those opinions. He disseminated those opinions \nand now they blame him for it. It is not the right thing to do. As \nPresident Bush said on more than one occasion, but on the eve of the G-\n8 summit in June of last year:\n\n       The authorization I issued was that anything we did would \n     conform with United States law and would be consistent with \n     international treaty obligations.\n\n  That has been the position. In a letter to Senator Leahy, Assistant \nAttorney General Will Moschella in the legislative affairs division of \nthe Justice Department rejected categorically ``any suggestion that the \nDepartment of Justice has participated in developing policies that \nwould permit unlawful conduct.''\n  In a special piece submitted to USA Today, Judge Gonzales, in his \ncapacity then as White House Counsel, stated ``in all aspects of our \nNation's war on terror, including the conflict in Iraq, it is the \npolicy of the United States to comply with the governing laws and \ntreaty obligations.'' I will talk more about that because it is \nimportant legally to understand what has been occurring.\n  We as a nation do not approve of torture. We reject it. We prosecute \nand discipline those who are participating in it or carry it out and we \nhave been committed to that as a country. We ought to ask ourselves, \nhas this Congress stated any position on terrorism? What did they say?\n  I remember not too many months ago when Attorney General John \nAshcroft was before the Judiciary Committee. They were bombarding him \nwith the allegations that he was responsible for Abu Ghraib, he was \nresponsible for any misbehavior throughout our entire command, and that \nhe had approved torture, and they quoted things they said he approved. \nIn frustration, Attorney General Ashcroft, looking at his former \ncolleagues, said ``Well, the problem I have with you, Senator, is, it \nis not my definition of torture that counts. It's the one you enacted \ninto law.''\n  Do you know we have a law that defines torture and sets forth what it \namounts to and how it should be defined? It is that definition that was \nmade a part of the OLC, Office of Legal Counsel memorandum, and it is \nthat memorandum and that language our colleagues across the aisle are \ncomplaining about, and some of them were here when that statute passed \nand they voted for it.\n  Let's take a look at that. This statute, part of the United States \nCode, says:\n\n       Torture means an act specifically intended to inflict \n     severe physical or mental pain or suffering upon another \n     person. Severe mental pain or suffering means the prolonged \n     mental harm caused by or resulting from the intentional \n     infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical \n     pain or suffering. The threat of imminent death or the \n     threat that another person will imminently be subjected to \n     death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the \n     administration or application of mind-altering substances \n     or procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses \n     or personality.\n\n  These words were used--and I know the Presiding Officer is a skilled \nJAG officer from South Carolina--those were the words discussed in the \nOLC memorandum. They used those kinds of words. The same kind of words \npassed by a number of Democrat Members in this body. The authors of the \nOLC memo simply discussed the meaning of these words passed by the \nCongress. Now some are arguing that because of this memo we approve \nthese horrible things.\n  I suppose a person could misinterpret deliberately some of that and \ncarry out things that are not legitimate. I suppose some of these \nthings would be legitimate. We said they were when we passed the \nstatute, or at least we did not prohibit them when we passed the \nstatute.\n  Who defines torture? The Office of Legal Counsel? Judge Gonzales? The \nPresident of the United States? Or the U.S. Congress? We have enacted a \ndefinition of torture, the one I just read. It might offend some \npeople, but as it is, that is the definition of torture, I submit, and \nI don't see how it can be disputed.\n  We did have activities that occurred. This memorandum fundamentally \nwas\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nadvice to the President on what his ultimate powers were. But the \nPresident's orders, the policies of the U.S. military, were much more \nconstrained than possibly would have been allowed under this statutory \ndefinition. Not that the President ultimately did not have that power. \nBut we have not utilized that power or approved it. In fact, we have \ndisciplined people who have not followed those rules and regulations.\n  First, it is always going to be the President's fault, during an \nelection year. Then it was Secretary Rumsfeld, and then Condoleezza \nRice. At some point they decided to quit blaming Secretary of State \nRice during her confirmation proceedings and start blaming it all on \nJudge Gonzales. So now we have been through the President, the \nSecretary of State, National Security Adviser, the Secretary of \nDefense, and now we are down on Judge Gonzales. It is all his fault. \nNow he cannot be confirmed because somebody at Abu Ghraib violated \npolicy. They have been tried. Some have already been convicted. They \nhave been removed from office.\n  We had the situation--do you remember it?--when a full colonel in the \nArmy, in the heat of battle, concerned for the safety of his troops, \nfired a gun near the head of an Iraqi terrorist to induce him to give \ninformation that would protect the lives of his soldiers. And we \ndrummed him out of the service for it long before a lot of this \nhappened.\n\n  Remember, it was the military that brought forth the abuses at Abu \nGhraib. They recognized that some had violated the laws of the United \nStates and that those activities should not be allowed. They have \ndisciplined people systematically since. They are continuing to do so. \nIf anybody higher up is implicated, these lower guys are going to tell \nabout it. They are going to pursue that, I have absolute confidence. \nAnd we will pursue that.\n  But I think it is unhealthy for our country, dangerous to our troops, \nundermining of our mission to suggest that it was the policy of the \nU.S. Government to do this. How can that help us gain respect in the \nworld when Senators in this body allege that the President's own \ncounsel is approving what went on in Abu Ghraib, that his policies \nlegitimized what was going on in Abu Ghraib? I do not believe that is \ntrue. It is not true. We should not be saying it. We had a big enough, \nbad enough problem in Abu Ghraib. It was an embarrassment to us. We \nwere painfully hurt by it. And it should not have occurred. But I will \nsay, with confidence, that Judge Gonzales does not bear the blame for \nthat.\n  Discipline in war is hard to maintain. I mentioned the example of how \na highly decorated colonel was removed from the service for his failure \nof discipline, even in a tough time. I remember back in the Pacific, in \nthose island campaigns, neither side took prisoners. It was a battle to \nthe death. We are facing an enemy unlike enemies we have faced before. \nThey are a ferocious, suicidal, murderous, sneaky bunch that for most \nof them, hopefully not all, but for most of them they simply have to be \ndefeated, they have to be captured, they have to be killed, they have \nto be restrained because they will not stop. If we are successful in \ndoing that, I believe the glory that some of these terrorists have \nattained will be diminished, and it will be seen that they represent a \nsmall, backward, insular, violent mentality, not conducive to progress, \npeace, and democracy in the Middle East or anyplace else in the world.\n  I think we are going to make progress on that. We need to hold our \nstandards high. I certainly agree with that. But war is a difficult \nthing. People do make mistakes. We have abuses in the Federal prison \nsystems and in State prison systems. Senator Kennedy and I offered \nlegislation to prohibit sexual abuse in prisons by guards and \nprisoners, and to investigate it, to identify it, and stop it. But we \nknow we have abuses in our prisons, and we need attention from the top \nand discipline from the top.\n  I will note a recent article about Abu Ghraib. Soldiers were \ninterviewed in a Washington Post article, and they all said this was \nunacceptable behavior; it should have never occurred. It is clear that \nthe soldiers who are there today fully understand their \nresponsibilities to treat these people humanely, and that they will do \nso.\n  I want to mention one more thing about some of the details of this \nissue. First, I think it is indisputable that al-Qaida and such \nterrorists who are about and loose in the world today do not qualify \nunder the Geneva Conventions. They simply are not covered by it because \nthey are not the kind of lawful combatants the Geneva Conventions \nprotect.\n  Now, the President says we are going to treat them humanely in any \ncase, and we are going to treat them fairly. In many instances he says \nwe are going to provide them the protections of the Geneva Conventions \neven though they are not entitled to them.\n  For example, it is the position of the White House that no detainee \nshould be subjected to sleep deprivation. Now, I think under the \ntorture statutes, sleep deprivation, at least to some degree, would not \nqualify as a severe kind of pain or the psychological impairments that \nwere referred to in the statute Congress passed defining torture. But \nthe President said that we would not deprive them of sleep anyway. Nor \nshould they be deprived of food and water during any period of \ninterrogation. Soldiers and interrogators were even prohibited from the \nact of pointing a finger at the chest of a detainee. That was declared \nan unacceptable technique by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld 2 years ago, \nJanuary 15, 2003. Well, we have gone a pretty good ways in trying to \nensure that our behavior is good. We have prosecuted people at Abu \nGhraib. We have disciplined a lot of people in Iraq and Afghanistan who \nhave exceeded their authority. In the course of furthering our intense \nwar against terrorism, we have tried to maintain control over our \ndecency and our morality. I do not think Members of this body should be \nsuggesting that we do not or that it is our policy to violate \ninternational law or the rights under our own statutes concerning \ntorture and other rules.\n\n  I heard it pointed out we all have things that do not work out right \nin our lives. We do things we thought were right at the time and \njustified them, and they maybe turn out to be wrong. Nobody who ever \ncomes before this body for confirmation is perfect. I know my \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, has stated that Judge Gonzales is no Robert \nKennedy. And they are different people in different times. Robert \nKennedy was appointed Attorney General by his brother. How much closer \ncan you be than that? But we now know from many of the histories that \nhave been written that on a number of occasions Robert Kennedy, as \nAttorney General, clearly violated the legal and constitutional rights \nof people he was investigating for criminal activities. I do not think \nthat is disputed.\n  Well, let me tell you, what would have happened if that had been true \nof Judge Gonzales? How far would he get along in this process? He would \nnot get to first base.\n  I would say this: Judge Gonzales was at the right hand of the \nPresident of the United States when we were deliberately attacked by an \nal-Qaida organization that had announced they were at war with the \nUnited States, that they were authorized and empowered, and it was \nlegitimate for them to attack and murder civilians of the United \nStates. We needed to respond to that. We did not need the legitimate \npower of the President to be constrained by some politically correct \nmemorandum, a memorandum that he requested from the Department of \nJustice, which was written by them and which represented a statement of \npolicy of the United States with regard to the powers of the Presidency \nand those in the military.\n  I think, all in all--there have been bumps in the road--but, all in \nall, our Government, from the President throughout the executive \nbranch, including the military, has done its best to fight this \nvicious, despicable, violent enemy, an enemy that does not meet the \nstandards of a lawful combatant but is clearly, in fact, unlawful \ncombatants not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions. \nWe have treated them humanely, with a number of exceptions for which \ndiscipline has been applied. And we have striven in every way possible \nto tighten up since the beginning of this war our discipline with \nregard to our soldiers and our policies to make sure we have the least \npossible errors that\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\nwould occur in this process of fighting this war on terrorism. I \nbelieve that deeply.\n\n  Soldiers have placed their lives at risk. They have placed the lives \nof their associates and comrades at risk, adhering to the highest \nideals of American values of life. They have not pulled triggers, \nsubjecting themselves to risk, because they were not sure. They have \nheld back and shown restraint time and time again. That has not been \nsufficiently appreciated. We have spent almost all of our time having \nMembers of the Congress attack and blame the whole Government for \nfailures in these hostilities of a few.\n  I believe Judge Gonzales is not the person to blame for all this. I \ndo not believe the Counsel to the President is responsible for Abu \nGhraib. He is not responsible for an opinion written by an independent \nagency of the Government, legally empowered and directed by this \nCongress to write it.\n  He is a good man, a decent man, a man we have seen up close and \npersonal for quite a number of years. I find in him the highest \nstandards of Americanism and decency. He is a superb lawyer. He has had \na ringside seat on how the Justice Department works without being a \npart of it. It will allow him to move into it with a fresh look and be \nable to do good things.\n  I believe strongly he should be confirmed. I am disappointed in the \nnature of the attacks put on him. I believe they have been unfair and \ndo not do justice to his character and the effectiveness of his \nservice.\n  It is a pleasure to speak on behalf of this fine American. He will \nmake a great Attorney General. I look forward to his confirmation and \nall of us working with him.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I believe it is important that we \ndiscuss more carefully what our responsibilities are as a nation under \nthe Geneva Conventions. We have had a lot of things said here, smeared \nover, slopped over, vague allegations of misconduct on behalf of this \nPresident and our country. Our soldiers are out fighting for us. We \nneed to understand what it is.\n  They have alleged repeatedly that all this is in violation of the \nGeneva Conventions, all this amounts to torture. I previously have gone \ninto some depth about what the congressional act was that prohibited \ntorture and how this Congress defined torture and what it meant. It \ndoes not mean someone can't be deprived of some sleep or have an \ninterrogator raise his voice during questioning. That is not torture.\n  I would make clear this basic fact--it is so basic we often don't \nthink about it--this group al-Qaida has declared war on the United \nStates. Not only have they declared it in a traditional lawful manner \nof nation states that they have done over the years, at least quasi-\nlawful; they have done it as a group of unlawful combatants, and they \nhave done it in a way that is not justified under the Geneva \nConventions or international law of any kind, shape, or form. When our \nsoldiers go out and they are engaging al-Qaida, they don't give them a \ntrial. They don't read them their Miranda rights. They don't sit down \nand see what they can do to ask them if they would change their heart. \nThey shoot them. We are at war with them. They are a hostile enemy, and \nwe do that.\n  When you capture a hostile enemy who a few moments before, you could \nhave killed lawfully as a soldier of the United States executing the \npolicy of the United States against a person who has declared war \nagainst you and has publicly stated they are justified in killing \ninnocent American civilians, men, women and children, if you can do \nthat, if you capture them, they don't then become entitled to every \nright that an American citizen has when he is tried in the U.S. \ndistrict court for tax evasion or bank robbery or drug dealing. It is \nnot the same. Everybody knows that, if they have given any thought to \nwar and treaties over the years.\n\n  What is a controlling authority with regard to international \nagreements? It is the Geneva Convention. There have been a series of \nthem. They have been amended over the years. The most pertinent one in \nthis area is the Third Geneva Convention. This is in addition to the \noriginal Convention.\n  It provides strict requirements--four, to be exact--that must be \nfulfilled by an individual should he seek the protections afforded by \nthe treaty.\n  In other words, everybody is not entitled to protection under the \ntreaty. You have to do certain things, and you have to be what we have \ncome to refer to as a lawful combatant.\n  What are those requirements? He must be commanded by a person \nresponsible for his subordinates. He should have a chain of command. He \ncannot be a single murdering bomber and claim he is a lawful combatant, \nhaving no authority in a chain of command and not acting on orders from \nsome lawful entity.\n  No. 2: He must, the exact words are, have a ``fixed, distinctive sign \nrecognizable at a distance.'' What does that mean? It means you wear a \nuniform, basically. That is what it has always meant traditionally. So \nif you catch somebody in your country sneaking around not in uniform, \nthey are spies, and they are hung. That is what happened historically. \nThe Geneva Convention never changed that fundamentally.\n  Carrying arms openly--the treaty considers that lawful combatants, \nsuch as a member of the U.S. Army, will carry their arms openly. They \nwill have a distinctive uniform, and they will carry their arms openly, \nevidence of the fact that they are soldiers. This is important for a \nlot of reasons.\n  One reason is that the people who are fighting against our soldiers \nare supposed to direct their fire at soldiers, not innocent civilians. \nSo if they are wearing a uniform and carrying their arms openly, they \nknow the target at which they are firing. The whole goal of the Geneva \nConventions is to eliminate the loss of life of innocent people and to \nminimize loss of life in general and minimize the horror of war as much \nas possible.\n  If they are to be considered as one who has the protections of the \nGeneva Conventions, they must be conducting their operations in \naccordance with the laws and customs of war. Sneaking around, hijacking \nairplanes, flying them into buildings, putting explosive devices under \nvehicles, throwing them at people in line to vote--those actions are \nnot consistent with the laws and customs of war, for Heaven's sake.\n  So there is no doubt whatsoever in my view that al-Qaida and the \nterrorist groups who do not wear uniforms, who go around bombing \ninnocent people, are not acting according to the rules of war, who do \nnot wear a uniform, who are not carrying their arms openly--they do not \nqualify for the protections of the Geneva Conventions. No counsel to \nthe President, no counsel in the U.S. Department of Justice should \nrender an opinion that says otherwise.\n  The President can say: We are going to give the protections, anyway, \nwhich he has done, and we are going to treat the people in Iraq \naccording--I think he said we will treat them according to the Geneva \nConventions. I do not think we said that explicitly with regard to \nAfghanistan and al-Qaida, but these Iraqi guys who sneak around and \nbomb are not much different to me. We have provided more protections, I \nwould say with absolute certainty, than international law or U.S. \nstatutes provide.\n  Al-Qaida is not a nation state. It has not signed the treaties of the \nGeneva Convention. Members of al-Qaida have no uniforms or distinctive \nsigns. Al-Qaida has declared war on us, however, and they are quite \ncapable through their sneaky, devious, murderous activities of sneaking \ninto our country and killing Americans right now. If they are able to \ndo so, they will.\n\n  One reason they have not been able to do so is because we have been \nhunting them down with the finest military the world has ever known, \nthat is using discipline, humanity, and the proper execution of \nviolence against these people. That is just the way it is. We have gone \nafter them. We have put them on the run. If they could have attacked us \nin our election, if they could have attacked us any time since 9/11, I \nsubmit they would have. We have had an Attorney General, John Ashcroft,\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\nwho utilized the powers and laws provided to this country and our \nleadership to go after them.\n  These people are entitled to certain rights, but not the same rights \nthat exist for an American citizen. They represent a different kind of \nthreat. They are unlawful combatants. They are an unlawful enemy which \nrejects and despises law. They reject our Constitution. They reject \ndemocracy. They see it as a threat. They want to rule their people \naccording to their narrow definition of law. They want to oppress \nwomen. They do not want progress. They do not want freedom. They do not \nwant the things the whole world needs. And those societies and that \nkind of mentality are what cause wars, not democracies.\n  I feel strongly about this. It is important for us to be clear: We as \na nation do not support, justify, or condone torture. We are \ndisciplining people who have done so. We are putting people in jail who \nhave done so. Guardsmen who came out of our communities, went to Iraq, \nworked midnight to 6 a.m., were away from home, lost their discipline \nand conducted themselves in ways that brought disrepute on the United \nStates and violated our rules and standards of the military are being \ntried and convicted and put in jail, as they should be. It is sad we \nsee that happen, and I know we will continue to punish those who \nviolate our standards. As a result of those prosecutions and those \nactions, our military will show even greater discipline.\n  I see the Senator from Idaho in the Chamber. I am sure he wishes to \nspeak. I want to yield to him because I respect his insight on these \nmatters.\n  I will say, I am disappointed--deeply disappointed--in the unfair \nattacks that have been placed on Judge Gonzales. He is being blamed for \nevery single thing about which people have complaints in the war \nagainst terrorism. They are saying he is responsible for everything \nthat may have gone wrong, some of which was wrong, some of which \nprobably was not wrong, but is being characterized as wrong. It is not \nright. He was counsel to the President. He did his duty. He sought the \nopinion from the proper people to give legal opinions on terrorism and \nwar, and he conducted himself consistent with those principles. He \nsteadfastly and continuously has condemned torture. He should be \nconfirmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe Senator from Alabama. Over the last several years, I have had the \nprivilege of serving with Senator Sessions on the Judiciary Committee. \nI have gained such phenomenal respect for his keen intellect and bright \nlegal mind. When one listens to him, as those who might be watching \ntoday have, they get the truth, direct, clear, understandable, and \nunvarnished. That is what it is all about.\n  The obfuscation of the truth sometimes finds its way to the Senate \nfloor, and my guess is that it is finding its way to the Senate floor \nin the debate on the nomination of Alberto Gonzales.\n  I rise in support of the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be our \nnext Attorney General. It seems to me that some of our colleagues are \ninterested in not the true man and his qualifications but more in what \nthey perceive to be the politics and the policies of this \nadministration.\n  In the last Congress, I had the privilege of serving as a member of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee and I witnessed this tactic used against \njudicial nominees time and time again, a tactic of equating a lawyer's \nperformance as legal counsel with his likely performance to the very \ndifferent role of being a judge. We saw that argued time and time again \nfor a political purpose, not a reasonable analysis of the character of \nthe individual and how he or she might perform in the new role in which \nthey were being asked to participate.\n  Likewise, in this debate some have argued we should evaluate Judge \nGonzales's fitness for the post of Attorney General, the Nation's top \ncop, based on a politically driven examination of his work product as \nthe President's Counsel. I urge my colleagues to abandon that tactic, \nreject that argument, and look at the lifetime achievement of the \nnominee if my colleagues truly want to understand who Judge Gonzales is \nand what he is qualified to do in the role he is now being asked to \nplay by our President.\n  I feel strongly that the Senate should vote to confirm this man. I \nhad the privilege of getting to know Judge Gonzales and work with him \nfirsthand while I served on the Judiciary Committee and in a variety of \nother settings.\n  First, Judge Gonzales's past experiences have prepared him for the \nposition to serve honorably in that position, in my opinion, without \nquestion. As Counsel to the President, he has been instrumental in \ncoordinating our Nation's law enforcement in the heightened security \nenvironment. Following 9/11, as Senator Sessions has just referred to, \nwhile serving as Counsel to the President, Judge Gonzales paid \nparticular attention to protecting our Nation from terrorism, while not \nforgetting the importance of doing so under the Constitution, in order \nto safeguard our rights as free citizens.\n  Also, President Bush has acknowledged the great help Judge Gonzales \nhas been to him in helping to select the best nominees for our Federal \ncourts during the past few years. Before serving as White House \nCounsel, Judge Gonzales was distinguished as a justice of the supreme \ncourt of the State of Texas, at which time he was known as a careful \njurist who was opposed to judicial activism and who recognized the \nlimited role that the judiciary plays in our unique system of \ngovernment.\n  Additionally, Judge Gonzales advised then-Governor Bush as his chief \ncounsel in Texas. Judge Gonzales served there as both a secretary of \nstate and chief elections officer of that great State. Furthermore, \nJudge Gonzales had a successful career in the private legal sector \nprior to entering public service. What combination do we need to get \nthe very best top cop in the country? He has not only a keen legal mind \nbut is one who has had administrative experience, one who has worked \nwith large systems of government and one who knows the limit of the law \nand the limit and the capacity of the position in which he is now being \nasked to serve.\n\n  Finally, Judge Gonzales has led a life filled with many other \nactivities and honors that helped to prepare him to be an outstanding \nAttorney General, and I will name just a few of them. Judge Gonzales \nserved his country as a member of the U.S. Air Force from 1973 to 1975. \nHe was also elected to the American Law Institute in 1999 and he served \non the board of trustees of the Texas Bar Foundation for several years \nand as the president of the Houston Hispanic Bar Association from 1990 \nto 1991. Later in 1999, Judge Gonzales was chosen as the Latino Lawyer \nof the Year by the Hispanic National Bar Association.\n  As a number of my colleagues have pointed out, when Judge Gonzales is \nconfirmed, he will be this great Nation's first Hispanic Attorney \nGeneral. Through all of this, Judge Gonzales has found time to help the \nless fortunate of our country. He served on the board of directors of \nthe United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, and finally in 1997 he received \nthe Presidential Citation from the State Bar of Texas for his work in \naddressing the legal needs of indigent citizens.\n  Clearly, Alberto Gonzales is an accomplished practitioner of the law \nand he is unquestionably qualified to be our Nation's No. 1 law \nenforcement officer.\n  The second reason I support Judge Gonzales, and the nomination that \nwe are arguing in his behalf today, is the man himself and his views on \nissues facing our country and what our country needs and what his role \nis. He is very realistic, honest, and straightforward about it.\n  In the last Congress when I served on the Judiciary Committee, I \nparticipated in debates on many of these issues that we see reignited \nby this nomination. Those experiences convinced me that Judge Gonzales \nhas the necessary outlook to protecting our country from all of those \nwho would do us and our citizens harm.\n  I will talk a little bit about his views on some of these important \nissues regarding the war on terror. Judge Gonzales recognized that \nafter the attacks of September 11, the United States was at war, a new \nand unique and different kind of war that we had\n\n[[Page S851]]\n\nnever experienced before. As Senator Sessions said, a war of ideas but \na war of violence, a war in which al-Qaida was the enemy but in a way \nthat we had never experienced before. It was a unique and different \nlegal paradigm in which Judge Gonzales found himself, dealing with \nterrorists and not recognizing them merely as criminals.\n  That is why we had to change the character of some of our laws. We do \nnot wait until after the fact and go out and collect the evidence and \ndecide who may or may not have caused the violence or perpetrated a \ncrime. It is too late then, and we all know it is too late. We act \nbefore, and we act decisively, as our President did.\n  Judge Gonzales advised our President in that, and the constitutional \nconsequences, and how we work our way through and the reasonable nature \nand character of protecting human rights and being fair and \nresponsible, while all the time recognizing we were dealing with an \nenemy who in no way would deal that way or comprehend that they had any \nresponsibility to deal with us as we might deal with them.\n\n  Judge Gonzales has also worked to ensure that those detained in war \nas terrorists were treated humanely. While that allegation goes forth \ntoday, working to keep the principles of the Geneva Convention were \nclearly understood and all of that was well sought after.\n  My time is about up. My colleagues on the other side have gathered to \nspeak to this nomination.\n  In closing, I support Judge Alberto Gonzales's nomination to be our \nnext Attorney General because of his lifetime of hard work and his \naccomplishments. There is no question this man is qualified. That \nreally is not the debate today. Others are trying to divert us off into \na debate of policy or a debate of issues well beyond the character of \nthe man and his ability to serve in the role that this President has \ncast him into as nominee for Attorney General of the United States.\n  I believe he will be confirmed, and I believe he will serve honorably \nin that position. I strongly support this nomination. I ask my \ncolleagues to step beyond the politics of the day, look at the reality \nof who we place in these key roles of Government to be effective \nadministrators on behalf of all of the people, to be an Attorney \nGeneral that is fair, who understands the role of the Constitution and \nthe boundaries we placed on law enforcement and the legal community in \nthe character of building and sustaining a civil society of the kind \nthat we as Americans have come to know and appreciate, and that which \nwe would hope the rest of the world can understand.\n  Judge Gonzales understands it. Judge Gonzales will make a great \nAttorney General. I support him strongly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am only going to take a few moments. I \nhave colleagues on this side of the aisle who wish to speak during the \nhour.\n  I hear so many of the statements on the other side speak of Judge \nGonzales's personality, his upbringing, and his inspirational life \nstory. If we were just voting on his personality, his upbringing, and \nhis life story, I would vote for him with wholehearted support. \nHowever, we are not voting on the life, we are voting on the record. It \nis an enormous difference. Equally important, we are not voting on an \nAttorney General to serve only the President, we are voting on the \nAttorney General for the United States.\n  So many of the supporters of Judge Gonzales have said that they abhor \nthe idea of torture. They say that they believe the Bybee memo was \nwrong. They say that these policies are wrong.\n  Of course they are wrong, but these are the policies that were held \nin place by the administration for as long as they remained secret. The \nBybee memo was sought by Judge Gonzales. It was agreed to by him. He \napparently still takes the position that there are circumstances where \nthe President of the United States is above the law.\n  I don't want someone to serve as Attorney General who will be a good \nsoldier for the President. I would have said the same thing, whether it \nwas a Democratic President or Republican President. I want someone for \nAttorney General who will be independent, who will give the best \npossible advice and protect the rights of all of Americans.\n  I am the parent of a former Marine. My son has now fulfilled his duty \nfor the Marines, but if he were serving, I would worry for him as I \nworry for all the thousands of men and women serving overseas. The \ntorture policies of this administration did nothing to enhance the \nsecurity of our Americans fighting bravely. In fact, the policies put \nsoldiers and civilians in greater danger.\n  The truth is that the Bybee memo was disavowed only when the press \nfound out about it. Unfortunately, the people at the center of the \ndevelopment of these policies, who could have disavowed the memo upon \nits publication, who could have stopped it, including Judge Gonzales, \ndid nothing.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Louisiana and the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island. I don't know which one seeks recognition, \nbut I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, every 4 years an individual chosen by the \nAmerican people steps forward to assume the awesome responsibilities as \nPresident of the United States. His first act is to take this oath:\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the \n     office of the President of the United States and I will, to \n     the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n\n  George W. Bush took this oath on January 20, 2001, and again a few \ndays ago on January 20, 2005. His overarching responsibility is to \npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. In order to protect, \npreserve, and defend the Constitution, you must understand what it \nsays. As such, a President must rely on the advice of his legal \ncounsel.\n  Alberto Gonzales has served as President Bush's legal counsel since \n2001. In this capacity, he has provided advice to him that, in my view, \nignores both the letter and spirit of the Constitution and the \nPresident's critical responsibility to preserve, protect, and defend \nit. Through his advice, he has set in motion policies that have harmed \nour interests at home and abroad.\n  Our Nation was founded by men and women fleeing severe political and \nreligious persecution. Wary of authoritarian government or religious \nleaders, they created a nation by and for the people, a nation \ncommitted to the rule of law and the notion that every person has \ncertain inalienable rights. Our Founding Fathers very deliberately did \nnot create a new monarchy. They did not crown a king. Instead, they \ncreated a new system of government that relied on the rule of law that \nwas agreed upon by representatives of the people.\n  As article VI of the Constitution states so eloquently:\n\n       This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which \n     shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or \n     which shall be made, under the Authority of the United \n     States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land. . . .\n\n  The Constitution is the supreme law, not the word of the President. I \nwould also emphasize the language here includes all treaties, including \nthe Geneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture.\n  They are not extrajudicial. They are part of the Constitution. They \nare part of the responsibility of all of us to defend.\n  In the United States of America, the Constitution, our Federal laws \nand our treaty obligations are the means by which we as a people, in \nthis grand experiment we call democracy, have agreed to rule ourselves.\n  The President, all Senators, all Representatives, the members of our \nstate legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of \nthe United States and the individual states, are bound by an oath to \nsupport our Constitution.\n  This oath to defend and support our Constitution was also taken by \nJudge Gonzales in his current position as counsel to the President.\n  Now, Judge Gonzales is being considered to serve as the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, the chief law enforcement officer of the \nUnited States.\n  It is Judge Gonzales's failure to defend and support our \nConstitution, our federal laws, and our treaty obligations that leads \nme to believe he does not have the wisdom or judgment to be our next \nAttorney General.\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\n  Our Nation's Attorney General must ensure that no person is above the \nlaw--including the President of the United States--and that no person \nis outside the law, whether that person is deemed an enemy combatant, \nor held outside the United States.\n  Judge Gonzales's record does not justify such an appointment.\n  I recognize that much of the advice that Judge Gonzales gave was in \nthe aftermath of the attacks of 9/11 and the emergence of the al-Qaida \nnetwork as a grievous threat to the United States. Small terrorist \ncells dispersed worldwide and committed to suicide attacks producing \nmass casualties represented a new and disturbing threat to our country. \nThe possibility that al-Qaida or other terrorist cells might acquire \nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear devices, added an even \nmore frightening element to the dangers we faced. We had to face this \nthreat realistically. The policies of deterrence that served us well in \nthe Cold War are difficult, if not impossible, to apply to these \nruthless groups of terrorists. With respect to al-Qaida, we had to take \npreemptive action. And, we did in Afghanistan.\n  But the nature of this threat did not relieve us of our \nresponsibilities to the Constitution and the structure of international \ntreaties embodied in the Constitution. This is not being naive or \nsentimental. The durability of the Constitution testifies to both its \nstrength and its wisdom. The structure of international treaties \nreflects hard won agreements based on experience. The Constitution \nrequires careful and sincere interpretation when new challenges arise. \nIt cannot be ignored or trivialized.\n  When it comes to the issue of the conduct of war, legal guidance must \nbe particularly clear and it must recognize that the fury of war too \noften brings out the worst.\n  Ages ago, Thucydides wrote:\n\n       War, depriving people of their expected resources, is a \n     tutor of violence, hardening men to match the conditions they \n     face . . . Suspicion of prior atrocities drives men to \n     surpass report in their own cruel innovations, either by \n     subtlety of assault or extravagance of reprisal.\n\n  Shakespeare captured the essence of this visceral violence in his \nimmortal phrase, ``Cry Havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.''\n  Abraham Lincoln understood the passions and emotions that grip the \nwarrior. Writing to a friend in the midst of our Civil War, President \nLincoln declared:\n\n       Thought is forced from old channels into confusion. \n     Deception breeds and thrives. Confidence dies, and universal \n     suspicion reigns. Each man feels an impulse to kill his \n     neighbor, lest he be first killed by him. Revenge and \n     retaliation follow. And all this, as before said, may be \n     among honest men only. But this is not all. Every foul bird \n     comes abroad, and every dirty reptile rises up.\n\n  Yet, the guidance provided by this Administration was confused at \nbest and relied on the fine parsing of legal terms which may pass \nmuster in the contemplative chambers of a judge but fails miserably in \nthe crucible of war. This advice was a disservice to the men and women \nof the Armed Forces.\n  It is clear that as White House counsel, Judge Gonzales has been one \nof the architect's of the Administration's post 9/11 policies. In \nparticular, he has helped craft or agreed to policies regarding the \ntreatment of individuals captured and detained in the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. These policies have denied detainees the \nprotections of the Geneva Conventions, permitted them to be \ninterrogated under a dramatically narrowed definition of torture, and \ndenied them access to counsel or judicial review.\n  In at least one memorandum, Judge Gonzales apparently agreed that the \nPresident has the ability to override the U.S. Constitution and \nimmunize acts of torture.\n  Although supporters of Judge Gonzales will point out that only one of \nfive memoranda discussed at his nomination hearing were written by \nJudge Gonzales, he clearly acquiesced to the conclusions in the other \nmemos.\n  As White House counsel, Judge Gonzales's role was to decide what \nlegal advice was needed from the Department of Justice and then to \nweigh and distill that advice before giving his opinion to the \nPresident.\n  It is clear from the record that Judge Gonzales either agreed with \nthe legal advice dispensed in these memoranda, or allowed poor legal \nadvice to be passed onto the President.\n  Either way, I believe Judge Gonzales has been deeply involved in \npolicies that have undermined our standing in the world and our \nhistoric commitment to the rule of law.\n  I think we must first put these memos and decisions in historical \ncontext.\n  The issue of the treatment of detainees in war is not a new one and \nan extensive legal framework has been developed to guide a nation's \nbehavior during conflict.\n  The most well known and comprehensive are the Geneva Conventions, \ncreated in 1948, to mitigate the harmful effects of war on all persons \nwho find themselves in the hand of a belligerent party. 192 countries, \nincluding the United States and Afghanistan ratified the treaty.\n  The Geneva Conventions were created in the aftermath of World War II \nand the Nuremberg Trials, by a world which had just experienced warring \narmies, the systematic rounding up and extermination of millions of \ninnocent civilians, squalid POW camps, death marches, resistance \nmovements and the aftermath of two nuclear bombs. Those who drafted the \nGeneva Conventions had pretty much seen it all, and they accounted for \nall of it in the Conventions.\n  The United States clearly took the Conventions seriously and made \nthem the part of the law of our land by incorporating them as part of \nour legal system.\n  The War Crimes Act, passed by Congress and signed by the President in \n1996, makes ``a grave breach'' of the Geneva Conventions a crime \npunishable by prison and even the death penalty.\n  Adding to this legal structure, the United States ratified the United \nNation's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1992. \nThe ICCPR prohibits arbitrary detention and ``cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment.'' The United States notified the UN that it \ninterprets ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'' to \nmean cruel and unusual treatment or punishment prohibited by the First, \nEighth and/or Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\n  Furthermore, in 1998, the United States ratified the Convention \nAgainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment. The Convention requires parties to take measures to prevent \ntorture from occurring within any territory under their jurisdictions, \nregardless of the existence of ``exceptional circumstances'' such as a \nwar or threat of war, internal political instability or other public \nemergency. The U.S. Congress implemented the treaty by enacting 18 \nU.S.C. sections 2340-2340A. Torture is defined in this statute as ``an \nact committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically \nintended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering upon \nanother person within his custody or control'' outside the United \nStates. Offenders can be subject to imprisonment and the death penalty.\n  The laws of warfare are also an integral part of military training \nand conduct. The Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ, was a law \nenacted by Congress in 1950. The mistreatment of prisoners may be \npunishable as a crime under article 93, UCMJ, which forbids a soldier \nto act with ``cruelty toward, or oppression or maltreatment of, any \npersons subject to his orders.'' Article 97 prohibits the arrest or \nconfinement of any person except as provided by law. The UCMJ also \npunishes ordinary crimes against persons such as assault, rape, sodomy, \nindecent assault, murder, manslaughter, and maiming. Article 134 also \npunishes ``all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order \nand discipline in the armed forces'' and ``all conduct of a nature to \nbring discredit upon the armed forces.''\n  The Army also has regulations implementing the laws of war, including \nregulation 190-08, which implements the Geneva Conventions. All \nsoldiers are expected to abide by Army regulations and if a soldier \nviolates a regulation, he or she is subject to punishment under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice.\n  Despite the Constitution's clear prohibition on cruel and unusual \npunishment, despite law after law, treaty after treaty prohibiting \ntorture, the President's chief counsel, Judge\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\nGonzales, requested a series of legal memos regarding the applicability \nof treaty provisions and permissible interrogation techniques in the \nwar on terrorism.\n  One of these memos, the August 1, 2002, Bybee Memorandum, was \napparently written to explore what coercive tactics U.S. officials \ncould use without being held criminally liable.\n  This memo created a new and radically narrow definition of torture. \nIt stated that torture would require interrogators to have specific \nintent to cause physical pain that ``must be equivalent in intensity to \nthe pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, \nimpairment of bodily function or even death.'' Mental torture is \ndefined in the statute but the Justice Department memo states that \nmental torture must result in ``significant psychological harm lasting \nfor months or even years.''\n  According to Harold Koh, Dean of the Yale Law School, former \nAssistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, and \nan international law expert, this memo is ``the most clearly erroneous \nlegal opinion'' he has ever read. In testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee he stated:\n\n       In sum, the August 1, 2002 OLC memorandum is a stain upon \n     our law and our national reputation. A legal opinion that is \n     so lacking in historical context, that offers a definition of \n     torture so narrow that it would have exculpated Saddam \n     Hussein, that reads the Commander-in-Chief power so as to \n     remove Congress as a check against torture, that turns \n     Nuremberg on its head, and that gives government officials a \n     license for cruelty can only be described--as my predecessor \n     Eugene Rostow described the Japanese internment cases--as a \n     ``disaster.''\n       One would have expected the Counsel to the President to \n     have immediately repudiated such an opinion. Judge Gonzales \n     did not.\n\n  Instead, this memo was endorsed by Judge Gonzales as the legal \nopinion of the Justice Department on the standard for torture.\n  Now, over 30 years ago, the U.S. Navy vessel USS Pueblo was sent on \nan intelligence mission off the coast of North Korea. On January 23, \n1968, it was attacked by North Korean naval and air forces. Eighty-one \nsurviving crewmembers of the USS Pueblo were captured and held captive \nfor 11 months. One survivor, Harry Iredale, related his experiences \nwith a North Korean interrogator named, ``The Bear:''\n\n       The Bear proceeded to yell at me to confess. He had me \n     kneel on the floor while two guards placed a 2-inch diameter \n     pole behind my knees and other guards jumped on each end of \n     it several times. Then the Bear picked up a hammer handle and \n     proceeded to smash it onto my head, completely encircling my \n     head with lumps as I screamed in pain.\n\n  I think most of us would consider this graphic description one of \ntorture. But under the Bybee memorandum's definition, this would not \nconstitute organ failure or death, so it would not be considered \ntorture.\n  More importantly, perhaps, is that the North Korean regime still \nexists and thousands of American soldiers line the border. Our soldiers \ncould still be captured. And now we cannot hold the North Koreans to a \nhigher standard of conduct, because ours is the same.\n  The August Bybee memorandum also enumerated reasons that American \nofficials could not be held criminally liable for coercive \ninterrogation tactics that fell outside of this new narrow definition \nof torture.\n  It also posits that officials can invoke ``necessity'' or ``self-\ndefense'' as a defense against prosecution for such acts, despite the \nfact the Convention Against Torture clearly states there are no \n``exceptional circumstances'' that may be invoked as justification for \ntorture.\n  Although the torture provisions of the August 2002 Bybee memo were \nrescinded and replaced four weeks ago by a new December 30, 2004 memo, \nthe Bybee memo was Administration policy for almost 2\\1/2\\ years and \nhas had extremely harmful effect on both our military and intelligence \ncommunities.\n  If this memo with its narrow definition of torture was so wrong on \nits face that it had to be rescinded, why didn't Judge Gonzales know it \nwas wrong at the time he requested and endorsed it?\n  One of the most disturbing parts of the August Bybee memorandum is \nthe suggestion that the President and other executive officials can \nescape prosecution for torture on the ground that ``they were carrying \nout the President's Commander-in-Chief powers.''\n  By adopting the doctrine of ``just following orders'' as a valid \ndefense for United States soldiers and officials, the opinion \nundermines the very underpinnings of individual criminal responsibility \nset forth after World War II, and now embodied in the basic instruments \nof international criminal law.\n  This memorandum basically puts the President, and his subordinates, \nabove the law, as it states, ``any effort to regulate the interrogation \nof battlefield combatants would violate the Constitution's sole vesting \nof the Commander-in-Chief authority in the President.''\n  This is antithetical to everything we know about our founding \ndocument and the rule of law.\n  It ignores the fact that the Convention Against Torture and other \ntreaties have been approved by Congress, elucidated by statute and \nbecome the law of the land.\n  The Bybee memo's reading of the President's powers as Commander-in-\nChief essentially would allow him to ignore or order that the criminal \nprohibition against torture in the United States code be set aside. The \nPresident could trump Congress' power under Article I, section 8, \nclause 10 to ``define and punish . . . offenses against the law of \nnations'' such as torture.\n  Interestingly, nowhere does the August Bybee memorandum mention the \nlandmark Youngstown Steel & Tube Co. v. Sawyer decision in which the \nSupreme Court explained why the President's Commander-in-Chief or \ninherent executive power were not enough to allow him to take over the \nAmerican steel industry during a time of crisis. In his concurring \nopinion, Justice Jackson eloquently discussed the limits on such \nPresidential powers, especially when the ``President takes measures \nincompatible with the express or implied will of Congress.''\n  In fact, Bybee cites no precedent for his unique enhancement of the \nPresident's Commander-in-Chief power other than:\n\n       In light of the President's complete authority over the \n     conduct of war, without a clear statement otherwise, we will \n     not read a criminal statute as infringing on the President's \n     ultimate authority in these areas. We have long recognized, \n     and the Supreme Court has established a canon of statutory \n     construction that statues are to be construed in a manner \n     that avoids constitutional difficulties so long as a \n     reasonable alternative construction is available.\n\n  This is nonsense. There are statutes on the book outlawing torture. \nThere is no precedent cited because scant precedent exists, it any.\n  Now if this Commander in Chief override exists, if the President can \nexercise his Commander-in-Chief power to ask his subordinates to engage \nin torture to protect the national security of our country, how would \nthis be done? One would think the Commander-in-Chief would have to \norder his subordinates to engage in such conduct for it to be legal. So \nwhere are the orders? And if there are no orders, aren't U.S. soldiers \nand intelligence officers still subject to the supreme law of our \nland--our Constitution, our statutes and our treaty obligations--and \ncan they not be prosecuted for violations of this law? How would Judge \nGonzales approach this dilemma, created by his own legal reasoning, if \nhe is nominated-confirmed Attorney General? Would he prosecute \nsubordinates of the President who engaged in what most rational people \nwould consider torture during the past 2\\1/2\\ years and then defend \nthemselves with the reasoning in the Bybee memorandum?\n  In addition, at this time there are over 20,000 private contractors \nin Iraq. Many of them are engaging in ``military functions'' in support \nof U.S. forces. These civilians are currently liable for prosecution in \nU.S. courts for various offenses, under the U.S. laws implementing the \nConvention on Torture. In addition, persons who are ``employed by or \naccompanying the armed forces'' may be prosecuted under the Military \nExtraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. Now, many such offenses are \npermitted by the Bybee memorandum but are prohibited by other U.S. law.\n  Again, would Judge Gonzales vigorously prosecute violations of law \nthat, either through his advice or the legal reasoning he deemed were \nacceptable practices activities?\n  Now the creation of this so-called Commander-in-Chief override power \nhas created some consternation in\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\nlegal circles. But neither Judge Gonzales nor the Justice Department \nhas backed away from it.\n\n  The December 30, 2004, memo declares that it supersedes the August \n2002 Bybee memo in its entirety. However, the Office of Legal Counsel \nhas not yet clearly and specifically renounced the parts of the August \n2002 memorandum concerning the Commander in Chief's power stating:\n\n       Consideration of the bounds of any such authority would be \n     inconsistent with the President's unequivocal directive that \n     United States persons not engage in torture.\n\n  Judge Gonzales's own public statements have also urged a broad view \nof the President's power to conduct the war on terror. In a June 2004 \nspeech before the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Law \nand National Security, Judge Gonzales stated:\n\n       [The President] has not had to--as I indicated, in terms of \n     what he has done or has not done, he has not exercised his \n     Commander-in-Chief override, he has not determined that \n     torture is, in fact, necessary to protect the national \n     security of this country.\n\n  But it seems that Judge Gonzales's statement is at least providing \nfor a situation in which the President could make that determination, \nbut under what constitutional principle I do not know.\n  Furthermore, Judge Gonzales was unwilling to repudiate the Commander \nin Chief override power when asked directly about it during his \nconfirmation hearing, saying that it was a hypothetical question about \na hypothetical situation and he was ``not prepared in this hearing to \ngive you an answer to such an important question.''\n  Now, I always assumed the purpose of a hearing to confirm a Cabinet \nofficial was that he would answer, after preparation, important \nquestions involving his proposed responsibilities. Apparently, Judge \nGonzales did not believe that was the role of the hearing. He provided \nno answer.\n  In addition, in responding to a followup question submitted by \nSenator Leahy, Judge Gonzales refused to answer in the affirmative that \nthe President could not override the Convention Against Torture and any \nimplementing legislation and immunize the use of torture under any \ncircumstances, stating again:\n\n       [T]he President does not intend to use any authority he \n     might conceivably have to authorize the use of torture.\n\n  I guess it is one of those situations where torture is in the eye of \nthe beholder. Much of what seems to have happened to those crew members \nof the Pueblo looks to us as torture, but I guess it was not torture \nunder the Bybee memorandum.\n  As Attorney General, Judge Gonzales will be responsible for enforcing \nthe laws of our land. But he himself created an exception to these laws \nfor the President. He not only allowed torture to be redefined, he also \nagreed to a new, unchecked power for the President that no President \nbefore ever had.\n  Now, I would like to discuss two memoranda Judge Gonzales requested \nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel regarding U.S. \ntreaty obligations in the war in Afghanistan. Specifically, he asked if \ntreaties forming part of the laws of armed conflict applied to \nconditions of detention and procedures for trials of members of al-\nQaida and the Taliban militia. He also asked that if the Geneva \nConventions did apply in Afghanistan, would the Taliban, the military \nforce of Afghanistan, qualify for prisoner-of-war status.\n  As I noted earlier, after World War II, the United Nations drafted, \nand most of the world, including the United States and Afghanistan, \nratified the Geneva Conventions. There are four conventions. The third \nconvention defines six classes of persons who, if captured, should be \nconsidered as prisoners of war. The most protected class under the \nGeneva Conventions is the prisoner-of-war category. Civilians and spies \nare protected as other classes in the fourth Geneva Convention. Running \nthrough all of these conventions is common article 3, which prohibits:\n\n       [O]utrages upon personal dignity, in particular, \n     humiliating and degrading treatment.\n\n  Most experts would agree this is the minimum standard for the \ntreatment of all detainees.\n  As I stated in the beginning of my remarks, September 11 did usher in \na new era. It was reasonable for Judge Gonzales to wonder if perhaps a \ngroup such as al-Qaida was one of those categories of individuals or \ngroups that was not authorized automatic protection under the Geneva \nConvention. However, the Geneva Conventions maintain if the status of a \ncaptured individual is in doubt, a competent tribunal must decide that \nstatus. Furthermore, the Geneva Conventions are only one part of the \nlaw of armed conflict. The Convention Against Torture and the assurance \nof basic human rights remain in place at all times.\n  On January 22, 2002, the Justice Department sent a memo to Judge \nGonzales regarding treaty obligations. Also signed by Jay Bybee, the \nAssistant Attorney General, the memo analyzed the War Crimes Act and \nthe Geneva Conventions and concluded:\n\n       [N]either the federal War Crimes Act nor the Geneva \n     Conventions would apply to the detention conditions of al-\n     Qaida prisoners. We also conclude that the President has the \n     plenary constitutional powers to suspend our treaty \n     obligations toward Afghanistan during the period of conflict.\n\n  A memo sent 2 weeks later concluded that the Taliban did not qualify \nfor prisoner-of-war status.\n  Now, legal experts can and have disagreed about the conclusions \nreached by the Department of Justice. But what I find deeply disturbing \nis the questionable judgment and cavalier attitude Judge Gonzales used \noutlining his recommendations as White House legal counsel.\n  On January 25, 2002, Judge Gonzales drafted a memorandum to the \nPresident agreeing with the January Bybee memorandum. He states two \npositive aspects of this decision. First, he finds that suspending \nthese treaty obligations ``preserves flexibility,'' which, I would \nnote, is not a legal conclusion. He then states that the war on \nterrorism is a new kind of war, a ``new paradigm that renders obsolete \nGeneva's strict limitation on questioning of enemy prisoners and \nrenders quaint some of its provisions.'' A second positive aspect Judge \nGonzales concluded is that since the Geneva Conventions do not apply to \nal-Qaida and the Taliban, it ``substantially reduces the threat of \ndomestic criminal prosecution under the War Crimes Act.''\n  Judge Gonzales then goes on to list seven negative points about \nsuspending the War Crimes Act and the Geneva Conventions in these \ncircumstances, including:\n  The U.S. had abided by the Geneva Conventions since their creation in \n1948.\n  The U.S. could then not invoke the Geneva Conventions for U.S. forces \ncaptured or mistreated in Afghanistan.\n  The War Crimes Act could not be used against the enemy.\n  The position would ``likely provoke widespread condemnation among our \nallies and in some domestic quarters.''\n  In the future, other countries may look for ``loopholes'' to avoid \ncomplying with the Geneva Conventions.\n  The determination ``could undermine U.S. military culture which \nemphasizes maintaining the highest standards of conduct of combat, and \ncould introduce an element of uncertainty in the status of \nadversaries.''\n  Remarkably, after weighing the pros and cons, Judge Gonzales found \nthe negatives of such a decision by the President were \n``unpersuasive.'' He concurred in the Justice Department's decision \nthat the Geneva Convention did not apply to al-Qaida and the Taliban.\n  On January 26, 2002, Secretary of State Powell objected to the \npresentation and conclusions in the Gonzales memo. Secretary Powell \nsent his own memo to Gonzales, stating:\n\n       I am concerned that the draft does not squarely present to \n     the President the options that are available to him. Nor does \n     it identify the significant pros and cons of each option.\n\n  Secretary Powell lists as cons, in his words:\n\n       It will reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice \n     in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the \n     protections of the law of war for our troops; it is a high \n     cost in terms of negative international reaction, with \n     immediate adverse consequences for our conduct of foreign \n     policy; it will undermine public support among critical \n     allies, making military cooperation more difficult to \n     sustain; and Europeans and others will likely have legal \n     problems with extradition.\n\n  At a February 4, 2002, National Security Council meeting to decide \nthis issue and make recommendations to the President, the Department of \nState, the Department of Defense, and\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were in agreement that all \ndetainees would get the treatment they are or would be entitled to \nunder the Geneva Conventions.\n  Now Judge Gonzales was faced with two opposing opinions: one, from \nthe Department of Justice, which offered a new and untried approach to \ninternational law; and the other which was supported by decades of \nprecedent and the entire military establishment, which was actually \ngoing to be on the front lines of the conflict. Judge Gonzales had to \nchoose what he was going to advise the President.\n  On February 7, 2002, President Bush, presumably following the legal \nadvice of his counsel, issued a memorandum stating that the Geneva \nConventions did not apply to al-Qaida, and that while the Taliban were \ncovered by the Geneva Conventions, they did not qualify for POW status. \nThe fact that the third Geneva Convention requires a competent tribunal \nto determine this fact was ignored. Furthermore, President Bush stated \nthat the Geneva Conventions' common article 3, the minimum standard of \nhuman rights for noncombatants, including prisoners, did not apply to \neither al-Qaida or the Taliban.\n  Mr. President, these questionable decisions of Judge Gonzales have \nprofound effects. What he found unpersuasive was the most correct \nstatement in his memo--that his advice would, in his words, ``undermine \nU.S. military culture which emphasizes maintaining the highest \nstandards of conduct in combat and could introduce an element of \nuncertainty in the status of adversaries.''\n  In January 2004, the Pentagon announced that they were investigating \nreports of abuse of prisoners in Iraq. In May 2004, the world was \nhorrified when pictures of some of the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison \nbecame public. Now for many months, DOD officials have maintained that \nsuch abuses were the acts of a few depraved, low-ranking individuals, \nbut reports of abuses in other prisons, such as Guantanamo and the \nAdhamiya Palace in Baghdad, are coming to light.\n  To date, the Pentagon has initiated several investigations into these \nabuses. Only some of the investigations have been completed, and they \nall concern Abu Ghraib. However, they have startlingly similar \nfindings. President Bush's February 7, 2002, memorandum set new policy \nthat conflicted with longstanding Army doctrine based on established \nlaws of war, and this conflict caused confusion and ultimately a \ncorrosion of standards.\n  The Schlesinger report, released on August 24, 2004, was written by \nan independent panel chaired by the former Secretary of Defense, Jim \nSchlesinger, to review DOD detention operations. In fact, the report \nwas essentially commissioned by the present Secretary of Defense, Mr. \nRumsfeld. Dr. Schlesinger pointedly blamed the administration for \nconfusion in the ranks. The Schlesinger report found ``Lieutenant \nGeneral Sanchez signed a memo authorizing a dozen interrogation \ntechniques beyond standard Army practice, including five beyond those \napplied at Guantanamo . . . using reasoning from the president's memo \nof February 7, 2002.''\n  Another report, completed by Lieutenant General Jones, stated that \nconfusion over different standards for detainee treatment and \ninterrogation, dictated by the administration and followed through by \nthe Army, led to ``a permissive and compromising climate for \nsoldiers.''\n  In order to overcome these problems, the Schlesinger report \nrecommended that ``the United States should further define its policy \napplicable to both the Department of Defense and other Government \nagencies, on the categorization and status of all detainees as it \napplies to various operations and theories. It should define their \nstatus and treatment in a way consistent with U.S. jurisprudence and \nmilitary doctrine and with the [United States] interpretation of the \nGeneva Conventions.''\n  It is a fact of life that there are always going to be abuses of \nhuman rights in time of war. But the abuses I have discussed above, and \nthat are still, unfortunately, coming to light, are systemic. I would \nargue that they are the result of a corrosive trend started by the \nPresident's February 7 memo, which was based on advice given by Judge \nGonzales in consultation with the Department of Justice. This is not \nthe type of legal thinking and judgment that I find suitable for the \nOffice of Attorney General.\n  There is one final issue that needs to be mentioned. That is the \ndeeply disturbing issue of ``ghost detainees.'' The Bush administration \nhas always maintained that the Geneva Conventions are in force in Iraq. \nArticle 49 of the fourth Geneva Convention prohibits ``individual or \nmass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons \nfrom occupied territory . . . regardless of their motive.''\n  Yet an October 24, 2004, Washington Post story states that a \nconfidential March 19, 2004, Justice Department memorandum granted \npermission to the CIA to take Iraqis out of their country to be \ninterrogated for a ``brief but not indefinite period.'' It also said \nthe CIA can permanently remove ``illegal aliens.'' Other reports state \nthat as many as a dozen detainees were moved under this policy.\n  In addition, the third and fourth Geneva Conventions maintain that \ninternational organizations such as the Red Cross must have access to \nprisoners. Two generals investigating the abuses of Abu Ghraib, Major \nGeneral Taguba and General Kern, noted in their reports that the U.S. \nhid prisoners from Red Cross teams. General Kern stated that the number \nof ghost detainees ``is in the dozens, perhaps up to 100.''\n\n  The role of Judge Gonzales in the production and approval of this \nmemo is yet unknown. But given his participation in other decisions \nmade about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is not irrational to \nassume that he had some participation.\n  The existence of ghost detainees is a violation of the Geneva \nConvention. Someone is responsible for this decision and must be held \naccountable. If Judge Gonzales is confirmed as Attorney General, will \nhe pursue these types of investigations and potential prosecutions?\n  Some of my colleagues will likely state that opposition to Judge \nGonzales is partisan politics. But we are not alone in opposing this \nnomination. Twelve retired admirals and generals sent a letter to the \nJudiciary Committee expressing deep concerns about the nomination of \nJudge Gonzales. This letter includes the following statement:\n\n       During his tenure as White House Counsel, Judge Gonzales \n     appears to have played a significant role in shaping U.S. \n     detention and interrogation operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, \n     Guantanamo Bay, and elsewhere. Today it is clear that these \n     operations have forced a greater animosity towards the \n     [United States], undermined our intelligence gathering \n     efforts, and added to the risks facing our troops serving \n     around the world.\n\n  These are the words of distinguished general officers who have served \ntheir country in uniform upwards of 30 or more years.\n  A group of 17 religious leaders and organizations also sent a letter \nto the Judiciary Committee expressing concern about Judge Gonzales's \nnomination and his role, in their words, in ``sanctioning torture.'' \nAnother group of more than 200 religious leaders sent a letter to Judge \nGonzales stating:\n\n       We fear that your legal judgments have paved the way to \n     torture and abuse.\n\n  Even his colleagues in the legal community have doubts. A group of \n329 prominent lawyers sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee stating \nthat Judge Gonzales's purported role in deciding the treatment of \ndetainees ``raises fundamental questions about Judge Gonzales's \nfidelity to the rule of law, about his views concerning the \nresponsibility of a government lawyer, and about the role of the \nDepartment of Justice.''\n  Much has been made and much should be made about Judge Gonzales's \nrise from very humble beginnings. There is no disputing this fact. \nThere is no disputing that the nomination of a Latino to such an August \nposition is a significant, notable moment in our Nation's history. \nIndeed, there are many people in my State who see their deepest hopes \nand dreams for their children and grandchildren in the story of Judge \nGonzales's rise. Such a sense of pride is no small thing. But our duty \nas Senators is to advise and consent on the fitness and skills of \nnominees. And there are few positions in the Cabinet that are as \nsensitive and important as that of Attorney General.\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\n  As heartening as Judge Gonzales's personal story is, like the \ncongressional Hispanic caucus and a number of civil rights groups such \nas the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, I believe that Judge \nGonzales has left too many important questions unanswered.\n  Indeed, as The congressional Hispanic caucus has pointed out:\n\n       [T]he Latino community continues to lack clear information \n     about how the nominee, as Attorney General, would influence \n     policies on such important topics as the Voting Rights Act, \n     affirmative action, protections for persons of limited \n     English proficiency, due process rights of immigrants, and \n     the role of local police in enforcing federal immigration \n     laws.\n\n  The right to vote, protection from discrimination, and assistance for \nthose who have yet to master the English language are issues of great \nimportance to Latinos in my State, and they deserve real answers. \nDespite Judge Gonzales's superb academic credentials and his record of \nachievement, I have too many concerns about his decisions made on legal \nmatters, particularly in his role of the past 4 years as White House \nCounsel, to vote for his confirmation.\n  The genius of our Founding Fathers was not to allow power to be \nconcentrated in the hands of a few. They were particularly concerned \nabout a concentration of power in the President. Although they made the \nPresident the Chief Executive Officer of our Government and the \nCommander in Chief, the Founding Fathers constrained the President \nthrough the very structure of our Government, through both law and \ntreaty. The Attorney General has a duty not just to serve the President \nbut, also and ultimately, to support, protect, and defend the \nconstitutional commitment to a system of checks and balances. I do not \nfeel comfortable with Judge Gonzales's ability to do this.\n  After studying his record, I do not believe that Judge Gonzales has \ndemonstrated the judgment necessary to perform the duties of the \nhighest law enforcement officer of our land.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na number of articles bearing on Judge Gonzales's role in torture \npolicies, as well as recent statements by the Leadership Conference on \nHuman Rights and the Center for Constitutional rights opposing this \nnomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    LCCR Opposes Gonzales Confirmation: Vote ``No'' February 2, 2005\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, largest and most \n     diverse civil and human rights coalition, we write to express \n     our opposition to the confirmation of White House Counsel \n     Alberto R. Gonzales as United States Attorney General. The \n     Leadership Conference recognizes the historic significance of \n     Mr. Gonzales's appointment as the first Hispanic American to \n     serve as Attorney General, and so the action we urge today is \n     not undertaken lightly. Regrettably, however, Mr. Gonzales's \n     failure to properly address concerns with his past record and \n     clearly explain his positions on critical civil and human \n     rights issues compels us to urge the Senate to reject his \n     confirmation.\n       Earlier this month, LCCR sent the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee a letter, signed by more than four dozen national \n     civil and human rights leaders, that expressed numerous \n     concerns with Mr. Gonzales's record and urged close scrutiny. \n     Despite a day-long hearing before the Committee, the \n     submission of written questions by Committee members, and \n     numerous inquiries by the press and the public, Mr. Gonzales \n     and the Administration have not yet provided the Senate \n     either with the critical information on his record or with \n     the commitment to accountability and transparency that are \n     prerequisites to the Senate exercising its constitutional \n     duty of advise and consent on this nomination. We remain \n     unconvinced that Mr. Gonzales would independently enforce the \n     law, rather than continue to simply rationalize it, as he did \n     while serving then-Governor George W. Bush.\n\n\n mr. gonzales has not addressed serious concerns involving the use of \n                           the death penalty\n\n       The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights opposes the death \n     penalty under all circumstances, but recognizes that it is \n     the law of the land in many states and at the federal level. \n     As the ultimate--and the only irreversible--sanction for \n     criminal conduct, capital punishment must never be \n     administered if a government has not exercised every \n     reasonable precaution at its disposal to avoid putting an \n     innocent person to death. A failure to ensure that every \n     death penalty case receives fair and balanced treatment can \n     easily lead to severe miscarriages of justice.\n       As General Counsel to then-Governor George W. Bush from \n     1995 to 1997, Mr. Gonzales advised the Governor on pending \n     clemency petitions in death penalty cases. While Governor \n     Bush exercised ultimate authority to grant or deny a clemency \n     petition, his decision in each case was based on the \n     information he received from Mr. Gonzales. It was Mr. \n     Gonzales's legal responsibility to present the Governor with \n     a full and balanced summary of each case, including any and \n     all significant mitigating factors.\n       To date, the only known physical records that document the \n     information that Mr. Gonzales provided to Mr. Bush regarding \n     clemency petitions are brief memoranda, ranging from one-and-\n     a-half to seven pages in length. Most of these memoranda were \n     dated either the day before or the day of a scheduled \n     execution.\n       The clemency memoranda are, in many cases, extremely \n     troubling. A number of them omit evidence that was presented \n     in clemency petitions such as outstanding claims of \n     innocence, allegations that a jury had failed to consider \n     material evidence, signs of mental impairment, and personal \n     mitigating factors such as severe childhood abuse. For \n     example, in the case of Carl Johnson, the clemency memorandum \n     prepared by Mr. Gonzales does not even refer to the fact that \n     Mr. Johnson had claimed he received ineffective assistance of \n     counsel because his lawyer slept through portions of his \n     trial. In the case of Terry Washington, a mentally retarded \n     33-year-old, Mr. Gonzales barely mentioned that Mr. \n     Washington's limited mental capacity (and the failure of his \n     counsel to raise it during trial) formed the central basis of \n     his thirty-page clemency petition. Instead, Mr. Gonzales \n     referred the issue of Mr. Washington's mental capacity only \n     as a piece of ``conflicting information'' about Mr. \n     Washington's background.\n       Mr. Gonzales has claimed, during questioning before the \n     Committee, that the memoranda were only ``summaries'' of the \n     death penalty cases he handled for Governor Bush, and that \n     they were typically provided at the end of a ``rolling series \n     of discussions'' about each case. Yet to date, Mr. Gonzales \n     has produced no tangible evidence of such discussions or any \n     other communications with the Governor about any death \n     penalty case, leaving serious and very troubling questions \n     remaining about whether, under Mr. Gonzales's tenure, justice \n     was properly administered in every case.\n       Mr. Gonzales's responses to questions about how he would \n     handle death penalty cases as Attorney General, if confirmed, \n     also cause significant concern. When asked about a recent \n     Justice Department report that revealed striking racial and \n     ethnic disparities in the imposition of the federal death \n     penalty, Mr. Gonzales expressed only a ``vague knowledge'' of \n     the problem. While he stated a willingness to examine the \n     application of the death penalty if he were convinced that \n     such disparities existed, he did not commit to address \n     already-documented concerns at the federal level. In \n     addition, while Mr. Gonzales was unfamiliar with Attorney \n     General Ashcroft's policy of overriding decisions by federal \n     prosecutors to not seek the death penalty, which in itself is \n     not indicative of a problem, he failed to commit to formally \n     review the practice, including its potential for racial \n     disparities.\n       In sum, as evidenced by both his past record and his \n     answers to questions about what he would do if confirmed as \n     Attorney General, Mr. Gonzales has clearly failed to assure \n     the Senate and ultimately the American people that he will \n     administer death penalty cases fairly and in accordance with \n     the law.\n\n\nmr. gonzales has failed to fully answer important questions about civil \n                          rights and liberties\n\n       In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Gonzales testified that \n     civil rights enforcement would be among his top priorities. \n     Yet while some of his responses to questions reflect some \n     level of consultation with the Justice Department (see \n     response #5 to Senator Biden, p. 2; response #3 to Senator \n     Durbin, p. 20), we are very troubled that his responses to \n     questions on many extremely important civil rights issues \n     were vague and were neither well-informed nor well-developed. \n     For example:\n       In response to questions about Title VI of the Civil Rights \n     Act, which prohibits racial and gender discrimination in \n     federally funded programs and activities, Mr. Gonzales failed \n     to commit to the enforcement of the Title VI regulations, as \n     distinguished from the Title VI statute itself. This is \n     troubling given the longstanding recognition that the \n     regulations have a scope and application that extend beyond \n     the limits of the statute itself. Because the Supreme Court \n     in Sandoval prohibited individuals from bringing private \n     actions to enforce the Title VI regulations, the government \n     was left as the only entity with the capacity to do so. \n     Important protections against discrimination in the areas of \n     language rights, educational discrimination, environmental \n     justice, and others will be entirely lost unless the \n     Administration commits itself to bring enforcement actions. \n     However, Mr. Gonzales's failure to make such a commitment \n     suggests a substantial narrowing of the historic reach of one \n     of our fundamental civil rights laws.\n       Mr. Gonzales responded to questions by Senator Kennedy \n     about mandatory minimum sentencing by stating simply that \n     ``mandatory minimums provide a clear deterrent and have been \n     effective.'' His answers\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\n     on this topic ignore evidence, including statements from many \n     current and former judges such as Supreme Court Justice \n     Anthony Kennedy, that mandatory minimum sentences, by \n     depriving judges of their traditional discretion to tailor a \n     sentence based on the culpability of the defendant and the \n     seriousness of the crime, render our nation's criminal \n     justice system unjust, unfair, and counter-productive. And, \n     as Justice Kennedy also observed, mandatory minimum \n     sentencing has its most disproportionate impact on \n     communities of color.\n       Mr. Gonzales was asked about the disparity in sentences for \n     defendants convicted of crack vs. powder cocaine offenses. \n     Under current law, draconian statutory and guideline \n     penalties are triggered by possession or sale of a small \n     amount of crack cocaine--one hundred times less than the \n     amount of powder cocaine that triggers the same penalties. \n     Because African Americans almost exclusively have been \n     targeted by federal authorities for crack cocaine offenses, \n     they and other racial and ethnic minorities serve far longer \n     prison sentences for drug dealing than whites convicted of \n     similar offenses involving powder cocaine. The U.S. \n     Sentencing Commission has twice concluded that there is no \n     empirical basis for the 100 to 1 ratio, but it persists. Yet \n     after being presented with this information in written \n     questions following his hearing, Mr. Gonzales failed to even \n     acknowledge the racial disparities that the current policies \n     have produced.\n       Mr. Gonzales played a critical role in shaping the \n     administration's ``enemy combatants'' policy, which places \n     individuals beyond the reach of the law and subjects them to \n     indefinite, incommunicado detention. He publicly argued that \n     the President's authority was constrained not so much by the \n     rule of law but ``as a matter of prudence and policy''--a \n     view so radical that it was eventually rejected by an 8-1 \n     majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. In his responses to \n     questions about this policy, following the ruling, Mr. \n     Gonzales has still not made it clear that he, as Attorney \n     General, would be fully committed to respecting the time-\n     honored and vital role of judicial review of executive \n     actions--a matter of grave concern to citizens and \n     noncitizens alike.\n\n\n   mr. gonzales has failed to clarify his role in policies regarding \n                  torture, interrogation and detention\n\n       As White House Counsel, Mr. Gonzales oversaw the \n     development of detention, interrogation, and torture policies \n     for handling prisoners in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. \n     He wrote a 2002 memorandum disparaging the Geneva Conventions \n     and arguing that they do not bind the United States in the \n     war in Afghanistan. He urged the President to reject warnings \n     by U.S. military leaders that such policies would undermine \n     respect for the law in the military, with catastrophic \n     results. He requested and reviewed legal opinions that \n     radically altered the definition of torture and claimed U.S. \n     officials were not bound by laws prohibiting torture. He even \n     made the radical suggestion that the President has the power \n     to disregard Congressional enactments. Changes made as a \n     result to long-established U.S. policy and practices appear \n     to have paved the way for the recent horrific incidents at \n     Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\n       The Administration continues to withhold critical documents \n     that could show the extent of Mr. Gonzales's involvement in \n     setting the above policies. We believe that all relevant \n     documents should be disclosed to the American people, and \n     that the President should clarify or waive any purported \n     claims of privilege. We strongly believe that the Senate \n     cannot meet its constitutional obligations in this nomination \n     without full disclosure and review of these materials.\n                               conclusion\n       In sum, the record before you regarding the Alberto \n     Gonzales nomination is woefully incomplete, at best, in spite \n     of repeated efforts by the Committee and other stakeholders \n     to obtain all relevant information. At worst, it raises \n     profound questions about Mr. Gonzales' commitment to civil \n     and human rights and the rule of law.\n       The record is very troubling because nowhere is the \n     Senate's constitutional role in reviewing a presidential \n     cabinet nominee more important than in the case of a \n     prospective Attorney General. It is even more troubling \n     because Mr. Gonzales, in response to questions by Chairman \n     Specter and other members of the Judiciary Committee during \n     his recent confirmation hearing, had repeatedly pledged far \n     greater cooperation with the Committee than his predecessor \n     had extended. Mr. Gonzales and the Administration have \n     utterly failed to deliver on this promised level of \n     cooperation, leaving numerous questions remaining about his \n     suitability for the position of Attorney General and about \n     the impact his tenure would have on civil and human rights in \n     this country and elsewhere. For this reason, we must urge you \n     to not confirm Mr. Gonzales. Please note that LCCR intends to \n     include how Senators vote on this issue in the upcoming 109th \n     Congress LCCR Voting Record.\n       Thank you for your consideration.

While we \n     applaud the effort of recent Presidents to achieve greater \n     diversity in their Cabinets and would be delighted to see the \n     first person of Latino descent be elevated to this high \n     office, the issue at hand is not about diversity, it is about \n     the conduct of someone who has fundamentally aided and \n     abetted efforts by those in the White House to disregard the \n     rule of law.\n       We believe that at the behest of President Bush, Mr. \n     Gonzales knowingly and willingly provided counsel and \n     advocated policies calculated to evade or circumvent domestic \n     and international laws prohibiting the use of torture to \n     extract information from soldiers or detainees held in U.S. \n     custody. We believe that the person entrusted to be the \n     highest law enforcement officer in our country must not be \n     someone who has shown such blatant disdain for the rule of \n     law as Chief Counsel to the President of the United States. \n     To confirm Mr. Gonzales would send the wrong signal to the \n     nation and the world. It would be tantamount to condoning \n     torture.\n       The evidence of Mr. Gonzales's efforts to evade or \n     circumvent domestic and international laws dealing with the \n     use of torture is overwhelming. As White House counsel, he \n     has consistently treated the law as an inconvenient obstacle \n     to be ignored whenever it conflicted with the wishes of the \n     President. Mr. Gonzales is the author of a leaked memo, dated \n     January 25, 2002, that justified the suspension of the Geneva \n     Conventions in the war in Afghanistan, calling these \n     universally recognized international laws ``obsolete'' and \n     ``quaint.''\n       In the same year, Mr. Gonzales requested a memo from the \n     Justice Department, inquiring as to whether the Bush \n     Administration could evade current treaties and laws in its \n     treatment of Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees without being \n     open to prosecution for war crimes. Moreover, he drafted the \n     original military commission order signed by President Bush \n     on November 14, 2001, which would have allowed suspects \n     apprehended in the global campaign against terrorism to be \n     charged, tried, and even executed without the most basic due \n     process protections. Gonzales also argued that U.S. citizens \n     could be held incommunicado and stripped of the right to \n     counsel and the right to challenge their detention in a court \n     of law for as long as the President deemed necessary. [CCR \n     successfully challenged this position in the milestone case \n     Rasul v. Bush, where the Supreme Court ruled that the \n     detainees at Guantanamo have a right to challenge their \n     detention in U.S. courts.]\n       Furthermore, Mr. Gonzales and his colleagues approved the \n     use of dogs, hooding, and extreme sensory deprivation, all \n     forbidden by Geneva Convention and International Covenant \n     Against Torture. They redefined torture to limit it to only \n     those actions that lead to organ failure, death or permanent \n     psychological damage. They justified this relaxed definition \n     of torture on the grounds that in a time of war, \n     interrogators need to extract information from prisoners \n     quickly to save American lives. However, it has long been \n     established by experts in the field that torture leads to \n     false confessions and bad intelligence. None of this seems to \n     have mattered to Mr. Gonzales and the higher ups in the White \n     House. Indeed, there is little doubt that the memos written \n     and commissioned by Gonzales paved the way for the abuse and \n     torture of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, Bagram \n     Air Force base, and elsewhere--many of whom are represented \n     by the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n       The verdict is clear; there is no question but that there \n     is a causal link between the memoranda and other directives \n     devised by Mr. Gonzales and the terrible infractions \n     committed by officers and functionaries in the field. The \n     images and information about the horrific acts committed \n     against prisoners at Abu Ghraib, (80% of were innocent of any \n     crimes according to the International Red Cross), has \n     severely damaged the reputation of the U.S. in the world as a \n     standard bearer for justice and the rule of law. The \n     arrogance that abounds in the White House is such that they \n     seem impervious to world opinion. But ``we the people'' have \n     the opportunity, obligation and power to let the President \n     and the world know that we will not tolerate intolerable acts \n     committed in our name!\n       Many organizations and members of Congress are content to \n     simply ask ``tough questions'' of Mr. Gonzales but not oppose \n     his nomination. At the Center for Constitutional Rights, we \n     firmly believe that a man who helped destroy our nation's \n     moral standing in the eyes of the world, endangered our \n     troops and dismantled centuries of carefully developed \n     international standards of law must not be rewarded with a \n     promotion. Tough questions are not enough. We have a\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\n     duty to save the soul of our country. Accordingly, we call \n     upon Americans of all political persuasions who oppose \n     torture and are eager to restore our nation's good name in \n     the world to join in a massive mobilization to stop the \n     confirmation of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General of the \n     United States.\n\n\n                           More on Gonzales:\n\n       According to Newsweek, Mr. Gonzales convened a series of \n     meetings with Defense Department General Counsel William \n     Hayes, Vice Presidential Counsel David Addington, and counsel \n     from the CIA and the Justice Department, where they discussed \n     specific torture techniques they deemed acceptable for use \n     against Al Qaeda leadership, including mock burial, ``water \n     boarding''--where the victim is made to feel that they are \n     drowning--and the threat of more brutal interrogations at the \n     hands of other nations. Indeed, the latter, a practice known \n     as ``extraordinary rendition'' has sent many suspects to \n     countries like Egypt, Jordan and Syria, previously far more \n     experienced in the techniques of torture than the U.S.\n       The Center for Constitutional Rights has seen the effects \n     of Mr. Gonzales's policies in all too much detail. We \n     represent many of the men, women and children held and \n     tortured at the hands of U.S. personnel at Abu Ghraib, \n     Guantanamo Bay, and elsewhere. In addition, the U.S. has an \n     unknown number of ghost detainees, hidden from the \n     International Red Cross, at spots around the globe: we can \n     only imagine the treatment they are receiving.\n       In their scathing critique of Mr. Gonzales's writings, The \n     Washington Post linked him directly to the tortures at Abu \n     Ghraib and called his legal positions ``damaging and \n     erroneous.'' Making Alberto Gonzales the Attorney General of \n     the United States would be a travesty. It would mean taking \n     one of the legal architects of an illegal and immoral policy \n     and installing him as the official who is charged with \n     protecting our constitutional rights.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 2004]\n\n                Memo Lets CIA Take Detainees Out of Iraq\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       At the request of the CIA, the Justice Department drafted a \n     confidential memo that authorizes the agency to transfer \n     detainees out of Iraq for iterrogation--a practice that \n     international legal specialists say contravenes the Geneva \n     Conventions.\n       One intelligence official familiar with the operation said \n     the CIA has used the March draft memo as legal support for \n     secretly transporting as many as a dozen detainees out of \n     Iraq in the last six months. The agency has concealed the \n     detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross \n     and other authorities, the official said.\n       The draft opinion, written by the Justice Department's \n     Office of Legal Counsel and dated March 19,2004, refers to \n     both Iraqi citizens and foreigners in Iraq, who the memo says \n     are protected by the treaty. It permits the CIA to take \n     Iraqis out of the country to be interrogated for a ``brief \n     but not indefinite period.'' It also says the CIA can \n     permanently remove persons deemed to be ``illegal aliens'' \n     under ``local immigration law.''\n       Some specialists in international law say the opinion \n     amounts to a reinterpretation of one of the most basic rights \n     of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which protects \n     civilians during wartime and occupation, including insurgents \n     who were not part of Iraq's military.\n       The treaty prohibits ``[i]ndividual or mass forcible \n     transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from \n     occupied territory . . . regardless of their motive.''\n       The 1949 treaty notes that a violation of this particular \n     provision constitutes a ``grave breach'' of the accord, and \n     thus a ``war crime'' under U.S. federal law, according to a \n     footnote in the Justice Department draft. ``For these \n     reasons,'' the footnote reads, ``we recommend that any \n     contemplated relocations of `protected persons' from Iraq to \n     facilitate interrogation be carefully evaluated for \n     compliance with Article 49 on a case by case basis.'' It says \n     that even persons removed from Iraq retain the treaty's \n     protections, which would include humane treatment and access \n     to international monitors.\n       During the war in Afghanistan, the administration ruled \n     that al Qaeda fighters were not considered ``protected \n     persons'' under the convention. Many of them were transferred \n     out of the country to the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, \n     and elsewhere for interrogations. By contrast, the U.S. \n     Government deems former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath \n     Party and military, as well as insurgents and other civilians \n     in Iraq, to be protected by the Geneva Conventions.\n       International law experts contacted for this article \n     described the legal reasoning contained in the Justice \n     Department memo as unconventional and disturbing.\n       ``The overall thrust of the Convention is to keep from \n     moving people out of the country and out of the protection of \n     the Convention,'' said former senior military attorney Scott \n     Silliman, executive director of Duke University's Center on \n     Law, Ethics and National Security. ``The memorandum seeks to \n     create a legal regime justifying conduct that the \n     international community clearly considers in violation of \n     international law and the Convention.'' Silliman reviewed the \n     document at The Post's request.\n       The CIA, Justice Department and the author of the draft \n     opinion, Jack L. Goldsmith, former director of the Office of \n     Legal Counsel, declined to comment for this article.\n       CIA officials have not disclosed the identities or \n     locations of its Iraq detainees to congressional oversight \n     committees, the Defense Department or CIA investigators who \n     are reviewing detention policy, according to two informed \n     U.S. Government officials and a confidential e-mail on the \n     subject shown to The Washington Post.\n       White House officials disputed the notion that Goldsmith's \n     interpretation of the treaty was unusual, although they did \n     not explain why. ``The Geneva Conventions are applicable to \n     the conflict in Iraq, and our policy is to comply with the \n     Geneva Conventions,'' White House spokesman Sean McCormick \n     said.\n       The Office of Legal Counsel also wrote the Aug. 1, 2002, \n     memo on torture that advised the CIA and White House that \n     torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad ``may be \n     justified,'' and that international laws against torture \n     ``may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations'' \n     conducted in the war on terrorism. President Bush's aides \n     repudiated that memo once it became public this June.\n       The Office of Legal Counsel writes legal opinions \n     considered binding on federal agencies and departments. The \n     March 19 document obtained by The Post is stamped ``draft'' \n     and was not finalized, said one U.S. official involved in the \n     legal deliberations. However, the memo was sent to the \n     general counsels at the National Security Council, the CIA \n     and the departments of State and Defense.\n       ``The memo was a green light,'' an intelligence official \n     said. ``the CIA used the memo to remove other people from \n     Iraq.''\n       Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the CIA has used broad \n     authority granted in a series of legal opinions and guidance \n     from the Office of Legal Counsel and its own general \n     counsel's office to transfer, interrogate and detain \n     individuals suspected of terrorist activities at a series of \n     undisclosed locations around the world.\n       According to current and former agency officials, the CIA \n     has a rendition policy that has permitted the agency to \n     transfer an unknown number of suspected terrorists captured \n     in one country into the hands of security services in other \n     countries whose record of human rights abuse is well \n     documented. These individuals, as well as those at CIA \n     detention facilities, have no access to any recognized legal \n     process or rights.\n       The scandal at Abu Ghraib, and the investigations and \n     congressional hearings that followed, forced the disclosure \n     of the Pentagon's behind-closed-doors debate and classified \n     rules for detentions and interrogations at Guantanamo Bay and \n     in Afghanistan and Iraq. Senior defense leaders have \n     repeatedly been called to explain and defend their policies \n     before Congress. But the CIA's policies and practices remain \n     shrouded in secrecy.\n       The only public account of CIA detainee treatment comes \n     from soldier testimony and Defense Department investigations \n     of military conduct. For instance, Army Maj. Gen. Antonio M. \n     Taguba's report on Abu Ghraib criticized the CIA practice of \n     maintaining ``ghost detainees''--prisoners who were not \n     officially registered and were moved around inside the prison \n     to hide them from Red Cross teams. Taguba called the practice \n     ``deceptive, contrary to Army doctrine and in violation of \n     international law.''\n       Gen. Paul J. Kern, who oversaw another Army inquiry, told \n     Congress that the number of CIA ghost detainees ``is in the \n     dozens, to perhaps up to 100.''\n       The March 19, 2004, Justice Department memo by Goldsmith \n     deals with a previously unknown class of people--those \n     removed from Iraq.\n       It is not clear why the CIA would feel the need to remove \n     detainees from Iraq for interrogation. A U.S. Government \n     official who has been briefed on the CIA's detention \n     practices said some detainees are probably taken to other \n     countries because ``that's where the agency has the people, \n     expertise and interrogation facilities, where their people \n     and programs are in place.''\n       The origin of the Justice Department memo is directly \n     related to the only publicly acknowledged ghost detainee, \n     Hiwa Abdul Rahman Rashul, nicknamed ``Triple X'' by CIA and \n     military officials.\n       Rashul, a suspected member of the Iraqi Al-Ansar terrorist \n     group, was captured by Kurdish soldiers in June or July of \n     2003 and turned over to the CIA, which whisked him to \n     Afghanistan for interrogation.\n       In October, White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales asked \n     the Office of Legal Counsel to write an opinion on \n     ``protected persons'' in Iraq and rule on the status of \n     Rashul, according to another U.S. Government official \n     involved in the deliberations.\n       Goldsmith, then head of the office, ruled that Rashul was a \n     ``protected person'' under the Fourth Geneva Convention and \n     therefore had to be brought back to Iraq, several \n     intelligence and defense officials said.\n       The CIA was not happy with the decision, according to two \n     intelligence officials. It promptly brought Rashul back and \n     suspended any other transfers out of the country.\n       At the same time, when transferring Rashul back to Iraq, \n     then-CIA Director George J. Tenet asked Defense Secretary \n     Donald H. Rumsfeld not to give Rashul a prisoner number and \n     to hide him from International Red Cross officials, according \n     to an account provided by Rumsfeld during a June 17 Pentagon \n     news conference. Rumsfeld complied.\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\n       As a ``ghost detainee,'' Rashul became lost in the prison \n     system for seven months.\n       Rumsfeld did not fully explain the reason he had complied \n     with Tenet's request or under what legal authority he could \n     have kept Rashul hidden for so long. ``We know from our \n     knowledge that [Tenet] has the authority to do this,'' he \n     said.\n       Rashul, defense and intelligence officials noted, had not \n     once been interrogated since he was returned to Iraq. His \n     current status is unknown.\n       In the one-page October 2003 interim ruling that directed \n     Rashul's return, Goldsmith also created a new category of \n     persons in Iraq whom he said did not qualify for protection \n     under the Geneva Conventions. They are non-Iraqis who are not \n     members of the former Baath Party and who went to Iraq after \n     the invasion.\n       After Goldsmith's ruling, the CIA and Gonzales asked the \n     Office of Legal Counsel for a more complete legal opinion on \n     ``protected persons'' in Iraq and on the legality of \n     transferring people out of Iraq for interrogation. ``That \n     case started the CIA yammering to Justice to get a better \n     memo,'' said one intelligence officer familiar with the \n     interagency discussion.\n       Michael Byers, a professor and international law expert at \n     the University of British Columbia, said that creating a \n     legal justification for removing protected persons from Iraq \n     ``is extraordinarily disturbing.''\n       ``What they are doing is interpreting an exception into an \n     all-encompassing right, in one of the most fundamental \n     treaties in history,'' Byers said. The Geneva Convention ``is \n     as close as you get to protecting human rights in times of \n     chaos. There's no ambiguity here.''\n\n  Mr. REED. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of Judge \nAlberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United States.\n  Judge Gonzales is a dedicated public servant and a legal professional \nwho has earned the trust of the President, and he deserves to be \nconfirmed. I have worked personally with Judge Gonzales since he joined \nthe administration, and I have a great deal of respect for him.\n  In 2001 and 2002, Kentucky had an urgent need to fill several \ndistrict court vacancies in the eastern district of Kentucky, and Judge \nGonzales was very helpful and worked with Senator McConnell and myself \nto quickly fill those vacancies. This ensured that our courts in \nKentucky continued to function and serve the people well.\n  Judge Gonzales has an impressive and broad legal and public service \nbackground. After a distinguished academic career, including a degree \nfrom Harvard Law School, Judge Gonzales joined one of Houston's most \nreputable law firms. His hard work and intelligence helped him quickly \nto become a partner in that law firm. That feat is even more impressive \nbecause he was one of the first two minority lawyers to become a \npartner in that firm.\n  He also took time from his private practice to teach law classes at \nthe University of Houston. Judge Gonzales then left behind a well-\npaying private practice to become general counsel to President Bush \nwhen he was Governor of Texas. As general counsel, Judge Gonzales \nearned the trust and confidence of the Governor, who then appointed him \nsecretary of state. After serving as secretary of state, Judge Gonzales \nwas appointed to the supreme court of the great State of Texas. He \nheard cases on that court until Governor Bush was elected President and \nasked Judge Gonzales to serve him as White House Counsel, one of the \nmost important legal jobs in this Nation. That job as White House \nCounsel became even more important after September 11 when our \nGovernment had to rethink our approach to fighting terrorism and \nterrorists and securing the homeland.\n\n  It is clear that Judge Gonzales has strong experience in all legal \nareas. As a practicing lawyer, he learned the private side of the \njustice system and what it was like to deal with the Government on a \nregular basis. As secretary of state and general counsel to the \nGovernor of Texas, he received executive experience and learned \nmanagement skills that will serve him well as head of the Department of \nJustice. As a judge, he learned the workings of the third branch of the \nGovernment and what the Department will have to confront when dealing \nwith the courts.\n  Finally, as White House Counsel, Judge Gonzales participated in the \ncreation of our strategies for fighting terrorism and terrorists at \nhome and abroad, and he will carry that vision and experience into our \nNation's top law enforcement job.\n  This is the unique part of the Judge Alberto Gonzales story. It is \nnot just his legal experience and public service; it is also a story of \nhard work and living the American dream.\n  Judge Gonzales is the first Hispanic nominated to be Attorney \nGeneral. This is noteworthy and a great accomplishment, and it reveals \nnot just the greatness of Judge Gonzales's life, but it also reveals \nthe opportunities our country provides to those willing to work hard \nand dare to achieve.\n  He was raised as one of eight children of migrant workers who barely \nspoke English. His parents did not graduate from high school. He began \nworking at age 12 to help the family get by.\n  College seemed like a distant dream in his youth, so he joined the \nAir Force. He was then accepted to the Air Force Academy and then moved \nto Rice University. After that came law school and his distinguished \ncareer.\n  The fact that young Alberto was able to raise himself out of such \nunderprivileged beginnings is a testament to his hard work and values \nhe learned as a child.\n  It is not easy to graduate from one of America's most admired law \nschools, even for the children of wealthy or middle-class families. It \nis also not easy to become a partner in a law firm or to serve in high-\nranking Government positions, no matter what your background happens to \nbe. But Judge Gonzales overcame all the hurdles in his past and \nachieved what few have achieved.\n  I hope that his story is noticed by all who want to achieve great \nthings in our country. In America, opportunities are boundless, and \nAlberto Gonzales is proof of that.\n  I am glad to support Judge Gonzales's nomination to be Attorney \nGeneral. I may not agree with him on every issue in the future, but I \nam confident that President Bush has chosen an honorable and \ndistinguished lawyer and public servant whom he can trust to be our \nNation's top law enforcement officer.\n  This is a critical and opportunistic time for America. We need the \nbest of the best to serve in this Cabinet, particularly at the Attorney \nGeneral level as the chief law enforcement officer in these United \nStates. Judge Alberto Gonzales is that person. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport his nomination.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening closely to my \ncolleagues, and I fear that sometimes in this debate we may just be \nmissing the forest for the trees. By focusing almost exclusively on \nallegations regarding the Convention Against Torture, which is an \nimportant issue, to be sure, Judge Gonzales's critics seem to have \nforgotten that we are debating a nomination for the position of \nAttorney General of the United States of America.\n  One would think, for example, that all of my colleagues would join me \nin being supportive of the prospect of our Nation's civil rights laws \nbeing enforced by a citizen who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks \nand has worked his way up the hard way. I am one of many who is pleased \nat the prospect of Judge Gonzales enforcing our civil rights laws.\n  It was not that long ago that we did not even have a Civil Rights \nDivision at Justice. Today, the public servants there do very important \nwork. Whether they are working to guarantee the right to vote, \nprotecting the freedom of worship, or preventing human trafficking, the \n21st century version of slavery, these career lawyers are determined to \nextend the principle of equality under the law to all Americans \nregardless of race, creed, or color.\n  Alberto Gonzales shares that commitment to the principle of equal \njustice under the law. Instead of launching unfounded accusations that \nJudge\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\nGonzales in some attenuated fashion somehow supports the inhumane \ntreatment of prisoners, one would think we would join together to \nsupport Judge Gonzales as the enforcer of our Nation's civil rights \nlaws.\n  As a child of immigrants, the diversity of experience that he would \nbring to this position is remarkable. His personal story is a testament \nto the opportunity afforded in this great country by the guarantees of \nfreedom and equality.\n  Through his role in the judicial nominations process as White House \nCounsel, Judge Gonzales has made it clear that diversity in Government \nis a desirable goal. I worked with him for 4 years on judicial \nnominations, so I know firsthand of his thoughts and actions on \nbringing diversity to our Federal bench. When working on behalf of the \nAmerican people, a personal appreciation of their everyday trials and \ndreams can only make one a better public servant. For that reason, I \nsuppose, he explained at the National Hispanic Leadership Summit, that \nwe must ``go the extra mile'' when seeking diversity in public service. \nCertainly this administration has been doing that, and he has been a \npivotal part of that.\n  There is no doubt that Judge Gonzales will bring these experiences to \nbear at his new job. Lynne Liberato, a partner in the Houston office of \nHaynes & Boone, and a former president of the State bar of Texas and \nthe Houston Bar Association has said that Judge Gonzales:\n\n     . . . has always been a person of good judgment, kindness, \n     and moderation. He has experienced the prejudice endured by \n     Mexican Americans. These experiences enhanced his judgment \n     and fueled his compassion.\n\n  Now this is not lost on groups representing Hispanic Americans. It is \ncertainly not lost on LULAC, the League of United Latin American \nCitizens, which has strongly supported Judge Gonzales and believes that \nhe will uphold the 1965 Voting Rights Act making certain that all \nAmericans can fully participate in the Democratic process. To me, that \nis the most important civil rights act in history.\n  Listening to Judge Gonzales's personal story, one discovers a person \ncommitted to the idea that if people are only treated equally, the \nopportunities afforded by America are boundless. His father built their \nhouse with his own hands. My dad did ours. His dad worked any job that \nwas available to him in order to support his family. So did my dad. He \npicked crops as a migrant worker, worked in construction, as my dad \ndid, and was part of a maintenance crew at a rice mill.\n  One gets the sense from listening to Judge Gonzales that his father \ndid these things knowing that if only he and his family were given a \nfair shake they would find success in America. Let me just say that my \nfather never met Judge Gonzales's father but it sounds to me that they \nwould have had a lot in common given their belief and faith in the \nAmerican dream. So it was hardly a surprise when Judge Gonzales \ndefended the rights of labor even in the face of the Supreme Court's \n2002 decision in Hoffman Plastics Compounds, Inc., v. NLRB.\n  The Court held that employees who present false documents to their \nemployers in order to establish employment eligibility are not entitled \nto the remedy of backpay when their employers violate Federal labor \nlaw. Yet Judge Gonzales insisted that the decision:\n\n     . . . will not prevent the administration from fully \n     enforcing core labor protections against employers, \n     regardless of the status of their employees.\n\n  When he made this statement at a meeting of MALDEF, the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund, I am told that one could \nsense the passion of a person with a genuine appreciation of the noble \nsacrifice and the hard labor of the working poor.\n\n  Judge Gonzales is going to lead the Justice Department.\n  His personal commitment to justice is deeply rooted. I know the time \npressures that attorneys face and yet Judge Gonzales has never let the \ndemands of his profession or his career stand in the way of his \nvoluntary service to his community.\n  Somehow, in the midst of building a successful law practice and \nsecond career as a public servant, he found time to serve as director \nof Catholic Charities and of Big Brothers Big Sisters. As Lynne \nLiberato explained in the Houston Chronicle:\n\n       As a young lawyer, Al was committed to the education of \n     minority kids. While a young associate at Vinson & Elkins he \n     was instrumental in establishing the Vinson & Elkins Minority \n     Scholarship. When asked by local Hispanic leaders to work on \n     a committee to address the issue of the large number of \n     Hispanic dropouts, Al devoted his time to the establishment \n     of the Hispanic Career and Education Day. Both of these \n     programs are still helping kids.\n\n  Judge Gonzales is committed to civil rights and the establishment of \njustice for all of our citizens, and so it is unfortunate that some of \nmy colleagues have allowed their opposition to the President's \nprosecution of the war on terror to cloud their judgment in this case. \nJudge Gonzales will be our Nation's chief law enforcement officer. As \nsuch, he will be called upon to enforce our civil rights statutes and \nhis long track record leaves no doubt that he will do so vigorously. \nHis nomination is a milestone in American history and his confirmation \nwill be remembered in our Hispanic communities for generations.\n  As a proud member of the party of Abraham Lincoln, I remain committed \nto a serious civil rights agenda. I wish my friends across the aisle \nwould put partisanship aside and recognize that Judge Gonzalez would \nmake a historic contribution to our Nation's continuing struggle to be \na more just political community.\n  Some Senators on the other side of the aisle are desperately \nsearching, fishing, and hunting to find something, anything, with which \nto attack Judge Alberto Gonzales. I reviewed some of the issues \nyesterday, including their attempt to hold Judge Gonzales responsible \nfor a memo that he did not write, prepared by an office he did not run, \nin a Department in which he did not work, that provided legal advice \nthat President Bush did not follow. That argument is a very thin brew. \nBut some of my friends across the aisle are still throwing political \nspaghetti at the wall hoping something will stick.\n  The senior Senator from New York, for example, wants to drag Judge \nGonzales into our internal Senate debate over filibusters of majority-\nsupported judicial nominations. In the Judiciary Committee hearing on \nJanuary 6 and the markup on January 26 and again on this floor \nyesterday, the distinguished Senator from New York has demanded to know \nJudge Gonzales's opinion on whether these filibusters are \nconstitutional.\n  Senator Schumer says the answer will ``weigh heavily in my decision \nwhether to support his confirmation.'' Judge Gonzales's answer has been \nclear and consistent, and it is both clearly and consistently correct. \nHe said in the hearing that this issue is ``an internal Senate \nmatter.''\n  Now, that is the right answer, because it is what the Constitution \nsays. In article 1, section 5, the Constitution gives each House of the \nCongress the power to ``determine the rules of its proceedings.''\n  Judge Gonzales did not remind us of the at least four instances where \nthe constitutional option was utilized in the Senate to stop an unjust, \nunconstitutional filibuster. No, he did not do that. He just said it is \nup to the Senate; the Senate should set its rules. That is what the \nConstitution says.\n  As the Supreme Court unanimously held more than a century ago, in \nexercising this authority we may not ignore constitutional restraints. \nThat is a given. But both the authority to determine our rules and our \nresponsibilities to meet constitutional standards are entirely ours so \nlong as our rules do not contravene another constitutional requirement.\n  The House of Representatives has nothing to say about our rules in \nthe Senate, and the executive branch does not either, and Alberto \nGonzales recognized these principles.\n  Judge Gonzales is not like the professors who opined in hearings on \nthis issue. Nor does he work for the Senate legal counsel or for the \nParliamentarian waiting in the wings to give his opinion on any issue \nany Senator might raise. He is Counsel to the President of the United \nStates of America. He comes before us wearing that hat. He has been \nnominated to be the next Attorney General of the United States of \nAmerica. Both positions are in the executive branch, which has no role\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\nwhatsoever in determining how the Senate sets its internal procedural \nrules.\n  So Judge Gonzales's answer was not only correct on its face, but it \ndemonstrated his respect for the fundamental principle of the \nseparation of powers. In my view, he correctly believes it is not \nappropriate to accept any invitation that comes along to speculate and \npostulate about issues that the Constitution expressly removes from his \njurisdiction.\n  In his January 6 hearing, Senator Schumer asked Judge Gonzales about \nthe filibusters, after insisting that the words of the Constitution \nshould be our standard on such issues. Keep in mind these are the first \nfilibusters of judges, of Federal judges, in the history of this \ncountry in over 200 years.\n  If the words of the Constitution matter, then nothing could be more \ncompelling than the Constitution's assignment of rulemaking authority \nright here in the Senate. Judge Gonzales's answer was grounded \ncorrectly in the text of the Constitution. For this reason, I was more \nthan a little surprised yesterday to hear the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York, Mr. Schumer, say on this floor that Judge Gonzales's \nprincipled answer to this politically motivated question suggests that \nhe would not be independent as Attorney General.\n  Give me a break. Frankly, as one who believes that my colleagues \nacross the aisle are using the current rules of the Senate to \nfilibuster judicial nominations in an unwise, unfair, unprecedented, \nand unconstitutional manner, there may have been some short-term \npolitical benefits to have the next Attorney General publicly side with \nme on this important issue. But Judge Gonzales wisely did not join in \nthis fray, even though it could have been politically advantageous to \nthe President and Republican Senators if he just came out on our side.\n  I asked those who questioned his independence and his ability to \nseparate himself from the political interests of the President, what \ncould be more independent than insisting that the constitutional \nseparation of powers takes precedence over the politics of the moment?\n  This is an odd way to look at independence. On the one hand, Senator \nSchumer wants Judge Gonzales as Attorney General to be independent from \nthe President at whose pleasure any Cabinet member serves. Then on the \nother side, Senator Schumer objects when Judge Gonzales, as Counsel to \nthe President, shows a little independence from Senator Schumer by \nrefusing to be pulled into a political dispute entirely outside the \njurisdiction of the executive branch.\n  What is even more disheartening to me is that even though the \ndistinguished Senator from New York has worked closely and \ncooperatively with Judge Gonzales in resolving their differences with \nrespect to filling judicial vacancies in New York, he somehow finds \nJudge Gonzales to be unfit for the office of Attorney General. \nSelecting judges has been one of the most vexatious issues that any \nPresident and any Senate face. Judge Gonzales has a proven track record \nof working effectively with Senator Schumer on New York judicial \nvacancies.\n  I think it is fair to call Senator Schumer one of the most energetic \nMembers of the Senate with respect to judicial nominations, whether you \nagree with him or not. It seems to me that Judge Gonzales's ability to \nwork with my friend from New York so successfully on these contentious \nissues bodes well for his abilities to continue to work closely with \nthe Senate once he is confirmed.\n  Several of my colleagues have stood on this floor and suggested--\nsometimes even flatly asserted--that Judge Gonzales lacks or will lack \nthe necessary independence from the White House if he were to become \nAttorney General of the United States of America.\n  I cannot reach into the hearts and minds of those making these \nstatements, but to me this suggestion is unadulterated bunk, sheer \nhokum. It is asking us to disprove a negative. It is the type of \nargument that is made when meritorious arguments are unavailable.\n  The charge that Judge Gonzales will not exercise his best judgment on \nbehalf of the American public is groundless. Judge Gonzales is an \naccomplished lawyer, one recognized by the alumni association at his \nalma mater, the Harvard Law School, one of the greatest law schools in \nthe country. He practiced at one of the most prestigious and respected \nlaw firms in the United States of America, Vinson and Elkins. He was a \npartner there.\n\n  As many speakers before me have noted, including Senator Specter and \nSenator Sessions, a good lawyer is one who knows who his client is and \nrepresents him well. What is it about Judge Gonzales that makes some \npeople believe that he is somehow incapable of making the simple \ndistinctions, distinctions made by lawyers every day? Is it prejudice? \nIs it a belief that a Hispanic American should never be in a position \nlike this--because he will be the first one ever in a position like \nthis? Is it a belief that only liberal Hispanics should be confirmed? \nOr is it because he has been an effective Counsel to the President of \nthe United States, who many on the other side do not like? Or is it \nbecause he is constantly mentioned for the Supreme Court of the United \nStates of America? Or is it that they just don't like Judge Gonzales? I \nfind that that is not possible because you can't help but like him. He \nis a fine, enjoyable, friendly man.\n  I do not agree with those who insinuate that he cannot handle this \njob or that he will not do it in the best possible manner. I believe \nevery Hispanic in America who is interested in this country and who \nunderstands what is going on here is watching this with a great deal of \ninterest. It is amazing how some can be so in favor of minorities and \nyet whenever the minority might be--in this case moderate, but \nrepresenting a conservative President--that for some reason or other, \nthey are just not worthy to hold these positions?\n  It was explained in the Judiciary Committee, Judge Gonzales \nunderstands the differences between the role of the White House Counsel \nand the role of Attorney General. Over the course of our history there \nhave been several individuals who have been close advisers and friends \nof the President and have gone on to serve successfully as Attorney \nGeneral. In President Reagan's administration, Attorney General Meese \nwore both hats with great distinction. Earlier than that, Robert \nKennedy, brother of the President of the United States, proved capable \nof separating his role of serving the American people from his unique \nrelationship with his brother, President John F. Kennedy.\n  Frankly, I doubt that any Attorney General was closer to the \nPresident than Attorney General Robert Kennedy was to President John F. \nKennedy. The historical record reveals that this issue was a matter of \ndebate and concern by some prior to the confirmation of Attorney \nGeneral Kennedy. In the same way that Robert Kennedy did not allow his \ncloseness to the President to interfere with his legal judgment, I am \nfully confident, and I think everybody who knows Alberto Gonzales is \nconfident, that Alberto Gonzales's relationship with President Bush \nwill not impede his ability to serve as a fair and effective Attorney \nGeneral of the United States of America.\n  In fact, that Judge Gonzales has the President's ear and full \nconfidence can only help achieve the Department of Justice's priorities \nin the same way that the Department of Justice played a prominent role \nin the Kennedy administration.\n  I am quite confident that Judge Gonzales will serve the American \npublic and enforce the law in a fair manner for all of our citizens. I \nam not certain why anybody would suggest that Judge Gonzales is somehow \nincapable of distinguishing his role as Attorney General of the United \nStates from his role as Counsel to the President. He made it quite \nclear in his confirmation hearing that he understood the obligations of \nhis new office. Here is what he said:\n\n       I do very much understand that there is a difference in the \n     position of counsel to the President and that of Attorney \n     General of the United States. . . . As counsel to the \n     President, my primary focus is on providing counsel to the \n     White House and to the White House staff and the President. I \n     do have a client who has an agenda and part of my role as \n     counsel is to provide advice that the President can achieve \n     that agenda lawfully. It is a much different situation as \n     Attorney General, and I know that. My first allegiance\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\n     is going to be to the Constitution and to the laws of the \n     United States.\n\n  You know, I think he ought to be taken at his word. We have done it \nfor countless others whom we have confirmed here in this body. But for \nsome reason some on the other side actually believe that he might not \nbe capable of doing this job. Or if he is, then he might not do it \nproperly. Or, if he doesn't do that, then he might be so much in his \nPresident's pocket that he won't uphold the law, which he has always \ndone.\n  It is ridiculous. What is the reason for this opposition? I don't \nknow what it is. But I have listed a few things it could be. Judge \nGonzales's service on the Texas Supreme Court should prove to anyone \ninterested his ability to be independent from then-Governor and now-\nPresident Bush.\n  In response to questions for the record from Senator Kennedy, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Judge Gonzales stated that he \n``would enforce the law fairly and equally on behalf of all \nAmericans.''\n  Senator Kennedy raised all of these torture memoranda as though Judge \nGonzales wrote them.\n  He wasn't in the Justice Department. He wasn't in the office of legal \ncounsel. He wasn't the person who wrote them. He didn't represent the \nJustice Department. But he did have a relationship to the February 7, \n2002, memorandum where the President said that all prisoners, whether \nor not they were subject to the Geneva Conventions, had been treated \n``humanely.''\n  People can have different views on the Bybee memoranda, and other \nmemoranda that have been quoted here as though Judge Gonzales had \nanything to do at all with them, but Judge Gonzales's opinion, which he \ngave the President, was that they should be treated humanely.\n  Why do they insist on these points? Why has torture become the big \npoint of debate on the floor of the Senate? There is only one reason: \nto undermine the President of the United States.\n  Just think about it. Why would we do that publicly as Senators? Why \nwould we do that, especially since we all know that these were rogue \nelements who have done these awful things? We all condemn them. But why \nwould we do this? Some people think that these statements are so bad, \nthat they give comfort to the enemy. I do not go that far. But why have \nthey used distortions to try to stop Judge Gonzales? Why would they do \nthat?\n  He is a moderate man. He is an accomplished man. He is a decent man. \nWe have had 4 years of experience with him. He has done a great job \ndown there as White House Counsel. He has been up here before every \nSenator on the Judiciary Committee, eight of whom voted against him, \nand he accommodated them in every way he possibly could. Sometimes he \ncouldn't do what they wanted him to do, but the fact is he was always \naccommodating. He was always reasonable, he was always moderate in his \napproach, and he always listened--exactly what we would hope the \nAttorney General of the United States would be like.\n  Further, during his opening statement at his confirmation hearing, \nJudge Gonzales indicated that ``[with] the consent of the Senate, [he] \nw[ould] no longer represent only the White House; [he] w[ould] \nrepresent the United States of America and its people.''\n  Knowing Judge Gonzales, he meant that.\n  Finally, Judge Gonzales explained at his hearing that his \nresponsibility as Attorney General would be to ``pursue justice for the \nall the people of our great Nation, to see the laws are enforced in a \nfair and impartial manner for all Americans.'' I believe it is clear \nthat Judge Gonzales understands the obligations associated with the \nposition of Attorney General of the United States, and he is uniquely \nqualified to follow in the footsteps of the able and distinguished men \nand women who have preceded him.\n  I know the other side does not want any Republican on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States of America. I cannot blame them for that. We \ndo not share the same philosophy, by and large, as the liberal \nphilosophy they espouse. On the other hand, in times past Republicans \nhave confirmed liberals to the U.S. Supreme Court without putting them \nthrough these types of machinations that have despoiled their \ncharacter. We have supported the President of the United States. We \nhave not filibustered judges. We did not smear great legal \nintellectuals like Robert Bork. I can name many others, including the \ncurrent Chief Justice of the United States, one of the finest men who \never served in the judiciary of this country, who had a distinguished \npublic service record before his nomination but was smeared during the \nJudiciary Committee hearings and on the floor of the Senate. My party \ndid not resort to these tactics. I would be disappointed if we did.\n  Here we have a chance to confirm a man who is a decent man, who is of \nHispanic origin, the first Hispanic ever to be nominated to one of the \nbig four Cabinet positions. Why can't my friends who oppose him \nrecognize that and recognize the historic nature of this nomination, \nrecognize his great ability, recognize his decency, recognize his \nfairness in working with them, and recognize that this man will make \na difference for all Americans, as he has as White House Counsel?\n\n  Is the hatred for the President so bad they transfer it to somebody \nas decent as Judge Gonzales after years of complaints about John \nAshcroft? He has been a wonderful Attorney General, in my eyes. After \nyears of complaining about him because he is too conservative, all of a \nsudden you have a moderate Hispanic man who has a distinguished public \nservice record, who has a distinguished career as a lawyer, who came \nfrom poverty to the heights of strength and success in this greatest of \nall nations, and he too gets treated like dirt. And I personally resent \nit.\n  Let me conclude these remarks by restating my support for Alberto \nGonzales. He has the education, he has the experience, and he has the \ncharacter to be the next Attorney General of the United States, and he \ndeserves the support of the Senate.\n  I believe that those who vote against him--I hope nobody does, I \nwould be so pleased if nobody did, but those who vote against him, I \nbelieve people throughout this country have to look at what they have \ndone with disdain, with concern, and with intelligent eyes and \ndetermine why they voted against somebody of this quality. Why would \nthey make some of these arguments that are clearly fallacious with \nregard to Judge Gonzales?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today \nin support of the President's nominee for Attorney General, Judge \nAlberto R. Gonzales. Judge Gonzales is an honorable man who will bring \ngreat integrity to the office of Attorney General. Few nominees have \ncome before this body who have demonstrated the intelligence, \ncommitment, and virtue of Judge Alberto Gonzales.\n  The biography of Judge Alberto Gonzales reads like a blueprint of the \ntrue American success story. He was born August 4, 1955 in San Antonio, \nTX. The second of eight children, a young Alberto was raised in a warm, \nfamily environment. His parents, a scant 8 years of formal education \nbetween them, taught their kids the value of hard work and persistence. \nIt was in Humble, TX, a small town north of Houston, that Alberto \nGonzales watched his father Pablo, a migrant worker, and two of his \nuncles build the two-bedroom house in which he and his siblings grew \nup. It is the same house in which his mother resides today.\n  Gonzales graduated from public high school in Houston in 1973. Having \nnever considered college a realistic possibility and full of desire to \nlearn and see the world, Alberto Gonzales enlisted in the Air Force. He \nwas assigned to Ft. Yukon, AK, where he became inspired to apply for an \nappointment to the United States Air Force Academy. Special \narrangements were made for Gonzales to take his ACT and the Academy's \nrequired physical examination while still stationed in Alaska. Gonzales \nwas rewarded with orders to report to the Academy at Colorado\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\nSprings, CO in 1975 to pursue his dream of becoming a pilot in the \nUnited States Air Force.\n  Alberto Gonzales excelled in his first year at Colorado Springs but \nfound he was more interested in politics and law than the engineering \nand science curriculum required by the Academy. After much deliberation \nand consideration of the effort put forth to earn his appointment to \nthe Academy, he decided to pursue a career in the law. Gonzales started \nat Rice University his junior year of college, graduating from Rice in \n1979. After Rice, Gonzales attended Harvard Law School where he \ngraduated in 1982. Gonzales returned to Houston as an associate at the \nlaw firm of Vinson & Elkins where he later became one of the firm's \nfirst two minority partners. While in private practice, Gonzales also \ntaught as an adjunct law professor at the University of Houston Law \nCenter and was actively involved in numerous civic organizations.\n  It was at a meeting of Houston area minority leaders in 1994 that \nAlberto Gonzales first met President George W. Bush during the \nPresident's first gubernatorial campaign. Several weeks after being \nelected Governor, Bush asked Gonzales to join his administration as his \nGeneral Counsel, where he served for 3 years. On December 2, 1997, \nGonzales was appointed Texas' 100th Secretary of State, serving as \nchief elections officer, the State's leading liaison on Mexico and \nborder issues, and senior adviser to the Governor. Gonzales was \nappointed to the Texas State Supreme Court in 1999, and was elected to \na full 6-year term on the court in 2000 with 81 percent of the vote. In \nJanuary of 2001, Alberto Gonzales again heeded President Bush's call to \nservice and was commissioned as counsel to the President.\n  This is an incredible journey from Humble, TX, to Ft. Yukon, AK, to \nthe Air Force Academy in Colorado to the Ivy League. From private \nbusiness and civil leadership in Texas to being recruited to serve in \nthe administration of President Bush, Alberto Gonzales has led a life \nfull of challenge, accomplishment, and great success. As if this \nweren't enough, Alberto Gonzales has given back to his community and \nhis fellow Americans along the way.\n  Alberto Gonzales was a trustee of the Texas Bar Foundation from 1996 \nto 1999, a director for the State Bar of Texas from 1991 to 1994, and \nPresident of the Houston Hispanic Bar Association from 1990 to 1991. He \nwas a director of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast from 1993 to \n1994, and President of Leadership Houston. In 1994, Gonzales served as \nChair of the Commission for District Decentralization of the Houston \nIndependent School District, and as a member of the Committee on \nUndergraduate Admissions for Rice University. Gonzales was Special \nLegal Counsel to the Houston Host Committee for the 1990 Summit of \nIndustrialized Nations, and a member of delegations sent by the \nAmerican Council of Young Political Leaders to Mexico in 1996 and to \nthe People's Republic of China in 1995. He served on the board of \ndirectors of Catholic Charities, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, and the \nHouston Hispanic Forum.\n  Judge Gonzales has been the fortunate recipient of many professional \nand civic honors, including his 2003 induction into the Hispanic \nScholarship Fund Alumni Hall of Fame, and the Good Neighbor Award from \nthe United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce for his dedication and \nleadership in promoting a civil society and equal opportunity. Gonzales \nalso received in 2003 the President's Awards from the United States \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce and the League of United Latin American \nCitizens. In 2002, he was recognized as a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice \nUniversity by the Association of Rice Alumni and was honored with the \nHarvard Law School Association Award. Gonzales was recognized as the \n1999 Latino Lawyer of the Year by the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation, and he received a Presidential Citation from the State Bar \nof Texas in 1997 for his dedication to addressing basic legal needs of \nthe indigent. He was chosen as one of the Five Outstanding Young Texans \nby the Texas Jaycees in 1994, and as the Outstanding Young Lawyer of \nTexas by the Texas Young Lawyers Association in 1992. Gonzales was \nhonored by the United Way in 1993 with a Commitment to Leadership \nAward, and received the Hispanic Salute Award in 1989 from the Houston \nMetro Ford Dealers for his work in the field of education.\n\n  When I began my remarks I suggested that Alberto Gonzales was one of \nthe most accomplished and qualified individuals ever to stand before \nthis body for confirmation. In recent weeks this body, and particularly \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, has engaged in a rigorous, often \nexaggerated, examination of Judge Gonzales life, his work, and \ncharacter. Like all things that take place inside the beltway, this \nexamination has bordered on the dramatic, the overblown, and the \novertly political.\n  Most of the criticism Judge Gonzales has endured has not been related \nto his background, academic and professional accomplishment, or his \ncompetency to serve as this Nation's highest law enforcement official. \nIndeed, the criticism has focused on very recent American history. \nJudge Gonzales, like countless millions of Americans, was effectively \ncalled to service in a way previously unimagined when a small group of \nradical murderers attacked this Nation on September 11, 2001. September \n11, 2001 was an act of war by a group of men who recognize no law and \nrepresent no nation. Terrorists who would attack innocent people around \nthe world and Americans here at home sign no treaties, engage in no \ncivil discourse, and disregard all bodies of democratic government. \nThis is an ugly thing. These are difficult times. We are engaged in a \nwar without borders against a foe that knows no bounds in its cruelty. \nInnocents killed for going to work on a sunny September morning, kidnap \nvictims beheaded for publicity and fear, an entire civic system \nindicted for having the nerve to believe in the liberty of the \nindividual. I find it hard to believe, but Judge Alberto Gonzales is \nbeing treated by some in this chamber as if he was somehow responsible \nfor the senseless and violent acts of terrorists. More reasonable yet \nequally baseless are the criticisms that Judge Gonzales somehow \nsupports the use of barbaric and medieval treatment of those \napprehended by the United States and suspected of engaging in terrorist \nactivities.\n  A good example of the ludicrous criticisms of Judge Gonzales, and one \nmy friend from Texas, Senator Cornyn has rightly sighted in recent \nfloor statements, is the flimsy assertion that Judge Gonzales in \nadvising President Bush to deny prisoner of war status to al-Qaida and \nTaliban terrorists is somehow a violator of the human rights principles \nso essentially a part of the American ethic. In his role advising the \nPresident on legal matters in the war on terror Alberto Gonzales has \nnever provided council regarding prisoners without insisting that their \ntreatment be humane in all instances.\n  According to the very Geneva Convention these critics pretend to \ndefend, only lawful combatants are eligible for POW protections. Lawful \ncombatants must pass the smell test. They must look like combatants. \nThey do not hide their weapons or their affiliations. They wear \nuniforms and they conduct their operations in accordance with the laws \nand customs of war. Civilians are to be treated as innocents. No \nstretching or distorting of this definition can turn terrorists in to \nlawful combatants. In their eagerness to demean Judge Gonzales his \ncritics fail to acknowledge that neither al-Qaida nor the Taliban \nmilitia are legally entitled to the Convention's protections. They do \nnot adhere to the required conditions of lawful combat and are not a \nparty to the Geneva Convention. This is not some arbitrary and \nconvenient conclusion. This is based in the very text and structure of \nthe text, the history of the convention, and has been affirmed by \nseveral Federal courts across the country. And this is what they offer \nas evidence that Judge Gonzales is somehow unfit to serve as Attorney \nGeneral?\n  Judge Gonzales and President Bush have repeatedly affirmed their \nrespect for the humane but aggressive prosecution of the war this \ncountry was dragged in to. Specific to the Geneva Convention Judge \nGonzales testified, ``honoring the Geneva Conventions wherever they \napply . . . I consider the Geneva Conventions neither obsolete or \nquaint.'' The administration has fully applied the Geneva Conventions' \nprotections in Iraq because Iraq is a\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\nHigh Contracting Party to the Conventions. There was never any question \nabout whether Geneva would apply in Iraq, Judge Gonzales testified \nrecently, so there was no decision for the administration to make. Yet \nin committing to the legal study of engagement with the Taliban militia \nand al-Qaida fighters somehow Judge Gonzales is labeled as a radical \nand accused of maliciousness only fairly attributed to the enemies of \nAmerica.\n\n  But the truth is not enough when there are political axes to grind. \nMembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee and others have loudly \nasserted that the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib somehow \nrepresents U.S. and administration policy. Like everyone else in this \nChamber I was startled by the photographs of prisoner mistreatment at \nAbu Ghraib, but again we see a logical failure in connecting this \nincident of abuse with any policy set by the Department of Justice, \nJudge Gonzales or the President. ``I have been deeply troubled and \noffended by reports of abuse,'' Judge Gonzales testified. ``The photos \nfrom Abu Ghraib sickened and outraged me, and left a stain on our \nNation's reputation.'' Judge Gonzales testified at length on this \nmatter and the administration has been nothing but clear that these \nisolated acts were those of a small group of misguided soldiers. These \nacts were wrong and completely inconsistent with the policies and \nvalues of this country. The Independent Panel to Review DoD Detention \nOperations found that the abuses depicted in Abu Ghraib photographs \nwere not part of authorized interrogations but a representation of \ndeviant behavior and a failure of military leadership and discipline.\n  And still the critics of Judge Gonzales demand he be linked to these \nroundly condemned and isolated acts. While I am proud to rise in \nsupport of Judge Gonzales, I am dismayed at the atmosphere in which \nthis nomination has been made and received by the Senate. As millions \nof Americans know, in recent years we have witnessed a historical \nhijacking of the President's power to appoint judges. While controversy \nmay not be new to the appointment process, the unprecedented filibuster \nof judges in this Chamber last year flies boldly in the face of both \nthe Founders' intent expressed in Article II, Section II of the \nConstitution, as well as a distortion of the Senate's rich tradition of \nproviding advise and consent without filibuster.\n  In my opinion the tenor of this confirmation process reeks of last \nyear's series of senseless cloture votes on nominees of high stature. \nUnfair and unsubstantiated claims have been made and half-truths and \nlies of omission have dominated the rhetoric of those opposing Judge \nGonzales. I am not here today to impugn those who have contributed to \nthis false advertising, though it is worth saying that the nature and \nintensity of these false arguments in light of this nominees \nextraordinary record and dedication may reveal more about the opponents \nthan the nominee. Upon his confirmation Judge Gonzales will become the \nfirst Hispanic American to serve in this high post, yet another \nhistoric appointment by President George W. Bush. Judge Gonzales is a \nman of great character who has and will continue to serve this Nation \nwith distinction. I urge my fellow Americans to look at Judge \nGonzales's record and draw their own conclusions as to why some in this \nbody find him to be so disagreeable to their aims. It is clear to me \nwhat has been happening here, just as it is clear to me that Judge \nGonzales will be confirmed despite the overtly political and shallow \nopposition he faces.\n  I am proud to rise in support of Judge Alberto Gonzales. His record \nof service is indicative of the character, integrity and energy he will \nbring to the demanding and thankless job of Attorney General. I look \nforward to working with Attorney General Gonzales, and I thank my \ncolleagues for their time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have had a lot of complaints on the \nfloor about one of America's most decent, fine public servants, Judge \nGonzales, who served as Counsel to the President of the United States. \nIt has been really painful to hear what has been said. I, just for the \nrecord, would like to take a few minutes to respond to some of these \nallegations that are not fair, represent distortions, and really \nmisrepresent him and attack his character unfairly.\n  Senator Kennedy, for example, says that Judge Gonzales was at the \n``epicenter'' of a torture policy. As I have indicated earlier, Judge \nGonzales has repeatedly and consistently opposed torture. He has said \nit is not proper and not justified and has publicly stated that we, as \na nation, are committed to the rule of law, to following our treaty \nobligations, and the statutory requirements that deal with torture. The \nPresident, of course, has said the same.\n  There is no policy of torture in the United States. We have a statute \nthat deals with that and prohibits it. It defines what torture is and \nwhat it is not. Sometimes that has been the problem. Congress's \ndefinition has been ignored. Things that are not included in our \ndefinition have been said to be torture.\n  Indeed, some of the people who complained about the memorandums \nwritten by the Department of Justice officials actually voted for the \nstatute that defined torture; and that memorandum quoted extensively \nfrom it and was framed by that American statute.\n  Senator Stabenow has contended that Judge Gonzales has a reckless \ndisregard for human rights--this decent man, who has seen \ndiscrimination in his life--that he has a reckless disregard for human \nrights and has twisted the law to allow torture.\n  The truth is, Judge Gonzales has stated that every detainee should be \ntreated humanely. In the only memorandum Judge Gonzales ever wrote, he \nprovided prisoner-of-war status to Iraqi soldiers captured in Iraq, \nallowing them the additional protections of a prisoner of war under the \nGeneva Conventions, even though they do not qualify.\n  The soldiers caught and captured right after the conclusion of \nhostilities, wearing a uniform, operating in units, they qualify as \nprisoners of war. But these people who are sneaking around, not in \nuniform, placing bombs against civilian people, against Iraqi citizens, \nagainst American soldiers, they do not meet the definition of the \nGeneva Conventions. Therefore, they really are not entitled legally to \nthose protections. But Judge Gonzales has said, and the President has \nagreed, that they will be given those protections.\n  Senator Feinstein says Judge Gonzales did not answer the committee's \nquestions properly, her questions. He really did answer them. I think \nthe truth is that the Senator was unsatisfied with his answers because \nthey were, she said, not independent of the President.\n  Let me ask, isn't it most likely the fact that Judge Gonzales and the \nPresident agreed on these positions? This issue has been taken to the \nAmerican people in the President's reelection campaign. All these \nissues were debated and the American people affirmed his leadership and \nhis guidance in the war on terrorism. To say there is not enough \ndistance between the President's lawyer and the President is really an \nodd statement to make. Of course, the lawyer and the President are \ntogether, I am sure not only legally and professionally together on \nthese issues, but they share deep values together.\n\n  Senator Mikulski claims that Judge Gonzales was not cooperative in \nthe nomination of judges to the Maryland bench. The truth is, Maryland \nSenators have played a role in obstructing the judge's nominees. They \nhave argued that one nominee, a lawyer born in Maryland and educated in \nMaryland, was not a Marylander and could not be confirmed. I think it \nwas driven by their disagreement with his conservative judicial \nphilosophy, but they objected on that basis, and there was a big \ndisagreement on it. But that is not Judge Gonzales's decision to make. \nUltimately, that is the decision of the President.\n  One Senator complained about his support for Claude Allen for the \ncourt of appeals, an African-American judicial nominee of excellent \nreputation,\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\nand I don't think that is fair. He simply supported Claude Allen, a \njudge that I supported and a majority of this Senate supports but has \nbeen blocked through dilatory tactics from the other side. But that is \nnot a basis to vote against him for Attorney General.\n  Senator Schumer complained that Judge Gonzales refused to answer his \nquestion on the so-called nuclear option, which is a political issue, a \nlegislative branch issue of this Congress to deal with. It is a matter \nthat involves rules in the Senate, how they are changed, and that kind \nof debate. This issue has nothing to do with running the Department of \nJustice. It is not any role for Judge Gonzales, a lawyer for the \nPresident of the United States, to start opining on what he thinks \nabout Senate rules.\n  Senator Schumer is leading filibuster after filibuster of the \nPresident's nominees in an unprecedented use of the filibuster \nsystematically against judicial nominees, something that has not \nhappened in the history of this Republic. But for these filibusters, \nthe nuclear question would not exist.\n  These complaints have been unfair. They have oftentimes relied on \ninformation taken out of context, information that is misleading. The \ntruth is, Judge Gonzales is a sound lawyer, a decent man who believes \nin the rule of law. He believes in following the law. He will be a \nterrific Attorney General. He has been nominated by the President. I \nbelieve he will be confirmed. I am excited for him and his good, fine \nfamily. It is going to be a special day for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 2:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senator from West Virginia is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, Alberto Gonzales is Counsel to the President of the \nUnited States. For the past 4 years, Mr. Gonzales has served as the \nchief legal adviser to President Bush, housed in the west wing of the \nWhite House, a stone's throw from the Oval Office.\n  The official biography of Alberto Gonzales on the White House Web \nsite states that before he was commissioned to be White House Counsel, \nJudge Gonzales was a justice on the Texas Supreme Court. Prior to that, \nhe served as the one-hundredth Secretary of the State of Texas, where \none of his many duties was to act as a senior adviser to then-Governor \nGeorge W. Bush. Before that, he was general counsel to Governor Bush \nfor 3 years.\n  So for over a decade, Alberto Gonzales has been a close confidant and \nadviser to George W. Bush, and the President has confirmed his personal \nand professional ties to Judge Gonzales on many occasions.\n  The President has described him as both ``a dear friend'' and as \n``the top legal official on the White House staff.'' When the President \nnominated Mr. Gonzales to be the next Attorney General of the United \nStates, the President began by asserting:\n\n       This is the fifth time I have asked Judge Gonzales to serve \n     his fellow citizens, and I am very grateful he keeps saying \n     ``yes'' . . . as the top legal official on the White House \n     staff, he has led a superb team of lawyers.\n\n  In praising his nomination of Alberto Gonzales, the President \nspecifically stressed the quintessential ``leadership'' role that \nAlberto Gonzales has held in providing the President with legal advice \non the war on terror. The President stated specifically that it was his \n``sharp intellect and sound judgment'' that helped shape our policies \nin the war on terror. According to the President, Mr. Gonzales is one \nof his closest friends who, again in the words of the President, \n``always gives me his frank opinion.''\n  I am not a member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and so I \nhave come to my conclusions by reading from the record. Not hearing \ndirectly the testimony, not being able to ask questions during the \nhearings, but from my reading of the testimony, I speak now.\n  Imagine how perplexing and disheartening it has been to review the \nresponses--or should I say lack of responses--that were provided by Mr. \nGonzales to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee at his \nconfirmation hearing on January 6. It seemed as if once seated before \nthe committee, Judge Gonzales forgot that he had, in fact, been the \nPresident's top legal adviser for the past 4 years.\n  It was a strangely detached Alberto Gonzales who appeared before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Suddenly this close friend and adviser to \nthe President simply could not recall forming opinions on a great \nnumber of key legal and policy decisions made by the Bush White House \nover the past 4 years. And this seemed particularly true when it came \nto decisions which in retrospect now appear to have been wrong.\n  When asked his specific recollection of weighty matters, Judge \nGonzales could provide only vague recollections in many instances of \nwhat might have been discussed in meetings of quite monumental \nimportance even during a time of war.\n  He could not remember what he advised in discussions interpreting the \nU.S. law against torture or the power of the President to ignore laws \npassed by Congress, discussions that resulted in decisions that \nreversed over 200 years of legal and constitutional precedents relied \non by 42 prior Presidents. That is pretty hard to believe. In fact, if \none did not know the true relationship between the President and this \nnominee, or if one had never heard the President refer to the ``frank'' \nadvice he has received from Judge Gonzales, one would think from \nreading his hearing transcript that Alberto Gonzales was not really the \nWhite House Counsel.\n  Instead, one might think that he is simply an old family friend who, \nyes, is happy to work near the seat of power but makes no really big \ndecisions, has no legal opinions of his own, and certainly feels no \nresponsibility to provide independent recommendations to the President.\n  I find it hard to believe that the top legal adviser to the President \ncannot recall what he said or what he did with respect to so many of \nthe enormous policy and legal decisions that have flowed from the White \nHouse since September 11 in particular. It is especially difficult to \ncomprehend the sudden memory lapse when the consequences of these \ndecisions have had, and will continue to have, profound effects on \nworld events for years, and even decades, to come.\n  Judge Gonzales was asked whether he had chaired meetings in which he \nhad discussed with Justice Department attorneys such interrogation \ntechniques as strapping detainees to boards and holding them under \nwater, as if to drown them. He testified that there were such meetings, \nand he did remember having had some discussions with Justice Department \nattorneys, but he could not recall what he told them in those \ndiscussions.\n  When Senator Kennedy asked if he ever suggested to the Justice \nDepartment attorneys that they ought to ``lean forward'' to support \nmore extreme uses of torture, as reported by the Washington Post, he \nsaid:\n\n       I don't ever recall having used that term.\n\n  He stated that, while he might have attended such meetings, it was \nnot his role, but that of the Justice Department, to determine which \ninterrogation techniques were lawful. He said:\n\n       It was not my role to direct that we should use certain \n     kinds of methods of receiving information from terrorists. \n     That was a decision made by the operational agencies. . . . \n     And we look to the Department of Justice to tell us what \n     would, in fact, be within the law.\n\n  He said he could not recall what he said when he discussed with \nJustice Department attorneys the contents of the now-infamous \n``torture'' memo of August 1, 2002, the one which independent \ninvestigative reports have found contributed to detainee abuses, first \nat Guantanamo and, then, Afghanistan and, later, Iraq.\n  When asked whether he agreed with the now repudiated conclusions \ncontained in that torture memo at the time of its creation on August 1, \n2002, Mr. Gonzales stated:\n\n       There was discussion between the White House and the \n     Department of Justice, as well as other agencies, about what \n     does this statute mean. . . .I don't recall today whether or \n     not I was in agreement with all of the analyses, but I don't \n     have a disagreement with the conclusions then reached by the \n     Department.\n\n  He went on to add that, as Counsel to the President, it was not his \nresponsibility to approve opinions issued by the Department of Justice. \nHe said:\n\n       I don't believe it is my responsibility, because it really \n     would politicize the work of\n\n[[Page S866]]\n\n     the career professionals at the Department of Justice.\n\n  Mr. President, one must wonder what the job of White House Counsel \nentails, if it does not involve giving the President the benefit of \none's thinking on legal issues.\n  Perhaps one reason Judge Gonzales says he does not remember what he \nsaid in those meetings is because, as soon as the torture memo was \nleaked to the press, he had to disavow it. Once it became clear that \nthe White House believed--based on those meetings--that only the most \negregious acts imaginable could be prohibited as torture, the memo \nreceived universal opprobrium. Thus, the administration had little \nchoice but to repudiate it and, in June 2004, Mr. Gonzales announced \nits withdrawal. He then directed the Justice Department to prepare new \nlegal analyses on how to interpret prohibitions against torture under \nU.S. and international law.\n\n  Strangely, however, that new analysis was not available to the public \nfor 6 more months. Finally, on December 30, just 1 week prior to the \nGonzales nomination hearing, a memorandum containing the \nadministration's most recent take on the subject was issued by the \nJustice Department.\n  With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, together with a keen desire to \nbe confirmed as the next Attorney General of the United States, Judge \nGonzales told the committee on January 6 that the analysis of the \nAugust 1, 2002, memo no longer represents the official position of the \nexecutive branch of the United States.\n  If Judge Gonzales didn't see fit to question the Justice Department's \nofficial position on torture in 2002, what made the administration \nchange its mind in 2004? Was it a careful review of the legal issues, \nor was it simply political backpedaling in light of the public \nknowledge of what its policies had brought about in Abu Ghraib and \nelsewhere?\n  I note in passing that the ``torture'' memo was written in 2002 by \nthen-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee, who is now a Federal judge \non the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. God help the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. I would like the record to reflect that 18 other Senators \nand I voted to reject the nomination of Jay Bybee to be a Federal \njudge, a decision I, for one, do not regret.\n  The Bybee memo drew universal condemnation and scorn for at least two \nof the legal opinions that were included in its text. First, it \ndescribed torture as being prohibited under U.S. law in only very \ncircumscribed circumstances. It defined torture so narrowly that \nhorrific harm could be inflicted against another human being in the \ncourse of an interrogation overseas and not be prohibited. According to \nthe memo, unless such acts resulted in organ failure, the impairment of \na bodily function, or death, they could be considered legal. In fact, \nthe first page of the memorandum states:\n\n       We conclude that the statute [the statute against torture], \n     taken as a whole, makes plain that it prohibits only extreme \n     acts. . . . This confirms our view that the criminal statute \n     penalizes only the most egregious conduct.\n\n  The second but equally shocking and erroneous legal conclusion \nreached in the so-called torture memorandum states:\n\n       We find that in the circumstances of the current war \n     against al-Qaida and its allies, prosecution under section \n     2340A [the relevant provision of U.S. law prohibiting \n     torture] may be barred because enforcement of the statute \n     would represent an unconstitutional infringement of the \n     President's authority to conduct war.\n\n  As the Commander in Chief. Where have we heard that before, the term \n``Commander in Chief''?\n  This means the White House believed that a President can simply \noverride the U.S. law prohibiting torture, just because he disagrees \nwith it. In other words, he can ignore the law by proclaiming, in his \nown mind, that the law is unconstitutional. Not because a court of the \nUnited States has found the law to be unconstitutional but because a \nwartime President decides he simply does not want to be bound by it.\n  What an astounding assertion. Think of it. A President placing \nhimself above the constitutional law--in effect, crowning himself king.\n  This outrageously broad interpretation of Executive authority is so \nantithetical to the carefully calibrated system of checks and balances \nconceived by the Founding Fathers it seems inconceivable that it could \nbe seriously contemplated by any so-called legal expert, much less \nattorneys of the U.S. Justice Department or the White House Counsel.\n  Has the White House no appreciation for the struggle that the Nation \nendured upon its creation? Can it really believe that a President can \ncircumvent the will of the people and their legislature by adopting and \ndisseminating a legal interpretation that would, in the end, protect \nfrom prosecution those who commit torture in violation of U.S. law?\n  Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 69, described in detail exactly \nhow the American system can and must be distinguished from the British \nmonarchy. Hamilton wrote:\n\n       There is no comparison--\n\n  Hear that again--\n\n       There is no comparison--\n\n  None--\n\n       There is no comparison between the intended power of the \n     President and the actual power of the British sovereign. The \n     one can perform alone, what the other can only do with the \n     concurrence of a branch of the Legislature.\n\n  Mr. President, no one man or woman, no President, not his White House \nCounsel, nor all the attorneys in the Office of the Legal Counsel in \nthe Justice Department can, on their own, act in contravention of a law \npassed by Congress.\n  No President--no President--can nullify or countermand a U.S. law to \nshield from prosecution those who would commit or attempt to commit \ntorture. But that was the result sought by this White House.\n  When asked by Senator Durbin if he still believes that the President \nhas the authority as Commander in Chief to ignore a law passed by \nCongress, to decide on his own whether it is unconstitutional, or to \nsimply refuse to comply with it, Judge Gonzales stated that, yes, he \nbelieves it is theoretically possible for the Congress to pass a law \nthat would be viewed as unconstitutional by a President and, therefore, \nto be ignored.\n\n  And even though the torture memo was replaced by a new memorandum on \nDecember 30, the replacement memorandum does not reject the earlier \ndocument's shockingly overly expansive interpretation of the \nPresident's Commander-in-Chief power. Instead, the new memo states that \nbecause that portion of the discussion in the earlier memo was \n``unnecessary,'' it has been eliminated from the new analysis.\n  Particularly disturbing is the fact that although the new analysis \nrepudiates the earlier memo's conclusion that all but extreme acts of \ntorture are permissible, Judge Gonzales could not tell us whether this \nrepudiation of prior policy has been communicated to those who are \ntoday doing the interrogating.\n  This is important because there is language contained in the now-\nrepudiated torture memo that was relied on in Guantanamo and parts of \nwhich were included word for word in the military's Working Group \nReport on Detainee Interrogations in the Global War on Terrorism. This \nreport, dated April 2003, has never been repudiated or amended and may \nbe relied upon by some interrogators in the field.\n  When asked whether those who are charged with conducting \ninterrogations have been apprised of the administration's repudiation \nof sections of the Bybee memo and the administration's attendant change \nin policy, Judge Gonzales did not know the answer.\n  Mr. Gonzales continues to deny responsibility for many of the \npolicies and legal decisions made by this administration. But the Fay \nreport and the Schlesinger report corroborate the fact that policy \nmemos on torture, ghost detainees, and the Geneva Conventions, which \nJudge Gonzales either wrote, requested, authorized, endorsed, or \nimplemented, appear to have contributed to detainee abuses in \nAfghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, and Iraq, including those that occurred at \nAbu Ghraib.\n  The International Committee of the Red Cross has told us that abuse \nof Iraqi detainees has been widespread, not simply the wrongdoing of a \nfew, as the White House first told us, and the abuse occurred not only \nat Abu Ghraib. Last week, the Los Angeles Times reported that documents \nreleased last\n\n[[Page S867]]\n\nMonday by the Pentagon disclosed that prisoners had lodged dozens of \nabuse complaints against U.S. and Iraqi personnel who guarded detainees \nin another location, a little known palace in Baghdad that was \nconverted into a prison.\n  The documents suggest, for the first time, that numerous detainees \nwere also abused at one of Saddam Hussein's former villas in eastern \nBaghdad. The article noted that while previous cases of abuse of Iraqi \nprisoners had focused mainly on Abu Ghraib, allegations of abuse at \nthis new location included that guards had sodomized a disabled man and \nkilled his brother, then tossed his dying body into a cell, on top of \nhis sister.\n  Judge Gonzales admits that he was physically present at discussions \nregarding whether acts of this nature constitute torture, but do not \nexpect him to take responsibility for them. Do not hold me accountable, \nhe says. It was not I. And he does not just point fingers at the \nJustice Department. He also spreads the blame around. While he admitted \nhe had made some mistakes, he attempted to further deflect \nresponsibility for his actions by saying the operational agencies also \nhad responsibility to make decisions on interrogation techniques--Not \nhim. This is exactly what he said:\n\n       I have recollection that we had some discussions in my \n     office, but let me be very clear with the committee. It is \n     not my job to decide which types of methods of obtaining \n     information from terrorists would be the most effective. That \n     job responsibility falls to folks within the agencies. It is \n     also not my job to make the ultimate decision about whether \n     or not those methods would, in fact, meet the requirements of \n     the anti-torture statute. That would be the job for the \n     Department of Justice. . . . I viewed it as their \n     responsibility to make a decision as to whether or not a \n     procedure or method would, in fact, be lawful.\n\n  One wishes that Judge Gonzales could have told us what his job was \nrather than, telling us only what it was not. Talk about passing the \nbuck.\n  At the end of the day one can only remember or wonder then what legal \nadvice, if any, he actually gave to the President of the United States. \nDoes Judge Gonzales or the President have an opinion on the question of \nwhat constitutes torture? Does he or the President have an opinion on \nthe related question of whether it is legal to relocate detainees to \nfacilitate interrogation? Do they believe it is morally or \nconstitutionally right? Do we know? No.\n  According to article II, section 3, of the U.S. Constitution, as head \nof the executive branch, the President has a legal duty to take care \nthat the laws be faithfully executed. The Constitution does not say \nthat the President should or may undertake that responsibility. It \nclearly states that the President shall take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.\n  He is duty bound to undertake that responsibility under the \nConstitution of the United States, and the President and his Counsel \nmust be held accountable for not only failing to faithfully execute our \nlaws but also for trying to undermine, contravene, and gut them.\n  With such a track record, how can we possibly trust this man to be \nAttorney General of the United States? What sort of judgment has he \nexhibited?\n  As I stated a few days ago with respect to Dr. Condoleezza Rice, \nthere needs to be accountability in our Government. There needs to be \naccountability for the innumerable blunders, bad decisions, and warped \npolicies that have led the United States to the position in which we \nnow find ourselves, trapped in Iraq amid increased violence; disgraced \nby detainee abuses first in Guantanamo, then in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nprobably in locations we have yet to discover; shunned by our allies; \nperceived by the world community, rightfully, as careening down the \nwrong path.\n  I do not believe our Nation can rely on the judgment of a public \nofficial with so little respect for the rule of constitutional law. We \ncannot rely on the judgment of someone with so little regard for our \nconstitutional system of government. I simply cannot support the \nnomination of someone who despite his assertions to the contrary \nobviously contributed in large measure to the atrocious policy failures \nand the contrived and abominable legal decisions that have flowed from \nthis White House over the past 4 years. For all of these reasons, I \nhave no choice but to vote against the nomination of Alberto Gonzales \nto be the next Attorney General of the United States.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in relation to the nomination of \nJudge Alberto Gonzales to be the next Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  Before making my comments about Judge Gonzales, I also want to say \nthat earlier this afternoon I had a highly enlightening and very \nrewarding discussion with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Byrd. Senator Byrd spoke just before me. He is a man of tradition \nand hard work. I am very grateful for his leadership and his \ninspiration.\n  As I make my comments about Attorney General-nominee Gonzales, I want \nto tell you that I do so because my brothers and sisters in law \nenforcement have endorsed him. I do so as well because he has given me \nhis written commitment to fight for civil rights. I do so because Judge \nGonzales has given me his written pledge that he opposes torture in all \nof its forms and will use the power of his office to prosecute any \nAmerican--anywhere--who uses torture.\n  Many of my colleagues and citizens across America have spoken \neloquently about their concerns with Judge Gonzales. The most grave of \nthose concerns has been the flawed legal analysis and conclusions \nregarding torture. That analysis and those conclusions were wrong and \nthey have been rejected.\n  Any policy that condones torture is reprehensible for three reasons. \nFirst, a torture policy violates U.S. law and the cornerstone of the \nGeneva Conventions. Second, a torture policy endangers our men and \nwomen in uniform. And, third, a torture policy diminishes America's \nstanding around the world.\n  Because of these concerns, I have had numerous conversations and \nmeetings with Judge Gonzales, and I am confident that as Attorney \nGeneral he will not sanction torture in any form and will uphold the \nlaws of the United States and the international accords that make \ntorture illegal.\n  In fact, I specifically asked Judge Gonzales to respond to my \nconcerns and the concerns of the American public in writing. In his \nletter to me of January 28, 2005, Judge Gonzales wrote:\n\n       I do not condone torture in any form. I confirm to you that \n     the United States of America does not condone the torture of \n     anyone by our country or by anyone else. The laws of the \n     United States and the international obligations of the United \n     States prohibit torture in all its forms. These international \n     obligations include the Geneva Conventions, which I consider \n     binding upon the United States. I reaffirm to you that, if \n     confirmed as Attorney General, I will enforce these laws and \n     international obligations aggressively to prohibit torture in \n     all its forms.\n\n  He continues in his letter:\n\n       I pledge to do so for two reasons. These are the laws of \n     the United States, and I am obligated to uphold those laws. \n     And secondly, any action by the United States that undermines \n     the Geneva Conventions threatens the safety and security of \n     our troops.\n\n  Judge Gonzales's statement is clear and unequivocal. Simply stated, \ntorture is illegal and wrong and that will be the position of Judge \nGonzales as Attorney General. As the Nation's top law enforcement \nofficer, Judge Gonzales will be accountable for this position as he \ndenounces torture, and I and the American people will make sure this \nis, in fact, the case.\n  Before proceeding further, I ask unanimous consent Judge Gonzales's \nletter to me be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, January 28, 2005.\n     Hon. Ken Salazar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Salazar: I have appreciated our ongoing \n     conversations, and I thank you for the dialogue we have had \n     about my nomination by the President to serve as Attorney \n     General. I am pleased to\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\n     reaffirm for you my positions on several issues I know are \n     important to you.\n       I understand, I agree with, and I will act in accord with \n     the principle that the Attorney General of the United States \n     is the nation's chief law enforcement officer, with client \n     responsibilities and other important duties to the people of \n     the United States. If confirmed, I will lead the Department \n     of Justice and act on behalf of agencies and officials of the \n     United States. Nevertheless, my highest and most solemn \n     obligation will be to represent the interests of the People. \n     I know that you understand this solemn duty well from your \n     prior service as Chief Counsel to the Governor and as \n     Colorado Attorney General.\n       I do not condone torture in any form. I confirm to you that \n     the United States of America does not condone the torture of \n     anyone by our country or by anyone else. The laws of the \n     United States and the international obligations of the United \n     States prohibit torture in all its forms. These international \n     obligations include the Geneva Conventions, which I consider \n     binding upon the United States. I reaffirm to you that, if \n     confirmed as Attorney General, I will enforce these laws and \n     international obligations aggressively to prohibit torture in \n     all its forms.\n       I pledge to do so for two reasons. These are the laws of \n     the United States, and I am obligated to uphold those laws. \n     And, secondly, any action by the United States that \n     undermines the Geneva Conventions threatens the safety and \n     security of our troops.\n       Also, I agree with you that our country should continue its \n     broad and healthy debate about the provisions of the USA \n     Patriot Act, particularly with regard to the necessary \n     balance between civil liberties and the ability of law \n     enforcement and other officials to protect public safety. I \n     keep an open mind on these issues. I welcome your views on \n     these matters, and I look forward to our continued \n     discussions.\n       I understand your concern about increased funding for state \n     and local law enforcement. As Attorney General, I will work \n     with you and our state and local law enforcement community to \n     do the best job we can to make our communities safer.\n       Finally, I understand the importance of civil rights and \n     equal opportunity for all Americans. I will work to uphold \n     those rights and opportunities as Attorney General.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to explain my position on \n     these matters for you. I appreciate your friendship and your \n     support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I have spent the last 6 years of my life \nas the attorney general of the great State of Colorado working with \npeople I consider to be my brothers and sisters in law enforcement. I \nhave met with the widows of fallen officers, and I led our State \nefforts to train Colorado's 14,000 peace officers.\n  I have deep respect for the 750,000 men and women in law enforcement \nwho risk their lives every day to keep each of us and our communities \nsafe. These men and women will be the backbone of our Nation's Homeland \nSecurity efforts. I respect their judgment and opinion. In that regard, \nI stand with the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District \nAttorneys Association, the FBI Agents Association, and the Law \nEnforcement Alliance of America, all of whom have endorsed Judge \nGonzales as Attorney General.\n  I have spoken to Judge Gonzales about the needs of law enforcement \naround the country. He has pledged his support and has pledged to come \nto Colorado to meet and learn from Colorado's heroic law enforcement \nofficers about their experiences and their needs.\n  Finally, Judge Gonzales, I believe in his heart, knows about the \nimportance of civil rights and liberties. He knows first hand of the \nindignities of a society that turns a blind eye to discrimination and \nprejudice. Because he knows that reality of the American experience, I \nexpect him, as Attorney General, to help lead the way for the creation \nof an America that despises hate and bigotry and recognizes that every \nhuman being deserves a government that will fight for the dignity and \nequality of all.\n  I will vote to confirm Judge Alberto Gonzales to be the next Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disturbed that even though there are \nsome Democrats who support Judge Gonzales, and some who oppose, I have \nheard some Senators on the other side of the aisle imply that those who \noppose this nomination are biased against him based on his ethnic \nbackground. I resent that charge.\n  For somebody to say that those opposed are biased against Judge \nGonzales because of his ethnicity is preposterous and deeply offensive.\n  We have stood here for 2 days explaining our positions. Many of us \nhave said if we were voting on the story and on the achievements of \nJudge Gonzales, which are commendable, we would be voting for him. If \nwe were voting on what he has overcome in his life and career, we would \nbe voting for him. What we have said clearly, however, is that we are \nvoting against him based upon his conduct as Counsel to the President. \nWe have come to this decision based upon his record.\n  Let us talk about that record. Judge Gonzales has argued that the \nConvention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment does not prohibit cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment or punishment with ``respect to aliens overseas.'' Reaching \nthis conclusion requires such twisted reasoning that even those who \nsupport Judge Gonzales must part company with him on this point.\n  I am also disturbed by his interpretation of the Geneva Conventions. \nJudge Gonzales did not follow the advice he received from Secretary of \nState Powell, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or of \nthe State Department lawyers. He did not stand up for the military and \ninterpret our obligations consistent with the Army Field Manual and the \ndecades of sound practice and counsel from the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps.\n  That is why I object to this nominee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \ndescribing Judge Gonzales's interrogation policies, written by Jeffrey \nSmith and Dan Eggen.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 5, 2005]\n\n    Gonzales Helped Set the Course for Detainees--Justice Nominee's \n           Hearings Likely To Focus on Interrogation Policies\n\n                  (By R. Jeffrey Smith and Dan Eggen)\n\n       In March 2002, U.S. elation at the capture of al Qaeda \n     operations chief Abu Zubaida was turning to frustration as he \n     refused to bend to CIA interrogation. But the agency's \n     officers, determined to wring more from Abu Zubaida through \n     threatening interrogations, worried about being charged with \n     violating domestic and international proscriptions on \n     torture.\n       They asked for a legal review--the first ever by the \n     government--of how much pain and suffering a U.S. \n     intelligence officer could inflict on a prisoner without \n     violating a 1994 law that imposes severe penalties, including \n     life imprisonment and execution, on convicted torturers. The \n     Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel took up the \n     task, and at least twice during the drafting, top \n     administration officials were briefed on the results.\n       White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales chaired the \n     meetings on this issue, which included detailed descriptions \n     of interrogation techniques such as ``waterboarding,'' a \n     tactic intended to make detainees feel as if they are \n     drowning. He raised no objections and, without consulting \n     military and State Department experts in the laws of torture \n     and war, approved an August 2002 memo that gave CIA \n     interrogators the legal blessings they sought.\n       Gonzales, working closely with a small group of \n     conservative legal officials at the White House, the Justice \n     Department and the Defense Department--and overseeing \n     deliberations that generally excluded potential dissenters--\n     helped chart other legal paths in the handling and \n     imprisonment of suspected terrorists and the applicability of \n     international conventions to U.S. military and law \n     enforcement activities.\n       His former colleagues say that throughout this period, \n     Gonzales--a confidant of George W. Bush's from Texas and the \n     president's nominee to be the next attorney general--often \n     repeated a phrase used by Defense Secretary Donald H. \n     Rumsfeld to spur tougher antiterrorism policies: ``Are we \n     being forward-leaning enough?''\n       But one of the mysteries that surround Gonzales is the \n     extent to which these new legal approaches are his own \n     handiwork rather than the work of others, particularly Vice \n     President Cheney's influential legal counsel, David S. \n     Addington.\n       Gonzales's involvement in the crafting of the torture memo, \n     and his work on two presidential orders on detainee policy \n     that provoked controversy or judicial censure during Bush's \n     first term, is expected to take center stage at Senate \n     Judiciary Committee hearings tomorrow on Gonzales's \n     nomination to\n\n[[Page S869]]\n\n     become attorney general. The outlines of Gonzales's actions \n     are known, but new details emerged in interviews with \n     colleagues and other officials, some of whom spoke only on \n     the condition of anonymity because they were involved in \n     confidential government policy deliberations.\n       On at least two of the most controversial policies endorsed \n     by Gonzales, officials familiar with the events say the \n     impetus for action came from Addington--another reflection of \n     Cheney's outsize influence with the president and the rest of \n     the government. Addington, universally described as \n     outspokenly conservative, interviewed candidates for \n     appointment as Gonzales's deputy, spoke at Gonzales's morning \n     meetings and, in at least one instance, drafted an early \n     version of a legal memorandum circulated to other departments \n     in Gonzales's name, several sources said.\n       Conceding that such ghostwriting might seem irregular, even \n     though Gonzales was aware of it, one former White House \n     official said it was simply ``evidence of the closeness of \n     the relationship'' between the two men. But another official \n     familiar with the administration's legal policymaking, who \n     spoke on the condition of anonymity because such \n     deliberations are supposed to be confidential, said that \n     Gonzales often acquiesced in policymaking by others.\n       This might not be the best quality for an official \n     nominated to be attorney general, the nation's top law \n     enforcement job, the administration official said. He added \n     that he thinks Gonzales learned from mistakes during Bush's \n     first term.\n       Supporters of Gonzales depict him as a more pragmatic \n     successor to John D. Ashcroft, and a cautious lawyer who \n     carefully weighs competing points of view while pressing for \n     aggressive anti-terrorism efforts. His critics have expressed \n     alarm at what they regard as his record of excluding \n     dissenting points of view in the development of legal \n     policies that fail to hold up under broader scrutiny and give \n     short shrift to human rights.\n       His nomination has, in short, become another battleground \n     for the debate over whether the administration has acted \n     prudently to forestall another terrorist attack or \n     overreached by legally sanctioning rights abuses.\n       One thing is clear: Gonzales, 49, enjoys Bush's trust. He \n     has worked directly with the former Texas governor for more \n     than nine years, advising him on sensitive foreign policy and \n     defense matters that rarely--if ever--fell within the purview \n     of previous White House counsels.\n       For example, when the Justice Department formally \n     repudiated the legal reasoning of the August 2002 \n     interrogation memo last week in another document that \n     Gonzales reviewed, it was overturning a policy with \n     consequences that Gonzales heard discussed in intimate \n     detail--to the point of learning what the physiological \n     reactions of detainees might be to the suffering the CIA \n     wanted to inflict, those involved in the deliberations said.\n       The White House said Gonzales and Addington, a former \n     Reagan aide and Pentagon counsel, were unavailable to be \n     interviewed for this article. But asked to comment on whether \n     Gonzales acquiesced too easily on legal policies pushed by \n     others, spokesman Brian Besanceney responded that Gonzales \n     had ``served with distinction and with the highest \n     professional standards as a lawyer'' in private practice, \n     state government and the White House, and he ``will \n     continue to do so as attorney general.''\n\n\n                            a success story\n\n       Bush has told people that he was attracted by Gonzales's \n     rags-to-riches life story. A Texas native and the son of \n     Mexican immigrants, Gonzales served for two years in the Air \n     Force before graduating from Rice University and Harvard Law \n     School. He met Bush during his 1994 gubernatorial campaign, \n     while Gonzales was a partner at the politically connected \n     Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins.\n       Upon election, Bush appointed him as his personal counsel, \n     later as Texas secretary of state and eventually as a justice \n     on the Texas Supreme Court. Within weeks of the 2000 \n     presidential election, Bush tapped Gonzales to be his White \n     House counsel, and Gonzales set about creating what officials \n     there proudly described as one of the most ideologically \n     aligned counsel's offices in years.\n       Bringing only one associate to Washington from Texas, \n     Gonzales forged his staff instead from a tightknit group of \n     Washington-based former clerks to Supreme Court or appellate \n     judges, all of whom had worked on at least one of three \n     touchstones of the conservative movement: the Whitewater and \n     Monica S. Lewinsky inquiries of former president Bill \n     Clinton, the Bush-Cheney election campaign, and the Florida \n     vote-counting dispute.\n       ``It was an office of like-minded'' lawyers and ``strong \n     personalities,'' said Bradford A. Berenson, a criminal \n     defense lawyer appointed as one of eight associate counsels \n     in Gonzales's office. ``There was not a shrinking violet in \n     the bunch.''\n       ``Federalist Society regulars'' is the way another former \n     associate counsel, H. Christopher Bartolomucci, described the \n     Gonzales staff and its ideological allies elsewhere in the \n     government, such as Deputy Assistant Attorney General John \n     Yoo and Defense Department General Counsel William J. Haynes \n     II. All were adherents to the theory that the Constitution \n     gives the president considerably more authority than the \n     Congress and the judiciary.\n       One of the clearest examples of this ambition was \n     Gonzales's long-running and ultimately futile battle with the \n     independent commission that investigated the Sept. 11, 2001, \n     terrorist attacks. Gonzales's office, acting as the liaison \n     between the White House and the 10-member bipartisan panel, \n     repeatedly resisted commission demands for access to \n     presidential documents and officials such as national \n     security adviser Condoleezza Rice, prompting angry and public \n     disputes.\n       Gonzales is ``a good lawyer and a nice guy, and maybe he \n     was a decent judge for a year, but he didn't bring a lot of \n     political judgment or strategic judgment to their dealings \n     with the commission,'' a senior commission official said. \n     ``He hurt the White House politically by antagonizing the \n     commissioners . . . and all of it for no good reason. In \n     the end, the stuff all came out.''\n       Each morning, Gonzales convened round tables at which his \n     staff--as well as Addington--related their legal conundrums. \n     Gonzales was ``not a domineering personality . . . and he \n     gave us a chance to speak our minds,'' said Helgi C. Walker, \n     a former clerk for Clarence Thomas who was an associate \n     counsel from 2001 to 2003.\n       ``There was often a lively debate, but at the end it was \n     not clear where Gonzales was,'' another former colleague \n     said. A second former colleague recalls that in interagency \n     meetings, Gonzales sat in the back and was ``unassuming, \n     pleasant and quiet.'' So discreet was Gonzales about his \n     opinions that one official who worked closely with him for a \n     year said ``he never made an impression on me.''\n       But Berenson says Gonzales was hardly pushed around by \n     officials who thought they had a monopoly on wisdom. ``I \n     didn't have the sense that he was whipping his horses or that \n     they were dragging him along behind them,'' he said, adding \n     that Gonzales was ``neither the tool of an aggressive staff \n     nor the quarterback of a reluctant team.''\n       Current and former White House officials interviewed for \n     this article listed only a few episodes in which Gonzales \n     forcefully pressed a position at odds with ideological \n     conservatives. None was in the terrorism field.\n       Walker said she is aware of criticism that Gonzales \n     ``should have been saying `I believe this or that' '' about \n     some of the provocative issues presented to him. ``He did not \n     see his job as being about him'' but about advocating Bush's \n     interests, she explained. ``The judge is not consumed with \n     his own importance, unlike some others in Washington.''\n\n\n                            detainee policy\n\n       Unlike many of his predecessors since the Reagan era, \n     Gonzales lacked much experience in federal law and national \n     security matters. So when the Pentagon worried about how to \n     handle expected al Qaeda detainees in the days after the \n     Sept. 11 attacks and the Oct. 7 U.S. attack on Afghanistan, \n     Gonzales organized an interagency group to take up the matter \n     under the State Department's war crimes adviser, Pierre-\n     Richard Prosper.\n       Former attorney general William P. Barr suggested to \n     Gonzales's staff early on that those captured on the \n     battlefield go before military tribunals instead of civil \n     courts. But Ashcroft and Michael Chertoff, his deputy for the \n     criminal division, both adamantly opposed the plan, along \n     with military lawyers at the Pentagon. The result was that \n     the process moved slowly.\n       Addington was the first to suggest that the issue be taken \n     away from the Prosper group and that a presidential order be \n     drafted authorizing the tribunals that he, Gonzales and \n     Timothy E. Flanigan, then a principal deputy to Gonzales, \n     supported. It was intended for circulation among a much \n     smaller group of like-minded officials. Berenson, Flanigan \n     and Addington helped write the draft, and on Nov. 6, 2001, \n     Gonzales's office secured an opinion from the Justice \n     Department's Office of Legal Counsel that the contemplated \n     military tribunals would be legal.\n       That office, historically the government's principal \n     internal domestic law adviser, was also staffed by advocates \n     of expansive executive powers; it had told the White House in \n     a classified memo five weeks earlier that the president's \n     authority to wage preemptive war against suspected terrorists \n     was virtually unlimited, partly because proving criminal \n     responsibility for terrorist acts was so difficult.\n       After a final discussion with Cheney, Bush signed the order \n     authorizing military tribunals on Nov. 13, 2001, while \n     standing up, as he was on his way out of the White House to \n     his Texas ranch for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir \n     Putin. It provided for the military trial of anyone suspected \n     of belonging to al Qaeda or conspiring to conduct or assist \n     acts of terrorism; conviction would come from a two-thirds \n     vote of the tribunal members, who would adjudicate fact and \n     law and decide what evidence was admissible. Decisions could \n     not be appealed.\n       Cut out in the final decision making were military lawyers, \n     the State Department and Chertoff, as well as Rice, her \n     deputy, Stephen J. Hadley, and Rice's legal adviser, John \n     Bellinger. ``I don't think Gonzales felt he was acting \n     precipitously, but he realized people would be surprised,'' \n     Flanigan said. It amounted to a decision that the president \n     could act without ``the entire staff's blessing. As it turned \n     out, they [National Security Council officials] just weren't \n     involved in the process.''\n       Berenson, who left the White House for private practice in \n     2003, said ``there were such\n\n[[Page S870]]\n\n     strong shared assumptions at the time [that] we had a \n     powerful sense of mission.'' He attributes the haste to worry \n     about another terrorist attack.\n       But David Bowker, then a State Department lawyer excluded \n     from the process and now in private practice, called the \n     order premature and politically unwise. ``The right thing to \n     do would have been an open process inside the government,'' \n     he said.\n       The tribunals were halted by U.S. District Judge James \n     Robertson, who ruled on Nov. 24, 2004, that detainees' rights \n     are guaranteed by the Geneva Conventions--which the \n     administration had argued were irrelevant.\n\n\n                           Rebellion at State\n\n       Four weeks after Bush's executive order, a similarly \n     limited deliberation provoked more determined rebellion at \n     the State Department and among military lawyers and officers. \n     The issue was whether al Qaeda and Taliban fighters captured \n     on the battlefield in Afghanistan should be accorded the \n     Geneva Conventions' human rights protections.\n       Gonzales, after reviewing a legal brief from the Justice \n     Department's Office of Legal Counsel, advised Bush verbally \n     on Jan. 18, 2002, that he had authority to exempt \n     the detainees from such protections. Bush agreed, \n     reversing a decades-old policy aimed in part at ensuring \n     equal treatment for U.S. military detainees around the \n     world. Rumsfeld issued an order the next day to commanders \n     that detainees would receive such protections only ``to \n     the extent appropriate and consistent with military \n     necessity.''\n       Secretary of State Colin L. Powell--whose legal adviser, \n     William H. Taft IV, had vigorously tried to block the \n     decision--then met twice with Bush to convince him that the \n     decision would be a public relations debacle and would \n     undermine U.S. military prohibitions on detainee abuse. Gen. \n     Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     backed Powell, as did the leaders of the U.S. Central Command \n     who were pursuing the war.\n       The task of summarizing the competing points of view in a \n     draft letter to the president was seized initially by \n     Addington. A memo he wrote and signed with Gonzales's name--\n     and knowledge--was circulated to various departments, several \n     sources said. A version of this draft, dated Jan. 25, 2002, \n     was subsequently leaked. It included the eye-catching \n     assertion that a ``new paradigm'' of a war on terrorism \n     ``renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning \n     of enemy prisoners.''\n       In early February 2002, Gonzales reviewed the issue once \n     more with Bush, who reaffirmed his initial decision regarding \n     his legal authority but chose not to invoke it immediately \n     for Taliban members. Flanigan said that Gonzales still \n     disagreed with Powell but ``viewed his role as trying to help \n     the president accommodate the views of State.''\n       Thirty months later, a Defense Department panel chaired by \n     James R. Schlesinger concluded that the president's resulting \n     Feb. 7 executive order played a key role in the Central \n     Command's creation of interrogation policies for the Abu \n     Ghraib prison in Iraq.\n       A former senior military lawyer, who was involved in the \n     deliberations but spoke on the condition of anonymity, \n     complained that Gonzales's counsel's office had ignored the \n     language and history of the conventions, treating the \n     question ``as if they wanted to look at the rules to see how \n     to justify what they wanted to do.''\n       ``It was not an open and honest discussion,'' the lawyer \n     said.\n       For Gonzales's aides, however, the experience only \n     reinforced a concern that the State Department and the \n     military legal community should not be trusted with \n     information about such policymaking. State ``saw its mission \n     as representing the interests of the rest of the world to the \n     president, instead of the president's interests to the \n     world,'' one aide said.\n\n\n                        The Debate Over Torture\n\n       This schism created additional problems when Gonzales \n     approved in August 2002--after limited consultation--an \n     Office of Legal Counsel memo suggesting various stratagems \n     that officials could use to defend themselves against \n     criminal prosecution for torture.\n       Drafted at the request of the CIA, which sought legal \n     blessing for aggressive interrogation methods for Abu Zubaida \n     and other al Qaeda detainees, the memo contended that only \n     physically punishing acts ``of an extreme nature'' would be \n     prosecutable. It also said that those committing torture with \n     express presidential authority or without the intent to \n     commit harm were probably immune from prosecution.\n       The memo was signed by Jay S. Bybee, then an assistant \n     attorney general and now a federal appellate judge, but \n     written with significant input from Yoo, whom Gonzales had \n     tried to hire at the White House and later endorsed to head \n     Justice's legal counsel office. During the drafting of the \n     memo, Yoo briefed Gonzales several times on its contents. He \n     also briefed Ashcroft, Bellinger, Addington, Haynes and the \n     CIA's acting general counsel, John A. Rizzo, several \n     officials said.\n       At least one of the meetings during this period included a \n     detailed description of the interrogation methods the CIA \n     wanted to use, such as open-handed slapping, the threat of \n     live burial and ``waterboarding''--a procedure that involves \n     strapping a detainee to a board, raising the feet above the \n     head, wrapping the face and nose in a wet towel, and dripping \n     water onto the head. Tested repeatedly on U.S. military \n     personnel as part of interrogation resistance training, the \n     technique proved to produce an unbearable sensation of \n     drowning.\n       State Department officials and military lawyers were \n     intentionally excluded from these deliberations, officials \n     said. Gonzales and his staff had no reservations about the \n     legal draft or the proposed interrogation methods and did not \n     suggest major changes during the editing of Yoo's memo, two \n     officials involved in the deliberations said.\n       The memo defined torture in extreme terms, said the \n     president had inherent powers to allow it and gave the CIA \n     permission to do what it wished. Seven months later, its \n     conclusions were cited approvingly in a Defense Department \n     memo that spelled out the Pentagon's policy for ``exceptional \n     interrogations'' of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       When the text was leaked to the public last summer, it \n     attracted scorn from military lawyers and human rights \n     experts worldwide. Nigel Rodley, a British lawyer who served \n     as the special U.N. rapporteur on torture and inhumane \n     treatment from 1993 to 2001, remarked that its underlying \n     doctrine ``sounds like the discredited legal theories used by \n     Latin American countries'' to justify repression.\n       After two weeks of damaging publicity, Gonzales distanced \n     himself, Bush and other senior officials from its language, \n     calling the conclusions ``unnecessary, over-broad \n     discussions'' of abstract legal theories ignored by \n     policymakers. Another six months passed before the Office of \n     Legal Counsel, under new direction, repudiated its reasoning \n     publicly, one week before Gonzales's confirmation hearing.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to set the record straight on \nsomething that the senior Senator from Utah said yesterday regarding \nthe President's February 2002 directive on the treatment of al-Qaida \nand Taliban detainees. According to Senator Hatch, ``the President \n[said] unequivocally that detainees are to be treated humanely.'' In \nfact, the President's directive said only that ``the U.S. Armed \nForces'' should treat detainees humanely. The President's directive \npointedly did not apply to the CIA and other nonmilitary personnel.\n  I asked Judge Gonzales:\n\n       Does the President's February 7, 2002, directive regarding \n     humane treatment of detainees apply to the CIA or any other \n     non-military personnel?\n\n  He replied:\n\n       No. By its terms, the February 7, 2002, directive \n     ``reaffirm[s] the order previously issued by the Secretary of \n     Defense to the United States Armed Forces.''\n\n  In other words, contrary to what he have heard, and continue to hear, \nfrom Judge Gonzales's supporters, the President's oft-quoted directive \nregarding the humane treatment of detainees is carefully worded to \npermit the occasional inhumane treatment of detainees. Indeed, that is \none of the legal loopholes that concerns so many of us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United States.\n  Judge Gonzales's story is truly inspirational. A man from humble \nbeginnings--Humble, TX, to be precise--he grew up in a modest home \nbuilt by his father and uncle where he lived with his parents and seven \nbrothers and sisters with no hot water and no telephone. His parents \nwere migrant workers who never even finished elementary school, but \nthey believed in the American dream. They worked hard to give their \nchildren an education and to instill in them the American values of \npersonal responsibility and hard work.\n  At the age of 12, Alberto Gonzales had his first job selling soft \ndrinks at Rice University football games where he dreamed of one day \ngoing to college. Through determination, intelligence, and hard work, \nhe achieved his dream. He graduated from Rice University, the first in \nhis family to earn a college degree, and went on to excel at Harvard \nLaw School.\n  Alberto Gonzales is a dedicated public servant. He has served his \ncountry in many capacities, including his service in the U.S. Air \nForce, as a judge on the Texas Supreme Court, and as Texas secretary of \nstate. Judge Gonzales knows well that holding a public office involves \na bond with the American people.\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\n  He has proven himself as a man of integrity and with the highest \nprofessional qualifications. That is why Judge Gonzales has broad \nsupport from groups and individuals across our country. His nomination \nis supported by the Hispanic National Bar Association, the League of \nUnited Latin American Citizens, the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational District Attorneys Association, and the FBI Agents \nAssociation, to name just a few of these groups.\n  He also has bipartisan support from those who know him best, \nincluding leading Democrats, for example, Henry Cisneros, who served as \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Clinton. Mr. \nCisneros, a former mayor of San Antonio, writes:\n\n       In the 36 years that I have voted, I have supported and \n     voted for only one Republican. That was when Alberto Gonzales \n     ran for election to the Texas Supreme Court. I messaged \n     friends about this uncommonly capable and serious man [and] I \n     urged them to support his campaign. . . . He is now President \n     Bush's nominee to be Attorney General of the United States \n     and I urge his confirmation.\n\n  I have had the personal opportunity to meet with Judge Gonzales to \ndiscuss many issues over the last few years on many different \noccasions. I have always found him to be a man who honored his \ncommitments, who kept his promises. I know he is a leader who is \ndedicated to protecting America, to following the Constitution, and to \napplying the rule of law.\n  The position of the Attorney General is as challenging a job as ever \ngiven the post-9/11 environment, but I am confident that as our \nNation's chief law enforcement officer, Judge Gonzales will continue \nthe progress we have made in fighting the war against terrorism, in \ncombating crime, in strengthening the FBI, and in continuing to protect \nour cherished civil liberties.\n  As Judge Gonzales himself said regarding his nomination:\n\n       The American people expect and deserve a Department of \n     Justice guided by the rule of law, and there should be no \n     question regarding the Department's commitment to justice for \n     every American. On this principle there can be no compromise.\n\n  Alberto Gonzales, the man from Humble, is committed to ensuring \njustice for each and every American. He is committed to the rule of \nlaw. He deserves our confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to join me \nin voting for his confirmation.\n  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico for allowing \nme to precede him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her good words. \nNeedless to say, I agree with the Senator and I hope that sometime \ntomorrow an overwhelming number of Senators from both sides of the \naisle will do likewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in behalf of the President's \nnominee for Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales. I have read as much as \nI could about his background and his life. Most importantly, I have \nread what those who have lived and worked with him during his life have \nhad to say about him, and I will read what they have had to say about \nhim shortly.\n  From everything I have read and learned, I have concluded that some \non that side of the aisle oppose him for totally personal, partisan, \nand political reasons, no question about it. I do not want to speculate \nas to why because it is really inconceivable to me that Democrats would \ndo what they are doing to this man.\n  For decades, they used to talk about the Democrat Party being the \nparty of Hispanics, as if it were just as natural and normal as day \nfollows night that Hispanics, that minority which is growing, just \nought to be Democrats.\n  Well, something has happened a little bit. Some change is occurring, \nand sure enough this President is tinkering with that toy of theirs. He \nis appointing more qualified Hispanics to high office than any of their \nPresidents ever have. My colleagues cannot say Alberto Gonzales was \nnominated just because he is a minority with the name Gonzales, because \nevery single qualification that one would require he has met.\n  Did the American Bar Association approve? Absolutely. What did the \nbar of Texas think about him? They named him to one of their highest \noffices before we ever thought of him. What about law firms in Texas? \nHe has been a member of the best law firms there are. What about \njudicial temperament? He sat on the highest civil and criminal court in \nthe big, great State of Texas. Now, they did not all do that because \nhis name is Gonzales, but it just happens that it is.\n  Nor did they approve of him because he was born in poverty, because \nhis parents did not speak English, or because he lived in a house \nwithout running water. They did not approve of him because of that. \nThey approved of him because he was qualified.\n  So then one might ask, what is all this objection about? It seems as \nif there is an idea that for some reason or another he has had a bad \nimpact on our country's name because he is for torturing prisoners, or \nif I am reading too much into that then maybe it is he set a bad \nexample which hurt America because people perceived he was for \ntorturing prisoners and he did not do anything about it.\n  Based on the record, based on the law, based on the interpretation of \nthe law, that is about as flimsy a reason as one could ever have for \nnot approving this man to be Attorney General.\n  First, I do not want to take a lot of time. It is late. We have heard \na lot. I did not come here without checking a few things. I find that \nmost authentic and reliable discerners, interpreters of the legal \nconsequences of the Geneva Convention conclude that the Geneva \nConvention does not apply to these kinds of captives.\n  I do not know how else to say it. There is opinion after opinion, \ninterpretation after interpretation, that the title which talks about \nthe care and how one must treat prisoners of war does not apply to \nterrorists. I will insert in the Record three different leading \nscholarly statements that say that is the case. Now, that is logical.\n  One might say, well, is America for torture? No. That is not logical. \nWhat is logical is when the Geneva Conventions were drawn, we were \ntalking about prisoners of war such as those in the First and the \nSecond World Wars, where literally thousands of soldiers belonging to \nan army of another nation were gathered and this was to say that you \nhave to treat them a certain way. They belong to a country. Terrorists \ndo not belong to any country. They are not fighting a war for a \ncountry. They are not part of an organized military that you capture.\n\n  I don't need to go into all that. I can just say, that is a bum rap, \nto say he should not be Attorney General because he might have said or \nsigned a memo that said we do not need to apply the Geneva Conventions \nto these captives. If that were the case, that should not disqualify \nhim because that is the predominant law, interpretive law of that \nconvention.\n  Then we say: Senator, you are not saying, since that is not the case, \nyou are free to do whatever you want to prisoners? Not at all. There \nstill is a rule of law regarding the treatment of prisoners. I do not \nthink anybody can rightfully get up and say Alberto Gonzales promoted \nor implicitly promoted treating these kind of captives any old way you \nwant. I do not believe that is the case.\n  So I don't know what we are talking about. There might be something. \nThere might be something. It might be that there has been a decision on \nthat side of the aisle to just make every appointment of the President \ndifficult, or anyone they can find the least thing about, make it \ndifficult. Let me say, I don't think it does them any good. I don't \nthink the American people, 2 weeks from now, are going to think this \neffort on their part did anything to hurt this man or hurt our \nPresident. What I am concerned about is whether the Democratic Party \nthinks it is going to help them because I do think it is another \nopportunity for Hispanics to say, Why should we be Democrats? I think \nthat is giving that nail another nice pound with a nice strong hammer. \nI do not think there is any question about that.\n  I do think there is a growing concern on that side of the aisle as to \nwho is going to be the next Supreme Court Justice. I know some might \nsay: Senator Domenici, get off that.\n  No, no, every time you get in corners, little corners where people \nare talking up here, the subject is, who do you think the President can \nappoint\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\nwho can get by the Senate? There was a lot of talk up here that maybe \nAlberto Gonzales was that person. I don't know that. It looks to me, \nbased on his history, based on his background, based on his \nrelationship with the President, he might be. But maybe, if you make \nenough noise about him and attempt to stick enough signs up on a \nbillboard saying he is this, that, or the other, maybe he will not be a \ncandidate, a probable candidate anymore. That could be what some people \nthink. I do not know. I hope it is not, and I hope, in spite of what \nhas happened, it doesn't.\n  I am not here as his champion for that job. That is the President's \njob. But I think it would be terrific if the President of the United \nStates followed up on all the things he has done to prove that he has \nno discrimination about his personal being and no discrimination that \nstems from his party, or Republicans. He is open. He has, in his \nCabinet, we all know, a distinguished group of Americans who are \nminorities. This would be another one.\n  I want to close by saying I am very pleased that a lot of \norganizations in this country, and a lot of distinguished people have \nnot bought the arguments made by the other side because they know him, \nthey like him, they are familiar with him, they trust him, and they \nwant him to be Attorney General.\n\n  Let me say first, about Henry Cisneros--a lot of Americans and a lot \nof Hispanic Americans know who he is. He had a little downfall in his \ncareer, but he is a very considerate, intelligent, concerned Hispanic \nAmerican from the State of Texas. He is the former mayor of San Antonio \nand a former Cabinet member, Democratic Presidential appointee.\n  I will not make his letter part of the Record since it has already \nbeen printed in the Record. It is dated January 5, 2005, to the Wall \nStreet Journal.\n  This is a tremendous examination of who this nominee is, what he has \ndone, what he has demonstrated, and the conclusion that it will be good \nfor America to have an Attorney General who has memories like those--\nhaving stated his upbringing and the like--\n\n       . . . because he can rely on those memories to understand \n     the realities that many Americans still confront in their \n     lives. I believe he will apply those life experiences to the \n     work ahead. His confirmation by the Senate can be part of \n     America's steady march toward liberty and justice for all.\n\n  That is not a Republican, that is not the President, that is Henry \nCisneros. He signs it: Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under \nPresident Clinton, mayor of San Antonio, TX, from 1981 through 1989.\n  Mr. Gonzales, in 1989, was recognized as the Latino Lawyer of the \nYear by the Hispanic National Bar Association and received a \nPresidential citation from the State Bar of Texas in 1997 for his \ndedication in addressing the basic legal needs of the indigent. He was \nchosen as one of the five outstanding young Texans by the Texas JCs, \nand an Outstanding Young Lawyer of Texas. He was also suggested as the \nTexas Young Lawyer by their association.\n  There are many more. I merely read these, and you know that they all \nare giving accolades, and that those who are giving accolades or giving \nawards are Hispanic. They are Hispanic organizations, Hispanic \nindividuals. I think that means something. We are very proud as \nRepublicans that the minority Hispanics in America are thrilled with \nthis appointment.\n  I looked very carefully at a couple of organizations that have been \ncited or if not should be cited as being opposed to him. I would be \nremiss if I didn't tell you I would expect that they would be because \nthey are so Democratic, I don't think they could be for a Republican \nFelix Frankfurter to be U.S. Attorney General if he were Republican. A \ncouple of these Spanish organizations are so devoted to Democrats, they \ncould not be for a Hispanic U.S. Attorney General if he were Republican \nno matter what his name is. So it doesn't bother me that two of them \nare.\n  But the League of United Latin American Citizens--LULAC, they are for \nhim. The National Council of La Raza--whether you agree with any of \nthese or not--is for him. The Hispanic National Bar Association is for \nhim. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \nOfficials, they are for him. The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce is \nfor him.\n  I can go on. There are eight more. I ask unanimous consent the list \nin its entirety be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Gonzales Nomination--Positions of Hispanic Groups\n\n\n                                Support\n\n     League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)\n     National Council of La Raza (Kerry)--Presidential Endorsement\n     Hispanic National Bar Associations\n     National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \n         Officials\n     Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU)\n     United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce\n     Hispanic Alliance for Progress\n     The Latino Coalition (Bush)\n     Hispanic Business Roundtable (Bush)\n     New American Alliance\n     MANA (national latina women's organization)\n     National Association of Hispanic Publishers\n     National Association of Hispanic Firefighters (Bush)\n\n\n                          Withheld Endorsement\n\n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund\n\n\n                                 Oppose\n\n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus (Kerry)\n     Mexican American Political Association\n     National Latino Law Students Association\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is a congressional Hispanic caucus which was \namong those that I was mentioning a while ago. They endorsed Senator \nKerry, supported him, campaigned for him. I wouldn't expect them to be \nfor this nominee.\n  I think I said most of what I wanted to say to the Senate for those \nwho are interested in the other side of the coin from what the \nDemocrats--small in number but by sufficient numbers--want to make a \nlot of people in the country think, that this man should not have this \njob.\n  I think they are wrong. I think the Hispanic community of America \nshould know that they are wrong. I think the Hispanic community of \nAmerica should know that most people who are concerned about them--\nHispanic Americans--are for him. I think they could rightfully conclude \nthat those who are not for him don't care about Hispanic Americans \nbecause most of them overwhelmingly think he is the right man for this \njob.\n  I thank the Senate for the few moments I have had to discuss this \nmatter and hope that my few words will have something to do with adding \nto the chorus of support for this candidate, and for some of those who \nlistened to that which is said against him will at least think if they \nwere leaning toward believing that, that there really is another side; \nand that real side is probably somewhere close to what I said in the \nlast 10 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the remarks \nof the Senator from New Mexico, and I would like to say two or three \nthings for the Record.\n  The criticism has been leveled that the Democrats are somehow \nobstructionists; that we are standing in the path of the President to \nfilling his Cabinet. The Senator from New Mexico knows this is the \nsecond rollcall on the nominees of the President. Six nominees for the \nCabinet positions asked for by President Bush have been approved by \nvoice vote--without even a recorded vote having been taken. Only one \nremains: Mr. Chertoff. To suggest that somehow we are delaying, \nobstructing, standing in the road of progress for this administration \nis to overlook the obvious.\n  We have cooperated with this administration. We have done our best to \nexpedite the hearings on these nominees.\n  There are only two of the highest positions--Secretary of State and \nAttorney General--that have evoked any substantive floor debate.\n  As I listen to my Republican colleagues, it appears that their advice \nto the Democratic minority is to sit down and be quiet; you lost the \nelection. But, as I understand it, each of us has been elected to \nrepresent a State and to stand up for the values in which we believe. \nTo ask for a few moments on\n\n[[Page S873]]\n\nthe floor to debate an important nomination for Secretary of State or \nAttorney General I don't think is being impudent. I think it is what we \nwere elected to do.\n  The Constitution not only empowers us and authorizes us; it commands \nus to advise and consent--not just consent. If we want to spend a day \nor two debating something as serious as Judge Gonzales's involvement in \nrewriting the torture policy in America, I don't think that is \ninappropriate. In fact, I think our silence would be inappropriate.\n  Those on the other side--and even some on this side--may disagree \nwith the conclusions reached earlier. I think you will find when the \nrollcall comes that there will be Senators on both sides of the aisle \nvoting for Judge Gonzales. So be it. But to say we are somehow stepping \nout of line by even debating a nominee for the Cabinet is just plain \nwrong.\n  Second, this is exactly the same argument that was used on the issue \nof judges. If you listened to the commentaries, particularly from some \nsources on radio and television, you would think that the Democrats had \nfound a way to stop most of the judges nominated by President Bush over \nthe last 4 years. But look at the cold facts. Two-hundred and four of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees were approved. They went through \nthis Congress, under both Democratic and Republican committee \nleadership. Only 10 nominees were held up. The final score in that game \nwas 204 to 10. It is clear the President won the overwhelming \npercentage of judicial nominees he sent to the floor of the Senate. If \nyou listen to our critics, you would think it was the opposite--that we \nonly approved 10 judges and turned down 204.\n  That wasn't the case at all. When people come to the floor critical \nof the Democrats for even wanting to debate a Cabinet nominee, I think \nthey are overstating the case.\n  Let me address the last point made by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't want to take the Senator's right to the floor \nunder any circumstances.\n  First, I ask to speak to ask the Senator a question right now, \nbecause I can't stay. I want the Senator to know that I always \nappreciate his remarks. They always stimulate me, whatever the Senator \nthinks that means. Maybe it stimulates me to answer; maybe it makes me \nget red in the face. I don't know.\n  Anyway, I don't think my remarks were principally devoted to--in \nfact, only mildly devoted to--the delay that may be taking place with \nregard to some nominees. I stand on that premise--that there have been \ndelays that were uncalled for. But that was the principal point.\n  I hope that nobody would let the distinguished Senator kind of avoid \nthe issue. That is not the issue Senator Domenici raises.\n  The issue is that this man is totally qualified; that those who know \nhim best say he is qualified. It appears that those on the other side \nof the aisle want to see him defeated, or put upon by their arguments \nsuch that he doesn't go into that office strong and full of support \nbut, rather, nicked by attacks that are meaningless and without any \nmerit. That is the argument.\n  I tried to tell everybody who is for him. Frankly, they knew him a \nlot better than any Senators knew him. Many of them like Cisneros knew \nhim for 15 years--and what he said about him on January 5, not 10 years \nago, what he was, what he wasn't, how good he was.\n  That was my argument. My argument and question was, Why? Maybe that \nis my question. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I \nwill make it a practice to always yield the floor whenever I possibly \ncan because I think dialog between two Senators runs perilously close \nto debate which we have very little of on the floor of the Senate.\n  I welcome the comments of the Senator from New Mexico. I may disagree \non this issue, but I hope we have respect for one another and what we \nbring to this Chamber.\n  The point I would like to make is this: I do not know him personally. \nI met him in my office for a brief meeting, the first time we ever sat \ndown together.\n  I read his life story. I couldn't help but be impressed. Here is a \nman who came from a very modest circumstance, who served his Nation in \nthe Air Force, who went to law school, who became general counsel to \nthe Governor of Texas, a member of the Texas Supreme Court, and then \nlegal counsel to the President of the United States. It is an amazing, \nextraordinary life story.\n  Some of my colleagues, including the Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nSalazar, have talked about their origins and their upbringing and how \ndifficult it is to overcome with discrimination in many quarters. Thank \ngoodness that is changing in America but not fast enough.\n  The point I would like to make is, I don't know a single Member of \nthe Senate who has taken exception to Judge Gonzales because he is \nHispanic or because he comes from humble origins. That is not the \nissue. The issue we believe, simply stated, is what did he do as \ngeneral counsel to the President? Did it qualify him or disqualify him \nto have the highest law enforcement position in the United States of \nAmerica? I think that is the issue.\n  When I came to the floor to speak earlier--and I will not recount my \nremarks--it related to the torture policy of which he was a part. I \nthink in 10 or 20 years of history we will look at this war on \nterrorism and judge us harshly for having sat down to rewrite the \npolicies and principles--the human principles--that guided this country \nfor decades when it came to the treatment of prisoners and detainees. \nThat is why I have reservations about Judge Gonzales. That is why I \nraised these questions, both in a public hearing and in written \nquestions to him personally. That is why I am opposing his nomination, \nsimply stated.\n  I have the greatest respect for what he has achieved personally in \nlife, but I have a responsibility to go beyond that personal \nachievement and ask from a professional and governmental viewpoint, Is \nhe the best person for this job? That is why many of us have risen in \nopposition to his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize that today, \nFebruary 2, 2005, is National Appreciation Day for Catholic Schools. As \na proud graduate of Catholic schools, I am delighted to be able to meet \nsome of these Catholic school student leaders to let them know what an \ninvestment in our future they are.\n  The spirit of Catholic schools has been present in the United States \nsince the first settlers arrived in America. In 1606 the Franciscans \nopened a school in what is now St. Augustine, FL. During the next \ncentury, the Franciscans and Ursulines established Catholic schools \nthroughout the American colonies: in Maryland, Massachusetts, \nPennsylvania, New York, and even in non-British colonial locales, such \nas New Orleans. After the American Revolution, Catholic patriots worked \nto open the first official parochial school in the United States, St. \nMary's School, established in 1782 in Philadelphia. In 1789 Georgetown \nUniversity, the first Catholic college in the United States, was \nfounded right here in the District.\n  Catholic schools have offered much more to the United States than \njust longevity, however; America's Catholic schools have offered an \nacademic excellence that has helped to influence the moral, \nintellectual, physical, and social values of our youth for over 300 \nyears. As Baltimore Archbishop Cardinal James Gibbons said, ``Education \nmust make a person not only clever but good.'' For more than three \ncenturies, Catholic schools in this country\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\nhave worked to do just that. They have inspired our youth, enriched our \ncommunities, and provided a moral support for millions.\n  Today, with over 2.6 million students enrolled in Catholic elementary \nand secondary schools, they are working as hard as ever to enhance the \neducation of our youth.\n  On a personal level, Catholic schools have greatly influenced who I \nam today. It was at my alma mater, Ursuline Academy of New Orleans, \nthat I sought my first elected office. As seventh grade class vice-\npresident, I took to heart the Academy's motto of serviam and fully \nembraced the words of the founder of the Ursuline Sisters, St. Angela \nMerici that it is better ``to serve than to be served.'' The promotion \nof educational excellence, the development of the whole person, \ncommunity, and family, and the dedication to service are values that I \nam grateful Ursuline reinforced.\n  It is with these thoughts in mind that I offer my utmost \ncongratulations and thanks to the Catholic schools, students, parents, \nand teachers across the Nation and specifically in Louisiana for the \nongoing contributions they have made in the area of education. You have \ndone remarkable work over the years, and I thank you for everything.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/02/senate-section/article/S874-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S874-S876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD WETLANDS DAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today on World \nWetlands Day to acknowledge the proclamation by the Governor of our \nState that today, February 2, America's Wetlands Day in Louisiana. \nWorld Wetlands Day is a day that we join together with people around \nthe world to bring public awareness to the benefits and values of \nwetlands as well as the severe challenges that confront them. February \n2 of each year marks the date of the signing in 1971 of the Convention \non Wetlands which provided a framework for national action and \ninternational cooperation toward the conservation and wise use of \nwetlands and their resources. Wetlands can be found in every country \nand are among the most productive ecosystems in the world.\n  Those of us from Louisiana bring a rather unique perspective to the \nsubject of wetlands. You see, Louisiana's coast is really America's \nwetland. It is not a beach, but a vast landscape of wetlands. The \nlandscape that extends along Louisiana's coast is one of the largest \nand most productive expanses of coastal wetlands in North America. It \nis the seventh largest delta on Earth, where the Mississippi River \ndrains two-thirds of the United States. It is also one of the most \nproductive environments in America--``working wetlands'' as they are \nknown to Louisianians--producing more seafood than any other State in \nthe lower 48. It is the nursery ground for the Gulf of Mexico and \nhabitat for the one of the greatest flyways in the world for millions \nof waterfowl and migratory songbirds.\n  Louisiana's coastal wetlands provide storm protection for ports that \ncarry nearly 500 million tons of waterborne commerce annually--the \nlargest port system in the world by tonnage. That accounts for 21 \npercent of all waterborne commerce in the United States each year. In \nfact, four of the top ten largest ports in the United States are \nlocated in Louisiana.\n  These wetlands also offer protection from storm surge for 2 million \npeople and a unique culture. However, what should be of fundamental \ninterest to those of us here is the role these wetlands play in our \nNation's energy security by not only protecting the Nation's critical \nenergy infrastructure but also providing the energy supply that runs \nour daily lives.\n  Eighty percent of the Nation's offshore oil and gas supply, which is \nalmost 30 percent of all the oil and gas consumed in this country, \npasses through these wetlands to be distributed to the rest of the \nNation. There are more than 20,000 miles of pipelines in Federal \noffshore lands and thousands more inland that all make landfall on \nLouisiana's barrier islands and wetland shorelines. The barrier islands \nare the first line of defense against the combined wind and water \nforces of a hurricane, and they serve as anchor points for pipelines \noriginating offshore.\n\n  Annual returns to the Federal Government of oil and gas receipts from \nproduction on the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, average more than $5 \nbillion annually. No single area has contributed as much to the Federal \ntreasury as the OCS. In fact, since 1953, the OCS has contributed $140 \nbillion to the U.S. Treasury.\n  Between 80 and 90 percent of that amount has come from offshore \nLouisiana. In 2003, almost $6 billion in offshore revenues went into \nthe Federal treasury, and more than $5 billion, or 80 percent of that \namount came from offshore Louisiana. Today the OCS supplies more than \n25 percent of our Nation's natural gas production and more than 30 \npercent our domestic oil production, with the promise of more--expected \nto reach 40 percent by 2008. In fact, the OCS supplies more oil to our \nNation than any other country including Saudi Arabia.\n  In addition to domestic production, Louisiana's coast is the land \nbase for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, LOOP, America's only offshore \noil port. LOOP handles about 15 percent of this country's foreign oil \nand is connected to more than 30 percent of the total refining capacity \nin the U.S. Much of the support infrastructure is located in the most \nrapidly deteriorating coastal areas. In addition to LOOP, one will find \ntwo storage sites for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, and Henry \nHub, one of the Nation's major natural gas distribution centers.\n  Port Fourchon, which supports 75 percent of the deepwater production \nin the Gulf, is the geographic and economic center of offshore drilling \nefforts along the Louisiana Coast. This port, and much of the Nation's \nenergy supply, is connected to the mainland by a 17-mile stretch of \ntwo-lane highway--LA 1--that is inundated by flooding in relatively \nmild storms and is vulnerable to being washed out completely.\n  The oil and gas produced offshore Louisiana moves through a maze of \npipelines that crisscross our State delivering energy to other regions \nof the country. In order to preserve this supply, Louisiana must be \nable to continue to host this production. Unfortunately, the very \ncoastal wetlands that support the critical infrastructure necessary to \ndeliver the energy are washing away at an alarming rate leaving \npipelines and other energy infrastructure vulnerable to the whims of \nMother Nature.\n\n  When Hurricane Ivan struck back in September, it should have been a \nwake-up call to us all. Although the storm did not directly hit \nLouisiana, its impact on prices and supply continues to be felt today. \nFour months later, a percentage of oil and gas production in the Gulf \nof Mexico remains offline as a result of the storm, directly \ncontributing to higher oil and gas prices in our country. One can only \nimagine what the impact would have been to supply and prices had Ivan \ncut a more Western path in the Gulf.\n  Louisiana is losing its coastal land at the staggering rate of 25 \nsquare miles a year. That is square miles, not acres. That is a \nfootball field every 30 minutes. We lost more than 1,900 square miles \nin the past 70 years, and the U.S. Geological Survey predicts we will \nlose another 1,000 if decisive action is not taken now to save it. The \neffects of natural processes like subsidence and storms combined with \nthe unintended consequences of Federal actions like the leveeing of the \nMississippi River and impacts from offshore oil and gas exploration and \ndevelopment have led to an ecosystem on the verge of collapse.\n  With the loss of barrier islands and wetlands over the next 50 years, \nNew Orleans will lose its wetland buffer that now protects it from many \neffects of flooding. Hurricanes will pose the greatest threat, since \nNew Orleans sits on a sloping continental shelf that makes it extremely \nvulnerable to storm surges.\n  More than 2 million people in inland south Louisiana will be subject \nto more severe and frequent flooding than ever before. Coastal \ncommunities will become shore-front towns, and the economic and \ncultural costs of relocation are estimated in the billions of dollars.\n  Louisiana takes pride in its role as the country's most crucial \nenergy provider. Ours is a State rich in natural resources. However, \ngiven the contribution my State makes to the Nation, it is time for all \nof us to consider what\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\nthe effects will be should we continue on our present track and ignore \nthe problem. The fate of the country's energy supply and infrastructure \nare just one example of what is at stake.\n  There are increasing signs that people around the country understand \nthe seriousness of the situation. In a poll released today, 90 percent \nof the respondents said it was important to fund national efforts to \nrestore Louisiana's wetlands in and around New Orleans as a means to \nlimit the damage that a direct hit from a hurricane would cause to the \narea. It is now long past time for the Federal Government to step up \nand invest in a State that gives so much to the rest of the country.\n\n            Rules of Procedure--Committee on Armed Services\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge a new beginning \nwith significance not only for the State of Idaho, but for the entire \nNation. I am speaking of the February 1, 2005, formal launch of the new \nIdaho National Laboratory.\n  At the direction of the administration, the Idaho National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory and the Argonne National \nLaboratory-West, two esteemed research facilities that have served this \ncountry so well for over 55 years, are being combined to pursue even \ngreater research and development heights as a single, cohesive \nenterprise. The new laboratory in Idaho has an unmatched foundation on \nwhich to pursue its Department of Energy-assigned vision of \ninternational nuclear leadership for the 21st century, compelling \ncontributions in national and homeland security technology development, \nand execution of a broad supporting science and technology portfolio.\n  Idaho is the place where the first usable amount of electricity from \nnuclear energy was generated. It is where the propulsion system for the \nfirst nuclear-powered submarine was developed. And it is where 52 \nmostly first-of-their-kind, nuclear reactors were designed and \nconstructed. Looking ahead, it is clearly a place well-qualified to \nimplement the technology-based components of the national energy policy \nour Nation needs and that I hope this body will act on this year.\n  The new Idaho National Laboratory is being managed by a team that \ndraws expertise from companies and academic institutions across the \nNation. The Battelle Energy Alliance is led by Battelle Memorial \nInstitute of Ohio. Its partners include BWX Technologies of Virginia, \nWashington Group International of Idaho, the Electric Power Research \nInstitute of California and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology led \nnational consortium of universities including North Carolina State \nUniversity, Ohio State University, Oregon State University, the \nUniversity of New Mexico, and Idaho's three research universities--\nBoise State University, Idaho State University, and the University of \nIdaho.\n  The competition for managing the lab brought out the highest caliber \nof teams. With the Battelle Energy Alliance, we have a truly \nextraordinary national team, committed to collaborating broadly to \nensure our collective interests in energy security, homeland security \nand economic security are well served by the new Idaho National \nLaboratory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/02/senate-section/article/S876-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LIEUTENANT COLONEL GABRIEL PATRICIO\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto Lieutenant Colonel Gabriel R. Patricio, who is concluding a 24-year \ncareer of dedication and excellence in the United States Marines. At \nthe Marine Corps Systems Command in Quantico, VA in recent years, he \nhas had a leading role in modernizing combat clothing and equipment to \nmake troops faster, more efficient, lighter and safer in battle. \nColonel Patricio's talents have produced the most significant upgrade \nin individual clothing and combat equipment for Marines in more than 50 \nyears.\n  Colonel Patricio's ability to think outside-the-box served him well \nin finding better ways to solve old problems. His innovative ideas have \nreduced the time it takes to move a product from concept to the field; \nso that life-saving equipment is being made available to Marines more \nquickly. As an example, he reached across the services to the Army's \nResearch and Development Center in Natick, MA to take advantage of \ntheir cutting-edge technology, which is now saving lives in Iraq.\n  Most recently, Colonel Patricio spearheaded an initiative to develop \nand field a state-of-the-art, on-the-move water purification and \nhydration system. Under his leadership, Systems Command and two private \ncompanies pooled their resources and expertise to create a pen-sized \ndevice that troops are now using to make local water clean and \ndrinkable.\n  Colonel Patricio has successfully managed programs to develop and \nfield other products to enhance the safety and performance of our \ntroops in Iraq and elsewhere, including new, lightweight and more \nprotective body armor; new protection for the face and eyes; \nlightweight helmets; improved load-bearing backpacks; hot weather, \nlightweight ``Jungle/Desert'' boots; high performance lightweight and \nheavyweight Polartec fleece clothing; and specialized mountain and \ncold-weather clothing, including gloves, boots and jackets.\n  Colonel Patricio has served the Marines, and the Nation well. I \ncongratulate him on his many outstanding contributions, and I wish him \na long and happy and healthy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/02/senate-section/article/S876-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S876-S877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the United Nations' Commission of \nInquiry on the crisis in Darfur reported to the Security Council on \nMonday of this week. Like every credible account of what has happened \nin Darfur, the report makes for grim reading. The Commission pointed to \nthe ``killing of civilians, torture, enforced disappearances, \ndestruction of villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence'' in \nits discussion of the violations of international law that have \noccurred in the area, and also found that there may have been Sudanese \nGovernment officials and others who acted ``with genocidal intent.''\n  This report stands in stark contrast to the positive news that \nemerged from Sudan last month, when a comprehensive agreement to end \nthe decades-long, devastating north-south civil war was signed. I \nwelcomed that agreement, and I hope it is successful. But the truth is \nthat I have little confidence in the Government of Sudan, and I see no \nreason to believe that a north-south peace agreement will awaken that \ngovernment to its responsibility to protect all of its citizens. Just \ndays after the historic peace agreement was signed, I visited the \nrefugee camps of eastern Chad and spoke to Sudanese citizens who had \nfled Darfur. They spoke of their desperate need for basic security back \nat home, and they are right. Consistent reports indicate that the \nviolence in Darfur has continued. The Commission of Inquiry's recent \nreport serves to remind all of us, Mr. President, that tragedy persists \nin Sudan, and the world has not done enough to stop it.\n  Much of the attention surrounding this report, Mr. President, has \nfocused on the Commission's recommendation that the International \nCriminal Court, or ICC, take up the Darfur issue with the intention of \ntrying those responsible for atrocities.\n  Just as the question of whether or not to use the word ``genocide'' \nwas, for some time, a debate that distracted attention from the need to \ntake meaningful action to bring security to the people of Darfur, I \nfear that a new issue--the question of whether or not the crimes \ncommitted in Darfur should be taken up by the International Criminal \nCourt--may soon dominate the debate.\n  Mr. President, the administration is implacably opposed to the ICC. \nFrankly, this is a subject on which the President and I share some \ncommon ground. I have not supported joining the ICC as it stands. I \nwant more protection for our troops to ensure that they will not be \ntargets of unjust and politically motivated prosecutions.\n  But I do believe that it was a mistake to walk off in a huff as the \nICC was taking shape. It is hard to protect\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\nour troops from unfair prosecutions if we aren't at the table to win \nthose protections.\n  I also believe that threatening our allies and trying to bully them \ninto changing their position on the ICC, rather than sitting at the \ntable to work these issues out, was a mistake. There are ways to \nprotect our interests that do not involve infuriating the allies that \nwe need to win the war on terrorism.\n  Certainly there are better ways to protect our interests than to \nstand in the way of trying people guilty of what our own administration \nhas called genocide.\n  The American Servicemembers Protection Act, which Congress passed to \ngive concrete form to the objections that many have to the ICC, \ncontains a provision stating:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall prohibit the United States from \n     rendering assistance to international efforts to bring to \n     justice Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic, Osama bin Laden, \n     other members of Al Queda, leaders of Islamic Jihad, and \n     other foreign nationals accused of genocide, war crimes or \n     crimes against humanity.\n\n  It seems to me that the crisis in Darfur may be precisely the kind of \nsituation that such a provision was intended to cover. We have an \ninterest--a moral interest and a political interest--in refusing to \naccept impunity for the grave abuses that have been committed in Darfur \nand in promoting long-term stability by insisting on accountability. \nThere is no question of American troops or political figures being \ninvolved. The legitimate concerns that we have with the ICC simply are \nrelevant to this situation.\n  The administration's position today, as I understand it, is that we \nshould create an entirely new international tribunal for Sudan. If that \nis what it takes to bring some justice to the people of Darfur, so be \nit. But it is not really difficult to understand why other members of \nthe international community would be resistant to creating an entirely \nnew structure, potentially every time that serious crimes against \nhumanity occur, when a structure already exists for the express \npurposes of dealing with these issues. Particularly when our own \nadministration has been pressing existing ad-hoc tribunals to wrap up \ntheir costly but important work, it seems odd to create another ad-hoc \nmechanism when the ICC exists. Most worryingly, it gives those who \nwould rather continue to wallow in endless reviews and deliberations \nwhile people in Darfur die another opportunity to delay reviews and \nmeaningful action.\n  So I believe that the administration should think about what makes \ngood sense in this case. Efforts to bring an end to the crisis in \nDarfur have faltered, time and again, due to a lack of multilateral \npolitical will. Security Council members were unable to do more than \ncontemplate the possibility of sanctions in the face of a terrible man-\nmade catastrophe. We must continue to build a solid international \ncoalition to pressure the Sudanese regime. I know that many of my \ncolleagues and many in the administration share my frustration with the \ngrace periods, the delays, the empty threats, and the hesitations. It \nis well past time, then, to do something about that. If we can send a \nformer Secretary of State around the world to encourage others to \nrelieve Iraqi debt, then we can appoint a very senior Presidential \nenvoy to focus on this problem, to drum up support in capitals around \nthe world, to squeeze every drop of potential cooperation from others \nwith intense discussions and negotiations. The Government of Sudan \nshould feel intense pressure every day, not hear mild scoldings and \nmixed messages every month or so. And the U.S. should not muddle our \nmessage by getting tangled up in our contorted position on the ICC.\n\n  Now the Commission of Inquiry's report has the potential to prod \nother states into action. It would be a terrible shame if the United \nStates, once at the forefront of urging action on Sudan, now became a \npart of the problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/02/senate-section/article/S877-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEDICARE ENHANCEMENT FOR NEEDED DRUGS ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to join the Senator from \nMaine, Olympia Snow, and the Senator from Oregon, Ron Wyden as an \noriginal cosponsor of the bipartisan Medicare Enhancement for Needed \nDrugs (MEND) Act. This bill takes necessary steps to ensure that our \nseniors, and our taxpayers, receive the best price possible on \nprescription drugs under the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nOne of the primary reasons I voted against the Medicare Modernization \nAct was because I felt that it did not go far enough in addressing the \nskyrocketing prices of prescription drugs. Without strong, proactive \nmeasures to keep the prices of prescription drugs in check, seniors \nwill continue to struggle to afford their prescription drugs, even with \nMedicare's help, and the overall cost of the Medicare Program will \ncontinue to mushroom.\n  There is bipartisan agreement that by prohibiting the Medicare \nProgram from negotiating the prices of prescription drugs, the Medicare \nModernization Act is actually failing to utilize the purchasing power \nof the Medicare Program. The MEND Act will repeal this prohibition, and \nallow--and in some circumstances mandate--the Secretary to negotiate \nthe prices of prescription drugs. This type of negotiation will save \ntaxpayers' dollars while reducing the costs of prescription drugs for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  The MEND Act also provides Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers with \nvaluable information on the prices of prescription drugs under the new \nMedicare benefit. This reporting will ensure that the prices of the \ndrugs most used by seniors do not go up just as the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit goes into effect. It will also ensure that \nseniors and others who depend on Medicare have the complete, accurate \ninformation they need when deciding upon a prescription drug plan under \nMedicare.\n  It is important that we act now, in a bipartisan manner, to fix the \nflaws included in the Medicare Modernization Act before the \nprescription drug benefit begins next year. The MEND Act will help both \nthose who depend on the Medicare Program, and those who have to pay for \nit, by acting to rein in the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/02/senate-section/article/S877-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S877-S878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HELPING TO PREPARE PROVIDERS TO CARE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, so many of VA health care providers are \ntruly dedicated to treating all of the ailments veterans face, \nincluding psychological ones. In an attempt to help VA providers \nunderstand the special needs of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \nEnduring Freedom veterans, one particular VA health care region has \nmade special efforts.\n  The Brockton Division of the VA Boston Healthcare System Continuing \nEducation Committee hosted a conference, entitled ``Preparing for the \nacute and long-term needs of Afghanistan and Iraq war veterans.'' \nSeveral experts in their respective fields served as speakers and made \npresentations to attendees. Brett Litz, Ph.D., of the National Center \nfor Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, discussed ``Promoting \nContinuity of Care and Understanding: Putting the Long-Term lmpact of \nthe War in Afghanistan and Iraq in Context.'' Dr. Litz helped the crowd \nto appreciate the active-duty military mental health culture; \nunderstand the early intervention and the variety of interventions for \nacute trauma; and appreciate high probability themes to war-zone \ntraumas in Afghanistan and Iraq veterans.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Engel, MD, MPH, of Walter Reed Medical \nCenter, addressed ``Quality of Post-Deployment Health Care in the \nDefense Health System--Steady Progress or Unified Promises?'' Lt. Col. \nEngel informed attendees of the strengths and limitations of Deployment \nhealth initiatives in the Department of Defense; ways to improve the \ncontinuity of care from postdeployment to discharge and beyond; and the \nrole of primary care in identifying and treating mental health problems \ncaused by exposure to war.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Carl Castro, Ph.D., of Walter Reed Army Institute \nof Research, spoke about the ``Impact of Combat on the Mental Health of \nSoldiers,'' focusing on the findings of the Mental Health Assessment \nTeam's evaluation of Iraq War veterans mental health and well-being in \nthe warzone; the findings of the psychological screening program in the \nU.S. Army; and the risk and resilience factors that\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\npredict deployment and post-deployment mental health in active duty \nmilitary personnel.\n  The final featured speaker was Yuval Neria, Ph.D., of the New York \nPsychiatric Institute. Dr. Neria educated the audience about ``Israeli \nWar Veterans and POW's Two Decades After the War: Findings from the Yom \nKippur 1973 War.'' She concentrated her discussion on understanding the \nphenomenology of war-trauma; understanding the nature of combat stress \nreactions; and understanding the impact of war-trauma across the \nlifespan.\n  These medical professionals provided just a snapshot of the strides \nVA has made and hopefully will continue to make in the field of war-\ntrauma. I applaud these VA health care providers. As ranking member of \nthe Committee on Veterans Affairs, I will be working to ensure that DoD \nand VA cooperate to make sure that there is a seamless transition from \nactive military status to veteran status. VA providers are quite \nobviously incredibly important as we seek to make this seamless \ntransition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/02/senate-section/article/S878-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     CELEBRATING THE 90TH BIRTHDAY OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL WOMEN'S \n                              ASSOCIATION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to extend my congratulations \nto the American Medical Women's Association, AMWA, on the occasion of \nits 90th Birthday Year Celebration.\n  Throughout this century, AMWA, which is known as the Vision and Voice \nof Women in Medicine, has been determined in its efforts to advance \nwomen in the medical profession and to promote women's health. This \nleading multidisciplinary association of women in medicine in our \ncountry has encouraged and honored excellence in the fields of \nmedicine, health care and science through a wide array of scholarships, \ngrants, and awards, as well as diverse educational programs for \nphysicians, medical students and the general public.\n  Over these nine decades, AMWA has supported numerous charitable \nprograms, particularly focusing on the needs of disadvantaged women and \ntheir families. For 75 years, AMWA's American Women's Hospitals Service \nclinics in the U.S. and abroad have provided desperately needed care to \nthe medically underserved. In addition, hundreds of medical students \nand residents have received remarkable healthcare training in these and \nother remote clinics worldwide through AMWA's sponsorship.\n  AMWA's advocacy on behalf of women's health and research has made \nAMWA a leading voice for the care of women and their children.\n  As someone who has been committed to expanding opportunities for \nwomen and enhancing women's health, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to applaud the accomplishments of this outstanding \norganization and to celebrate with them the history and future of \nAmerican Medical Women's Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/02/senate-section/article/S878-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S878-S881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF \n                   CONGRESS ON FEBRUARY 2, 2005--PM 2\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was ordered to lie on the table:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, fellow \ncitizens:\n  As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of \nGovernment share a great privilege: we have been placed in office by \nthe votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we \nshare with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian \nterritories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq.\n  Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the \ncommitment of our Nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This \nevening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and \naround the world.\n  Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going \nback to work, with our Nation an active force for good in the world--\nthe state of our Union is confident and strong. Our generation has been \nblessed--by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, and \nby the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a \nlittle gray in the mirror--or a lot of gray--and we watch our children \nmoving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of \ntheir Union?\n  Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that \nquestion. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do \nwhat Americans have always done, and build a better world for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  First, we must be good stewards of this economy, and renew the great \ninstitutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely.\n  America's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized \nnation. In the past 4 years, we have provided tax relief to every \nperson who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new \nmarkets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to \nthe highest level in history, and in the last year alone, the United \nStates has added 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the \nCongress delivered--and the Nation is grateful.\n  Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more \nflexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America \nthe economic leader of the world.\n  America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of \nthe Federal Government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for \nspending discipline. So next week I will send you a budget that holds \nthe growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief \npermanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My \nbudget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 Government \nprograms that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or \ndo not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: a \ntaxpayer dollar must be spent wisely, or not at all.\n  To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a \nrising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No \nChild Left Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the \nrise, and we are closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now \nwe must demand better results from our high schools, so every high \nschool diploma is a ticket to success. We will help an additional \n200,000 workers to get training for a better career, by reforming our \njob training system and strengthening America's community colleges. And \nwe will make it easier for Americans to afford a college education, by \nincreasing the size of Pell Grants.\n  To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must \nreward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small \nbusiness is the path of advancement, especially for women and \nminorities, so we must free small businesses from needless regulation \nand protect honest job-creators from junk lawsuits. Justice is \ndistorted, and our economy is held back, by irresponsible class actions \nand frivolous asbestos claims--and I urge Congress to pass legal \nreforms this year.\n  To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health \ncare more affordable, and give families greater access to good \ncoverage, and more control over their health decisions. I ask Congress \nto move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda--with tax credits \nto help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in \nevery poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical \nerrors and needless costs, association health plans for small \nbusinesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and \nmedical liability reform that will reduce health care costs, and make \nsure patients have the doctors and care they need.\n  To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of \naffordable, environmentally responsible energy. Nearly 4 years ago, I \nsubmitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, \nalternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and more production \nhere at home, including safe, clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies \nlegislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\nof our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge \ntechnology--from hydrogen-fueled cars, to clean coal, to renewable \nsources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough--I urge \nCongress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less \ndependent on foreign energy.\n  All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new \njobs--but they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the \nprosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were \ncreated to meet the needs of an earlier time. Year after year, \nAmericans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent Federal tax code. I \nhave appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to \nbottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will \nwork together to give this Nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy \nto understand, and fair to all.\n\n  America's immigration system is also outdated--unsuited to the needs \nof our economy and to the values of our country. We should not be \ncontent with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to \nprovide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and \ninvite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that \npermits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, \nthat rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our \ncountry, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.\n  One of America's most important institutions--a symbol of the trust \nbetween generations--is also in need of wise and effective reform. \nSocial Security was a great moral success of the 20th Century, and we \nmust honor its great purposes in this new century. The system, however, \non its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join \ntogether to strengthen and save Social Security.\n  Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security \nbenefits, and millions more are nearing retirement--and for them the \nsystem is strong and fiscally sound. I have a message for every \nAmerican who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you. For you, \nthe Social Security system will not change in any way.\n  For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems \nthat will grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades \nago, for a very different era. In those days people didn't live as \nlong, benefits were much lower than they are today, and a half century \nago, about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing \nbenefits. Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social \nSecurity could not have foreseen. In today's world, people are living \nlonger and therefore drawing benefits longer--and those benefits are \nscheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead \nof 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only \nabout three workers--and over the next few decades, that number will \nfall to just two workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer \nworkers are paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of \nretirees.\n  So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social \nSecurity will be paying out more than it takes in. And every year \nafterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. For \nexample, in the year 2027, the Government will somehow have to come up \nwith an extra 200 billion dollars to keep the system afloat--and by \n2033, the annual shortfall would be more than 300 billion dollars. By \nthe year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If \nsteps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be \ndrastically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe \ncuts in Social Security benefits or other Government programs.\n  I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem like a long way off. But \nthose dates are not so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you \nhave a five-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for \ncollege tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their \n20s, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before \nthey retire does not seem like a small matter. And it should not be a \nsmall matter to the United States Congress.\n  You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the \nfinancial problems of Social Security once and for all.\n  Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid \nreview of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for \nwealthy retirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the \npossibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During \nthe 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the \nretirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early \ncollection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated.\n  All these ideas are on the table. I know that none of these reforms \nwould be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, \nbecause our children's retirement security is more important than \npartisan politics. I will work with members of Congress to find the \nmost effective combination of reforms. I will listen to anyone who has \na good idea to offer. We must, however, be guided by some basic \nprinciples. We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave \nthat task for another day. We must not jeopardize our economic strength \nby increasing payroll taxes. We must ensure that lower income Americans \nget the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their \nretirement. We must guarantee that there is no change for those now \nretired or nearing retirement. And we must take care that any changes \nin the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and \nplan for their future.\n  As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make \nthe system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach \nthat goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts. Here is \nhow the idea works. Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is \ntaken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of \ntoday's retirees. If you are a younger worker, I believe you should be \nable to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so \nyou can build a nest egg for your own future.\n\n  Here is why personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will \ngrow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can \ndeliver--and your account will provide money for retirement over and \nabove the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, \nyou'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your \npersonal account, if you wish, to your children or grandchildren. And \nbest of all, the money in the account is yours, and the Government can \nnever take it away.\n  The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set \ncareful guidelines for personal accounts. We will make sure the money \ncan only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We will \nmake sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street \nfees. We will make sure there are good options to protect your \ninvestments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement. We \nwill make sure a personal account can't be emptied out all at once, but \nrather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional Social \nSecurity benefits. And we will make sure this plan is fiscally \nresponsible, by starting personal retirement accounts gradually, and \nraising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually \npermitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their \npayroll taxes in their accounts.\n  Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to Federal employees, \nbecause you already have something similar, called the Thrift Savings \nPlan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any \nof five different broadly based investment funds. It is time to extend \nthe same security, and choice, and ownership to young Americans.\n  Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is \nto honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So \nmany of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family \nand faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children. \nGovernment is not the source of these values, but government should \nnever undermine them.\n  Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of \nsociety, it\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\nshould not be re-defined by activist judges. For the good of families, \nchildren, and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect \nthe institution of marriage.\n  Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and \nvulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life. Medical research \ncan help us reach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that \nsave lives and help people overcome disabilities--and I thank Congress \nfor doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. To build \na culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always \nserve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit \nof others. We should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I \nwill work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created \nfor experimentation or grown for body parts, and that human life is \nnever bought and sold as a commodity. America will continue to lead the \nworld in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always \nethical.\n  Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a \nduty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As \nPresident, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and \nwomen who understand the role of courts in our democracy, and are well \nqualified to serve on the bench--and I have done so. The Constitution \nalso gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we \nmust never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the \nopportunities of America. Our Government will continue to support \nfaith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now \nwe need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our \ncities, better options than apathy, or gangs, or jail. Tonight I \npropose a 3-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out \nof gangs, and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women \nand rejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader \noutreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches \nand community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports. And \nI am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First \nLady, Laura Bush.\n  Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask \nyou to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention, and \nprovide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we \nupdate this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens \nwith the highest rates of new cases, African-American men and women.\n  Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief \nin equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and \nbackgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In \nAmerica we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a \ncrime he or she did not commit--so we are dramatically expanding the \nuse of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to \nCongress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in \ncapital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have \ncompetent lawyers by their side.\n\n  Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an \nAmerica that is safe from danger, and protected by peace. We will pass \nalong to our children all the freedoms we enjoy--and chief among them \nis freedom from fear.\n  In the three and a half years since September 11th, 2001, we have \ntaken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We have created a new \ndepartment of Government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on \npreventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken \nup terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses \nagainst biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and \ntrained more than a half million first responders. Police and \nfirefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working \nevery day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all.\n  Our Nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the \nenemy abroad, with measures that are determined, successful, and \ncontinuing. The al-Qaida terror network that attacked our country still \nhas leaders--but many of its top commanders have been removed. There \nare still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists--but their \nnumber has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass \ndestruction--but no longer without attention and without consequence. \nOur country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many, \nand intimidate us all--and we will stay on the offensive against them, \nuntil the fight is won.\n  Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror--and \nI thank the Congress for providing our servicemen and women with the \nresources they have needed. During this time of war, we must continue \nto support our military and give them the tools for victory.\n  Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an \ninternational force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries \nhave troops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union \nprovided technical assistance for elections, and NATO is leading a \nmission to help train Iraqi officers. We are cooperating with 60 \ngovernments in the Proliferation Security Initiative, to detect and \nstop the transit of dangerous materials. We are working closely with \ngovernments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear \nambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries have \ncaptured or detained al-Qaida terrorists. In the next 4 years, my \nAdministration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat \nthe dangers of our time.\n  In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by \neliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of \nmurder. If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in \nhatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror \nwill stalk America and other free nations for decades. The only force \npowerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror, and replace \nhatred with hope, is the force of human freedom. Our enemies know this, \nand that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he \ncalled the ``evil principle'' of democracy. And we have declared our \nown intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support \ndemocratic movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate \ngoal of ending tyranny in our world.\n  The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose \nour form of Government on anyone else. That is one of the main \ndifferences between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand \nan empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-\nappointed rulers control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to \nbuild and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with \ngovernments that answer to their citizens, and reflect their own \ncultures. And because democracies respect their own people and their \nneighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace.\n  That advance has great momentum in our time--shown by women voting in \nAfghanistan, and palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people \nof Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president. \nWe are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. And in the \ncoming years, we will add to that story.\n  The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories \nare showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and \nfailure. Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip \nthat will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime \nMinister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discuss with them how we \nand our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build \nthe institutions of a peaceful, independent democratic state. To \npromote this democracy, I will ask Congress for 350 million dollars to \nsupport Palestinian political, economic, and security reforms. The goal \nof two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in \npeace is within reach--and America will help them achieve that goal.\n  To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United \nStates will work with our friends in the region to fight the common \nthreat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. \nHopeful reform is already\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\ntaking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The government \nof Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region \nby expanding the role of its people in determining their future. And \nthe great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace \nin the Middle East, can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle \nEast.\n\n  To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes \nthat continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. \nSyria still allows its territory, and parts of Lebanon, to be used by \nterrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region. You \nhave passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act--and we \nexpect the Syrian government to end all support for terror and open the \ndoor to freedom. Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor \nof terror--pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the \nfreedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European allies to \nmake clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranim \nenrichment program and any plutonium re-processing, and end its support \nfor terror. And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for \nyour own liberty, America stands with you.\n  Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in \nthe Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country \nis a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have \nchosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting \nterrorists in Iraq, so we do not have to face them here at home. And \nthe victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on \nterror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring \nmore hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a \nterrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.\n  We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty--as \nthey showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, \nmillions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to \nrepresent them in a new Transitional National Assembly. A young woman \nin Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day, \nand wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She said, ``hearing \nthose explosions, it occurred to me--the insurgents are weak, they are \nafraid of democracy, they are losing. . . . So I got my husband, and I \ngot my parents, and we all came out and voted together.'' Americans \nrecognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, \ncasting your vote is an act of civic responsibility; for millions of \nIraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they have earned \nthe respect of us all.\n  One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia \nTaleb al-Suhail. She says of her country, ``we were occupied for 35 \nyears by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. . . . Thank you \nto the American people who paid the cost . . . but most of all to the \nsoldiers.'' Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by \nSaddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was \nfinally able to vote for the leaders of her country--and we are honored \nthat she is with us tonight.\n  The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy, and \nwill continue to attack it. Yet the terrorists' most powerful myth is \nbeing destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and \nassassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to \ndestroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole \nworld now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the \nwill of the Iraqi people.\n  We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for \ntheir own freedom, and to write their own history. As Prime Minister \nAllawi said in his speech to Congress last September, ``Ordinary Iraqis \nare anxious . . . to shoulder all the security burdens of our country \nas quickly as possible.'' This is the natural desire of an independent \nnation, and it also is the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq. The \nnew political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that \ncountry. At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground, and in \nconsultation with the Iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our \nefforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security. forces--forces \nwith skilled officers, and an effective command structure. As those \nforces become more self-reliant and take on greater security \nresponsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly \nbe in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend \ntheir own country--and we will help that proud, new nation secure its \nliberty.\n  Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, ``Tell America not \nto abandon us.'' He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military \nstrategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and \nunchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and \nfreedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come. We \nwill not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that \nwould embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us \nout. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: A country that is democratic, \nrepresentative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able \nto defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women \nserving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned.\n  Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the \nworld, often taking great risks on my orders. We have given them \ntraining and equipment; and they have given us an example of idealism \nand character that makes every American proud. The volunteers of our \nmilitary are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in \nhonor and decency, and every day they are making our Nation more \nsecure. Some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible \ninjuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to help \nthem recover. And we have said farewell to some very good men and \nwomen, who died for our freedom, and whose memory this Nation will \nhonor forever.\n\n  One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of \nPflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His \nmom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a \nMarine, and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. \nShe wrote, ``When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to \nprotect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said: \n`You've done your job, mom. Now it's my turn to protect you.' '' Ladies \nand gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders, and \nour military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant \nNorwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood.\n  In these 4 years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. \nWe have known times of sorrow, and hours of uncertainty, and days of \nvictory. In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen \nthreads of purpose that unite us. The attack on freedom in our world \nhas reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change, the world. \nWe are all part of a great venture: To extend the promise of freedom in \nour country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to \nspread the peace that freedom brings.\n  As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, ``each age is a dream \nthat is dying, or one that is coming to birth.'' And we live in the \ncountry where the biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was \nonly a dream--until it was fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from \nfascism was only a dream--until it was achieved. The fall of imperial \ncommunism was only a dream--until, one day, it was accomplished. Our \ngeneration has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with \nconfidence. The road of Providence is uneven and unpredictable--yet we \nknow where it leads: It leads to freedom.\n  Thank you, and may God bless America.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide \ngrant eligibility for a State that adopts a program for the impoundment \nof vehicles operated by persons while under the influence of alcohol; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this legislation addresses the serious \nnational problem of drunk driving by helping to ensure that when \ndrunken drivers are arrested, they can't simply get back into their car \nand put the lives of others in jeopardy. This is based on original \nlegislation, known as ``John's Law,'' that I introduced in the Senate \nin the 108th Congress and that has already been enacted at the State \nlevel in New Jersey. I am proud that Senator Lautenberg will be co-\nsponsoring this legislation.\n  On July 22, 2000, Navy Ensign John Elliott was driving home from the \nUnited States Naval Academy in Annapolis for his mother's birthday when \nhis car was struck by another car. Both Ensign Elliott and the driver \nof that car were killed. The driver of the car that caused the \ncollision had a blood alcohol level that exceeded twice the legal \nlimit.\n  What makes this tragedy especially distressing is that this same \ndriver had been arrested and charged with driving under the influence \nof alcohol, DUI, just three hours before the crash. After being \nprocessed for that offense, he had been released into the custody of a \nfriend who drove him back to his car and allowed him to get behind the \nwheel, with tragic results.\n  We need to ensure that drunken drivers do not get back behind the \nwheel before they sober up. With this legislation, States would be \nallowed to use some of their drunk driver prevention grant money from \nthe Federal Government to impound the vehicles of drunk drivers for no \nless than 12 hours. This would help ensure that a drunk driver cannot \nget back behind the wheel until he is sober. And that would make our \nroads safer, and prevent the loss of many innocent lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``John's Law of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ALCOHOL-IMPAIRED DRIVING COUNTERMEASURES.\n\n       Section 410(b)(1) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(H) Program for impoundment of vehicles.--A program to \n     impound a vehicle for no less than 12 hours that is operated \n     by a person who is arrested for operating the vehicle while \n     under the influence of alcohol.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 258. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to enhance \nresearch, training, and health information dissemination with respect \nto urologic diseases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise along with Senator Dodd to \nintroduce the Training and Research in Urology Act--also known as the \nTRU Act. During my career in the U.S. Senate, I have supported the \nsuccessful effort to double National Institutes of Health (NIH) \nresearch funding and have provided a strong voice for our children. \nThis bill complements these past and continued efforts. It helps \nprovide urologic scientists with the tools they need to find new cures \nfor the many debilitating urologic diseases impacting men, women, and \nchildren. This legislation is important to my home state of Ohio and \nwould impact many families in Ohio and nationwide who are afflicted \nwith urologic diseases.\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\n  Ohio is a leader in urologic research. Researchers at the Children's \nHospital of Cincinnati, the Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve, and \nOhio State University have made great strides toward achieving \ntreatments. The fact is that urologic conditions affect millions of \nchildren and adults. Urology is a physiological system distinct from \nother body systems. Urologic conditions include incontinence, \ninfertility, and impotence--all of which are extremely common, yet \nserious and debilitating. As many as 10 million children--more than \n30,000 in Ohio--are affected by urinary tract problems, and some forms \nof these problems can be deadly. At least half of all diabetics have \nbladder dysfunctions, which can include urinary retention, changes in \nbladder compliance, and incontinence. Interstitial Cystitis (IC), a \npainful bladder syndrome, affects 200,000 people, mostly women. There \nare no known causes or cures, and few minimally effective treatments. \nAdditionally, there are 7 million urinary tract infections in the \nUnited States each year.\n  Incontinence costs the healthcare system $25 billion each year and is \na leading reason people are forced to enter nursing homes, impacting \nMedicare and Medicaid costs. Urinary tract infection treatment costs \ntotal more than $1 billion each year. Many urologic diseases, \nincontinence, erectile dysfunction, and cancer, increase in aging \npopulations. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, \nand African-American men are at a greater risk for the disease. \nMedicare beneficiaries suffer from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), \nwhich results in bladder dysfunction and urinary frequency. Fifty \npercent of men at age 60 have BPH. Treatment and surgery cost $2 \nbillion per year.\n  Research for urologic disorders has failed to keep pace. Further \ndelay translates into increased costs--in dollars, in needless \nsuffering, and in the loss of human dignity. Incontinence costs the \nhealthcare system $23 billion each year, yet only 90 cents per patient \nis spent on research--little more than the cost of a single adult \nundergarment. In 2002, only $5 million of the $88 million in new \ninitiatives from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and \nKidney Diseases (NIDDK) was designated to urologic diseases and \nconditions. Of that $5 million, no new initiatives were announced for \nwomen's urologic health problems. In 2001, we spent less than five \ncents per child on research into pediatric urologic problems. The \nmedications currently used are very expensive and have unknown, long-\nterm side effects.\n  The TRU Act establishes a Division of Urology at the NIDDK--the home \nof the urology basic science program--and expands existing research \nmechanisms, like the successful George O'Brien Urology Research \nCenters. This will give NIH new opportunities for investment in efforts \nto combat and vanquish these diseases.\n  This legislation is necessary to elevate leadership in urology \nresearch at the NIDDK. When the Institute was created in its current \nform nearly 20 years ago, Congress specifically provided for three \nseparate Division Directors. Regrettably, the current statute fails to \nprovide the NIDDK with the flexibility to create additional Division \nDirectors when necessary to better respond to current scientific \nopportunities. This prescriptive statutory language is unique to the \nNIDDK. For example, the National Cancer Institute and the National \nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute do not have any statutory language \nregarding Division Directors.\n  Mr. President, the basic science breakthroughs of the last decade are \nliterally passing urology by. A greater focus on urological diseases is \nneeded at the NIDDK and will be best accomplished with senior \nleadership with expertise in urology as provided in the TRU Act. This \nlegislation is supported by the Coalition for Urologic Research & \nEducation (CURE)--a group representing tens of thousands of patients, \nresearchers and healthcare providers. I urge my colleagues to join me \nas co-sponsors of the TRU Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague, \nSenator Mike DeWine, in introducing the Training and Research in \nUrology Act--the ``TRU'' Act. Each day, millions of American men, women \nand children suffer with urologic conditions--children suffering from \nurological abnormalities, women living with painful urologic illnesses, \nthe elderly for whom urologic conditions can present a wide variety of \nvery serious health problems. The silent struggle of patients with \nurologic diseases has gone on too long. The legislation we introduce \ntoday seeks to ease the burden of millions of Americans suffering from \nurologic illnesses.\n  The amazing breakthroughs of the last decade in basic science have \nresulted in new treatments and even cures for some urologic conditions. \nUnfortunately, these exciting advancements often fail to reach many who \nsuffer from urologic diseases. It is time to change the way we think \nand deal with urologic disease.\n  The TRU Act will create a new urology-specific division at the \nNational Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases, NIDDK. \nSenior urology leadership at NIDDK will assure that urology receives \nadequate attention and will allow science to drive the research agenda. \nFederal legislation is necessary because more than 20 years ago \nCongress established the current three divisions within NIDDK. Unlike \nthe other institutes at NIH, the director does not have the authority \nto establish new divisions when warranted. Urologic discoveries have \nadvanced the science over the past two decades and I believe a urology \ndivision at NIDDK will assure continued progress in urology research.\n  I was surprised to learn that the most frequently occurring birth \ndefects are related to urologic conditions. In fact, Spina Bifida alone \naffects approximately 4,000 newborns in the United States each year. \nThe Spina Bifida Association of America informed me that those living \n``with Spina Bifida often refer to the complications associated with \nneurogenic bowel and bladder as the most difficult for them both \nphysically and socially. ``\n  The TRU Act would also charge NIDDK with creating a national urologic \nresearch plan and create an additional 10 centers for the study of \nurologic diseases, as well as recruit and retain talented investigators \nthrough a loan repayment program.\n  In Connecticut, as in many states, there is important urologic \nresearch being conducted currently. Researchers at Yale University have \nmade great strides toward achieving treatments of benefit to all \nAmericans. For example, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, BPH, commonly \nreferred as an enlarged prostate, impacts more than 125,000 men in \nConnecticut and more than 50 percent of men 60 years of age and older. \nBPH is the second most common kidney or urologic condition requiring \nhospitalization and the fifth leading reason for physician visits. Yale \nUniversity's Dr. Harris Foster, Jr. is studying the use of phytotherapy \nto relieve lower urinary tract symptoms, particularly BPH. The research \nsupported by the TRU Act will support this and other important urologic \nresearch initiatives nationwide.\n  The TRU Act is supported by the Spina Bifida Association of America \nand the Urology Section of the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well \nas the Coalition for Urologic Research and Education, CURE, a group \nrepresenting hundreds of thousands of patients, researchers and \nhealthcare providers, including the Men's Health Network and the \nSociety for Women's Health Research.\n  The TRU Act will lead urology research and training into the 21st \ncentury, and more important, it will lead to better the lives of \nmillions of patients, young and old, struggling to live with urologic \ndiseases. Therefore, I join my colleague in supporting this worthy \nmeasure and urge all of my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 260. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \ntechnical and financial assistance to private landowners to restore, \nenhance, and manage private land to improve fish and wildlife habitats \nthrough the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Partners for \nFish and Wildlife Act.\n  On August 26, 2004, President Bush signed Executive Order 13352 \npromoting a new approach to conservation within the Federal \ngovernment's conservation and environmental departments. This Executive \nOrder was offered to ensure that Federal agencies pursue cooperative \nconservation actions designed to involve private landowners rather than \nsimply making mandates which private landowners must fulfill.\n  An example of this new cooperative conservation is the Partners for \nFish and Wildlife Program. Since 1987, the Partners Program has been a \nsuccessful voluntary partnership program that helps private landowners \nrestore fish and wildlife habitat on their own lands.\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\nThrough 33,103 agreements with private landowners, the Partners Program \nhas accomplished the restoration of 677,000 acres of wetlands, \n1,253,700 acres of prairies and native grasslands, and 5,560 miles of \nriparian and in-stream habitat. Partners Program agreements are funded \nthrough contributions from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service along \nwith cash and in-kind contributions from participating private \nlandowners. Since 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has provided \n$3,511,121 to restore habitat in Oklahoma through the Partners Program, \nto which private landowners have contributed $12,638,272.\n  In Oklahoma, 97 percent of land is held in private ownership. Since \n1990, a total of 124,285 acres in Oklahoma has been restored through \n700 individual Partners Program voluntary agreements with private \nlandowners. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service District Office in Tulsa \ncurrently reports that at least another 100 private landowners are \nwaiting to enter into Partner's projects as soon as funds become \navailable.\n  As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, a \nnew approach to conservation is especially important to me. All \nconservation programs should create positive incentives to protect \nspecies and, above all, should hold sacred the rights of private \nlandowners. A positive step toward those aims is authorization of the \nPartners for Fish and Wildlife Program which has already proven to be \nan effective habitat conservation program that leverages federal funds \nand utilizes voluntary private landowner participation. To date, the \nPartners Program has received little attention. My bill will build on \nthis successful program to provide additional funding and added \nstability.\n  I am pleased to author legislation to authorize a program with a \nproven record in positive and actual conservation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 262. A bill to authorize appropriations to the Secretary of \nInterior for the restoration of the Angel Island Immigration Station in \nthe State of California; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Angel \nIsland Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act, with \nSenator Boxer as an original cosponsor.\n  This legislation authorizes the use of up to $15 million in Federal \nfunds for ongoing efforts to restore and preserve the Angel Island \nImmigration Station located on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay.\n  I understand that Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey is introducing similar \nlegislation in the House. In the 108th Congress, Congresswoman \nWoolsey's Angel Island bill passed the House.\n  The Angel Island Immigration Station is an important piece of \nAmerican history, especially to our Nation's Asian American and \nimmigrant communities.\n  From the mid 19th to early 20th century, millions of people came to \nAmerica in pursuit of the American dream. Most people are familiar with \nEllis Island and the stories of immigrants coming to America and seeing \nthe Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, but often forgotten are the \nexperiences of those who made it to America through the West Coast by \nway of Angel Island. Just like those who came through Ellis Island, \nthere are many stories of triumph and tribulation associated with Angel \nIsland.\n  However, for the Chinese and those from other Asian countries who \ncame through Angel Island Immigration Station the story goes a bit \nfurther.\n  The economic downturn in the 1870s brought political pressures to \ndeal with the increasing population of Chinese who risked everything to \ntravel to ``Gold Mountain'' in search of a better life. Amongst the \nharshest of measures taken was the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act \nof 1882, the only legislation enacted by Congress to ban a specific \nethnic population from entry into the United States.\n  To enforce this new law and subsequent legislation which excluded \nmost Asian immigrants to this country, the Angel Island Immigration \nStation was established in 1910.\n  After a difficult journey across the Pacific Ocean, many new arrivals \nwere brought to the Station where they faced separation from their \nfamily, embarrassing medical examinations, grueling interrogations and \nlong detainments that lasted months, even years, in living deplorable \nconditions.\n  Testaments to these experiences can be found today on the wooden \nwalls of the barracks. Many of the detainees told their stories through \npoems that they carved on the barrack walls. Using allegories and \nhistorical references, they described their aspirations for coming to \nAmerica as well as expressed their anger and sadness at the treatment \nthey received. However, this experience did not break the spirit of \nthese new courageous immigrants. They endured and established new roots \nand made immeasurable contributions to this nation.\n  The Station was closed in 1940 and three years later Congress \nrepealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. For the next 20 years the Station \nremained mostly unused except for a short term during World War II, \nwhen it was used as a prisoner of war camp.\n  In 1963, Angel Island became a State park and the California \nDepartment of Parks and Recreation assumed stewardship of the \nImmigration Station.\n  In the late 1990's, the Station was a declared a National Historic \nLandmark and named on ``America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.'' \nIn 1998, Congress approved $300,000 to conduct a study to determine the \nfeasibility and desirability of preserving sites within the Golden Gate \nNational Recreation Area (GGNRA) which includes the Immigration \nStation. As a result, a historic three-party agreement was created \nbetween the National Park Service, California Department of Parks and \nthe Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation to conduct this study. \nIn 2000, Save America's Treasures named the Angel Island Immigration \nStation one of its Official Projects and provided $500,000 for the \npreservation of poems carved into the walls.\n  The Station is supported by the people of California as well as \nnumerous private interests. The voters of California voted in 2000 to \nset aside $15 million for restoration of the Station through \nProposition 12 and in addition approximately $1.1 million in private \nfunds has been raised so far. Most recently, in December 2004, the \nCalifornia Cultural and Historical Endowment Board voted to reserve $3 \nmillion pending further staff findings for the Immigration Station.\n  The legislation limits Federal funding to 50 percent the total funds \nfrom all sources spent to restore the Angel Island Immigration Station. \nThe remaining money will be provided through State bond funding and \nraised through private means, making this a true public private \npartnership.\n  Today, approximately 200,000 visits are made each year to Angel \nIsland by ferry from San Francisco, Tiburon and Alameda. In addition, \n60,000 visits are made to the Immigration Station, about half of which \nare students on guided tours.\n  The resources secured so far have set in motion designing, planning \nand initial restoration efforts of the Immigration Station but much \nmore is needed, particularly to save the Immigration Station Hospital \nbuilding, which is deteriorating.\n  The bill I am introducing today will authorize $15 million in Federal \nfunding to complete the restoration of the Angel Island Immigration \nStation so the stories of these early Americans who courageously \nendured the experience at the Angel Island Immigration Station will be \npreserved for future generations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Angel Island Immigration \n     Station Restoration and Preservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Angel Island Immigration Station, also known as the \n     Ellis Island of the West, is a National Historic Landmark.\n       (2) Between 1910 and 1940, the Angel Island Immigration \n     Station processed more than\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\n     1,000,000 immigrants and emigrants from around the world.\n       (3) The Angel Island Immigration Station contributes \n     greatly to our understanding of our Nation's rich and complex \n     immigration history.\n       (4) The Angel Island Immigration Station was built to \n     enforce the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and subsequent \n     immigration laws, which unfairly and severely restricted \n     Asian immigration.\n       (5) During their detention at the Angel Island Immigration \n     Station, Chinese detainees carved poems into the walls of the \n     detention barracks. More than 140 poems remain today, \n     representing the unique voices of immigrants awaiting entry \n     to this country.\n       (6) More than 50,000 people, including 30,000 \n     schoolchildren, visit the Angel Island Immigration Station \n     annually to learn more about the experience of immigrants who \n     have traveled to our shores.\n       (7) The restoration of the Angel Island Immigration Station \n     and the preservation of the writings and drawings at the \n     Angel Island Immigration Station will ensure that future \n     generations also have the benefit of experiencing and \n     appreciating this great symbol of the perseverance of the \n     immigrant spirit, and of the diversity of this great Nation.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESTORATION.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior \n     $15,000,000 for restoring the Angel Island Immigration \n     Station in the San Francisco Bay, in coordination with the \n     Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation and the \n     California Department of Parks and Recreation.\n       (b) Federal Funding.--Federal funding under this Act shall \n     not exceed 50 percent of the total funds from all sources \n     spent to restore the Angel Island Immigration Station.\n       (c) Priority.--(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     funds appropriated pursuant to this Act shall be used for the \n     restoration of the Immigration Station Hospital on Angel \n     Island.\n       (2) Any remaining funds in excess of the amount required to \n     carry out paragraph (1) shall be used solely for the \n     restoration of the Angel Island Immigration Station.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 263. A bill to provide for the protection of paleontological \nresources on Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nPaleontological Resources Preservation Act to protect and preserve the \nNation's important fossil record for the benefit of our citizens. I am \npleased to have Senators Baucus, Feinstein, Durbin, Roberts, and Inouye \njoin me as original cosponsors on this significant legislation.\n  This bill was reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, and approved by unanimous consent during the \n108th Congress. A similar bill was introduced in the other body by \nRepresentative James R. McGovern, with 15 cosponsors, but was not \nreported by the Resources Committee. I hope we can pass this again \nquickly in the Senate and move the bill in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  You may remember that in 1999, Congress requested that the Secretary \nof the Interior review and report on the Federal policy concerning \npaleontological resources on Federal lands. In its request, Congress \nnoted that no unified Federal policy existed regarding the--treatment \nof fossils by Federal land management agencies, and emphasized \nCongress's concerns that a lack of appropriate standards would lead to \nthe deterioration or loss of fossils, which are valuable scientific \nresources. Unfortunately, that situation remains the case today.\n  In the past year alone, there have been compelling finds of fossils \nthat are helping us unlock the mysteries of the past from the earth, \nwhether violent tectonic cataclysms or depletion of oxygen in the \noceans and consequent drastic changes in species. The National Parks \nConservation Association NPCA, a bipartisan non-profit organization \ndedicated to protecting and enhancing National Parks, recently called \nfor ``stronger laws, better enforcement, and better education programs \n. . . to more fully protect these valuable [fossil] relics.'' In its \nFall 2004 issue of National Parks, the article described the discovery \nat Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, in July 2003, of fossilized \nremains of a 5-foot tall hornless rhinoceros, a collie-sized horse, and \na foot-tall, deer-like mammal.\n  National Parks are the home of many extraordinary fossil discoveries \nalready, such as the graveyards of 20-million-year old camels and \nrhinos at Agate Fossil Beds National Monument in Nebraska, the only \npygmy island-dwelling mammoth at Channel Islands National Park in \nCalifornia; and tropical dinosaurs in what are now the arid lands of \nthe Painted Desert of southern Arizona.\n  Besides the National Park Service, other Federal land management \nagencies have a number of regulations and directives on paleontological \nresources, but they are not consistent and there is no clear statutory \nlanguage providing direction in protecting and curating fossils. I \nwould like to commend to my colleagues two reports recently published \nby the Congressional Research Service, CRS, which we know as an \nimpartial, non-partisan legislative research service that provides \nanalysis for Congress. The CRS American Law Division published two \nreports entitled ``Federal Management and Protection of Fossil \nResources on Federal Lands'' and, ``Paleontological Resources \nProtection Act: Proposal for the Management and Protection of Fossil \nResources Located on Federal Lands.''\n  These two reports analyze the status and activities of Federal \nagencies with paleontological responsibilities, the statutory \nauthorities for fossils, the case law supporting them, and the bills \nrecently introduced on fossils such as S. 546 in the 108th Congress. \nThe reports point out that several Federal agencies have management \nauthority for the protection of fossil resources on the lands under \ntheir jurisdiction--the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land \nManagement, Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service, and \nNational Park Service, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's U.S. \nForest Service. The report also points out that the U.S. Geological \nSurvey, Department of Defense, and Smithsonian Institution have some \nfossil responsibilities. The reports further find that agency \nenforcement and prosecution policies differ greatly and there is only \nlimited and scattered authority for Federal management and protection \nof fossil resources on Federal lands.\n\n  The report concludes that the scattered authorities result in case \nlaw on fossil protection that is not well developed and not necessarily \nconsistent. The cases do not provide clear case precedent and are not \nnecessarily applicable to broader protection, regulation, management, \nand marketing issues.\n  Both reports conclude that there is an absence of uniform regulations \nfor paleontological resources on Federal lands--as shown by an absence \nof precise uniform definitions of key terms--and that there is no \ncomprehensive statute or management policy for the protection and \nmanagement of fossils on Federal lands.\n  The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act embodies the \nprinciples recommended by an interagency group in a 2000 report to \nCongress entitled ``Assessment of Fossil Management on Federal and \nIndian Lands.'' The bill provides the paleontological equivalent of \nprotections found in the Archaeological Resources Preservation Act. The \nbill finds that fossil resources on Federal lands are an irreplaceable \npart of the heritage of the United States and affirms that reasonable \naccess to fossil resources should be provided for scientific, \neducational, and recreational purposes. The bill acknowledges the value \nof amateur collecting and provides an exception for casual collecting \nof invertebrate fossils, but protects vertebrate fossils found on \nFederal lands under a system of permits. The fossil bill does not \nrestrict access of the interested public to fossils on public lands but \nrather will help create opportunities for involvement. For example, \nthere are many amateur paleontologists volunteering to assist in the \nexcavation and curation of fossils on national park lands already.\n  Finally, I would like to emphasize that this bill in no way affects \narchaeological or cultural resources under the Archaeological Resources \nProtection Act of 1979 or the Native American Graves Protection and \nRehabilitation Act. They are exempted because they are very different \ntypes of resources This bill covers only paleontological remains--\nfossils on Federal lands.\n  As we look toward the future, public access to fossil resources will \ntake on a new meaning, as digital images of fossils become available \nworldwide. Discoveries in paleontology are made\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\nmore frequently than we realize. They shape how we learn about the \nworld around us. In January of this year, Science Express, the on-line \nversion of the journal Science, reported two studies using \npaleontological data to understand the causes of the ``Great Dying,'' \nor mass extinctions that occurred about 250 million years ago in the \nPermian-Triassic period. The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act \nwould create a legacy for the production of scientific knowledge for \nfuture generations.\n  The protections offered in this act are not new. Federal land \nmanagement agencies already have individual regulations prohibiting \ntheft of government property. However, the reality is that U.S. \nattorneys are reluctant to prosecute cases involving fossil theft \nbecause they are difficult. The National Park Service reported 721 \nincidents of vandalism; and visitors annually take up to 12 tons of \npetrified wood from Petrified Forest National Park, a fact that has \nlead the NPCA to place the Petrified National Forest on its ``Ten Most \nEndangered National Parks'' lists in 2000 and 2001.\n  Congress has not provided a clear statute stating the value of \npaleontological resources to our Nation, as has been provided for \narchaeological resources. Fossils are too valuable to be left within \nthe general theft provisions that are difficult to prosecute, and they \nare too valuable to the education of our children not to ensure public \naccess. We need to work together to make sure that we fulfill our \nresponsibility as stewards of public lands, and as protectors of our \nNation's natural resources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 263\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paleontological Resources \n     Preservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Casual collecting.--The term ``casual collecting'' \n     means the collecting of a reasonable amount of common \n     invertebrate and plant paleontological resources for non-\n     commercial personal use, either by surface collection or the \n     use of non-powered hand tools resulting in only negligible \n     disturbance to the Earth's surface and other resources. As \n     used in this paragraph, the terms ``reasonable amount'', \n     ``common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources'' \n     and ``negligible disturbance'' shall be determined by the \n     Secretary.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior with respect to lands controlled or \n     administered by the Secretary of the Interior or the \n     Secretary of Agriculture with respect to National Forest \n     System Lands controlled or administered by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n       (3) Federal lands.--The term ``Federal lands'' means--\n       (A) lands controlled or administered by the Secretary of \n     the Interior, except Indian lands; or\n       (B) National Forest System lands controlled or administered \n     by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (4) Indian lands.--The term ``Indian Land'' means lands of \n     Indian tribes, or Indian individuals, which are either held \n     in trust by the United States or subject to a restriction \n     against alienation imposed by the United States.\n       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means the fifty States, the \n     District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and \n     any other territory or possession of the United States.\n       (6) Paleontological resource.--The term ``paleontological \n     resource'' means any fossilized remains, traces, or imprints \n     of organisms, preserved in or on the earth's crust, that are \n     of paleontological interest and that provide information \n     about the history of life on earth, except that the term does \n     not include--\n       (A) any materials associated with an archaeological \n     resource (as defined in section 3(1) of the Archaeological \n     Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. 470bb(1)); or\n       (B) any cultural item (as defined in section 2 of the \n     Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 3001)).\n\n     SEC. 3.

CIVIL PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Hearing.--A person who violates any prohibition \n     contained in an applicable regulation or permit issued under \n     this Act may be assessed a penalty by the Secretary after the \n     person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing with \n     respect to the violation. Each violation shall be considered \n     a separate offense for purposes of this section.\n       (2) Amount of penalty.--The amount of such penalty assessed \n     under paragraph (1) shall be determined under regulations \n     promulgated pursuant to this Act, taking into account the \n     following factors:\n       (A) The scientific or fair market value, whichever is \n     greater, of the paleontological resource involved, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       (B) The cost of response, restoration, and repair of the \n     resource and the paleontological site involved.\n       (C) Any other factors considered relevant by the Secretary \n     assessing the penalty.\n       (3) Multiple offenses.--In the case of a second or \n     subsequent violation by the same person, the amount of a \n     penalty assessed under paragraph (2) may be doubled.\n       (4) Limitation.--The amount of any penalty assessed under \n     this subsection for any one violation shall not exceed an \n     amount equal to double the cost of response, restoration, and \n     repair of resources and paleontological site damage plus \n     double the scientific or fair market value of resources \n     destroyed or not recovered.\n       (b) Petition for Judicial Review; Collection of Unpaid \n     Assessments.--\n       (1) Judicial review.--Any person against whom an order is \n     issued assessing a penalty under subsection (a) may file a \n     petition for judicial review of the order in the United \n     States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the \n     district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred \n     within the 30-day period beginning on the date the order \n     making the assessment was issued. Upon notice of such filing, \n     the Secretary shall promptly file such a certified copy of \n     the record on which the order was issued.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize certain projects in the State of \nHawaii; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with the senior Senator from \nHawaii to introduce legislation to authorize three important water \nreclamation projects in the State of Hawaii. This legislation, the \nHawaii Water Resources Act of 2005, is identical to legislation \nconsidered in the 108th Congress that passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent on May 19, 2004.\n  Although one usually does not readily associate the State of Hawaii \nas a place with drought problems, Hawaii has been experiencing drought \nconditions since 1998. The Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2005 builds \nupon the Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2000 P.L. 106-566 that \nauthorized the Bureau of Reclamation to survey irrigation and water \ndelivery systems in Hawaii and\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\nidentify new opportunities for reclamation and reuse of water and \nwastewater for agriculture and non-agricultural purposes. While the Act \nresulted in the development of the initial Hawaii Drought Plan in 2000, \nwhich was updated this past year to incorporate comments and \nrecommendations made by the Bureau of Reclamation, more needs to be \ndone.\n  Although Hawaii is just beginning to recover from a multi-year \ndrought, the National Weather Service has indicated that due to a mild \nEl Nino effect in the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii may again experience \nanother period of drought. It is imperative for Hawaii to improve its \nways to reduce consumption of drinking water. The legislation that I am \nintroducing today, the Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2005, will help \nthe State of Hawaii to be proactive by authorizing projects that will \naddress the demand on our freshwater supply, especially on the islands \nof Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii.\n  The legislation authorizes three projects. The first project, in \nHonolulu, will provide reliable potable water through resource \ndiversification to meet existing and future demands, particularly in \nthe Ewa area of Oahu where water demands are outpacing the availability \nof drinking water. The second project, in North Kona, will address the \nissue of effluent being discharged into a temporary disposal sump from \nthe Kealakehe Wastewater Treatment Plant. The project would utilize \nsubsurface wetlands to naturally clean the effluent and convey the \nrecycled water to a number of users. The third project, in Lahaina, \nwill reduce the use of potable water by extending the County of Maui's \nmain recycled water pipeline.\n  The Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2005 will begin the next phase of \nensuring that the State of Hawaii will continue to have a supply of \nfresh drinking water. It is vitally important for the State to begin \nworking on these water reclamation projects and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation which is important to communities in Hawaii.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Talent, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 265. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to add \nrequirements regarding trauma care, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each year, nearly 1 of every 10 Americans \nis injured and requires medical attention. Injuries are the fifth \nleading cause of death in the United States. Trauma kills more people \nbetween the ages of one and 44 than any other disease or illness.\n  While injury prevention programs have greatly reduced death and \ndisability, severe injuries will continue. Given the mass trauma events \nof September 11, 2001 and our Nation's renewed focus on enhancing \ndisaster preparedness, it is critical that the Federal Government \nincrease its commitment to strengthening programs governing trauma care \nsystem planning and development.\n  The direct and indirect cost of injury is estimated to be about $224 \nbillion a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. The death rate from unintentional injury is more than 50 \npercent higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Only one fourth of \nthe U.S. population lives in an area served by a trauma care system. \nStudies of conventional trauma care show that as many as 35 percent of \ntrauma patient deaths could have been prevented if optimal acute care \nhad been available. It is essential that all Americans have access to a \ntrauma system that provides needed care as quickly as possible.\n  Since 1990, Congress has sought to improve care through the Trauma \nCare Systems Planning and Development Act. This Act provides grants for \nplanning, implementing, and developing statewide trauma care systems. \nThis critical program must be reauthorized. Therefore, I am introducing \nbipartisan legislation today, along with Senators Kennedy, Roberts, \nJeffords, Talent, Clinton, and Murray to reauthorize this program.\n  Despite our past investments, one half of the States in the country \nare still without a statewide trauma care system. Clearly we can do \nbetter. We must respond to the goals put forth by the Institute of \nMedicine in 1999--that Congress ``support a greater national commitment \nto, and support of, trauma care systems at the federal, state, and \nlocal levels.''\n  The ``Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act of 2005'', \nreauthorizes this program with several improvements: first, it improves \nthe collection and analysis of trauma patient data with the goal of \nimproving the overall system of care for these patients; second, the \nbill reduces the amount of matching funds that states will have to \nprovide to participate in the program so that we can extend quality \ntrauma care systems across the nation; third, the legislation provides \na self-evaluation mechanism to assist states in assessing and improving \ntheir trauma care systems; fourth, it authorizes the Institute of \nMedicine to study the state of trauma care and trauma research; and \nfinally, it doubles the funding available for this program to allow \nadditional states to participate.\n  I appreciate the support of my co-sponsors. I look forward to working \nwith them, and with Senator Enzi, the Chairman of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, to see this bill passed this \nyear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trauma Care Systems Planning \n     and Development Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Federal Government and State governments have \n     established a history of cooperation in the development, \n     implementation, and monitoring of integrated, comprehensive \n     systems for the provision of emergency medical services.\n       (2) Trauma is the leading cause of death of Americans \n     between the ages of 1 and 44 years and is the third leading \n     cause of death in the general population of the United \n     States.\n       (3) In 1995, the total direct and indirect cost of \n     traumatic injury in the United States was estimated at \n     $260,000,000,000.\n       (4) There are 40,000 fatalities and 5,000,000 nonfatal \n     injuries each year from motor vehicle-related trauma, \n     resulting in an aggregate annual cost of $230,000,000,000 in \n     medical expenses, insurance, lost wages, and property damage.\n       (5) Barriers to the receipt of prompt and appropriate \n     emergency medical services exist in many areas of the United \n     States.\n       (6) The number of deaths from trauma can be reduced by \n     improving the systems for the provision of emergency medical \n     services in the United States.\n       (7) Trauma care systems are an important part of the \n     emergency preparedness system needed for homeland defense.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to stop taxpayer funded Government propaganda; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to put \nan end to the spate of propaganda we are seeing across our government. \nIn my view, it is a practice that is inconsistent with democracy, and \nwe have to put a stop to it.\n  That is why Senator Kennedy and I have drafted the ``Stop Government \nPropaganda Act'' which we are introducing today, along with our \ncosponsors, Senators Durbin, Corzine, Clinton, Dorgan, Murray, Johnson, \nJack Reed, Lieberman and Leahy.\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\n  Our bill will shut down the Administration's propaganda mill once and \nfor all.\n  Propaganda had its place in Saddam's Iraq. Propaganda was a staple of \nthe old Soviet Union. But covert government propaganda has no place in \nthe United States Government.\n  In the last few weeks, we have seen revelations that a number of \nconservative columnists are actually on the Bush Administration's \npayroll to push the President's agenda.\n  Armstrong Williams was paid to improve the image of President Bush's \neducation programs, and the columnists Maggie Gallagher and Mike \nMcManus were paid to promote the President's ``marriage initiative.''\n  Some have called it the ``pundit payola'' scandal. But this scandal \ngoes well beyond these particular payments to journalists.\n  In fact, these secret payments are only the latest in a series of \ncovert propaganda activities conducted by this Administration.\n  Last year, we discovered that the Administration was paying a public \nrelations firm to creat fake television news stories. These fake news \nstories touting the new Medicare law made their way onto local news \nshows on forty television stations across the country.\n  These fake news stories even featured a fake reporter--Karen Ryan \n``reporting from Washington.'' While Karen Ryan does exist, she's not a \nreporter. She is a public relations consultant based here in \nWashington.\n  Worse, the viewers who watched these fake news stories thought they \nwere hearing real news. But what they were watching was Government-\nproduced propaganda.\n  The Government Accountability Office investigated the legality of \nthese fake news stories and came back with a clear decision: it was \nillegal propaganda. The GAO also said that the Administration must \nofficially report the misspent funds to Congress.\n  But the Bush Administration simply ignored GAO's legal ruling. The \nAdministration said that because of the separation of powers, the GAO \ncan't tell them what to do.\n  So, in other words, the Administration has said that they will ignore \nthe current law on the books. That is why we are introducing new \nlegislation today that will put real teeth in the anti-propaganda law.\n  Our bill, the Stop Government Propaganda Act, does two major things:\n  First, it makes the Anti-Propaganda law permanent.\n  Right now, the anti-propaganda law is passed year to year as a \n``rider'' in our appropriations bills. Making the law permanent will \nshow that we are serious about it and want it obeyed.\n  Also, our bill has real consequences for violations by the \nAdministration. The current law is enforced by GAO, and the \nAdministration is obviously ignoring their rulings. That has to change.\n  Our bill calls for the Justice Department to pursue these violations. \nBut in cases where DOJ fails to act, our bill authorizes citizen \nlawsuits to enforce the law.\n  And we also give added power to the GAO. Right now, the \nAdministration ignores the GAO's legal decisions. But our bill will \nmake it downright painful for the Administration to ignore the GAO.\n  When the GAO finds that taxpayer funds are misspent for propaganda \npurposes, and the agency fails to follow the GAO's ordered actions, our \nbill would call for the head of that agency's salary to be withheld.\n  Our bill establishes a point of order against any appropriations bill \nthat fails to enforce the salary reduction.\n  Last week, President Bush said he agrees that it is wrong to pay \njournalists and that the practice must stop. But at the same time, the \nBush Administration continues to ignore GAO's rulings on their \npropaganda violations.\n  And while the attention was on Armstrong Williams, the Administration \nhas been ramping up propaganda efforts at the Social Security \nAdministration. In fact, last week, the Democratic Policy Committee \nheard testimony from two Social Security employees who revealed how \nthey are being forced to push the White House agenda on the public.\n  Rather than concentrate on getting benefits out or servicing people \non Social Security, the White House is using SSA employees to spread \nits false propaganda message of a ``crisis'' in Social Security.\n  That is why we must act now to put a stop to all of these practices. \nI urge my colleagues to support our bill, the Stop Government \nPropaganda Act.\n  As we seek to establish democracy in Iraq, let's first remove this \ntaint from our own democracy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 266\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Government Propaganda \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1951, the following prohibition on the use of \n     appropriated funds for propaganda purposes has been enacted \n     annually: ``No part of any appropriation contained in this or \n     any other Act shall be used for publicity or propaganda \n     purposes within the United States not heretofore authorized \n     by Congress.''.\n       (2) On May 19, 2004, the Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO) ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services \n     violated the publicity and propaganda prohibitions by \n     creating fake television new stories for distribution to \n     broadcast stations across the country.\n       (3) On January 4, 2005, the GAO ruled that the Office of \n     National drug Control Policy violated the publicity and \n     propaganda prohibitions by distributing fake television news \n     stories to broadcast stations from 2002 to 2004.\n       (4) In 2003, the Department of Education violated publicity \n     and propaganda prohibitions by using of taxpayer funds to \n     create fake television news stories promoting the ``No Child \n     Left Behind'' program violated the propaganda prohibition.\n       (5) An analysis of individual journalists, paid for by the \n     Department of Education in 2003, which ranked reporters on \n     how positive their articles portrayed the Administration and \n     the Republican Party, constituted a gross violation of the \n     law prohibiting propaganda and the use of taxpayer funds for \n     partisan purposes.\n       (6) The payment of taxpayer funds to journalist Armstrong \n     Williams in 2003 to promote Administration education policies \n     violated the ban on covert propaganda.\n       (7) The payment of taxpayer funds to journalist Maggie \n     Gallagher in 2002 to promote Administration welfare and \n     family policies violated the ban on covert propaganda.\n       (8) Payment for and construction of 8 little red \n     schoolhouse facades at the entranceways to the Department of \n     Education headquarters in Washington, DC to boost the image \n     of the ``No Child Left Behind'' program was an inappropriate \n     use of taxpayer dollars.\n       (9) Messages inserted into Social Security Administration \n     materials in 2004 and 2005 intended to further grassroots \n     lobbying efforts in favor of President Bush's Social Security \n     privatization plan is an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds.\n       (10) The Department of Health and Human Services ignored \n     the Government Accountability Office's legal decision of May \n     19, 2004, and failed to follow the GAO's directive to report \n     its Anti-Deficiency Act violation to Congress and the \n     President, as provided by section 1351 of title 31, United \n     States Code.\n       (11) Despite numerous violations of the propaganda law, the \n     Department of Justice has not acted to enforce the law or \n     follow the requirements of the Anti-Deficiency Act.\n       (12) In order to protect taxpayer funds, stronger measures \n     must be enacted into law to require actual enforcement of the \n     ban on the use of taxpayer funds for propaganda purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``publicity'' or ``propaganda'' \n     includes--\n       (1) a news release or other publication that does not \n     clearly identify the Government agency directly or indirectly \n     (through a contractor) financially responsible for the \n     message;\n       (2) any audio or visual presentation that does not \n     continuously and clearly identify the Government agency \n     directly or indirectly financially responsible for the \n     message;\n       (3) an Internet message that does not continuously and \n     clearly identify the Government agency directly or indirectly \n     financially responsible for the message;\n       (4) any attempt to manipulate the news media by payment to \n     any journalist, reporter, columnist, commentator, editor, or \n     news organization;\n       (5) any message designed to aid a political party or \n     candidate;\n       (6) any message with the purpose of self-aggrandizement or \n     puffery of the Administration, agency, Executive branch \n     programs or policies, or pending congressional legislation;\n       (7) a message of a nature tending to emphasize the \n     importance of the agency or its activities;\n       (8) a message that is so misleading or inaccurate that it \n     constitutes propaganda; and\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\n       (9) the preparation, distribution, or use of any kit, \n     pamphlet, booklet, publication, radio, television, or video \n     presentation designed to support or defeat legislation \n     pending before Congress or any State legislature, except in \n     presentation to Congress or any State legislature itself.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON PUBLICITY OR PROPAGANDA AND \n                   ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The senior official of an Executive branch \n     agency who authorizes or directs funds appropriated to such \n     Executive branch agency for publicity or propaganda purposes \n     within the United States, unless authorized by law, is liable \n     to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not \n     less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000, plus 3 times the \n     amount of funds appropriated.\n       (b) Responsibilities of the Attorney General.--The Attorney \n     General diligently shall investigate a violation of \n     subsection (a). If the Attorney General finds that a person \n     has violated or is violating subsection (a), the Attorney \n     General may bring a civil action under this section against \n     the person.\n       (c) Actions by Private Persons.--\n       (1) In general.--A person may bring a civil action for a \n     violation of subsection (a) for the person and for the United \n     States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of \n     the Government. The action may be dismissed only if the court \n     and the Attorney General give written consent to the \n     dismissal and their reasons for consenting.\n       (2) Notice.--A copy of the complaint and written disclosure \n     of substantially all material evidence and information the \n     person possesses shall be served on the Government pursuant \n     to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The \n     complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal \n     for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the \n     defendant until the court so orders. The Government may elect \n     to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after \n     it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and \n     information.\n       (3) Delay of notice.--The Government may, for good cause \n     shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which \n     the complaint remains under seal under paragraph (2). Any \n     such motions may be supported by affidavits or other \n     submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to \n     respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 \n     days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the \n     defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure.\n       (4) Government action.--Before the expiration of the 60-day \n     period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the \n     Government shall--\n       (A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall \n     be conducted by the Government; or\n       (B) notify the court that it declines to take over the \n     action, in which case the person bringing the action shall \n     have the right to conduct the action.\n       (5) Limited intervention.--When a person brings an action \n     under this subsection, no person other than the Government \n     may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts \n     underlying the pending action.\n       (d) Rights of the Parties.--\n       (1) Government action.--If the Government proceeds with the \n     action, it shall have the primary responsibility for \n     prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of \n     the person bringing the action. Such person shall have the \n     right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the \n     limitations set forth in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Limitations.--\n       (A) Dismissal.--The Government may dismiss the action \n     notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the \n     action if the person has been notified by the Government of \n     the filing of the motion and the court has provided the \n     person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.\n       (B) Settlement.--The Government may settle the action with \n     the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person \n     initiating the action if the court determines, after a \n     hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and \n     reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of \n     good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.\n       (C) Proceedings.--Upon a showing by the Government that \n     unrestricted participation during the course of the \n     litigation by the person initiating the action would \n     interfere with or unduly delay the Government's prosecution \n     of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for \n     purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, \n     impose limitations on the person's participation, such as--\n       (i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;\n       (ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such \n     witnesses;\n       (iii) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; \n     or\n       (iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in \n     the litigation.\n       (D) Limit participation.--Upon a showing by the defendant \n     that unrestricted participation during the course of the \n     litigation by the person initiating the action would be for \n     purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue \n     burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the \n     participation by the person in the litigation.\n       (3) Action by person.--If the Government elects not to \n     proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action \n     shall have the right to conduct the action. If the Government \n     so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings \n     filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all \n     deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a \n     person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting \n     the status and rights of the person initiating the action, \n     may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a \n     later date upon a showing of good cause.\n       (4) Interference.--Whether or not the Government proceeds \n     with the action, upon a showing by the Government that \n     certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the \n     action would interfere with the Government's investigation or \n     prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the \n     same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of \n     not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in \n     camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further \n     showing in camera that the Government has pursued the \n     criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with \n     reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil \n     action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil \n     investigation or proceedings.\n       (5) Government action.--Notwithstanding subsection (b), the \n     Government may elect to pursue its claim through any \n     alternate remedy available to the Government, including any \n     administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. \n     If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another \n     proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the \n     same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had \n     if the action had continued under this section. Any finding \n     of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding \n     that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to \n     an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding \n     sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been \n     finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the \n     United States, if all time for filing such an appeal with \n     respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the \n     finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.\n       (e) Award to Private Plaintiff.--\n       (1) Government action.--If the Government proceeds with an \n     action brought by a person under subsection (c), such person \n     shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, \n     receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of \n     the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, \n     depending upon the extent to which the person substantially \n     contributed to the prosecution of the action.\n       (2) No government action.--If the Government does not \n     proceed with an action under this section, the person \n     bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an \n     amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting \n     the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less \n     than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds \n     of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such \n     proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for \n     reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been \n     necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and \n     costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded \n     against the defendant.\n       (3) Frivolous claim.--If the Government does not proceed \n     with the action and the person bringing the action conducts \n     the action, the court may award to the defendant its \n     reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the defendant \n     prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of \n     the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly \n     vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.\n       (f) Government Not Liable for Certain Expenses.--The \n     Government is not liable for expenses which a person incurs \n     in bringing an action under this section.\n       (g) Fees and Expenses to Prevailing Defendant.--In civil \n     actions brought under this section by the United States, the \n     provisions of section 2412 (d) of title 28 shall apply.\n       (h) Whistleblower Protection.--\n       (1) In general.--Any employee who is discharged, demoted, \n     suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner \n     discriminated against in the terms and conditions of \n     employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done \n     by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in \n     furtherance of an action under this section, including \n     investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or \n     assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this \n     section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make \n     the employee whole.\n       (2) Relief.--Relief under this subsection shall include \n     reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee \n     would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount \n     of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for \n     any special damages sustained as a result of the \n     discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable \n     attorneys' fees.

Mr. President, we have to stop right now all the \ntaxpayer-financed propaganda put out by our government to influence the \nAmerican people. We need to expedite the investigations, begin \ncongressional hearings, and pass specific new legislation to prevent \nthe administration from using persons paid to pose as legitimate \njournalists to push for the Bush political agenda.\n  Last week, we found out, according to the Washington Post, that \nanother commentator, Maggie Gallagher, was paid $21,500 by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to promote the Bush \nadministration's marriage agenda--a fact she didn't disclose to her \nreaders while writing on the issue.\n  As most of us now know, thanks to USA Today, the outgoing leadership \nof the Education Department secretly, and still unapologetically, paid \n$241,000 to commentator Armstrong Williams to influence his broadcasts. \nMr. Williams was paid to comment favorably on the President's No Child \nLeft Behind Act education reform plan, to conduct phony ``interviews'' \nwith administration officials, and to encourage his colleagues in the \nmedia to do the same.\n  The Gallagher and Williams payments were part of a multimillion \ndollar, taxpayer-funded public relations scheme to influence and \nundermine America's free press. Journalists were ranked on the \nfavorability of their news coverage of President Bush on education. \nPhony video reports and interviews about the President's Medicare \nprescription drug law were broadcast as independent news on local \ntelevision.\n  All parties agree that this type of secret government paid journalism \nis wrong. Yet Ms. Gallagher and Mr. Williams continue to retain their \n$21,500 and $241,000 bribes.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Lautenberg, who has been our leader on \nthis issue, in introducing legislation to permanently prohibit the use \nof taxpayer funds for the type of manipulative payments that Ms. \nGallagher and Mr. Williams received. Our legislation will prohibit \nagencies from issuing news releases, video news releases, and internet \nmessages that do not clearly identify the government as financially \nresponsible for the information.\n  It will enforce these prohibitions by creating a mechanism to dock \nthe pay of any Cabinet Secretary or agency head responsible, and by \nauthorizing private citizens to bring a court action to recover \ntaxpayer funds.\n  Propaganda by the Department of Health and Human Services, the \nDepartment of Education, and the Office of Drug Control and Policy has \nto stop now, before the infection spreads. We cannot sit still in \nCongress while the administration corrupts the first amendment and \nfreedom of the press.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Wyden, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 267. A bill to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community \nSelf-Determination Act of 2000, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues and \nfriends, Senator Wyden of Oregon and Senator Feinstein of California, \nto reauthorize a law that has stabilized payments to rural forest \ncounties and, more important, has brought communities together to \naccomplish projects on the ground that improve watersheds and enhance \nhabitat.\n  It should be remembered that the National Forest System was formed in \n1905 from the Forest Reserves, which were established between 1891 and \n1905 by Presidential proclamation. During that time, 153 million acres \nof forestlands were set aside in Forest Reserves and removed from \nfuture settlement and economic development. This imposed great \nhardships on those counties that were in and adjacent to these new \nreserves. In many cases, 65 to 90 percent of the land in a county was \nsequestered in the new forest reserves, leaving little land for \neconomic development and diminishing the potential tax base to support \nessential community infrastructure such as roads and schools. There was \nconsiderable opposition in the forest counties to establishing these \nreserves.\n  In 1908, in response to the mounting opposition to the reserves in \nthe West, Congress passed a bill which created a revenue sharing \nmechanism to offset for forest counties the effects of removing these \nlands from economic development. The 1908 act specified that 10 percent \nof all revenues generated from the multiple-use management of our \nNational Forests would be shared with the counties to support public \nroads and public schools. Several years later that percentage was \nincreased to 25 percent. People in our forest counties refer to this as \nthe ``Compact with the People of Rural Counties'' which was part of the \nfoundation for establishing our National Forest System.\n  It was the intent of Congress in establishing our National Forests, \nthat they would be managed in a sustained multiple-use manner in \nperpetuity, and that they would provide revenues for local counties and \nthe Federal treasury in perpetuity as well. And, from 1908 until about \n1993, this revenue sharing mechanism worked extremely well. However, \nfrom 1986 to the present, we have, for a variety of reasons, reduced \nour sustained active multiple-use management of the National Forests \nand the revenues have declined precipitously. Most counties have seen a \ndecline of more than 85 percent in actual revenues generated on our \nNational Forests and therefore an 85 percent reduction in 25 percent \npayments to counties which are used to help fund schools and county \nroad departments.\n  And more important, they have seen a 60-percent reduction in the \neconomic activity that the federal timber sale programs generated in \nthese counties. The Forest Service in its 1997 TSPIRS report estimates \nthe total economic activity in these rural counties to be more than \n$2.1 billion, compared to more than $5.5 billion as recently as 1991.\n  In 2000, Congress passed the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self \nDetermination Act to address the needs of the National Forest counties \nand to focus on creating a new cooperative partnership between citizens \nin forest counties and our Federal land management agencies to develop \nforest health improvement projects on public lands and simultaneously \nstimulate job development and community economic stability.\n\n  This Act restored the 1908 compact between the people of rural \nAmerica and the Federal Government, and it has been an enormous success \nin achieving and even surpassing the goals of Congress.\n  This is a remarkable success story for rural forest communities. \nThese funds have restored and sustained essential infrastructure such \nas county schools and county roads through title I. Essential forest \nimprovement projects have been completed through title II projects \nfunded by forest counties, and planned by diverse stakeholder resource \nadvisory committees. In Idaho, resource advisory committees are \npartnering with the Forest Service and other organizations to fight the \nspread of weeds on the Nez Perce National Forest, make road \nimprovements in Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, and repair \nculverts and improve fish habitat on the Caribou-Targhee National \nForest.\n  These groups are reducing management gridlock and building \ncollaborative public lands decisionmaking capacity in counties across \nAmerica. These resource advisory committees are a real and working \ncompact between the Federal land management agencies and rural \ncommunities that includes all interest groups; they represent a true \ncoupling of community with land managers that is good for the land and \ngood for the communities.\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\n  Finally, essential services are being supported and developed in \nforest counties by investing title III funds. In Idaho, counties are \nusing the funding as directed for search and rescue operations and \nyouth employment and educational opportunities.\n  The impact of this act over the last few years is positive and \nsubstantial. This law should be extended so it can continue to benefit \nthe forest counties and their schools, and continue to contribute to \nimproving the health of our National Forests.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 267\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my very dear friend \nand colleague, Senator Craig of Idaho, as his principal cosponsor on \nlegislation to reauthorize a law that has spawned a revolution in \nforest dependent communities in 42 States and in over 700 counties \nacross the country. Our bill will reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools \nand Community Self Determination Act of 2000.\n  This bill is short and simple but also extraordinary: it renews the \noriginal law and its programs for 8 more years. It also makes some \ntechnical and grammatical corrections to the original law and adds an \noversight report on some of the projects done under this Act. As we \nintroduce this bill today in the Senate, our friends and colleagues in \nthe House are introducing the exact same bill with the same, bi-\npartisan spirit.\n  The reason we can pursue reauthorization of such a far reaching law \nwith such little language is because the folks that it affects, the \nforest dependent communities, as well as the educators, the county \nleaders and the environmentalists in those communities, have made this \nlaw work. The reason we want to reauthorize this legislation is because \nthese same folks want to continue the work this law allows\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\nthem to do together, on federal and private lands, and in rural \ncommunities.\n  The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of2000 \nis sustaining rural communities as well as encouraging industry and \ncreating jobs based on natural resources. If I may paraphrase a famous \ncommercial to describe this legislation, I'd say:\n  Stabilization of payments to counties for roads and schools--millions \nof dollars; Additional investments and the creation of new jobs through \nforest related projects--thousands of projects; Improving cooperative \nrelationships among the people that use and care for federal lands: \nPriceless.\n  Title I of the Act stabilizes funding for public education in rural \ncommunities. It also fortifies local government budgets that provide \nhealth and safety services in rural America, as well as maintains the \ntransportation corridors that move people and material to and from \nforest communities.\n  Title II of the Act provides resources for community-based \nstewardship for local federal lands. By establishing Resource Advisory \nCommittees, RACs, tasked with reviewing and recommending to the Forest \nService and Bureau of Land Management projects to be completed on \nFederal lands that benefit the community and the federal lands \nassociated with that RAC, this Act has resulted in over a thousand \nprojects making Federal lands more environmentally healthy today than \nbefore this Act passed in 2000. RACs enlist community members \nrepresenting environmental interests, recreations users, farmers, local \nofficials and forest products industry. This collaborative planning of \nmanagement of local Federal lands has put people to work building fish-\nfriendly culverts; reducing hazardous fuel loads; enhancing picnic, \ncamping and hiking facilities; and removing debris and noxious plant \nspecies.\n  The kinds of projects the RACs have supported are varied: watershed \nrestoration and maintenance; wild life habitat restoration; native \nfisheries habitat enhancement; forest health improvements; wild land \nfire hazard reduction; control of noxious weeds; removal of trash and \nillegal dumps; road maintenance and obliteration; trail maintenance and \nobliteration; and campground maintenance.\n  Title III of the Act supports activities protecting federal \ninfrastructure and the forest ecosystem. Fire Planning, emergency \nresponse, law enforcement and search and rescue services make \nfedera1lands safe. They reinforce county government's commitment to the \npartnership between the Federal Government and local communities. These \nfunds are being used to respond to forest fires conduct search and \nrescue missions and improve forest health while teaching at-risk \nchildren and rehabilitating prisoners in prison-work camp programs. \nTitle III projects, like Title II projects, are also helping to develop \ncooperative projects between counties, local, State and Federal \nofficials and agencies.\n  The Act's greatest financial footprint is felt in the West, but \nfinancial benefits flow to counties nationwide. Significant investment \nin Federal lands has taken or will take place: $121 million from Title \nII and $124 million from Title III. At least 1,168 Title II projects \nwere approved during the Act's first two years.\n  Under the reauthorization we are sponsoring the payment amount will \ncontinue to be based on the average of timber receipts for the three \ntop federal land timber production years: FY 1985 through FY 2000. \nCurrently, on lands where there is no harvest and no safety net, the \ncommunities get no money. For those lands, funds will be provided from \nthe general treasury. For others, there would be funds available, first \nfrom receipts but then from the general treasury. Still, for counties \nwhere the status quo is their best source of funds, they could stay \nwith the status quo until they feel the need to use the safety net. No \nlonger will there be an absolute a reliance on receipts, thus \ndecreasing pressure on land managers to produce timber harvest for \nschools and counties. While there is widespread application of the Act, \n86 percent of counties nationwide have opted for the ``stable \npayment;'' under the reauthorization bill, if a county that has been \npart of this Act would like to opt out it may do so. It is only fair to \nallow this, given that the county may have opted in by assuming the law \nwould only last through 2006.\n  Very strong support exists across the nation from stakeholders for \nrenewal of the Act past fiscal year 2006.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me and my colleague across the \naisle on this bi-partisan, bi-cameral effort to renew a law that is \nactually working on the ground.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kohl, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 268. A bill to provide competitive grants for training court \nreporters and closed captioners to meet requirements for realtime \nwriters under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nTraining for Realtime Writers Act of 2005, on behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues, Senators Clinton, Cochran, Kohl, Lautenberg, Leahy, Lugar, \nRockefeller, and Wyden.\n  The 1996 Telecom Act required that all television broadcasts were to \nbe captioned by 2006 and all Spanish language programming was to be \ncaptioned by 2010. This was a much needed reform that has helped \nmillions of deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans to be able to take full \nadvantage of television programming. Sadly, we have yet to meet that \ndemand. It has been estimated that 3,000 captioners are needed to \nfulfill the 2006 mandate, and that number continues to increase as more \nand more broadband stations come online. Unfortunately, the United \nStates has fallen behind in training these individuals. We must jump \nstart training programs to get students in the pipeline and begin to \naddress the need for Spanish language broadcasting.\n  This is an issue that I feel very strongly about because my late \nbrother, Frank, was deaf. I know personally that access to culture, \nnews, and other media was important to him and to others in achieving a \nbetter quality of life. More than 28 million Americans, or 8 percent of \nthe population, are considered deaf or hard of hearing and many require \ncaptioning services to participate in mainstream activities. In 1990, I \nauthored legislation that required all television sets to be equipped \nwith a computer chip to decode closed captioning. This bill completes \nthe promise of that technology, affording deaf and hard of hearing \nAmericans the same equality and access that captioning provides.\n  But let me emphasize that the deaf and hard of hearing population is \nonly one of a number of groups that will benefit from the legislation. \nThe audience for captioning also includes individuals seeking to \nacquire or improve literacy skills, including approximately 27 million \nfunctionally illiterate adults, 3 to 4 million immigrants learning \nEnglish as a second language, and 18 million children learning to read \nin grades kindergarten through 3. I see people using closed captioning \nto stay informed everywhere--from the gym to the airport. Here in the \nSenate, I would wager that many individuals on our staff have the \ncaptioning turned on right now to follow what is happening on the \nSenate floor while they go about conducting the meetings and phone \ncalls that advance legislation. Captioning helps people educate \nthemselves and helps all of us stay informed and entertained when audio \nisn't the most appropriate medium.\n  Although the 2006 deadline is only 23 months away, our nation is \nfacing a serious shortage of captioners. Over the past decade, student \nenrollment in programs that train court reporters to become realtime \nwriters has decreased by 50 percent causing such programs to close on \nmany campuses. Yet the need for these skills continues to rise. In \nfact, the rate of job placement upon graduation nears 100 percent. In \naddition, the majority of closed captioners are independent \ncontractors. They are the small businesses that run the American \neconomy and we should do everything we can to promote the creation and \nsupport of those businesses.\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\n  That is why my colleagues and I are introducing this vital piece of \nlegislation. The Training for Realtime Writers Act of 2005 would \nestablish competitive grants to be used toward training real time \ncaptioners. This is necessary to ensure that we meet our goal set by \nthe 1996 Telecom Act.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee reported this bill unanimously last \nsession, the full Senate has passed this Act without objection twice \nnow, and we stand here today, once again at the beginning of the \nprocess. I ask my colleagues to join us once again in support of this \nlegislation and join us in our effort to win its passage into law. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 268\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide emergency relief to small business concerns \naffected by a significant increase in the price of heating oil, natural \ngas, propane, or kerosene, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, tonight the President will deliver his \nfifth State of the Union address. It is expected that he will, in that \naddress, talk about his plan to expand the ownership of businesses, as \nhe did in his Inaugural Address. As a long-time member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, I hope that the \nadministration will also tend to the needs of small businesses that \nalready exist, in particular those struggling to make ends meet with \nthe record high cost of heating fuels. It could be done very easily by \nmaking those small businesses eligible to apply for low-cost disaster \nloans through the Small Business Administration's Economic Injury \nDisaster Loan Program. And by making small farms and agricultural \nbusinesses eligible for loans through a similar loan program at the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  There has been a bipartisan push for this assistance in Congress \ntwice in the past few years, most recently in November during the \nconsideration of the mega funding bill, the FY2005 Omnibus \nAppropriations Conference Report. It makes no sense that out of 3,000 \npages of legislation and almost $400 billion in spending, the White \nHouse and the Republican leadership, opposing members in their own \nparty, refused to help the little guy. While it would have been most \nhelpful to these businesses--from small heating oil dealers to small \nmanufacturers--to enact the legislation in November when the prices \nwere at an all-time high, we can still be helpful now.\n  In that spirit, together with Senator Reed and 17 of my colleagues, I \nam re-introducing the Small Business and Farm Energy Emergency Relief \nAct. I thank Senators Reed, Dodd, Bingaman, Kohl, Jeffords, Cantwell, \nJohnson, Pryor, Leahy, Levin, Schumer, Lieberman, Clinton, Harkin, \nKennedy, Bayh and Obama. In the past, this assistance has been \nsupported by many Republicans, and I hope they will again cosponsor the \nlegislation. I have reached out to them in hopes that they will once \nagain work in a bipartisan way to help our small businesses. I know the \nheating oil issue is important to Senator Snowe, my colleague and \nchairman of the Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, and I \nlook forward to working with her. I am hopeful that she will cosponsor \nthis bill and agree to take action on it in Committee as soon as \npossible.\n  We have built a very clear record over the years on how this \nlegislation would work and why it is needed. Let me take a few minutes \nto summarize those conclusions. The Small Business and Farm Energy \nEmergency Relief Act of 2005 would provide emergency relief, through \naffordable, low-interest SBA and USDA Disaster loans, to small \nbusinesses adversely affected by, or likely to be adversely affected \nby, significant increases in the prices of four heating fuels--heating \noil, propane, kerosene, and natural gas. This would be helpful, because \nfor those businesses in danger of or already suffering from significant \neconomic injury caused by crippling increases in the costs of heating \nfuel, they need access to capital to mitigate or avoid serious losses. \nHowever, commercial lenders typically won't make loans to these small \nbusinesses because they often don't have the increased cash flow to \ndemonstrate the ability to repay the loan.\n  Economic injury disaster loans give affected small businesses \nnecessary working capital until normal operations resume, or until they \ncan restructure or change the business to address the market changes. \nThese are direct loans, made through the SBA, with interest rates of 4 \npercent or less. The SBA tailors the repayment of each economic injury \ndisaster loan to each borrower's financial capability, enabling them to \navoid the robbing Peter to pay Paul syndrome, as they juggle bills.\n  In practical terms, SBA considers economic injury to be when a small \nbusiness is unable, or likely to be unable, to meet its obligations as \nthey mature or to pay its ordinary and necessary operating expenses. To \nbe eligible to apply for an economic injury loan,\n  you must be a small business that has been the victim of some kind of \ndisaster,\n  you must have used all reasonably available funds,\n  and you must be unable to obtain credit elsewhere.\n  Under this program, the disaster must be declared by the President, \nthe SBA Administrator, or a governor at the discretion of the \nAdministrator. Small businesses will have nine months to apply from \nOctober 1, 2004 or, for future disasters, from the day a disaster is \ndeclared.\n  This bill differs from the legislation we put forward in 2001 in that \nit uses a different trigger to define a disaster. For this legislation, \nSenator Reed worked closely with the Department of Energy to identify \nwhat would be considered extreme price jumps in the heating fuels of \nheating oil, natural gas, and propane. Therefore, the assistance under \nthis bill would become available when the price jumps 40 percent, when \ncompared to the same period for the two previous years, when absorbing \nthe cost becomes nearly impossible.\n  Mr. President, I again ask that my colleagues get behind this bill \nand make it law as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of a bipartisan letter of support, a copy of the cosponsors from \nthe 107th Congress, and a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 16, 2004.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, \n         State, and the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Fritz F. Hollings,\n     Ranking Member, Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \n         Justice, State, and the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Stevens, Byrd, Gregg and Hollings: We are \n     writing to request you include a provision in the fiscal year \n     2005 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report to make heating \n     oil distributors and other small businesses harmed by \n     substantial increases in energy prices eligible for Small \n     Business Administration (SBA) disaster loans. Many small \n     businesses are being adversely affected by the substantial \n     increases in the prices of heating oil, propane, kerosene and \n     natural gas. The recent volatile and substantial increases in \n     the cost of these fuels is placing a tremendous burden on the \n     financial resources of small businesses, which typically have \n     small cash flows and narrow operating margins.\n       Heating oil and propane distributors, in particular, are \n     being impacted. Heating oil and propane distributors purchase \n     oil through wholesalers. Typically, the distributor has 10 \n     days to pay for the oil. The money is pulled directly from a \n     line of credit either at a bank or with the wholesaler. Given \n     the high cost of heating oil, distributors' purchasing power \n     is much lower this year compared to previous years. In \n     addition, the distributors often do not receive payments from \n     customers until 30 days or more after delivery; therefore, \n     their financial resources for purchasing oil for customers \n     and running their business are limited. Heating oil and \n     propane dealers need to borrow money on a short-term basis to \n     maintain economic viability. Commercial lenders\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\n     typically will not make loans to these small businesses \n     because they usually do not have the increased cash flows to \n     demonstrate the ability to repay the loan. Without sufficient \n     credit, these small businesses will struggle to purchase the \n     heating fuels they need to supply residential customers, \n     businesses and public facilities, such as schools. These \n     loans would provide affected small businesses with the \n     working capital needed until normal operations resume or \n     until they can restructure to address the market changes.\n       SBA's disaster loans are appropriate sources of funding to \n     address this problem. The hurricanes that caused significant \n     damage to the Gulf Coast along with the current instability \n     in Iraq, Nigeria and Russia caused a surge in the price of \n     oil and important refined products, especially heating fuels. \n     The conditions restricting these small businesses' access to \n     capital are beyond their control and SBA loans can fill this \n     gap when the private sector does not meet the credit needs of \n     small businesses.\n       A similar provision passed the Small Business Committee and \n     Senate with broad bipartisan support during the 10th Congress \n     when these small businesses faced a substantial increase in \n     energy prices. In addition, there is precedence for this \n     proposal, as a similar provision was enacted in the 104th \n     Congress to help commercial fisheries failures.\n       Thank you for your consideration. Please find enclosed \n     suggested draft language for the proposal. If your staff has \n     questions about the proposal or the impacts of the current \n     energy price increases on small businesses, please ask them \n     to contact Kris Sarri at 224-0606.\n           Sincerely,\n       Jack Reed,\n       John F.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business and Farm \n     Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a significant number of small businesses in the United \n     States, non-farm as well as agricultural producers, use \n     heating oil, natural gas, propane, or kerosene to heat their \n     facilities and for other purposes;\n       (2) a significant number of small business concerns in the \n     United States sell, distribute, market, or otherwise engage \n     in commerce directly related to heating oil, natural gas, \n     propane, and kerosene; and\n       (3) significant increases in the price of heating oil, \n     natural gas, propane, or kerosene--\n       (A) disproportionately harm small businesses dependent on \n     those fuels or that use, sell, or distribute those fuels in \n     the ordinary course of their business, and can cause them \n     substantial economic injury;\n       (B) can negatively affect the national economy and regional \n     economies;\n       (C) have occurred in the winters of 1983-1984, 1988-1989, \n     1996-1997, 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2004-2005; and\n       (D) can be caused by a host of factors, including \n     international conflicts, global or regional supply \n     difficulties, weather conditions, insufficient inventories, \n     refinery capacity, transportation, and competitive structures \n     in the markets, causes that are often unforeseeable to, and \n     beyond the control of, those who own and operate small \n     businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide a framework for consideration by the \nlegislative and executive branches of proposed unilateral economic \nsanctions in order to ensure coordination of United States policy with \nrespect to trade, security, and human rights; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Sanctions Policy \nReform Act.\n  The fundamental purpose of my bill is to promote good governance \nthrough thoughtful deliberation on those proposals involving unilateral \neconomic sanctions directed against other countries. My bill lays out a \nset of guidelines and requirements for a careful and deliberative \nprocess in both branches of government when considering new unilateral \nsanctions. It does not preclude the use of economic sanctions nor does \nit change those sanctions already in force. It is based on the \nprinciple that if we improve the quality of our policy process and \npublic discourse, we can improve the quality of the policy itself.\n  Numerous studies have shown that unilateral sanctions rarely succeed \nand often harm the United States more than the target country. \nSanctions can jeopardize billions of dollars in U.S. export earnings \nand hundreds of thousands of American jobs. They frequently weaken our \ninternational competitiveness by yielding to other countries those \nmarkets and opportunities that we abandon. They also can undermine our \nability to provide humanitarian assistance abroad.\n  Unilateral sanctions often appear to be cost-free, but they have many \nunintended victims--the poor in the target countries, American \ncompanies, American labor, American consumers and, quite frankly, \nAmerican foreign policy. Sanctions can weaken our international \ncompetitiveness, lower our global market share, abandon our established \nmarket to others and jeopardize billions in export earnings--the key to \nour economic growth. They may also impair our ability to provide \nhumanitarian assistance. They sometimes anger our friends and call our \ninternational leadership into question. In many cases, unilateral \nsanctions are well-intentioned, but impotent, serving only to create \nthe illusion of U.S. action. In the worst cases, unilateral sanctions \nare actually undermining our own interests in the world.\n  Unilateral sanctions do have a place in our foreign policy. There \nwill always be situations in which the actions of other countries are \nso egregious or so threatening to the United States that some response \nby the United States, short of the use of military force, is needed and \njustified. In these instances, sanctions can be helpful in getting the \nattention of another country, in showing U.S. determination to change \nbehaviors we find objectionable, or in stimulating a search for \ncreative solutions to difficult foreign policy problems.\n  But decisions to impose them must be fully considered and debated. \nToo frequently, this does not happen. Unilateral sanctions are often \nthe result of a knee-jerk impulse to take action, combined with a timid \ndesire to avoid the risks and commitments involved in more potent \nforeign policy steps that have greater potential to protect American \ninterests. We must avoid putting U.S. national security in a straight-\njacket, and we must have a clear idea of the consequences of sanctions \non our own security and prosperity before we enact them.\n  To this end, I am offering this bill to reform the U.S. sanctions \ndecision-making process. The bill will establish procedural guidelines \nand informational requirements that must be met prior to the imposition \nof unilateral economic sanctions. For example, before imposing \nunilateral sanctions, Congress would be required to consider findings \nby executive branch officials that evaluate the impact of the proposed \nsanctions on American agriculture, energy requirements, and capital \nmarkets. The bill mandates that we be better informed about the \nprospects that our sanctions will succeed, about the economic costs to \nthe United States, and about the sanctions' impact on other American \nobjectives.\n  In addition, this sanctions policy reform bill provides for more \nactive consultation between the Congress and the President and for \nPresidential waiver authority if the President determines it is in our \nnational security interests. It also establishes an executive branch \nSanctions Review Committee, which will be tasked with evaluating the \neffect of any proposed sanctions and providing appropriate \nrecommendations to the President prior to the imposition of such \nsanctions.\n  The bill would have no effect on existing sanctions. It would apply \nonly to new sanctions that are enacted after this bill became law. It \nalso would apply only to sanctions that are unilateral and that are \nintended to achieve foreign policy goals. As such, it excludes trade \nremedies or trade sanctions imposed because of market access \nrestrictions, unfair trade practices, or violations of U.S. commercial \nor trade laws.\n  Let me suggest a number of fundamental principles that I believe \nshould\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\nshape our approach to unilateral economic sanctions: unilateral \neconomic sanctions should not be the policy of first resort (to the \nextent possible, other means of persuasion ought to be exhausted \nfirst); if harm is to be done or is intended, we must follow the \ncardinal principle that we plan to harm our adversary more than we harm \nourselves; when possible, multilateral economic sanctions and \ninternational cooperation are preferable to unilateral sanctions and \nare more likely to succeed, even though they may be more difficult to \nobtain; we ought to avoid double standards and be as consistent as \npossible in the application of our sanctions policy; to the extent \npossible, we ought to avoid disproportionate harm to the civilian \npopulation (we should avoid the use of food as a weapon of foreign \npolicy and we should permit humanitarian assistance programs to \nfunction); our foreign policy goals ought to be clear, specific and \nachievable within a reasonable period of time; we ought to keep to a \nminimum the adverse affects of our sanctions on our friends and allies; \nwe should keep in mind that unilateral sanctions can cause adverse \nconsequences that may be more problematic than the actions that \nprompted the sanctions--a regime collapse, a humanitarian disaster, a \nmass exodus of people, or more repression and isolation in the target \ncountry, for example; we should explore options for solving problems \nthrough dialogue, public diplomacy, and positive inducements or \nrewards; the President of the United States should always have options \nthat include both sticks and carrots that can be adjusted according to \ncircumstance and nuance (the Congress should be vigilant by ensuring \nthat his options are consistent with Congressional intent and the law); \nand in those cases where we do impose sanctions unilaterally, our \nactions must be part of a coherent and coordinated foreign policy that \nis coupled with diplomacy and consistent with our international \nobligations and objectives.\n  An unexamined reliance on unilateral sanctions may be appropriate for \na third-rate power whose foreign policy interests lie primarily in \nsatisfying domestic constituencies or cultivating a self-righteous \nposture. But the United States is the world's only superpower. Our own \nprosperity and security, as well as the future of the world, depend on \na vigorous and effective assertion of our international interests.\n  The United States should never abandon its leadership role in the \nworld, nor forsake the basic values we cherish. We must ask, however, \nwhether we are always able to change the actions of other countries \nwhose behavior we find disagreeable or threatening. If we are able to \ninfluence those actions, we need to ponder how best to proceed. In my \njudgment, unilateral economic sanctions will not always be the best \nanswer. But, if they are the answer, they should be structured so that \nthey do as little harm as possible to our global interests. By \nimproving upon our procedures and the quality and timeliness of our \ninformation when considering new sanctions, I believe U.S. foreign \npolicy will be more effective.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Salazar):\n  S. 271. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nclarify when organizations described in section 527 of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 must register as political committees, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my good \nfriends and colleagues Senators Feingold from Wisconsin, and Lott from \nMississippi, and our good friends who lead the campaign finance reform \nfight in the House, Representatives Shays and Meehan, in introducing a \nbill to end the illegal practice of 527 groups spending soft money on \nads and other activities to influence Federal elections.\n  As my colleagues know, a number of 527 groups raised and spent a \nsubstantial amount of soft money in a blatant effort to influence the \noutcome of last year's Presidential election. These activities are \nillegal under existing laws, and yet once again, the Federal Election \nCommission, FEC, has failed to do its job and has refused to do \nanything to stop these illegal activities. Therefore, we must pursue \nall possible steps to overturn the FEC's misinterpretation of the \ncampaign finance laws, which is improperly allowing 527 groups whose \npurpose is to influence Federal elections to spend soft money on these \nefforts.\n  According to an analysis by campaign finance scholar Tony Corrado, \nFederally oriented 527s spent $423 million on the 2004 elections. The \nsame analysis shows that ten donors gave at least $4 million each to \n527s involved in the 2004 elections and two donors each contributed \nover $20 million.\n  In September, we filed a lawsuit to overturn the FEC's failure to \nissue regulations to stop these illegal practices by 527 groups. \nPresident Bush and his campaign filed a similar lawsuit against the FEC \nas well, and I also appreciate President Bush's support for the \nlegislative effort we begin today on 527s. Today, we are introducing \nlegislation that will accomplish the same result. We are going to \nfollow every possible avenue to stop 527 groups from effectively \nbreaking the law, and doing what they are already prohibited from doing \nby longstanding laws.\n  The bill we introduce today is simple. It would require that all 527s \nregister as political committees and comply with Federal campaign \nfinance laws, including Federal limits on the contributions they \nreceive, unless the money they raise and spend is only in connection \nwith non-Federal candidate elections, State or local ballot \ninitiatives, or the nomination or confirmation of individuals to non-\nelected offices.\n  Additionally, this legislation would set new rules for Federal \npolitical committees that spend funds on voter mobilization efforts \neffecting both Federal and local races and, therefore, use both a \nFederal and a non-Federal account under FEC regulations. The new rules \nwould prevent unlimited soft money from being channeled into Federal \nelection activities by these Federal political committees.\n  Under the new rules, at least half of the funds spent on these voter \nmobilization activities by Federal political committees would have to \nbe hard money from their Federal account. More importantly, the funds \nraised for their non-Federal account would have to come from \nindividuals and would be limited to no more than $25,000 per year per \ndonor. Corporations and labor unions could not contribute to these non-\nFederal accounts. To put it in simple terms, a George Soros could give \n$25,000 per year as opposed to $10 million to finance these activities.\n  Let me be perfectly clear on one point here. Our proposal will not \nshut down 527s, it will simply require them to abide by the same \nFederal regulations every other Federal political committee must abide \nby in spending money to influence Federal elections.\n  It is unfortunate that we even need to be here introducing this bill \ntoday. This legislation would not be necessary if it weren't for the \nabject failure of the FEC to enforce existing law. As my colleagues \nwell know, some organizations, registered under section 527 of the \nInternal Revenue Code, had a major impact on last year's presidential \nelection by raising and spending illegal soft money to run ads \nattacking both President Bush and Senator Kerry. The use of soft money \nto finance these activities is clearly illegal under current statute, \nand the fact that they have been allowed to continue unchecked is \nunconscionable.\n  The blame for this lack of enforcement does not lie with the \nCongress, nor with the Administration. The blame for this continuing \nillegal activity lies squarely with the FEC. This agency has a duty to \nissue regulations to properly implement and enforce the Nation's \ncampaign laws--and the FEC has failed, and it has failed miserably to \ncarry out that responsibility. The Supreme Court found that to be the \ncase in its McConnell decision, and Judge Kollar-Kotelly found that to \nbe the case in her decision overturning 15 regulations incorrectly \nadopted by the FEC to implement the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of \n2002, BCRA. That is why a Los Angeles Times editorial stated that, \n``her decision would make a fitting obituary for an agency that \ndeserves to die.'' We are not going to allow the destructive FEC to \ncontinue\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\nto undermine the Nation's campaign finance laws as it has been \nconsistently doing for the past two decades.\n  Opponents of campaign reform like to point out that the activities of \nthese 527s serve as proof that BCRA has failed in its stated purpose to \neliminate the corrupting influence of soft money in our political \ncampaigns. Let me be perfectly clear on this. The 527 issue has nothing \nto do with BCRA, it has everything to do with the 1974 law and the \nfailure of the FEC to do its job and properly regulate the activities \nof these groups.\n  As further evidence of the FEC's lack of capability, let me quote \nfrom a couple of court decisions which highlight this agency's \nshortcomings. First, in its decision upholding the constitutionality of \nBCRA in McConnell v. FEC, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the FEC \nhad ``subverted'' the law, issued regulations that ``permitted more \nthan Congress had ever intended,'' and ``invited widespread \ncircumvention'' of FECA's limits on contributions. Additionally, in \nSeptember, a Federal district court judge threw out 15 of the FEC's \nregulations implementing BCRA. Among the reasons for her actions were \nthat one provision ``severely undermines FECA'' and would ``foster \ncorruption'', another ``runs completely afoul'' of current law, another \nwould ``render the statute largely meaningless'' and, finally, that \nanother had ``no rational basis.''\n  The track record of the FEC is clear and, by their continued \nstonewalling, the Commission has proven itself to be nothing more than \na bureaucratic nightmare, and the time has come to put an end to its \ndestructive tactics. The FEC has had ample, and well documented, \nopportunities to address the issue of the 527's illegal activities, and \neach time they have taken a pass, choosing instead to delay, postpone, \nand refuse to act.\n  Enough is enough. It is time to stop wasting taxpayer's dollars on an \nagency that runs roughshod over the will of the Congress, the Supreme \nCourt, the American people, and the Constitution. We've fought too long \nand too hard to sit back and allow this worthless agency to undermine \nthe law.\n  So, here is the bottom line: If the FEC won't do its job, and its \ncommissioners have proven time and time again that they won't, then \nwe'll do it for them.
