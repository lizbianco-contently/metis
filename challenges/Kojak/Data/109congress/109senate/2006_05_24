As \nI indicated, it has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \nthe Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. This \nlegislation, The MINER Act, represents the most comprehensive overhaul \nof our Nation's mine safety laws in a generation.\n  S. 2803, was unanimously reported out last week by the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions. It is the product of a truly \nbipartisan effort undertaken with the single goal of improving the \nsafety of our Nation's miners. I would like to thank Senator Kennedy, \nthe ranking member of the HELP Committee, Senators Isakson and Murray, \nthe chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Employment and \nWorkplace Safety; and Senators Byrd and Rockefeller of West Virginia \nfor their long and tireless efforts in fashioning this legislation. I \nwould also like to express my\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\nthanks to Senators DeWine, Santorum, Specter, McConnell, and Bunning \nfor their cosponsorship of this legislation.\n  This year we have witnessed a series of tragic losses in the coal \nmining community. The year began with the deadly accidents at the Sago \nand Alma mines in West Virginia. It continued this weekend with the \ndeaths of five miners in a coal mine explosion in eastern Kentucky. \nNothing we can do here can bring back those whose lives have been lost. \nWe can, however, best honor those who have lost their lives by making \nsuch accidents less likely in the future, and making it more likely \nthat miners will survive such accidents when they do occur. That is the \naim of the MINER Act.\n  The MINER Act would require that coal mines develop and continuously \nupdate emergency response and preparedness plans that are designed to \nmake mining accidents more survivable. These plans will incorporate \ntechnological advances designed to enhance surface to underground \ncommunication, to aid in the location of underground personnel, and to \nprovide additional breathable air for miners that are trapped \nunderground. The legislation codifies the requirements for mine rescue \nteams, affords protections for these heroic volunteers, and ensures \nthat they, and other necessary Federal resources, will be promptly \ncalled upon when an emergency occurs.\n  The bill further recognizes that the development of mine safety \ntechnology, and the education and training of all those who work in the \nindustry are vital elements in the effort to improve mine safety. Thus, \nthe legislation enhances the mine safety research and development \nefforts of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. It \nencourages private sector technology development, and speeds the \napproval of new equipment. It also provides a mechanism for sharing \ntechnical research and development among Federal agencies. The bill \nwill also provide grants for additional safety training, and \nscholarship funds for mine safety related education.\n  In addition, the legislation recognizes the fact that despite the \ntragedies of this year, the safety record in the mining industry has \nbeen a good one that continues to improve. This has been due to the \nconcerted efforts of State and Federal regulators, mine employees, and \nmine operators, the vast majority of whom are serious and steadfast in \nmeeting their workplace safety responsibilities. However, there are a \nfew operators that fall outside the mold; thus, the legislation \ncontains enhanced penalty provisions targeted at these few ``bad \nactors.''\n  Those who work in our Nation's mines play a vital role in our \ncountry's economic well-being and energy security. They deserve our \nbest efforts to provide for their protection as they perform their \noften dangerous work. I believe that the MINER Act does make major \nsafety improvements that will better protect miners both today and in \nyears to come.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed for just 2 minutes on this issue.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the fact that the Senator from \nKentucky has advanced this issue this morning and ensured that the \nlegislation was going to be passed. I wish to pay tribute to my \nchairman, Senator Enzi. Within hours of the Sago mine disaster, he \nnotified our committee that we would go as a committee down to visit \nthe Sago mine. We spent hours with the families of Sago, came back \nimmediately, had an informal hearing to get early reactions and \nresponses about things that could be done immediately, and then \nstructured a whole series of hearings. We had very extensive markups on \nthose hearings.\n  This legislation has the strong support of the families and the \nstrong support of the mine workers. I think it is a very clear \nindication that this Senate gives the highest possible priority to the \nworkers and their families and safety and security.\n  We believe strongly that we should be tireless in pursuing new \ntechnologies which will provide additional kinds of safety and security \nto these miners. That process is outlined in the legislation. But this \nis a very clear message to the families that they are perhaps in the \nmost dangerous undertaking which is absolutely essential in providing \nenergy for our country. These are extraordinarily heroic men and women \nwho work the mines. This Senate has responded, and we will respond to \nensure to the extent legislatively we can that they will have safe and \nsecure jobs.\n  I thank the Senator. I am grateful for the leadership of Senator \nEnzi.\n  Finally, during all of this period, we have been fortunate to have \nthe tireless leadership of Senator Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller. Jay \nRockefeller is recovering from a difficult operation, but he has been \nin constant touch with me and members of the committee and is following \nthis legislation. Senator Byrd appeared before our committee, sat \nthrough the hearings, and has been instrumental in terms of developing \nthe legislation and pressing and pushing us forward to make sure it is \nachieved.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \ncommend my colleagues for their quick action today in taking up and \npassing S. 2803, the Mine Improvement and Emergency Response Act, or \nthe MINER Act, of 2006.\n  In passing this important legislation, the Senate has set the stage \nfor the most dramatic improvement in coal mine safety in a generation. \nBefore we can celebrate significant improvements in our mine safety \nlaws, we must encourage our colleagues in the House to act as quickly \nas they can to pass mine safety legislation so that it can be sent to \nthe President for his signature.\n  The recent mining deaths in the Commonwealth of Kentucky--five over \nthe weekend and one yesterday--lend further credence to the truism that \nmine safety laws are written in the blood of coal miners. We began this \nyear with the tragic deaths of 12 men at Sago mine in Upshur County, \nWV. Before we could even comprehend that immense loss, two more West \nVirginia miners lost their lives at the Alma mine in Logan County. \nThese men--and miners who paid the ultimate price this year in West \nVirginia's Longbranch No. 18, Black Castle, Candice No. 2, and Jacob \nNo. 1 mines, as well as at mines in Kentucky, Utah, Alabama, and \nMaryland--went to work each day knowing full well that mining is \ninherently dangerous.\n  The miners who died knew--and the miners who still go to work each \nday understand--the risks they face in fueling the American economy and \nproviding better lives for their families. We can do nothing that \nadequately honors our fallen miners, but we can give the families who \ncontinue to send their loved ones to work underground a better chance \nof seeing their miners come home safely at shift's end.\n  The MINER Act will bring into the mines new technology to help \ntrapped miners breathe after an accident and enable them to get out or \nwait to be rescued. It will introduce new communications equipment into \nmines to allow miners underground to benefit from information known to \nthose at the surface that could save their lives. This legislation will \nmake it more certain that, if there is an accident, highly trained mine \nrescue teams are available and familiar with the mines where they will \ncalled upon to save lives. It does not include every technology that I \nbelieve could be important to safeguarding miners as they do their \nwork, but it is still groundbreaking legislation that addresses mine \nsafety problems for the first time in a generation.\n  We could not have done this without the dedication and integrity of \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate HELP \nCommittee, Mike Enzi and Ted Kennedy. Their understanding of the \nabsolute necessity of tackling this issue made this legislation \npossible. I want to especially also thank Senators Johnny Isakson, \nPatty Murray, and my colleague and Senior Senator, Robert C. Byrd. In \nthe\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\nseveral months since Sago and Alma became places all Americans know, \nthe persistence of these Senators has been crucial in moving this \nlegislation forward. We can only hope that this bill will prevent \nfuture tragedies that could make other coal communities into household \nwords.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am pleased that the Senate has passed the Mine \nImprovement and New Emergency Response Act today, and I commend \nChairman Enzi, Senator Isakson, and Senator Murray for their dedication \nin pursuing these safety protections. I also commend Senator Byrd and \nSenator Rockefeller, who have been tireless in insisting on \nimprovements in mine safety. This bill is the most significant \nimprovement in mine safety by Congress in a generation.\n  Today's action was clearly necessary. The year began with the \nshocking tragedies at the Sago and Alma mines in West Virginia, where \n14 coal miners were killed. Tragedy struck again last weekend in \nKentucky, where five coal miners were killed at the Darby mine in \nHarlan County.\n  We will learn more in the weeks ahead from the ongoing investigations \nof these disasters. But many lessons are already painfully clear. The \nminers who died could have survived with adequate oxygen. But, their \nself-rescue units didn't work, and they had to share precious oxygen \nwith each other.\n  They also had no realistic way to let rescuers outside know where \nthey were. At Sago, they resorted to banging on pipes with sledge \nhammers, wasting precious energy and oxygen. This should never have \nhappened and we need to be sure that it doesn't happen again.\n  The bill requires every company to have a comprehensive emergency \nresponse plan, so that companies and miners will know ahead of time how \nto respond. The bill sets stronger minimum safety standards for oxygen \nsupplies, communications, tracking, lifelines, and training, and also \nrequires companies to continuously reevaluate the safety of their \nmines. They must adapt their safety response plans to changes in their \nmining operations and advances in mine safety technology. Safety must \nno longer be a topic that companies address only in the wake of a \ndisaster or a government directive. Plans to improve safety must be an \nenforceable day-to-day obligation of every mining operation.\n  As we saw at Sago and Darby, the time to determine whether a mine's \noxygen supply is reliable can't just be after a tragedy. To address the \nrecurring problems with oxygen supplies, the bill requires companies to \nprovide at least two hours of oxygen for every miner, plus additional \noxygen along evacuation routes and for trapped miners awaiting rescue. \nCompanies will be required to inspect and replace these units \nregularly, so that no miner has an oxygen pack that doesn't work.\n  All mines will be required to have back-up telephone lines \nimmediately available, and to adopt two-way wireless communications and \nelectronic tracking systems as soon as possible. They will also have to \ninstall fire-resistant lifelines, to show miners to the best way out in \nan emergency.\n  One of the most moving aspects of the Sago and Alma response was the \noutpouring of support from other miners around the country. They wanted \nto do everything they could to rescue their brothers and sisters \ntrapped underground. This bill guarantees that every mine in the \ncountry will have a person on staff who knows the mine and is trained \nin emergency response. It strengthens requirements for training mine \nrescue teams. The teams will practice in the mines they monitor, so \nthat the first time they go into a mine will not be during an \nemergency.\n  The bill also reduces the time required for a rescue team to reach a \nmine to one hour from the current two hours. By providing good \nSamaritan-type liability protection for mine rescue team members and \ntheir regular employers, this bill will encourage more miners to \nparticipate in mine rescue teams and more employers to support them.\n  Even if we don't know why the seal at Sago failed, we know that it \ndid. The initial reports from Darby suggest that a seal also failed \nthere. We don't need another tragedy caused by a failed seal to know \nthat the standard for seals must be improved. Our standards for these \nprotective barriers lag far behind other developed nations. That is why \nthis bill requires the Mine Safety and Health Administration to issue a \nnew regulation in 18 months to improve these standards.\n  We also need greater incentives to prevent accidents from happening. \nToo many mining companies have been paying fines that cost less than \nparking tickets. Under this bill, companies can no longer treat \nviolations of health and safety laws as a cost of doing business. We \nimpose substantial new minimum penalties on companies that put miners \nat risk and do not take their obligation seriously to provide a safe \nworkplace. These new penalties escalate when companies continue to \nignore their safety obligations. The bill also makes clear that MSHA \nhas the authority to shut down a mine that refuses to pay its fines.\n  Research is an important part of safety. The Navy has technologies to \ncommunicate with submarines on the bottom of the ocean. NASA can talk \nto people on the Moon. It is time to bring mine safety technology into \nthe 21st century too. Our bill creates an interagency task force so \nthat NIOSH will have the benefit of the advances made by other \nindustries and agencies. It also creates two competitive grant \nprograms: one to encourage the development and manufacture of mine \nsafety equipment that the private sector might not otherwise find \neconomically viable, and another to educate and train employers and \nminers to better identify, avoid, and prevent unsafe working \nconditions.\n  This bill is an important step in strengthening the response to mine \nemergencies. But there is more to be done. We have seen miners in other \ncountries survive because of requirements that their mines have refuge \nchambers. Our bill requires MSHA and NIOSH to test refuge chambers to \nsee if they should be used here to protect miners in a fire or \nexplosion. It also addresses safety issues raised by ventilating mines \nwith belt air, particularly the problem of fires on mine conveyor \nbelts. The bill requires the Secretary of Labor to report to us on \nthese problems, and I commend Senator Enzi and Senator Isakson for \nagreeing to work together and to hold hearings on these critical issues \nin the future.\n  We can't bring back the brave miners who have died this year. Today, \nhowever, we honor their memory by passing this legislation and we will \nhonor them even more by following through to see that it is implemented \nas effectively as possible to make our mines safer.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any further debate?\n  Without objection, the unanimous consent request is agreed to.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2803), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have one further observation on the \nmeasure which we just passed.\n  I again congratulate the Senator from Massachusetts and Chairman Enzi \nfor this important piece of legislation. This has been a tough few \nyears in coal country--in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and in Kentucky. \nAs everyone knows, we just lost five miners last weekend. This \nlegislation couldn't be more timely.\n  Again, I congratulate those on both sides of the aisle who made an \nimportant contribution to move this legislation out of the Senate and \nover to the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5050-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5050-S5061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 2006\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, throughout this debate on immigration, \nwe have been discussing what to do about illegal immigrants in the \ncountry today and what to do about those who will illegally pass our \nborders every day in the future. We have heard very valid concerns, \nwhich I share with my colleagues, about how best to deal with the \nsecurity of the Nation. The number of illegal immigrants who currently \nreside in the United States has been estimated, as we all know, to be \nabout 12 million people.\n  I rise today to express another area of concern which has not yet \nbeen addressed by the amendments thus far--that is voting. The U.S. \nConstitution secures the voting franchise only for citizens of our \ncountry. As close elections in the past have made abundantly clear, we \nmust make certain that each vote is legally cast and counted. Imagine \nthe impact of 12 million potentially illegal registered voters.\n  This problem was recently tackled by a bipartisan commission on \nelection reform, which was chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and \nformer Secretary of State James Baker. This was referred to as the \nCarter-Baker commission, named after these two American leaders.\n  They recognized that clean lists are key, but even more importantly \nthey note that ``election officials still need to make sure that the \nperson arriving at the polling site is the same one that is named on \nthe registration list.'' They note that ``Photo IDs currently are \nneeded to board a plane, enter Federal buildings, and cash a check. \nVoting is equally important.'' Again, those are the words of Jimmy \nCarter, James Baker, and their bipartisan commission.\n  Moreover, we not only need to ensure that those voting are those on \nthe rolls but also that they are legally entitled to vote. As we said \nwhen we passed the Help America Vote Act a few years ago, on which I \nwas proud to be the lead Republican, along with my good friend from \nMissouri, Senator Bond, and Senator Dodd, who was chairman of the Rules \nCommittee at the time, the leader on the Democratic side, we want \neveryone who is legally entitled to vote to be able to vote and have \nthat vote counted but to do so only once. In short, we wanted to make \nit easier to vote and harder to cheat. The key is to ensure that \neveryone who votes is legally entitled to do so.\n  The Carter-Baker commission's recommendations on voter identification \nare, first, to ensure that persons presenting themselves at the polling \nplaces are the ones on the registration list.\n  The commission recommends that States require voters to use the REAL \nID card which was mandated in a law and signed by the President in May \nof 2005, just a year ago. The card includes a person's full name, date \nof birth, a signature captured as a digital image, a photograph, and \nthe person's Social Security number. This card should be modestly \nadapted for voting purposes to indicate on the front or back whether \nthe individual is a U.S. citizen. States should provide an Election \nAssistance Commission template identification with a photo to \nnondrivers free of charge.\n  Second, the commission said the right to vote is a vital component of \nU.S. citizenship, and all States should use their best efforts to \nobtain proof of citizenship before registering voters.\n  That is precisely what my amendment does--implements the \nrecommendations of the Carter-Baker Commission on Federal Election \nReform to protect and secure the franchise of all U.S. citizens from \nballots being cast illegally by non-U.S. citizens. Further, for those \nwho cannot afford an identification, I have included a grant program \nwithin this amendment to make identifications available free of charge.\n  Former mayor of Atlanta, Andrew Young, supported the free photo \nidentification as a way to empower minorities and believes, in an era \nwhere people have to show identification to rent a video or cash a \ncheck, requiring an identification can help poor people who otherwise \nmight be even more marginalized by not having such a photo \nidentification.\n  This is an issue which an overwhelming majority of Americans support. \nAn April 2006 NBC-Wall Street Journal poll asked for reaction to \nrequiring voters to produce a valid photo identification when they go \nto vote.\n  Only 7 percent of Americans oppose requiring photo identification at \nthe polls; 62 percent of Americans strongly favor requiring photo \nidentification at the polls; 19 percent of Americans mildly favor photo \nidentification at the polls; 12 percent are neutral; only 3 percent of \nAmericans mildly oppose requiring photo identification at the\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\npolls; only 4 percent strongly oppose. So collapsing those numbers as \nwe frequently do with polls, 81 percent of Americans favor photo \nidentification at the polls, across the philosophical spectrum in our \ncountry.\n  As the chart indicates, only 7 percent are opposed. Not only is the \nCarter-Baker commission on record as supporting photo identification at \nthe polls, the American people are overwhelmingly on the side of photo \nidentification at the polls.\n  There have also, interestingly enough, been some State-based polls \nconducted which concur that Americans overwhelmingly support requiring \nphoto identification at the polls. In Wisconsin, 69 percent favor \nrequiring photo identification at the polls. In Washington State, 87 \npercent favor requiring photo identification at the polls. In \nPennsylvania, 82 percent favor requiring photo identification at the \npolls. In Missouri, 89 percent favor requiring photo identification at \nthe polls.\n  The numbers make it clear the vast majority of Americans support \nrequiring photo identification at the polls. Why wouldn't they? As John \nFund pointed out in his piece in the Wall Street Journal a couple of \ndays ago, entitled ``Jimmy Carter is Right, Amend the Immigration Bill \nto Require Voters to Show ID'':\n\n       Almost everyone needs a photo ID in today's modern world.\n\n  You need photo identification to drive a car, fly a plane, get a gun, \ncatch a fish, open a bank account, cash a check, enter a Federal and \nsome State buildings, and the list goes on and on.\n  This is not a new concept. Twenty-four States already require some \nkind of photo identification at the polls. Further, thanks to the Help \nAmerica Vote Act, photo identification at the polls is required by \nthose who register to vote by mail and don't provide the appropriate \ninformation at registration.\n  Some may ask, if States are doing it, why should the Federal \nGovernment get involved? I associate myself with the answer to this \nquestion given by Jimmy Carter and James Baker. Here is what they had \nto say about whether we should simply leave this up to the States:\n\n       Our concern was that the differing requirements from state-\n     to-state could be a source of discrimination, and so we \n     recommend a standard for the entire country, Real ID Card.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to consider whether the protection of each and \nevery American's franchise, a right at the very core of our democracy, \nis important enough to accord it equal treatment to getting a library \ncard or joining Sam's Club. Last I checked, the constitutional right to \nrent a movie or buy motor oil in bulk was conspicuously absent. \nHowever, the Constitution is replete, as is the United States Code, \nwith protections of the franchise for all Americans.\n  I will have three articles printed in the Record, but I will take a \ncouple of minutes to highlight some of the very important points raised \nin these articles.\n  The first article, entitled ``Jimmy Carter Is Right, Amend the \nimmigration bill to require voters to show ID'' appeared Monday in the \nOpinion Journal written by John Fund in which he notes:\n\n       Andrew Young, the former Atlanta mayor and U.N. ambassador, \n     believes that in an era when people have to show ID to rent a \n     video or cash a check, ``requiring ID can help poor people \n     who otherwise might be even more marginalized by not having \n     one.\n\n  Mr. Fund goes on to note:\n\n       The Carter-Baker commissioners recognized that cost could \n     be a barrier to some and thus recommended that identification \n     cards be provided at no cost to anyone who needed one. They \n     also argued that photo ID would make it significantly less \n     likely that a voter would be wrongly turned away at the polls \n     due to out-of-date registration lists or for more malicious \n     reasons.\n\n  This amendment does just that, provides grants to States so that \nanyone who wants an ID can get one free of charge.\n  Lastly, and most importantly for this immigration debate, Mr. Fund \nstates:\n\n       The man who in 1994 assassinated Mexican presidential \n     candidate Luis Donaldo Colosino in Tijuana had registered to \n     vote at least twice in the U.S. although he was not a \n     citizen. An investigation by the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service into alleged fraud in a 1996 Orange \n     County, California congressional race revealed that ``4,023 \n     illegal voters possibly cast ballots in the disputed election \n     between Republican Robert Dornan and Democrat Loretta \n     Sanchez.\n\n  The second article is written by Andrew Young, former mayor of \nAtlanta on September 30, 2005 for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in \nwhich he states:\n\n       At the end of the day, a photo ID is a true weapon against \n     the bondages of poverty. Anyone driving through a low-income \n     neighborhood sees the ubiquitous check-cashing storefronts, \n     which thrive because other establishments, such as \n     supermarkets and banks, won't cash checks without a standard \n     photo ID. Why not enfranchise the 12% of Americans who don't \n     have drivers' licenses or government-issued photo IDs.\n\n  The last article is co-authored by Jimmy Carter and James Baker and \nappeared in the September 23, 2005, New York Times, in which they \nobserve:\n\n       In arguing against voter ID requirements, some critics have \n     overlooked the larger benefits of government-issued ID's for \n     the poor and minorities. When he spoke to the commission, \n     Andrew Young, the former mayor of Atlanta, supported the free \n     photo ID as a way to empower minorities, who are often \n     charged exorbitant fees for cashing checks because they lack \n     proper identification. In a post/911 world, photo ID's are \n     required to get on a plane or into a skyscraper.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent those three articles to which I just referred \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 22, 2006]\n\n                         Jimmy Carter Is Right\n\n       Amid all the disputes over immigration in Congress, one \n     amendment is being proposed that in theory should unite \n     people in both parties. How about requiring that everyone \n     show some form of identification before voting in federal \n     elections? Polls show overwhelming support for the idea, and \n     there is increasing concern that more illegal aliens are \n     showing up on voter registration rolls. But the fact that \n     photo ID isn't likely to pass shows both how deeply emotional \n     the immigration issue has become and how bitter congressional \n     politics have become with elections only 5 1/2 months away.\n       Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican whip, is proposing \n     the photo ID amendment. He notes that Mexico and many other \n     countries require the production of such identification in \n     their own elections, and that the idea builds on the \n     suggestion of last year's bipartisan election reform \n     commission headed by former president Jimmy Carter and former \n     secretary of state James Baker.\n       The Carter-Baker commission issued 87 recommendations to \n     improve the functioning of election systems. One called for a \n     national requirement that electronic voting machines include \n     a paper trail that would allow people to check their votes, \n     while another would have states establish uniform procedures \n     for counting provisional ballots.\n       But the biggest surprise was that 18 of 21 commissioners \n     backed a requirement that voters show some form of photo \n     identification. They argued that with Congress passing the \n     Real ID Act to standardize security protections for drivers' \n     licenses in all 50 states, the time had come to standardize \n     voter ID requirements. Former Senate Democratic leader Tom \n     Daschle joined two other commissioners in complaining that \n     the ID requirements would be akin to a Jim Crow-era ``poll \n     tax'' and would restrict voting among the poor or elderly who \n     might lack such an ID.\n       Mr. Daschle's racially charged analogy is preposterous. \n     Almost everyone needs photo ID in today's modern world. \n     Andrew Young, the former Atlanta mayor and U.N. ambassador, \n     believes that in an era when people have to show ID to rent a \n     video or cash a check, ``requiring ID can help poor people'' \n     who otherwise might be even more marginalized by not having \n     one.\n       The Carter-Baker commissioners recognized that cost could \n     be a barrier to some and thus recommended that identification \n     cards be provided at no cost to anyone who needed one. They \n     also argued that photo ID would make it significantly less \n     likely that a voter would be wrongly turned away at the polls \n     due to out-of-date registration lists or for more malicious \n     reasons. In any case, the tacit acknowledgment by Mr. Carter \n     and most of the other liberals on the commission that the \n     integrity of the ballot is every bit as important as access \n     to the ballot was a welcome one.\n       The photo ID issue is being joined with the immigration \n     debate because there is growing anecdotal evidence that voter \n     registration by noncitizens is a problem. All that it takes \n     to register is for someone to fill out a postcard, and I have \n     interviewed people who were still allowed to register without \n     checking the box that indicated they were a citizen. Several \n     California counties report that an increasing number of \n     registered voters called up for jury duty write back saying \n     they are ineligible because they aren't citizens,\n       The man who in 1994 assassinated Mexican presidential \n     candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio in Tijuana had registered to \n     vote at least twice in the U.S. although he was not a \n     citizen. An investigation by the Immigration\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\n     and Naturalization Service into alleged fraud in a 1996 \n     Orange County, Calif., congressional race revealed that \n     ``4,023 illegal voters possibly cast ballots in the disputed \n     election between Republican Robert Dornan and Democrat \n     Loretta Sanchez.''\n       It's certainly true that new ID rules alone wouldn't \n     eliminate all the potential for fraud. Much of the voter \n     fraud taking place today occurs not at polling places but \n     through absentee ballots. In some states party officials are \n     allowed to pick up absentee ballots, deliver them to voters \n     and return them, creating opportunities for all manner of \n     illegal behavior. Other states allow organizations to pay \n     ``bounties'' for each absentee ballot they deliver, which \n     provides an economic incentive for fraud. The Carter-Baker \n     commission recommended that states eliminate both practices.\n       In a politically polarized country, photo ID for voting is \n     a rare issue that enjoys across-the-board support among the \n     general public. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll last month \n     found that 80% of voters favored a photo ID requirement, with \n     62% favoring it strongly. Only 7% were opposed. Numbers that \n     high indicate the notion has overwhelming support among all \n     demographic and racial groups.\n       Skeptics argue that in some states the effort to impose \n     such a requirement seems to emphasize the ID requirement \n     while not making a serious effort to ensure everyone has such \n     a document. Robert Pastor, executive director of the Carter-\n     Baker commission, claims that some Republicans supporting \n     voter ID ``are not really serious about making sure that \n     voter ID is free for those who can't afford it.''\n       Some analysts say a photo ID law could pass on the national \n     level only if it is seen to satisfy both sides. ``As part of \n     an overall bipartisan package of election reform--which would \n     include universal voter registration conducted by the \n     government--national voter identification makes sense, \n     especially if structured to limit absentee vote fraud, and so \n     that identification can be checked across states,'' says Rick \n     Hasen, a professor at Loyola Law School. But he says that \n     excessive ``partisan jockeying is not going to increase \n     public confidence in the outcome of elections.''\n       Sen. McConnell's proposed photo ID requirement is a good \n     idea, but it may be able to move forward only if he puts some \n     real money on the table to ensure that everyone who wants to \n     vote can get an ID. In that, the photo ID issue resembles the \n     immigration debate itself. The only immigration bill that is \n     going to pass both houses is one that combines beefed-up \n     border enforcement with steps that regularize the growing \n     demand for labor from Mexico via some kind of legal guest \n     worker program. But sadly, in the case of both photo ID and \n     immigration, political jockeying appears to be the order of \n     the day. It may take a lame-duck session of Congress after \n     this year's election for members finally to address both \n     issues seriously.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Sept. 30, 2005]\n\n               Voter IDs Only Part of Elections Solution\n\n                           (By Andrew Young)\n\n       There is an understandable, visceral reaction by many \n     people against the use of a photo ID card for voting. But how \n     we vote and voting in general must be seriously examined, and \n     we cannot let partisanship take place over citizenship. \n     America ranks 139th out of 172 countries in voter turnout \n     worldwide.\n       How do you create a fair voting system, with access to all \n     who deserve it, with a required photo ID without \n     disenfranchising or penalizing Americans? We know, a photo ID \n     requirement can be used as a latter-day equivalent of the \n     poll tax--that has happened in Georgia, which has added a fee \n     to get the appropriate ID.\n       So why did I give at least conditional support to the \n     Carter-Baker Commission for its recommendation of a required \n     photo ID?\n       First, I accepted the two pillars of the commission's own \n     recommendation: There already is a photo ID requirement in \n     federal law--the new Real ID requirement imposed by Congress \n     as part of homeland security policy. If everyone will \n     eventually be required to carry a Real ID card, why not use \n     it to improve the voter registration and election system? \n     Encode the cards with voter data, and that will protect \n     voters from being wrongfully turned away from the polls.\n       The second pillar is that any required photo ID must be \n     made widely available, easily accessible and free.\n       Time will tell whether Georgia is effectively executing its \n     plans through its mobile vans and, for the indigent, a waiver \n     of the fee for a photo ID.\n       At the end of the day, a photo ID is a true weapon against \n     the bondages of poverty. Anyone driving through a low-income \n     neighborhood sees the ubiquitous check-cashing storefronts, \n     which thrive because other establishments, such as \n     supermarkets and banks, won't cash checks without a standard \n     photo ID. Why not enfranchise the 12 percent of Americans who \n     don't have drivers' licenses or government-issued photo IDs?\n       Given these two pillars, I have no objections to an ID \n     requirement, even though I do not believe that fraud is \n     widespread or that the ID is the key to election reform.\n       But there is another condition: The ID has to be made part \n     of a package that includes bolder solutions that expand \n     access to large numbers of voters who are now seriously \n     handicapped by the way we run elections.\n       Imagine you are a working poor person. Election Day, \n     Tuesday, comes. You have to be at work at 8 a.m.--your \n     employer doesn't give you time off to vote, and you will have \n     your pay docked or be fired if you are late. You check out \n     your polling place at 7 a.m.--there is already a long line, \n     with many there because they have the same problem. So you go \n     to work, finish at 6 or 7 p.m. and head to the polls again. \n     Another long line awaits, with no guarantee you will get to \n     the front of it before the polls close.\n       I firmly believe that the surest fix to our anemic turnout \n     is in the calendar, not the cards.\n       Having Election Day on a Tuesday was a decision made 160 \n     years ago, for reasons that were appropriate to Colonial \n     times but are no longer relevant. According to the 2002 \n     census data and other polls, the inconvenience of Tuesday is \n     the single reason people most cited for not voting.\n       So I asked the members of the Carter-Baker commission when \n     I met with them, ``Why Tuesday?'' having personally observed \n     that historic weekend in South Africa when Nelson Mandela was \n     elected president. Regrettably there is nothing in the \n     Carter-Baker report on federal election reform that addresses \n     why Tuesday voting remains a good idea.\n       If America is to remain the world's beacon of democracy, we \n     can no longer tolerate an evergrowing class of permanent non-\n     voters.\n       A simple act of Congress moving Election Day to the weekend \n     is what the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. truly envisioned when \n     he said ``the short walk to the voting booth'' is the most \n     decisive step for our democracy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 23, 2005]\n\n                     Voting Reform Is in the Cards\n\n                (By Jimmy Carter and James A. Baker III)\n\n       We agreed to lead the Commission on Federal Election Reform \n     because of our shared concern that too many Americans lack \n     confidence in the electoral process, and because members of \n     Congress are divided on the issue and busy with other \n     matters.\n       This week, we issued a report that bridges the gap between \n     the two parties' perspectives and offers a comprehensive \n     approach that can help end the sterile debate between ballot \n     access and ballot integrity. Unfortunately, some have \n     misrepresented one of our 87 recommendations. As a result, \n     they have deflected attention from the need for comprehensive \n     reform.\n       Our recommendations are intended to increase voter \n     participation, enhance ballot security and provide for paper \n     auditing of electronic voting machines. We also offer plans \n     to reduce election fraud, and to make the administration of \n     elections impartial and more effective.\n       Most important, we propose building on the Help America \n     Vote Act of 2002 to develop an accurate and up-to-date \n     registration system by requiring states, not counties, to \n     organize voter registration lists and share them with other \n     states to avoid duplications when people move. The lists \n     should be easily accessible so that voters can learn if \n     they're registered, and where they're registered to vote.\n       Some of our recommendations are controversial, but the 21 \n     members of our bipartisan commission, which was organized by \n     American University, approved the overall report, and we hope \n     it will break the stalemate in Congress and increase the \n     prospects for electoral reform.\n       Since we presented our work to the president and Congress, \n     some have overlooked almost all of the report to focus on a \n     single proposal--a requirement that voters have driver's \n     licenses or government-issued photo IDs. Worse, they have \n     unfairly described our recommendation.\n       Here's the problem we were addressing: 24 states already \n     require that voters prove their identity at the polls--some \n     states request driver's licenses, others accept utility \n     bills, affidavits or other documents--and 12 others are \n     considering it. This includes Georgia, which just started \n     demanding that voters have a state-issued photo ID, even \n     though obtaining one can be too costly or difficult for poor \n     Georgians. We consider Georgia's law discriminatory.\n       Our concern was that the differing requirements from state-\n     to-state could be a source of discrimination, and so we \n     recommended a standard for the entire country, the Real ID \n     card, the standardized driver's licenses mandated by federal \n     law last May. With that law, a driver's license can double as \n     a voting card. All but three of our 21 commission members \n     accepted the proposal, in part because the choice was no \n     longer whether to have voter IDs, but rather what kind of IDs \n     voters should have.\n       Yes, we are concerned about the approximately 12 percent of \n     citizens who lack a driver's license. So we proposed that \n     states finally assume the responsibility to seek out citizens \n     to both register voters and provide them with free IDs that \n     meet federal standards. States should open new offices, use \n     social service agencies and deploy mobile offices to register \n     voters. By connecting IDs to registration, voting \n     participation will be expanded.\n       Our proposal would allow voters without photo IDs to be \n     able to cast provisional ballots until 2010. Their votes \n     would count if the signature they placed on the ballot \n     matched the one on file, just as the case for absentee \n     ballots. After that, people who forgot their photo IDs could \n     cast provisional votes that would be counted if they returned \n     with their IDs within 48 hours. Some have suggested we use a \n     signature match for provisional ballots\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\n     after 2010, but we think citizens would prefer to get a free \n     photo ID before then.\n       In arguing against voter ID requirements, some critics have \n     overlooked the larger benefit of government-issued IDs for \n     the poor and minorities. When he spoke to the commission, \n     Andrew Young, the former mayor of Atlanta, supported the free \n     photo ID as away to empower minorities, who are often charged \n     exorbitant fees for cashing checks because they lack proper \n     identification. In a post-9/11 world, photo IDs are required \n     to get on a plane or into a skyscraper.\n       We hope that honest disagreements about a photo ID will not \n     deflect attention from the urgency of fixing our electoral \n     system. While some members of Congress may prefer to block \n     any changes or stand behind their particular proposals rather \n     than support comprehensive reforms, we hope that in the end \n     they will work to find common ground. The American people \n     want the system fixed before the next election, and that will \n     require a comprehensive approach with a bipartisan voice in \n     favor of reform.\n       Jimmy Carter was the 39th president. James A. Baker III was \n     secretary of state in the George H. W. Bush administration.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What is the remaining time?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 10 minutes 15 seconds; the \nminority has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I retain the remainder of my time, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have 25 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, last night I offered an amendment dealing with the \nenforcement of safety provisions to make sure those American workers \nwho work here, and the guest workers, are going to be in safe \nconditions, that they are going to be safe and secure, that we are \ngoing to have the safest workforce possible. And all I heard on the \nother side is: We can't do this because we haven't had any hearings.\n  This is an important issue, an important question, and vital, but we \ncan't possibly consider this as a measure that is only tangentially \nrelevant to the immigration issue. I suggest what was sauce for the \ngoose is sauce for the gander. This is a very important issue that \ndeserves consideration.\n  We have 25 minutes on this side to try and deal with this issue. \nObviously, that is inadequate.\n  I remember 1964. My first amendment in the Senate was in opposition \nto the poll tax. I lost that vote, 52 to 48. Eventually, we eliminated \nthe poll tax. But we went through to the 1964-1965 Voting Rights Act, \nand we eliminated not only the poll tax but the literacy test.\n  Why were those tests put in place? They were put in place to make \nsure our voting was going to be safe and secure and that we were only \ngoing to have people voting who deserved to vote. This is a way to keep \nour voting clear and to make sure that we are going to preserve the \nsanctity of the voting box.\n  So we had those measures, but as we know, they were struck down. Why \nwere they struck down? I will not take the time here, but fundamentally \nand basically they were unconstitutional.\n  Now the Senator suggests: Let's go there and put in a new process. \nThat sounds very good. The poll tax sounded very good when it was \ninitially offered. So did the literacy test. Now we have a new idea \nthat is going to be offered. The first question we have to ask \nourselves is, Is there a problem?\n  We have heard anecdotal comments from the Senator from Kentucky--not \nstudies, not reviews, but anecdotal studies--about whether there was \nreal fraud out there. Is this a problem in the United States of \nAmerica? There has not been any evidence that this is the result of \nhearings. We have not had any hearings.\n  The study of the 2002 and 2004 Ohio elections found there were 9 \nmillion votes cast and 4 were found to be fraudulent according to the \nLeague of Women Voters of Ohio; 4 votes found to be fraudulent \naccording to the League of Women Voters of Ohio, the most comprehensive \nstudy that has been done recently in terms of elections.\n  The Secretary of State of Georgia stated she was not aware of a \nsingle case or complaint of a voter impersonating another voter at the \npolls in almost a decade. That was sworn testimony of the Secretary of \nGeorgia. She was much more concerned about absentee ballots than the \nquestion of fraud.\n  A 12-State study by Demos, a nonprofit organization, not a Democrat \nor Republican organization, concluded election fraud was very rare. \nThey found no evidence suggesting fraud, other than a minor problem. \nThat is the best information we have. We have not had any hearings. All \nof the relevant studies indicated that is the situation. So we have a \nsolution where there really isn't a problem.\n  The Senator from Kentucky says he is basically following the \nrecommendations of the Carter-Baker commission of some time ago. That \nis not exactly the case. In the Carter-Baker proposal they have a \nnumber of recommendations on implementation. First of all, they say it \nshould not be implemented until January 2010. This is to be implemented \nin May of 2008, the middle of the Presidential primaries.\n  Why did the Carter-Baker commission say 2010? They said it because \nthe States are not prepared to deal with it prior to that time. What is \nthe date of the Senator from Kentucky? What date do they select? May \n2008, in the middle of the Presidential primaries, for 110 million \nAmericans who vote, to drop this in on the States?\n  This is unworkable. The denial of one of the most sacred rights of an \nAmerican citizen, the right to vote, is going to be heavily compromised \nif we accept this.\n  A second proposal of the Carter-Baker commission indicates it has to \nbe free identifications. This is the language in the McConnell \namendment:\n\n       . . . the Election Assistance Commission shall make \n     payments to States to--[what, make them all free? No]--\n     promote the issuance to registered voters of free. . . .\n\n  It does not even guarantee the funding. It was guaranteed in the \nCarter proposal.\n  Finally, it also indicated that, should there be States that refuse \nor fail to have a process, there is a backup system to ensure the right \nto vote. That does not exist in this particular proposal.\n\n  So this does not even meet the bare requirements of the Carter-Baker \nproposal. It does not even meet those bare requirements. It accelerates \nthe timing, which was deferred, for very good reasons, after a \nprolonged discussion during the debate.\n  Finally, and most importantly, when the courts recently considered a \nvery similar proposal to the one we have here, which was a similar \nvoter identification proposal, in Common Cause v. Georgia--which is a \n2005 case; virtually an identical kind of a proposal to that which is \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky--it pointed out that it violated \nthe equal protection clause because it unduly burdened the fundamental \nright to vote for several classes of citizens.\n  Sure, you need a photo identification to get a video because the \nvideo shop wants the video back. Sure, you have a photo identification \nto rent a car because the people who rent the cars want the car back, \nand for insurance purposes. Sure, you have a video when you buy a gun, \nfor the obvious reasons. But as to the right to vote, we want to \nencourage people to vote. This is what the circuit court said, with \nvirtually an identical proposal that came before them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take another 2 minutes.\n  That is what the circuit court said in response to a similar proposal \nwhich became before them.\n  The amendment violates the Equal Protection Clause because it unduly \nburdens the fundamental right to vote for several classes of people. \nThe court in the Georgia case found the voter identification \nrequirement ``most likely to prevent Georgia's elderly, poor, and \nAfrican-American voters from voting.''\n  The amendment violates the 24th amendment because it amounts to an \nunconstitutional poll tax. The Supreme Court found that the 24th \namendment not only bars poll taxes, but also bars their \n``equivalent[s]'' and found this kind of identification was an \nequivalent.\n  The McConnell amendment requires that the Election Assistance \nCommission make funds available only ``to promote the issuance of free \nphoto identification,'' but does not mandate and provide that.\n  This is an unwise amendment on an immigration bill.\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\n  Mr. President, I see our friend from Connecticut, who was the floor \nmanager of the earlier legislation, and my colleague from Illinois, who \nalso wishes to speak.\n  The most sacred right guaranteed in our democracy is the right to \nvote. We want to promote people voting. We want our elections safe and \nsecure. But this issue deserves more than 45 minutes on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate on an immigration bill.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Let me echo Senator Kennedy's strong opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  There is no more fundamental right accorded to United States citizens \nby the Constitution than the right to vote. And the unimpeded exercise \nof this right is essential to the functioning of our democracy. \nUnfortunately, history has not been kind to certain citizens in their \nability to exercise this right.\n  For a large part of our Nation's history, racial minorities have been \nprevented from voting because of barriers such as literacy tests, poll \ntaxes, and property requirements.\n  We have come a long way in the last 40 years. That was clear just a \nfew weeks ago when Democrats and Republicans, Members of the Senate and \nthe House, stood on the Capitol steps to announce the introduction of a \nbill to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. That rare and refreshing \ndisplay of bipartisanship reflects our collective belief that more \nneeds to be done to remove barriers to voting.\n  Right now, the Senate is finishing a historic debate about \nimmigration reform. It has been a difficult discussion, occasionally \ncontentious. And it has required bipartisan cooperation. After several \nweeks, and many, many amendments, we are less than an hour away from \nvoting for cloture. Considering our progress and the delicate balance \nwe are trying to maintain, this amendment could not come at a worse \ntime.\n  Let's be clear, this is a national voter identification law. This is \na national voter identification law that breaks the careful compromise \nstruck by a 50-50 Senate 4 years ago. It would be the most restrictive \nvoter identification law ever enacted, one that could quite literally \nresult in millions of disenfranchised voters and utter chaos at the \nState level.\n  Now, I recognize there is a certain simplistic appeal to this \namendment. After all, why shouldn't we require people to present a \nphoto identification card when they vote? Don't we want to ensure that \nvoters are actually who they claim to be? And shouldn't we at least \nmake sure that noncitizens are not casting ballots and changing the \noutcomes of elections?\n  There are two problems with that argument. First, there has been no \nshowing that there is any significant problem of voter fraud in the 50 \nStates. There certainly is no showing that noncitizens are rushing to \ntry to vote. This is a solution in search of a problem. The second \nproblem is that historically disenfranchised groups--minorities, the \npoor, the elderly and the disabled--are most affected by photo \nidentification laws.\n  Let me give you a few statistics. Overall, 12 percent of voting-age \nAmericans do not have a driver's license, most of whom are minorities, \nnew U.S. citizens, the indigent, the elderly, or the disabled. AARP \nreports that 3.6 million disabled Americans have no driver's license.\n  A recent study in Wisconsin found that white adults were twice as \nlikely to have driver's licenses as African Americans over 18. A study \nin Louisiana found that African Americans were four to five times less \nlikely to have photo identification than white residents.\n  Now, why won't poor people be able to get photo identifications or \nREAL IDs? It is simple: Because it costs money. You need a birth \ncertificate, passport, or proof of naturalization, and that can cost up \nto $85. Then you need to go to a State office to apply for a card. That \nrequires time off work, possibly a long trip on public transportation, \nassuming there is even an office near you.\n  Imagine if you only vote once every 2 or 4 years, it is not very \nlikely you are going to take time off work, take a bus to a far-off \ngovernment office to get an identification, and pay $85 just so you can \nvote. That is not something most folks are going to be able to do.\n  The fact of the matter is, this is an idea that has been batted \naround, not with respect to immigration, but with respect to generally \nattempting to restrict the approach for people voting throughout the \ncountry. This is not the time to do it.\n  The Carter-Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform found that in \nthe 2002 and 2004 elections, fraudulent votes made up .00003 percent of \nthe votes cast. That is a lot of zeros. So let me say it a different \nway: Out of almost 200 million votes that were cast during those \nelections, 52 were fraudulent. To put that in some context, you are \nstatistically more likely to get killed by lightning than to find a \nfraudulent vote in a Federal election.\n  This is not the appropriate time to be debating this kind of \namendment. We have a lot of serious issues to address with respect to \nimmigration. I ask all my colleagues to reject this amendment so we can \nmove on to the important business at hand.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do we have 11 minutes? Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 6 minutes. \nThe Senator from Connecticut has 5.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So 6 and 5 is 11.\n  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am glad our math is good here this \nmorning. I appreciate that early in the day.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his \nleadership on this bill and his eloquence this morning on this \namendment being offered by our colleague from Kentucky. I commend our \ncolleague from Illinois as well for his eloquent comments about the \nproblems associated with this amendment.\n  Very bluntly and very squarely, if the McConnell amendment is adopted \nin the next 20 minutes, then roughly 142 million people in our country \nwould have to have a new--a new--photo identification, one which does \nnot exist yet, that complies with REAL ID by the elections in 2008. \nOtherwise, you could not vote a regular ballot in the 2008 Federal \nelections without this new identification.\n  My colleague cites polling data that indicates that 62 percent of \nAmericans believe a photo identification may be necessary. They were \nnot asked whether or not they knew they would have to have a completely \nnew identification, which I presume they would have to pay for, and if \nthey don't have it with them by election day 2008, then they would not \nbe allowed to show up and vote a regular ballot in person for \npresidential and other federal candidates across the country. So 142 \nmillion people could be disenfranchised by this amendment if we end up \nrequiring a new photo identification.\n  Now, it has been said over and over again this morning--it needs to \nbe repeated--it was Patrick Henry who said, more than 200 years ago: \nThe right to vote is the right upon which all other rights depend. It \nis the essential right. The idea we would somehow exclude people who \nare elderly or disabled or people who, for a variety of reasons, do not \nhave or cannot get this new photo identification from having access to \nthe ballot because of some anecdotal evidence that people may show up \nand pretend to be someone else--because that is the only set of \ncircumstances we are talking about here.\n  Absentee ballots present a unique set of problems. This does not \ncover the absentee ballots. It does not cover the situations where \npeople mail in votes under a different set of circumstances in some of \nour States. This amendment only addresses the situation in which \nsomeone shows up to vote claiming to be someone else, when, in fact, \nthey are a different individual.\n  So I would hope our colleagues, recognizing the tremendous problems \nthis\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\namendment could afford us, would reject this amendment. We had this \ndebate 4 years ago when we adopted the Help America Vote Act. What we \nsaid is, if you register by mail, then the first time you show up at \nthe polls, you need some form of identification, and, in fact, a photo \nidentification may be one of them. But it is not the only thing that \ncan be a source of identification for first time voters who registered \nby mail. There may be a variety of other criteria that States would \nadopt.\n  In a sense, we are going to nationalize and Federalize every single \nState by this approach. States, as we have historically said, determine \nthe specific requirements of registration. Some States require very \nlittle. That is their judgment. Other States require more. We stayed \naway from dictating to States exactly what they had to do in the Help \nAmerica Vote Act. If you adopt this amendment, why not consider an \namendment for national registration? Many advocate that.\n  I think it may be a sound idea to move to a national registration. \nThe HAVA bill moved from local registration to Statewide registration, \nwhich is a major step forward. But here we are saying you are going to \nhave to have one size fits all, one identification, and we do not even \nknow what it looks like yet--it does not exist at all--which has to \ncomply with the REAL ID requirements between now and election day 2008. \nAnd if you do not have it, then you could be refused a regular ballot \nand forced to vote provisionally.\n  Obviously, access to the ballot has been critical for us. We have \nbalanced that right to try to ensure, to the extent possible, that the \nballot is going to be secure. But if we err on any side of that \nequation, it has been historically to err on the side of access to make \nsure people are encouraged to participate. Thus, the reason, in the \nHAVA bill, why we have provisional balloting--for the first time that \nwill exist--it is so that if you show up and there is a contest as to \nwhether or not you have the right to vote, the law says you should be \nable to cast a provisional ballot, so that after the election, after \nthe ballots are cast, or the polling places are closed, if, in fact, \nyou, the voter, were right, the ballot counts. If you were wrong, \nobviously, it does not, but you have a right to find out why it was not \ncounted in order to be able to correct the problem.\n  Provisional ballots are making it possible for people to vote who \nbelieve they have the right to vote, to cast a ballot. That right has \nnot existed in the past. That is the direction we are heading in as a \ncountry, not going backwards, not retreating, and not creating \nobstacles and hurdles to cast those ballots. That, unfortunately, would \nbe the outcome if the McConnell amendment were adopted.\n  Every major civil rights organization, every leading organization \ndefending the disabled and the elderly are opposed to this amendment \nand are very worried about what it could mean if it were adopted.\n  So I urge my colleagues, at this early hour in the morning: Please, \nwhen you come here, this is not the place for this amendment on an \nimmigration bill. There is a time and opportunity to go back and \nrevisit election issues. I hope we do that at some point. But to \ncherry-pick a provision that would set us back decades would be a \nmistake.\n\n  The right to vote is one of the most fundamental civil rights \naccorded to citizens by the United States Constitution. The right of \nall Americans to vote, and to have their vote counted, is the \ncornerstone of our democratic form of government. It is at the heart of \nall we do here, and precedes other rights because it is the means by \nwhich we choose those who represent us. The free and unencumbered \nexercise of the franchise is a core pre-condition of a government that \nis of the people, by the people and for the people.\n  This amendment would jeopardize efforts to balance the traditional \nrequirements of ballot access and ballot security; impinge \nunnecessarily on those fundamental rights; create a disparate impact on \nwhole classes of our citizens; and effectively impose a new form of \npoll tax on millions of American voters.\n  Public confidence in the integrity of final election results is \nlikely to be judged to a large extent by how well our laws balance the \ntwin goals of expanded ballot access and enhanced ballot security, a \nfact that should remain foremost in our minds as we move forward on \nthis debate in the coming days.\n  This amendment would dangerously undermine that delicate balance. \nWhere difficult questions on these issues arise, my bias has always \nbeen to err on the side of expanded ballot access for all eligible \nvoters. That should be no surprise to anyone who has been in the Senate \nor watched its deliberations in recent years, including the debate \nthree years ago on the Help America Vote Act.\n  We must do all we can to ensure that the fundamental right to vote \ncan be exercised freely, even while taking appropriate precautions to \nprevent usually isolated acts of individual voter fraud.\n  The McConnell amendment before us would effectively mandate a one-\nsize-fits-all voter identification solution for every voter, every \nState, and the territories regardless of their circumstances, resources \nor preferences.\n  Every American citizen who is eligible to vote today in a Federal \nelection would be effectively rendered ineligible to vote in the \nPresidential election of November 2008 by this amendment. Under this \namendment, even those Americans who were born in this country and have \nbeen voting in every election since they turned 18 would be unable to \nvote in the November 2008 Presidential election, unless they first \nobtain a new REAL ID/citizenship card, or its equivalent.\n  This is a sea change in the rules of access for voters to every \npolling place in the United States. Under this amendment, everyone, \nevery voter would have to present a REAL ID/citizenship card to vote a \nregular ballot at the polls.\n  My colleagues may remember the stories of dogs and dead people voting \nin the 2000 Presidential election. To respond to individual fraud in \nelection registration, Congress adopted a measured, two-part response: \na new identification for first time voters who register by mail and a \ncomputerized statewide voter registration system. Under HAVA, the \nStates must have the computerized voter registration system in place \nthis year. And the States are working diligently to accomplish that.\n  But this amendment goes much farther and without any justification, \nwithout any evidence of widespread fraud, effectively disenfranchises \nevery single American voter who is eligible to vote in Federal \nelections today.\n  The only fraud that this amendment purports to address is the \nsituation in which a voter appears, in person, at the polls and claims \nto be someone else. During all of the hearings that the Rules Committee \nheld on election reform following the debacle of the 2000 Presidential \nelections, including the hearings held by my distinguished friend, the \nauthor of this amendment--who was Chairman of the Rules Committee at \nthe time--not one witness testified to widespread fraud by individuals \nappearing in person at the polls claiming to be someone they were not.\n  And Congress isn't the only body which failed to find more than \nanecdotal evidence of such fraud.\n  Just last year, the bipartisan Carter-Baker Commission on Federal \nElection Reform, co-chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former \nSecretary of State James Baker, also failed to find the fraud that this \namendment is designed to address.\n  Let me quote from the September 2005 Carter-Baker Commission Report:\n\n       There is no evidence of extensive fraud in U.S. elections \n     or of multiple voting, but both could occur, and it could \n     affect the outcome of a close election.\n\n  So even though neither Congress, nor the esteemed private Carter-\nBaker Commission, could find the type of fraud that would justify a \nnational citizenship voting card, this amendment would literally \njeopardize the voting rights of every single American citizen in order \nto combat this phantom fraud.\n  And yet the fraud that the bipartisan Carter-Baker Commission was \nconcerned about--that of fraud committed through absentee balloting--is \nnot even addressed by this amendment.\n  Again, quoting from the 2005 Carter-Baker Commission Report:\n\n       Absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential \n     voter fraud.\n\n  But does this amendment apply to absentee balloting or vote by mail?\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\nNo--it applies only to those American citizens who make the effort to \nget up on election day and go to the polls, stand in line--sometimes \nfor hours--and publicly present themselves to vote.\n  This amendment would change the law to effectively federalize what \nhas always been a State and local determination. It would establish a \none-size-fits-all Federal REAL ID/citizenship card, based on a law that \nhas itself not been fully implemented.\n  It mandates that every State implement a system which uses these new \ncards by May 11, 2008--less than two years from now, and during a \nperiod when we will almost certainly face a hotly contested \nPresidential election. If this amendment is adopted, the resulting \nchaos will undermine the results of the 2008 Presidential election to \nthe point that not even the Supreme Court will be able to determine the \nwinner.\n  No one in this Chamber can say with any certainty how this is going \nto work, if at all, or that it will not further disenfranchise \nvulnerable voters. In my view, it almost certainly will.\n  This is not the time, nor the vehicle, to be debating election \nreforms that will most assuredly disenfranchise American citizens, \nparticularly the poor, minorities, the elderly, and the disabled.\n  These voting issues are important, and as I have said, I would \nwelcome a full and comprehensive debate on how to expand access for all \nAmericans to enable them to more effectively and easily register and \nvote in Federal elections, while preserving ballot security.\n  I have introduced legislation on that issue in this Congress, and \nwould like to have it considered soon. We could and should have a full \ndebate on how best to balance the twin goals of expanded ballot access \nwith appropriate ballot security. But now is neither the time nor the \nplace for that debate. This is not what we should be doing on this \nbill.\n  I am also concerned about amending HAVA now. I intend to oppose any \namendment that would open up the Help America Vote Act before the law \nis fully implemented in time for the fall Federal elections in 2006.\n  We have already had over 10 primaries and we are less than six months \nprior to the general mid-term elections. States are working hard to \ncome into compliance with the new requirements of accessible voting \nsystems and statewide voter registration list. Voters are working hard \nto understand the new circumstances and new technologies they will be \nfacing in the 2006 elections, and are being educated on how to exercise \ntheir rights to ensure an equal opportunity for all to cast a vote and \nhave that vote counted.\n  Many of us know that no single law is the comprehensive and perfect \nfix for a number of problems which have existed for decades in our \ndecentralized election system. HAVA was a landmark law, the next step \nin a march which included the Voting Rights Act, NVRA legislation, and \nother measures. HAVA made appropriate changes to the law in the wake of \nthe 2000 election debacle, and did so with broad, bipartisan support.\n  And I am sure there are a host of improvements that could be made to \nHAVA. I have some in mind myself. But HAVA deserves to be fully and \neffectively implemented before taking the next steps toward broader \nreform.\n  If this Senate wishes to debate election reforms, I am prepared to do \nso for days to come. There are numerous reforms which the Senate should \nbe considering.\n  If we are prepared to impose a universal voting ID on Americans, then \nwe should also establish a universal Federal registration requirement \nfor voting. If we are going to preempt the rights of States to \ndetermine who is eligible to vote in a Federal election, then perhaps \nwe should preempt the rights of States to decide whether or not they \nwill count that Federal ballot.\n  If we are going to federalize identification requirements for voting, \nthen perhaps we should federalize eligibility requirements for absentee \nvoting.\n  If we want to ensure that the vote of every eligible American citizen \nhas equal weight, then maybe we should federalize the administration of \nFederal elections.\n  But that is not the approach that my colleague, Senator McConnell, \nand I took in developing the bipartisan Help America Vote Act. And that \nis not the approach that the Congress and President Bush took in \npassing and signing into law the Help America Vote Act. And nothing in \nthe intervening 3\\1/2\\ years has changed to suggest that either HAVA \nisn't working, or that the American people support the kind of sea \nchange that this amendment creates.\n  HAVA was a carefully crafted balance between the twin goals of making \nit easier to vote and harder to defraud the system. This amendment \ndestroys the necessary balance between ballot access and ballot \nsecurity--a balance that is key to ensuring the integrity of Federal \nelection results.\n  If we are equally concerned about both access to the ballot box and \npotential fraud, then we should not enact an amendment which, by \noperation of its provisions, will potentially prevent every single \neligible citizen from voting in the 2008 Presidential election.\n  And if we are truly concerned about potential voting fraud, then we \nshould give the States the opportunity to complete implementation of \nHAVA and allow that new law to work before we enact a new requirement \nwhich on its face will disrupt the delicate balance HAVA created.\n  HAVA needs to be allowed to work. And for that reason, a broad \nCoalition of civil rights and voting rights groups, and organizations \nrepresenting State and local governments, oppose this amendment.\n  This Coalition letter makes clear that in their view, the six-month \nperiod prior to Federal mid-term elections, as we are implementing \nHAVA, is not the time, nor is the immigration bill the vehicle, to \nattempt to make highly controversial changes to the way voters qualify \nfor access to the ballot box. Specifically, the Coalition letter \nrejects this amendment because, and I quote:\n\n       The amendment raises voter identification issues without \n     deliberation, further complicates unrealistic implementation \n     deadlines for the REAL ID Act, creates a mandate for an \n     identification tool not yet available, and undermines the \n     continuing efforts of the States to enfranchise every \n     eligible voter through the Help America Vote Act of 2002, \n     ``HAVA''.\n\n  Mr. President, any amendment which attempts to impose additional new \nFederal election reforms must include proposals which balance the \ncompeting goals of expanded ballot access and ballot security. My hope \nis that the Senate will make clear that effective election reform is \nnot just about one of those aspects, but must address both. Some in \nthis body have maintained a continuing misplaced emphasis on security \nat the expense of access. It is the duty of this Congress to ensure \nthat both goals are protected and preserved for all Americans.\n  I urge rejection of the McConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, elections are the heart of democracy. They \nare the instrument for the people to choose leaders and hold them \naccountable. At the same time, elections are a core public function \nupon which all other Government responsibilities depend. If elections \nare defective, the entire democratic system is at risk. Americans are \nlosing confidence in the fairness of elections. We need to address the \nproblems of our electoral system. Those are the words of the cochairmen \nof the Commission on Federal Election Reform, former Secretary of State \nJim Baker and former President Jimmy Carter.\n  Most people know Jimmy Carter, the former President. I happen to know \nhim as a Governor. We served together. We also know him as a lion in \nthe world of free and fair elections. He has traveled the globe, faced \ndown dictators, watched over petty potentates, all in the name of free \nand fair elections. He believes we need a real voter identification.\n  We took steps in the HAVA to make sure that somebody who had a right \nto\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\nvote was not unjustifiably denied that right by being refused an \nopportunity to vote at the polls. That is why we supported it, and it \nwas a great idea to have a provisional ballot. But you can lose your \nvote just as surely and as effectively when somebody who is not \neligible to vote casts an illegal vote that cancels your vote. That is \na silent and more insidious way of losing your vote--if your vote is \ncanceled by an illegal vote cast by someone who is not eligible to vote \nor somebody who has voted more than once.\n  My colleague from Illinois has raised the question of why we need it \nbecause there isn't any vote fraud. That is a monumental announcement \nfrom somebody who comes from a State that has Chicago in it, but I \nthink that St. Louis has outdone Chicago. In the 2000 election we had \npeople filing to keep the polls open because they had been denied the \nright to vote. It turns out when they looked into the situation, the \nfirst plaintiff had trouble voting because he had been dead for 14 \nmonths.\n  They said: The real plaintiff is a guy whose name is very similar. \nThat plaintiff had voted earlier that afternoon in St. Louis County. \nBut when we started looking into voter fraud in St. Louis, news reports \nwere rife with fraudulent voting. Thousands of votes were apparently \ncast by dead people, or with fraudulent addresses, large numbers voting \nfrom vacant lots, dozens of people voting from a single-family \nresidence. Voter fraud was so bad in the elections that even a very \nliberal newspaper in St. Louis carried a cartoon showing St. Louis \nvoting.\n  Here is the voting booth. Here is a casket where people were trying \nto vote in St. Louis. You can accept voting in these two places, but \nthe coffin is not a place you expect people to cast a vote from.\n  How would a picture identification requirement help the situation? As \nyou can imagine, a picture of a dead person would certainly be \nnoticeable. Assuming the dead person was not the one actually voting, \nthere would be a mismatch between the voter and the photo. I don't \nimagine that opponents of this amendment actually are fighting to have \ndead people vote, but that is the result when they block amendments \nsuch as this.\n  Another result is seen in this registration card. I suppose I \nshouldn't keep it up too long because somebody will want to copy the \naddress and send Ritzy Mekler a campaign solicitation. Why does Ritzy's \nregistration matter? How would a picture identification address her \nsituation? A picture identification of Ritzy Mekler would instantly \nhave indicated the problem because Ritzy is a 13-year-old cocker \nspaniel.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield another minute to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. These are not isolated instances. The Missouri Secretary of \nState conducted an investigation after the 2000 vote and found \nsignificant voter fraud. Subsequent criminal proceedings confirmed that \nfraud is still a problem and must be monitored in Missouri. A 2004 \nreport by Missouri's State auditor found over 24,000 voters registered \nwho were either double registered, deceased, or felons. These are \nproblems we want to clean up, and a voter identification requirement \nwill help us.\n  The amendment we have before us requires voters to present \nidentification for the 2008 election. It will be the same requirement \nthat citizens face every time they take the train or fly on an \nairplane. It will be the same requirement they face when cashing a \ncheck.\n  For those concerned that some voters need help getting a picture ID \nso they can vote, I agree 100 percent. This amendment will also provide \nnew grant funds to States so that everyone who needs an ID can get one \nfree of charge.\n  There should be no barriers to voting in this country. There also \nshould be no barriers to a free and fair election.\n  We will not be alone in this requirement. Voters in nearly 100 \ndemocracies use a photo identification card. Maybe that international \nexperience is what helped convince President Carter that this was an \nimportant idea. So important that the Commission on Federal Election \nReform he cochaired included this recommendation.\n  That commission's executive director note that polls indicated that \nmany Americans lack confidence in the electoral system, but that the \npolitical parties are so divided that serious electoral reform is \nunlikely without a strong bipartisan voice.\n  That is why President Carter joined in the election reform effort, \nand that is why I urge my colleagues to join this effort--so that we \ncan restore faith in our elections, so that we know that citizens who \nhave the right to vote are voting, so that even new citizens who were \nimmigrants have a free and fair election to vote in. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator McConnell has proposed an amendment \nto the immigration bill to modify the Help America Vote Act of 2002, \n``HAVA'', by mandating that all States require government-issued photo \nidentification from voters at polling places. Senator McConnell's \namendment raises serious concerns by putting the policy ahead of the \ngroundwork necessary to determine how and whether such a step should be \ntaken.\n  I do not see his justification for attaching that proposal to this \nmeasure or to get ahead of the implementation of the REAL ID Act or \nrecommendations by the Carter-Baker commission. The REAL ID Act has \ngiven us a great many problems, and there are a number of aspects that \nneed to be adjusted or fixed. If the Rules Committee wants to take a \ncomprehensive look at it and if Senator Dodd supports that effort, I \nwill be very interested in what they have to say. I do not think it is \nwise to expand the purpose of the REAL ID Act without due deliberation. \nThis is not the right time, nor is this bill the right place, to make \nhasty changes to Federal voting laws without the careful consideration \nsuch modifications deserve.\n  The Senate is currently considering the reauthorization of the Voting \nRights Act and is doing so in a deliberate, considered, and bipartisan \nmanner. We should take the same approach to any enhancement of HAVA, \nwhich should include the considered input from the States, their \nelection officials and citizens. HAVA expressly provides for State \ninvolvement in carrying out the improvements in the law. Senator \nMcConnell's amendment would seem to undermine HAVA by preventing the \nStates from performing their legislative role in devising voter \nidentification procedures. The States play an integral role in carrying \nout the improvements in the Act, and we should let them perform this \nfunction without the undue interference.\n  Any proposal for federally standardized identification cards should \nbe subject to hearings and debate beyond the constrained environment of \nthe amendment process for the immigration bill. Before we vote on \nproposals for the use of a national identification card in our voting \nsystem, we must undertake a national debate about the technology, \nimplementation, and the implications for the privacy rights of American \ncitizens and the risks that required forms of voter identification have \nsometimes been used to intimidate minority voters or suppress their \nparticipation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes and yield the \nlast 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  This is an extraordinarily important amendment. It deserves the full \nconsideration of this body because, as has been pointed out, it reaches \nthe essence of our democracy, which is the right to vote. If we are \ngoing to take action on an immigration bill that is going to have an \nimpact on 120 million Americans in the 2008 Presidential campaign, we \nshould not be doing that in the 50 minutes before a cloture vote on the \nimmigration bill.\n  I have pointed to recent courts of appeals decisions on measures that \nare virtually identical to this where they have struck it down because \nthey believed that it was going to effectively discriminate against \nlarge groups of Americans, primarily the poor, the disabled, and the \nelderly. The court of appeals made that judgment in the Georgia ID \ncase, not those on this side of the aisle. It was the court's decision.\n  It seems to me, having so clear a judicial determination on this \nmeasure and such a wide separation between what this measure is and \nwhat was recommended by the Carter-Baker commission, it is not wise for \nthe Senate to\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\nadopt what would be a major rewriting of our national election laws in \nthe 50 minutes prior to a cloture vote on an immigration bill. It is \nunwise for the Senate. If we are not successful in defeating it, this \npotentially could have a most dramatic adverse impact in terms of \nAmerican voting in the next national election. I don't think that is \nwhat this legislation is really about. I don't think we should take \nthat step. If we are going to debate this issue, we ought to have the \nopportunity to have hearings and a review to make a judgment. Now is \nnot the time, and this is not the legislation.\n  I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me again quote from the Carter-Baker \ncommission report regarding the very proposal that is before us:\n\n       There is no evidence of extensive fraud in U.S. elections \n     or of multiple voting. It could occur and it could affect the \n     outcome, but there is no evidence that exists today.\n\n  What is true is if this amendment were adopted, there are clearly \npeople who will show up to vote who will not be allowed to vote a \nregular ballot because, under this legislation, in May of 2008, if you \ndon't have this nonexisting voter card, you will not be allowed to \nvote. I don't care how long you have lived here, how many elections you \nhave participated in, this is a national requirement that will exist in \nMay of 2008. And out of 142 million people who have a right to vote, \nthere is likely to be a substantial number who would be \ndisenfranchised. This is the wrong direction to be going based on an \nanecdotal piece of evidence about people who show up to vote and claim \nto be someone else.\n  And that is why the Carter-Baker Commission recommendations on voter \nID included a number of other reforms to provide a failsafe against \nthis result. These additional components of the voter ID recommendation \ninclude allowing affidavit voting, with signature verification, until \n2010. Thereafter, the Commission recommends that voters who did not \nhave their ID could return to the appropriate election official within \n48 hours of voting and provide the ID. But those failsafe provisions \nare not included in the amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Absentee balloting is an area that could take some work when it comes \nto addressing fraud, but even the Carter-Baker Commission concluded \nthat fraud could not be documented in the case of in-person voting. To \ntake this immigration legislation we have worked months to craft, and \ninclude the consideration of this ID proposal--and we rejected it only \n4 years ago--to open up just this part of the Help America Vote Act, \ndisregarding everything else, is the wrong step to take on an \nimmigration bill.\n  Again, I emphasize, every civil rights organization, every group \nrepresenting the elderly and disabled is urging colleagues to reject \nthis amendment. This would be a major step backwards when it comes to \nelection reform.\n  At the proper time I will offer a motion to table. My colleague from \nKentucky wants to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 4 minutes 12 \nseconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is a great debate going on in the \nDemocratic Party on this issue. We have Jimmy Carter and Andrew Young \non one side and, from the comments I have heard this morning, I gather \ncolleagues from Massachusetts and Connecticut and Illinois on the \nother. It is an interesting debate among Democrats as to whether we \nshould have this important ballot integrity measure.\n  My good friend from Massachusetts mentioned Georgia. They have photo \nidentification in Georgia. That might explain why there were no \nreported cases by the Georgia Secretary of State of a problem. My good \nfriend from Illinois declared that voter fraud was not a problem in \nAmerica. I am sure he is familiar with Cook County in his own State, as \nSenator Bond has discussed regarding St. Louis and his State.\n  Let me take anyone who may doubt to eastern Kentucky. Voter fraud is \na significant problem in America. And with a lot of new people coming \nin, many of them illegal, it raises the stakes to protect the integrity \nof the vote in this country. Every time somebody votes illegally, they \ndiminish the quality and the significance of the votes of American \ncitizens. This is not just Republicans making this point. This is some \nof the most significant Democrats in America today. President Jimmy \nCarter and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young believe that photo \nidentification is absolutely critical.\n  With regard to the suggestion that there have been no hearings, we \nhad numerous hearings in the Committee on Rules prior to passage of \nHAVA in 2002. The Baker-Carter commission had 21 members, 11 staff \nmembers, 25 academic advisors, 24 consulted experts in the field, two \npublic hearings, advice from 22 witnesses, followed by three meetings \nand presentations spanning the country from LA to the District of \nColumbia, all of which produced a 104-page report in encapsulating 87 \ndetailed recommendations to improve elections. There have been plenty \nof hearings on this subject.\n  The question is, on a measure which will guarantee that the number of \nillegals in America will continue to increase unless we are serious \nabout border security, do we care about the franchise and diminishing \nthe significance of the franchise of existing American citizens. We \nhave engaged in a good discussion this morning on what this amendment \ndoes and does not do. It gives States the flexibility to design an \nidentification to be shown at the polls to protect and secure the \nfranchise of all U.S. citizens from ballots being cast illegally by \nnon-U.S. citizens. Yes, the content standards of the REAL ID are the \ntemplate but just the template.\n  And, last, the Federal Government will pay for any low-income \nAmericans who do not have a photo identification, which is exactly the \npoint that Andrew Young was making about how important that was for \nlow-income Americans to finally have a photo identification so they can \nfunction in our society, which increasingly requires photo \nidentification for almost everything--check cashing, getting on a \nplane, getting a fishing license, you name it, photo identification is \nrequired. It is nonsense to suggest that somehow photo identification \nfor one of our most sacred rights, the right to participate at the \npolls, to choose our leadership, should not be protected by a \nrequirement that is increasingly routine in almost all daily activities \nin America today.\n  If you support this amendment, then that puts you in the same camp \nwith Jimmy Carter, James Baker, Andrew Young and 81% of legally \nregistered Americans who seek to preserve and protect their \nConstitutionally guaranteed franchise from being disenfranchised by \nvote dilution and vote fraud. Mr. President, I urge that the motion to \ntable, which Senator Dodd has indicated he is going to make, be \nopposed.\n  Mr. President, has all time been yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nState and local coalitions and civil rights groups be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 22, 2006.\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned national organizations, \n     urge you to reject an amendment to be introduced by Senator \n     Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to the Comprehensive Immigration \n     Reform Act of 2006. The McConnell amendment would require, by \n     May 11, 2008, that voters at polling places show federally \n     mandated photo identification, pursuant to the ``REAL ID Act \n     of 2005'' (P.L. 109-13), prior to casting a ballot.\n       The amendment raises voter identification issues without \n     deliberation, further complicates unrealistic implementation \n     deadlines for the REAL ID Act, creates a mandate for an \n     identification tool not yet available, and underlines the \n     continuing efforts of the states to enfranchise every \n     eligible voter through the Help America Vote Act of 2002 \n     (HAVA).\n       The undersigned groups have, for several years, been part \n     of a coalition focused on educating Members of Congress about \n     the importance of fully funding the Help America Vote Act. \n     However, in this case, we have come together to oppose this \n     amendment.\n       Our organizations are working to implement HAVA so that \n     voters' rights are guaranteed, and so that states have the \n     flexibility needed to implement required reforms\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\n     to the nation's multi-jurisdictional system of election \n     administration.\n       Throughout the life of HAVA, both the House and the Senate \n     have sought input from all of the organizations in this \n     coalition and have worked hard to balance the needs and \n     interests of all parties. This amendment, however, has not \n     gone through any of the normal information gathering or \n     deliberative processes. For example: hearings have not been \n     held in committee; interested organizations and individuals \n     have not had an opportunity to comment, and election \n     officials have not been given the opportunity to address how \n     this provision would be administered.\n       In addition, issues like voter identification have been \n     highly divisive. HAVA expressly recognized the states' right \n     to address the voter ID question through the state \n     legislative process, in a manner consistent with federal and \n     constitutional law. The McConnell amendment would undermine \n     the intent of HAVA in this area. Also, with growing \n     uncertainty at the state level about implementing the REAL ID \n     program in its current form, it is irresponsible to alter and \n     expand the original purpose of the REAL ID's reach as \n     contemplated by the Congress.\n       For the above reasons, we urge you to reject the McConnell \n     amendment. Thank you for your consideration.

Mr. President, although I share some of the concerns \nof the senior Senator from Massachusetts, I voted against tabling the \nMcConnell amendment because I believe we need a voter identification \ncard to reduce voter fraud. I support an appropriate identification \ncard for Americans but did not support the REAL ID Act because I was \nconcerned it would impose an unfunded mandate on the States and that \nthe deadline for compliance was unattainable for most States. I still \nhold those concerns, but it is clear now that the REAL ID is to become \nthe Federal standard. I hope the Senator from Kentucky and others will \nwork to address these concerns in conference--and during the \nappropriations process--so that a realistic deadline can be set and \nsufficient funding provided to the States so that they may comply with \nthis federal mandate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate at \nthe present time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next order of business is a vote on the \ncloture motion.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ncloture vote, the Senate stand in recess until 12 noon to accommodate \nthe joint meeting with the Prime Minister of Israel and that the time \ncount postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope that this morning we will begin to \ndraw to a close the Republican filibuster against comprehensive \nimmigration reform. I have been encouraged that since our return to \nthis legislation this month, the President has spoken out in favor of \ncomprehensive immigration reform with an essential component being a \nrealistic path to earned citizenship for those who work hard, pay their \ntaxes, and contribute so much to our American way of life. When \nRepublicans filibustered against two cloture votes last month, \nincluding one on a motion by the Republican Leader, I was disappointed. \nI had hoped we would recognize the lawful, heartfelt protests of \nmillions against the harsh House-passed criminalization measures. While \nthey waved American flags, some of those fueling anti-immigrant \nfeelings burned flags of other countries. I hope that through this \ndebate we have been able to convince enough Senate Republicans to join \nus in our efforts and to appreciate the contributions of immigrants to \nour economy and our Nation.\n  This bill is not all that it should be. Yesterday we short-circuited \nefforts to make it more flexible for those persecuted around the world. \nThis country has had a history of being welcoming to refugees and those \nseeking asylum from persecution. Yesterday the Senate turned its back \non that history by refusing to allow the Secretary of State the \nflexibility needed after restrictive language was added by the REAL ID \nAct to our laws. I hope Senators will reconsider these issues with more \nopen minds and hearts and a fully understanding of the lives being \naffected. Sadly too, many were spooked by false arguments.\n  I have made no secret that I preferred the better outline of the \nJudiciary Committee bill. The bill the Senate is now considering is a \nfurther compromise. Debate and amendments have added some improvements \nand some significant steps in the wrong direction. Besides the failures \nyesterday to readjust its asylum provisions to take into account the \nrealities of oppressive forces in many parts of the world, I was most \ndisappointed that the Senate appeared to be so anti-Hispanic in its \nadoption of the Inhofe English amendment. Yesterday Senator Salazar and\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\nI wrote to the President following up on this provision and the \ncomments of the Attorney General last week and weekend. We asked \nwhether the President will continue to implement the language outreach \npolicies of President Clinton's Executive Order 13166. A prompt and \nstraightforward affirmative answer can go a long way toward rendering \nthe Inhofe English amendment a symbolic stain rather than a serious \nimpediment to immigrants and Americans for whom English is a second \nlanguage. I ask consent that a copy of our letter be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY, There are growing rumors that some who oppose \ncomprehensive immigration reform will not be deterred by a \nsupermajority vote for cloture and are considering various procedural \npoints of order to delay or derail Senate action in the Nation's \ninterest. I hope they will reconsider and join with us in a \nconstructive way to enact comprehensive immigration reform. We do not \nneed more divisiveness and derision. This bill is not the bill I would \nhave designed. It includes many features I do not support and fails to \ninclude many that I do. Nonetheless, I will support cloture and will \ncontinue to work to enact bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2006.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: Last week over my objection the Senate \n     adopted an amendment to the comprehensive immigration bill \n     that seeks to place restrictions on the Government and its \n     communications in languages other than English. I was \n     extremely disappointed that your Administration did not speak \n     out against the divisive amendment and help us work to defeat \n     it.\n       Attorney General Gonzales said after the fact that you have \n     ``never been supportive of English only or English as the \n     official language.'' The Attorney General indicated over the \n     weekend that his reading of the Inhofe amendment ``would not \n     have an effect on any existing rights, currently provided \n     under federal law.'' I note that you continue to use Spanish \n     on the official White House website, indeed you include a \n     translation into Spanish of the radio address you gave last \n     Saturday on immigration.\n       I write to ask whether you intend to continue to adhere to \n     Executive Order 13166 if the Inhofe amendment is enacted into \n     law. This Executive Order was adopted by President Clinton in \n     August 2000 to improve access to federal programs and \n     activities. In 2002, your Assistant Attorney General for \n     Civil Right reaffirmed support for the Executive Order and \n     indicated that your ``Administration does not plan to repeal \n     Executive Order 13166.'' What would be the effect, if any, on \n     Executive Order 13166 and its implementation if the Inhofe \n     language adopted by the Senate were to become law?\n           Respectfully,\n     Patrick Leahy,\n     Senator.\n     Ken Salazar,\n     Senator.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is his first visit to \nWashington as Prime Minister, and he will be only the fourth Israeli \nPrime Minister ever to address both Chambers.\n  The honor is mutual. We look forward to listening to his remarks in a \nfew moments. Following his speech, the Speaker of the House, Speaker \nHastert, and I, along with a number of our colleagues, will host the \nPrime Minister for a bipartisan bicameral leadership lunch.\n  Ehud Olmert was sworn in as the 12th Prime Minister of Israel on May \n4 after a tragic stroke incapacitated Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in \nJanuary. In late March he assumed the leadership of Ariel Sharon's \nKadima party, and led it to victory in Israel's national elections. His \nparty won the largest share of seats in the Israeli Knesset, elevating \nMr. Olmert to the Prime Ministership with responsibility for governing \nIsrael's next coalition government. His Cabinet was sworn in this month \nand includes members of the largest opposition party, the Labor Party. \nI spoke with the Prime Minister in April to congratulate him on his and \nthe Kadima party's victory.\n  Today it is my privilege to welcome him to the United States Capitol.\n  Since its founding nearly 60 years ago, Israel and the United States \nhave enjoyed a special and exceptionally strong relationship. Shared \nhistorical and cultural ties have bound our countries together. For \nnearly six decades,\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\nAmerica's commitment to Israel's security has been one of the principal \npillars of U.S. policy in the Middle East.\n  Today, Prime Minister Olmert faces great challenges. In January's \nPalestinian legislative elections, Hamas won a majority of \nparliamentary seats. Hamas is a known terrorist organization that has \ncalled publicly for Israel's destruction. It has repeatedly \ndemonstrated its willingness to employ violence and terrorism in \npursuit of this objective.\n  On April 17, a Palestinian suicide bomber killed nine people in an \nattack in Tel Aviv during the Passover holiday. The Hamas government \nrefused to condemn the bombing.\n  Here in Congress we share the view that Hamas is a terrorist \norganization and needs to take substantial steps to become a partner \nfor peace. We are in agreement that Hamas must recognize Israel, \nrenounce its violence and terrorism, disarm its militias, and abide by \nall previous agreements with Israel, including the roadmap for peace. \nUntil Hamas meets these conditions, foreign assistance for the Hamas-\nled Palestinian Authority will not be forthcoming.\n  Since taking office, Prime Minister Olmert has repeated his desire to \nnegotiate an end to this conflict. In fact, he has stated that \nnegotiations with a credible peace partner that is genuinely and \ndemonstrably committed to a peaceful two-state solution and that will \nend terrorism against Israel is ``the most stable and desired basis for \nthe political process.''\n  The Prime Minister has stated that he will allow time for a credible \npeace partner to emerge in the Palestinian Authority, and like his \npredecessor, he has demonstrated the willingness and ability to make \nthe difficult decisions necessary for peace in the Middle East. I hope \nPrime Minister Olmert will continue along this path and get the peace \nprocess back on track. I commend the Prime Minister for his leadership \nin the months since former Prime Minister Sharon's stroke. He can be \nassured of our continued support.\n  The United States is proud to be a friend and ally to the people of \nIsrael. The Prime Minister's visit to the Capitol today underscores our \nstrong bilateral relationship.

Madam President, I make a point of order that the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky is not germane under rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, in accordance with the agreement that was entered \ninto yesterday, the Senator from West Virginia is prepared to address \nthe Senate on mine safety and then to debate his amendment. I look \nforward to that discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, what is so lovely as a day in June? I \nrepeat my question. What is so lovely as a day in June? Of course, the \nPresiding Officer, who graces the Chair this afternoon, she is--I have \nsaid enough. People have caught on already. I am talking about somebody \nwho is as lovely as a day in June. But beauty is in the eye of the \nbeholder, they say.\n\n\n                              Mine Safety\n\n  Madam President, this morning the Senate unanimously passed critical \nmine safety legislation in response to the coal mine tragedies that \nrobbed the State of West Virginia of 18 of its sons this year. A \nprocess that began with the introduction of the West Virginia \ndelegation's mine safety bill has taken a significant step forward \ntoday. We have learned from the tragedy at Sago, and we have learned \nfrom the subsequent mining fatalities in West Virginia, Kentucky, Utah, \nAlabama, and Maryland.\n  If the House acts quickly on legislation and the Federal mine \nregulators are quick in implementing the bill, the miners of our \nNation, the miners of our country, will soon have the oxygen--yes, the \noxygen--communications, and rescue teams necessary to save lives and to \nprevent future tragedies. We saw in Kentucky over the weekend that \nthese mine accidents can happen at any time, so the Senate's quick and \nunanimous passage of the Senate committee-reported bill this morning is \ngreeted by all who mine coal with welcome relief.\n\n  On behalf of the many grateful coal miners and their families in West \nVirginia, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Senators Mike Enzi \nand Ted Kennedy. I thank them, yes, I do, on behalf of these people.\n  I was raised in the home of a coal miner. I married, 69 years ago, \nthe daughter of a coal miner. I know about the lives--the joys and the \nsadnesses that come to the lives--of the men and women who work in the \nmines. They are a special breed. They are going to a mine, where an \nexplosion has just occurred, to risk their own lives for other men and \nwomen who may be trapped in that mine. A special breed.\n  So I thank Senators Enzi and Kennedy for their great work. They have \nperformed a mission. I also thank Senators Isakson and Murray, the \nchairman and ranking members of the full committee and the Subcommittee \non Employment and Workplace Safety, who committed themselves to the \ntask of producing a mine safety bill. They were unyielding in that \neffort.\n  Along with Senator Isakson, Chairman Enzi and Senator Kennedy visited \nthe Sago and Alma mines in West Virginia. Yes, they did. I thank them \nagain. Along with Senator Isakson, Chairman Enzi and Senator Kennedy \nvisited the Sago and Alma mines in West Virginia. They talked with the \nfamilies of those who had perished. What a sad day. They took a \npersonal interest in the safety of the coal miners of my State.\n  When it came time to draft a committee bill, the chairman and ranking \nmember graciously solicited the ideas of Senator Rockefeller and \nmyself. Senator Rockefeller has been away for a while recovering from \nback surgery. He has been away for several weeks now. Senator \nRockefeller is a true friend of the coal miners of West Virginia and \nthe miners throughout the Nation. Senator Rockefeller has been \nrecovering from back surgery for several weeks now, but he contributed \nmuch--yes, much--to the discussions that produced this bill.\n  Even in recovery, Jay Rockefeller, my esteemed colleague, is a strong \npresence. He has been and is a strong presence in the Senate, and \nthroughout his career he has been a very forceful advocate for the \nsafety of coal miners, the miners of West Virginia.\n  With Senate passage today, our hopes are high that the House of \nRepresentatives will act quickly on legislation that can be enacted \ninto law. The sooner Congress passes legislation, the safer our coal \nminers will be at work, and the greater the likelihood the future \ndisasters can be prevented. Our Nation's coal miners and their families \ndeserve no less.\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4127\n\n  Madam President, I will be offering the Byrd-Gregg amendment to fund \nborder security and interior enforcement efforts. For those Senators \nwho want to secure the borders, here me now, those Senators who want to \nsecure the borders, this is the amendment that will help to provide a \nsource of funding to make it happen.\n  Of the 12 million illegal aliens in the country, it is estimated that \none in four were lawfully admitted to the United States, but they \noverstayed their visas to remain here illegally. Of the 19 terrorists \nwho carried out the September 11 attacks, 4 were illegal aliens who had \noverstayed their visas. Let me say that again for emphasis: Of the 19 \nterrorists who carried out the September 11 attacks, 4 were illegal \naliens who had overstayed their visas. They came as students, tourists, \nor business travelers.\n  It is estimated that 400,000 illegal aliens who have been ordered \ndeported by an immigration judge have disappeared--get that--\ndisappeared into the interior of the country. Let me say that again: It \nis estimated that 400,000--yes, you heard me, 400,000--illegal aliens \nhave been ordered deported by an immigration judge but have \ndisappeared, have faded into, have blended into the interior of the \ncountry.\n  Our border and interior enforcement personnel have asked for \nadditional resources and personnel to apprehend and deport these \naliens, but those law enforcement agencies have consistently been made \nto do with less than what they need to do their job. It is a dismal \nrecord.\n  To make matters worse, the pending bill grants amnesty to up to 12 \nmillion illegal aliens by rewarding them with temporary worker status. \nThe expectation and promise is that many of these illegal aliens who \nhave already successfully circumvented our immigration laws will \neventually adjust their status to legal permanent resident or leave the \ncountry when their temporary worker status expires.\n  Given the failure to prevent other immigrant workers from overstaying \ntheir temporary visas in the past, it is difficult to take such \nassurances seriously. The pending bill authorizes appropriations of $25 \nbillion--that is a lot of money--over the next 5 years for border and \ninterior security efforts. Yet there is little hope that such funds \nwill ever be made available.\n  The President has consistently underfunded--yes, Senators heard me \ncorrectly--the President has consistently underfunded border and \ninterior enforcement in his annual budgets, and he has consistently \nopposed efforts to replace those funds in the appropriations process. \nThe funding for our border and interior enforcement agencies has been \nso severely neglected that the President has been forced to deploy the \nNational Guard to our southern border with Mexico. This is a real \nnational security threat that will grow alarmingly worse if this \namnesty proposal is carried into effect. Our border security requires \nreal resources not more unfunded mandates.\n  Today, I offer an amendment, along with Senator Gregg, my esteemed \ncolleague--when I say ``esteemed'' I say that with great fervor, my \nesteemed colleague--the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security \nAppropriations, to help provide a source of funding to secure our \nborder.\n  The Byrd-Gregg amendment, or the Gregg-Byrd amendment, would require \nthe illegal aliens who would benefit from this amnesty bill to help pay \nits costs. What is wrong with that? It would require the illegal aliens \nwho would benefit from this amnesty bill to help pay its costs. That \nsounds pretty good to me. It would require illegal aliens to pay a $500 \nfee before gaining any benefit from the amnesty provisions of this \nbill. That is not too high a fee. This fee would be in addition to the \nother fees and penalties included in this bill.\n  The Gregg-Byrd amendment would dedicate those moneys to the \nappropriations accounts where border and interior security efforts are \nfunded. Our amendment makes available almost $3 billion.\n  That is no small sum of money: $3 billion. That is $3 for every \nminute since Jesus Christ was born; $3 for every 60 seconds since our \nLord and Saviour Jesus Christ was born. That is a lot of money.\n  Our amendment would make available almost $3 billion in the next 2 \nfiscal years to apprehend and detain those aliens who are inadmissible \nand deportable under the Immigration Act. It would make funds available \nto help our Border Patrol acquire border sensor and surveillance \ntechnology. It would provide funds for air and marine interdiction, \noperations, maintenance, and procurement; for construction projects in \nsupport of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to train Federal law \nenforcement personnel, and for maritime security activities.\n  These are essential border security equipment needs that have been \nneglected for too long--too long--and continue to be neglected. So I \nthink it is only fair and appropriate that the illegal aliens who have \ncreated the need for these funds help to finance them. Yes, this is a \nnecessary amendment if Senators hope to secure the border.\n  The Byrd-Gregg amendment would help to provide some certainty that \nthe law enforcement mandates of this bill would be carried into effect. \nIt is not enough to authorize border security. We need to fund it. We \nneed to fund border security. The Senate must ensure that the aliens \nwho are supposed to leave are made to leave, and that the agencies \ncharged with that responsibility have the resources that those agencies \nneed to do their job.\n  I urge the adoption of the Byrd-Gregg amendment.\n  Madam President, I call up amendment No. 4127.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 4127.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To fund improvements in border and interior security by \n           assessing a $500 supplemental fee under title VI)\n\n       On page 537, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 645. SUPPLEMENTAL IMMIGRATION FEE.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Fee.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), any alien who \n     receives any immigration benefit under this title, or the \n     amendments made by this title, shall, before receiving such \n     benefit, pay a fee to the Secretary in an amount equal to \n     $500, in addition to other applicable fees and penalties \n     imposed under this title, or the amendments made by this \n     title.\n       (2) Fees contingent on appropriations.--No fee may be \n     collected under this section except to the extent that the \n     expenditure of the fee to pay the costs of activities and \n     services for which the fee is imposed, as described in \n     subsection (b), is provided for in advance in an \n     appropriations Act.\n       (b) Deposit and Expenditure of Fees.--\n       (1) Deposit.--Amounts collected under subsection (a) shall \n     be deposited as an offsetting collection in, and credited to, \n     the accounts providing appropriations-\n       (A) to carry out the apprehension and detention of any \n     alien who is inadmissible by reason of any offense described \n     in section 212(a);\n       (B) to carry out the apprehension and detention of any \n     alien who is deportable for any offense under section 237(a);\n       (C) to acquire border sensor and surveillance technology;\n       (D) for air and marine interdiction, operations, \n     maintenance, and procurement;\n       (E) for construction projects in support of the United \n     States Customs and Border Protection;\n       (F) to train Federal law enforcement personnel; and\n       (G) for maritime security activities.\n       (2) Availability of fees.--Amounts deposited under \n     paragraph (1) shall remain available until expended for the \n     activities and services described in paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nThomas be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I wonder if I might inquire of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia if he would be willing to \nenter into a time agreement on the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I would. May I defer to my distinguished \ncolleague, Mr. Gregg, that he might speak at this time on the \namendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Of course. But if we could enter into a time agreement, \nI would suggest 1 hour equally divided. We are trying to work through--\nno one knows better than Senator Byrd, who was the distinguished \nmajority leader\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\nfor many, many years, and the President pro tempore, what is involved \nin trying to work through time agreements. I do not know that we will \nneed all that time, but it would be my suggestion, if it is acceptable \nto you, I say to Senator Byrd and Senator Gregg, that we have a 1-hour \ntime agreement equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is fine with me.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would be agreeable to a time agreement. And I believe my \ncolleague, Senator Gregg, would be willing--he has nodded in the \naffirmative.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then I propose a unanimous consent request, Madam \nPresident, on the Byrd-Gregg amendment, that there be a 1-hour time \nagreement, with no second degrees in order, and that the 1 hour be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, did I hear the Senator include the \nprovision that there be no second-degree amendments?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I did.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, may I inquire of the floor manager, on a \nseparate matter. I am going to speak, obviously, to this amendment \nwhich Senator Byrd has offered, which I am happy to cosponsor. If I \ncould get the manager's attention, I ask unanimous consent that after \nwe complete this amendment we go to my amendment, that I offer with \nSenator Cantwell, as the next piece of business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you.\n  Madam President, I join with Senator Byrd in sponsoring his \namendment, which is a right and proper amendment in the context of the \ncost of containing our borders and the fact that most of that cost is \nincurred as a result of illegal activity occurring on the borders and \nespecially people coming across the borders illegally.\n  The amendment essentially adds $500, which, as I understand it, the \nway it is constructed, will not be actually called upon unless the \nAppropriations Committee determines that it needs the money in order to \nimprove border security. It is likely it will be called upon because we \ndo need those funds to improve border security.\n  The total amount this would raise, as the Senator from West Virginia \nhas pointed out, is about $3 billion--$2.8 billion. That is a lot of \nmoney, as he pointed out--$3 for every minute, I think he said, since \nthe birth of Jesus. It is, however, only a small portion of what is \ngoing to be necessary in order to properly secure the borders.\n  We know, for example, that it will cost us about $2 billion to move \nforward with fully implemented sensor and surveillance technology on \nthe border. We know it will cost approximately $2 billion, in addition \nto the $2 billion I just mentioned, to do a fully integrated \ncommunications system on the border. And we are talking just the \nsouthern border. We know that in order to upgrade the air fleet, which \nis extremely aged--the P-3s being almost 40 years over their useful \nlife and the helicopters being 20 years over their useful life--it will \ncost $2.4 billion.\n  So there is a great need for funds to adequately secure the border. I \nthink we have all agreed in this Senate--and I think it is the \nconsensus of the American people--that the first effort in the area of \ncontrolling illegal immigration should be the securing of our borders, \nand especially our southern border, which has been the point of most \nconcern relative to illegal immigrants coming across the border.\n  So this amendment says, if you are going to obtain citizenship in \nwhat has been described as earned citizenship, an element of that \nearning of citizenship--since you are already here illegally, according \nto the 12 million people who would be qualified for this and be subject \nto this additional fee--an element of earning that citizenship is to \npay a fee, much as you would pay a fine for violating the law, which is \nwhat happened here. In addition, of course, they go to the back of the \nline, and they have to show so many years of having worked here in the \nUnited States in a constructive way, and they cannot have violated \nAmerican laws.\n  But part of the element of earning that citizenship is to pay a fine. \nWhat we are suggesting is that in addition to the base fine--which is \npresently now, I believe, at $2,750, after all the amendments on the \nfloor--we would add an additional $500. So the fine would essentially \nbe--or the fee, however you want to describe it; depending on which \nside of the debate you are on, we use different terminology, but it is \nthe same thing--the person seeking to change their status from illegal \nto legal would have to pay this fee. It would be $3,250 total, $500 of \nwhich would go to helping us secure the border so we would not have \nthis problem in the future of so many illegals coming across the \nborder.\n\n  It is not an exceptional amount of money. Some people are going to \nargue that it is too much money to ask people to pay. That is really \nnot a lot of money to pay to get in line to become an American citizen. \nIt is a fairly reasonable request, in light of the fact that they are \nalready here, they have a job, they are earning money, they are taking \nadvantage of our society, and now they want to participate in the \nsociety as legalized citizens. Having come in illegally, it is \nreasonable to ask them to pay this additional fee. So this $500 which \nis being proposed by Senator Byrd is both reasonable in the context of \nwhat people should be asked to pay and very important in the context of \ndoing an adequate job of protecting our border.\n  Senator Byrd has been one of the most aggressive and effective \nadvocates for a long time for beefing up border security. He has \noffered amendment after amendment to try to accomplish this. I have \ngreatly respected and, obviously, have enjoyed working with him on the \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security relative to trying to improve the \nborders and relative to all things that committee addresses. But this \nhas been a special focus of his, and he understands this issue.\n  This amendment reflects that understanding, that for all the good \nintentions and all the good words, if they are not backed up by \nresources--a point I have made on this floor innumerable times, and \nwhich is made by this amendment--you simply cannot accomplish your \ngoal. The goal, obviously, is to secure the southern border so that, to \nthe extent you can do it, you limit people coming in here illegally \nthrough the use of an intelligent border security system. That means \nelectronics. That means boots on the ground. That means adequate \naircraft. That means adequate unmanned aircraft. And that means \nadequate Coast Guard.\n  But it all takes dollars. As the Senator from West Virginia has \npointed out, the dollars simply have not been in the pipeline. The \ndollars are not in the pipeline. As I have mentioned before on this \nfloor, the budget which was sent up by the President, by the \nadministration, requested additional commitment to the border, but they \nused a plug number in the sense that they expected to pay for that with \n$1.2 billion in increased fees for people flying on airplanes. That is \nnot going to happen. Those fees are not going to happen. And it is \nreasonable they should not happen.\n  People flying on airplanes are not crossing our border illegally. \nPeople flying on airplanes are not using land transportation into this \ncountry. The land transportation security system should not be paid for \nby the air traffic security system. The air traffic security system \nshould pay for itself, and to a great extent it does through the taxes \nput on people who are flying. The TSA is paid for, in large part, by \nthat. But we should not increase further the taxes on people flying and \nthen take that money and use it on the borders to support land \ntransportation security.\n  I have suggested that maybe we should put a toll down on the border. \nIt costs me 75 cents to go from Nashua, NH, to Manchester, NH, which is \nabout 18 miles. With the cost of 50 cents to come across the border, we \ncould raise this money. That was objected to. There are some treaty \nissues there, and also some cultural issues.\n  But there is another approach, and it is a good approach. It is to \nsay to the people who abused our border, who took advantage of the fact \nwe did not have adequate security on our border and came into our \ncountry illegally: Listen, when you want to put yourself\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\nin the status of a legal citizen--go to the back of the line, earn your \ncitizenship--part of that is to pay the cost of making the border \nsecure.\n  So the Senator from West Virginia has come up with an excellent \nproposal. I strongly support it, and I certainly hope the Senate will \nsupport it as we go forward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Byrd and Senator Gregg, for offering this amendment.\n  The concern which I have is whether it will be counterproductive, in \nputting such an increased burden on the undocumented immigrants, that \nthey will not come forward.\n  The fines and fees have been very carefully calibrated during the \ncourse of committee deliberation. On those who have been here for more \nthan 5 years, we had assessed the fine or fee at $2,000, with $1,600 \ngoing to Border Patrol. With respect to those who were here 2 to 5 \nyears, we have put on a fee of $1,000 less than those who were here \nmore than 5 years because they have to return. And out of that $1,000, \nwe have allocated $800 to border security. There are other fines, $500 \nfor spouse and children on deferred mandatory departure and $400 on \nagriculture jobs adjustment status. It was the calculation of the \ncommittee, after considering the matter carefully, that that was the \nappropriate fine.\n  It would always be a good idea to find some other source of revenue \nto help defray expenditures from the general Treasury, but what we are \ntrying to do here is to calibrate a system where we will achieve the \nobjective of imposing fines as much as we think the traffic will bear \nand still bring the undocumented immigrants out of the so-called \nshadows and not create a fugitive class. I intend to stick with the \ncommittee recommendation which is the committee bill.\n  Therefore, as much as I respect and admire Senator Byrd, I am \nconstrained, as chairman of the committee, to oppose the amendment. It \nis a judgment call as to what will be accomplished, a judgment call as \nto whether $2,000 is right or $2,500 is right or $3,000 is right. We \ndon't want to get involved in an auction sale, obviously, but that is \nthe position I take as manager of the bill.\n  Next in line is the Gregg amendment. We ought to be prepared to move \nto that amendment at the conclusion of debate on the Byrd-Gregg \namendment. I don't know how much longer the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia will want to speak or whether the Senator from \nMassachusetts will speak. A unanimous consent request is being typed up \nnow. We have 14 amendments to go. We are working through time \nagreements. We would like to have Senators on the next amendment lined \nup. That would be Senator Gregg. Beyond Senator Gregg, the next \namendment will be Senator Landrieu's amendment. So we give notice to \nSenator Landrieu that she should be on deck.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I regret that I was necessarily absent \nfor a good part of the Senator's presentation. I am familiar with the \nissue. I applaud his concern about whether there are going to be \nadequate resources to deal with issues of enforcement, detention, and \nlegal enforcement. These are all worthwhile undertakings. The real \nissue is, in the compromise legislation we are going to raise $18 \nbillion. The Cornyn amendment adds between $5 and $6 billion. As I \nunderstand it, the Byrd amendment is $3 billion on top of that. And we \nhave raised fees on immigrants quite significantly so that there will \nbe a considerable additional burden.\n  About 35 percent of those who will be adjusting their status are \noverstays, and so they had nothing really to do with border security, \nalthough border security is enormously important. We can't reallocate \nthe resources, the fines or fees, on people that had come across the \nborder. It seems to me that these fees are enormously costly. Under the \nCornyn amendment, it is going to be an additional payment for every \nchild. We reach a point where we are talking about people of extremely \nmodest means, reaching a ceiling. I think we crossed it even with the \nCornyn amendment.\n  I reluctantly oppose the amendment. But I want to give assurance to \nthe Senator from West Virginia that we will monitor this very closely. \nHe is on our side the leader on the Appropriations Committee. We have \ntalked over his general concerns on a wide range of issues relating to \nimmigrants. We remember the border security issue of a couple years \nago, and he was very involved in wanting to make sure of the integrity \nof the system. He was very involved in the debate on those questions. \nThis subject matter is not a new matter for him. It is a matter of \nenormous importance. I hope we will be able to handle it under the \nexisting provisions and we would not need the additional resources that \nare included in his amendment.\n  We want to give him assurance that we will keep in close contact with \nhim to let him know what the current situation is, and we will always \nhave an opportunity in the future to revisit it. I join with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and hope that it will not be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request. It \nhas been coordinated with the Democrats, and it is appropriate to \npropound it at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the debate in relation to the \nByrd amendment, it be temporarily set aside and the Senate proceed to \nthe following amendments: Senator Gregg, 60 minutes equally divided; \nSenator Landrieu No. 4025, 20 minutes equally divided; Senator \nHutchison No. 4046, 30 minutes equally divided; Senator Sessions, \nBudget Act point of order and a subsequent motion to waive, 1 hour for \nSenator Sessions, 30 minutes for Senator Kennedy, 30 minutes for \nmyself; I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back \nof the above mentioned times, the Senate proceed first to a vote on the \npending motion to waive the Sessions budget point of order, to be \nfollowed by votes in relation to the above listed amendments in the \norder offered; provided further that there be no second degrees in \norder prior to the votes, there be 2 minutes equally divided for debate \nbetween the votes, and finally, all votes after the first vote in this \nsequence be limited to 10 minutes in length, with the times for voting \nrigidly enforced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the bill authorizes $25 billion over 5 \nyears in appropriations. This amendment by Senator Gregg and myself \nfunds $3 billion of that amount. This is a modest sum, a modest \namendment, a modest fee increase that Senator Gregg and I are asking \nfor. The pending bill would provide amnesty for the illegal aliens who \nwould benefit from the bill. It would provide a path leading to U.S. \ncitizenship. It would provide access to taxpayer-funded benefits such \nas Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, unemployment compensation, \nfood stamps. Illegal aliens who would benefit from the bill are getting \na lot, significantly more than what they are being asked to pay into \nthe system. I don't believe that it is too much to ask that they help \nto fix the border security system that they sought to undermine.\n  This amendment is specific. It targets those areas identified by the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that are most in need of \nfunds. I also note that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nthis bill would authorize $25 billion in appropriations over the next 5 \nyears. Six billion of that is authorized for fiscal year 2007, and \nSenator Gregg and I, as the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee, are going to be asked to fund \nmany of these border security authorizations. We need a source of \nrevenue with which to do it. So the purpose of this amendment is to \nprovide a source of funding for our border security needs and to do it \nas quickly as possible.\n  This amendment would make almost $1 billion available for border and \ninterior security needs for the fiscal year 2007, which the \nAppropriations Committee can provide this summer when it writes the \nbill. This amendment\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\nwould make another $2 billion available in the fiscal year 2008.\n  We can't afford to delay this critical funding any longer. I hope \nSenators will support this amendment.\n  (Mr. DeMint assumed the chair.)\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n\n                             Amendment 4114\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I see my good friend from New Hampshire \ncoming to the floor to offer his amendment. I must rise in opposition \nto the soon to be pending amendment, which would essentially do away \nwith the original purpose of the diversity visa program.\n  As a Member of the House, I helped create this program, which my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, created in the Senate in 1990. It had a \nvery simple purpose, and that was this. Our immigration laws were based \non family reunification and certain other qualifications, so there were \nwhole ranges of countries from which people could not get visas. They \ntended to be European and African, even though the vast majority of \nAmericans are descendents of Europeans and Africans. But because for \nseveral generations no people had come from those countries--the people \nwere either third cousins or unrelated to people here--the family \nunification, a very noble purpose, took predominance and the \noverwhelming majority of immigrants came from the Caribbean, Latin \nAmerica, and Asia. This diversity program was a small program, and it \nwas intended to allow some from other countries to come. In fact, my \ncity of New York has dramatically benefited from this program, and \ndiverse countries such as Ireland, Poland, and Nigeria have had large \nnumbers of immigrants to be able to come, set roots, and help the \ndiversity of New York and of America.\n  So this is an excellent program. Nobody has said it has done a bad \njob. It is small. There are only about 50,000 visas a year. It is \nreally based on the idea of new seed. I believe every immigrant is \nspecial because they, or all of us who descend from them, come from a \nspecial group of people who had the guts and the gumption to get off \ntheir butts and basically come to America. They said: I don't want to \nlead this disease-ridden, impoverished life. I am willing to come here \nand take a risk. That is one of the reasons America is a special \nplace--the idea of bringing new seed to this country, people who are \nwilling to risk everything, is great.\n  I have one example. I met a man named Napoleon Barragan, who probably \nwould not qualify under this program. He founded 1-800-Mattress. It \nemploys about a thousand people in Queens. I went to his office and saw \nthis picture in which there were grass huts with kids playing in the \nfront. He said: That is the village in which I was born in Ecuador. He \nsaid: Of all those kids, only one had the gumption, the guts to leave \nthat impoverished, disease-ridden life and come to America. He said: Do \nyou know who that was? I said no, but I had an idea. He said: Me. He \nwent on to found a company that employs a thousand people.\n  My friend from New Hampshire and colleague from Washington say let's \nhave more visas for highly educated people. I am all for that. But this \nbill puts a whole lot of visas in for that, and that is why groups as \ndiverse not only as the NAACP and U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \nbut the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, and I am even told that Microsoft opposes this amendment \nbecause they are very happy with the much needed increase in people who \nhave certain skills and certain education. I think America should admit \nmany more of those people but not at the expense of this small, \nsuccessful program that guarantees that other countries, such as the \nIrelands, the Polands, and the Nigerias that are unable to have \nimmigrants come in for family reasons, can get people to come into this \ncountry. So why can't we have both?\n  If you believe that immigrants are good for America, as I do, and you \nbelieve both highly educated people and new seed people are good for \nAmerica, why do we have to rob Peter to pay Paul? As I said, Microsoft, \nwhich has led the charge for more highly educated people, such as \nengineers and scientists, to be allowed into this country, is not \nasking that this program be changed. These companies recognize, as \nSenator Kennedy did in the Senate and as I did in the House a long time \nago, that this country is better served by bringing immigrants from all \nover the world at all levels. We certainly need more scientists and \nengineers, but we also need new immigrants like Napoleon Barragan--\nambitious people without money and a family connection--to come here \nand start new businesses.\n  The great thing about America is when you work hard, you benefit \nyourself, your family and, in that way, you benefit America. My own \nancestors were immigrants. They didn't come here with advanced degrees. \nMy father was an exterminator. I am a U.S. Senator. That says something \ngreat about America. But one of the things great about America is, \nagain, we allow people from all over the world to come here.\n\n  So I plead with my colleagues, keep the diversity visa program. It is \nsmall, 50,000 a year. From all the groups that want more educated \nimmigrants to come to America, we do not hear any need to take away \nfrom this program to add more. They are very happy with what Senator \nSpecter has done in the bill, as am I, which is increase the numbers of \nH-1Bs and other visas for these folks. We can have both. We do not have \nto rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  As I ride my bike around New York City on the weekends, I see what \nimmigrants do for America. This program has dramatically helped. \nNeighborhoods such as Woodlawn and Greenpoint have been revitalized by \nnew Irish and Polish immigrants. Neighborhoods such as East Flatbush \nand Harlem have been revitalized by West African immigrants. We don't \nhave to stop this program.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on a well-intentioned but misguided \namendment and preserve the diversity program as well as other parts of \nthe bill that allow more educated immigrants to come to this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am not sure of the status of my \namendment. I understand there was a unanimous consent agreement that it \nwould be limited to an hour in time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Am I to presume that the statement of the Senator from New \nYork comes off of the opposition's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After the amendment is offered, there is 1 \nhour equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator's statement be taken out of that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GREGG. First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that from \nthe previous order of the Hutchison amendment be 4101 rather than 4046 \nand that the time under that amendment be 40 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time on the \nByrd-Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4114\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4114.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4114.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time just \nallocated to the Senator from New York be applied against the time in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment is offered by myself and \nSenator Cantwell. The purpose of this amendment is really pretty \nsimple. We as a nation are in the process of addressing how we handle \nthe illegal immigrant situation and immigration generally. We are about \nto basically give a large number of people--10 million, maybe 12 \nmillion--who arrived here illegally the opportunity to get in line and \nearn their citizenship.\n  Those people, for the most part, don't have any unique skills that \nmade them special to American society. They came here, they were \nwilling to work--which is, of course, great--and they are hard workers, \nin most instances. We didn't seek them out because we felt they were \ngoing to create jobs in the United States. But we do have this program \ncalled the lottery program where we essentially say to anybody in \ncertain countries which are alleged to be underserved and have few \npeople, immigrating into this country: You can get into the lottery and \nyou can get in line, get a green card, and become an American citizen.\n  There are 50,000 winners handed out every year. It just seems to us \nthat if we are going to have such a program in the context of overall \nimmigration reform, we ought to be saying that people who participate \nin this lottery are people who we as a nation actively need in order to \nmake our Nation stronger socially and economically, rather than simply \nsaying to everyone in the Ukraine: You can participate in the lottery. \nWe might get a cab driver or an unemployed cab driver as a winner of \nthe lottery.\n  We would say to the people in the Ukraine: If you have an advanced \ndegree which America feels would be constructive to our society in \nmaking us a stronger society, then you can participate in the lottery.\n  What we have done is taken two-thirds of the lottery options, 33,000, \nand said for those alleged underserved countries, people with advanced \ndegrees will be able to compete for those options. Then we left one-\nthird for anybody to compete for the lottery status. This only seems to \nmake sense.\n  If we listen to the debate on this floor, we hear a lot about \noutsourcing of jobs, the fact America is losing jobs overseas. What we \nare proposing essentially is to bring people into our country who \ncreate jobs because they have certain skills and abilities, certain \ntalents which we as a nation know we need.\n  Take, for example, the issue of engineers. We are confronting a world \nwhere countries such as Japan and especially China are graduating \nliterally four, five, six times the number of engineers we are \ngraduating. We are just not producing enough people in the science \ndisciplines to keep up with our needs as a nation to be competitive \neconomically.\n  So it makes sense that we should go around the world and say to \npeople who have these types of talents: If you want to come to the \nUnited States, we have certain programs we can use to help you come \nhere. One, of course, is the H-1B program which, under this bill, has \nbeen significantly expanded and is an appropriate program. But in order \nto participate in the H-1B program, you must be a family member of \nsomebody in the United States who will sponsor you or you have an \nemployer who has said they want to bring that person to the United \nStates to work for them.\n  What we are suggesting is there are countries where a lot of these \nAmerican employers are not going to go because the return on their \nefforts isn't that high and there are a lot of places where people who \nhave these degrees don't have family members in the United States, so \nthey are totally shut out of their ability to participate in coming to \nAmerica, even though they may have skills and talents which we in \nAmerica feel strongly will help us.\n  Rather than have a lottery system which says to the unemployed cab \ndriver in Kiev, You should have a chance to come to America, we are \ngoing to have a lottery system that says to the physicist in Kiev, You \nhave a shot at coming to America.\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\n  This seems to make sense because it isn't as if we as a nation \nhaven't already attracted to us a large number of unskilled people. We \nalready have that situation, and this bill is trying to address that \nsituation. We literally have millions of unskilled people who are going \nto be put in line for American citizenship under this bill. It would be \nappropriate, therefore, it seems, to take this small number of people \nwho can't qualify to come here, even though they may have the skills we \nneed, because they don't have a family member and they don't have an \nemployer sponsor and say to those folks: Yes, we are going to give you \nthe opportunity to come here, too, through participating in this \nlottery system. That is what this proposal does.\n  The idea that some of these nations that have been described as \ndiverse--that is one of those nomenclature, feel-good, politically \ncorrect terms put on something when it doesn't make a lot of sense. In \nthis instance, it has no applicability at all. The fact is, these \ncountries which qualify under what is called the diversity lottery \nactually have a large number of people here illegally. Most of those \npeople are unskilled. They have just shown up, they came here \nillegally, and they are going to be able to get in line now under this \nbill. So it makes sense that we should say to those nations--for \nexample, we know that Poland has approximately 50,000 people here \nillegally. Most of them don't have unique skills. We should say: If you \nare in Poland and you want to come to the United States and you want to \nuse the lottery system to come here, you have to have a skill we need \nas a nation in order to participate in that lottery.\n  It is estimated that there are almost 200,000 people from Africa who \nare in this country illegally and who are probably totally unskilled. \nWhat we are suggesting is bring a skill with you if you want to come to \nthis country through the lottery system.\n  We are not suggesting these countries won't get their fair share of \npeople who are the types that were described by the Senator from New \nYork who come here with a desire to produce and be successful. Those \nfolks may already be here illegally, and they will be able to get in \nline or they can compete for a third of the lottery system that is not \ngoing to be targeted toward talents that America needs.\n  What we are suggesting is that we should have a win-win situation. If \nwe are going to set up a lottery, not only should the person who wins \nthe lottery be a winner and win the right to come to the United States, \nbut the people of America should be winners by attracting into the \ncountry people whom we have a pretty good idea are going to be able to \ncontribute to the betterment of our Nation because they will bring \ntheir talents.\n  That is critical in this world today. As I mentioned before, we are \nconfronting a world where our capacity to compete is tied directly to \nour brain power. We can't compete with the Chinese on labor because \nthey have a billion more people than we have. But where we can compete \nwith them is by producing ideas that are better, by taking ideas that \nare good and making them better, by adding value through talent and \nability. So we should be attracting to America people who can help us \ndo that. We should be going across the world and saying: Give us your \nbest and your brightest; come here and participate in the American \ndream and raise the waters so that all the boats float higher.\n\n  This lottery system, to the extent it makes sense, should be built \naround that concept. It should not be built around the concept if you \nhappen to have a high-school education or you happen to have held a job \nin 2 out of the last 5 years, you have some right to participate in a \nlottery to get into the United States. That makes no sense to us as a \nnation.\n  This is not a unique approach, by the way. In fact, most nations \ndon't do what we do. We basically have an open approach to immigration. \nMost people require some qualifying talent in order to immigrate to \nthose nations, especially western nations.\n  So with this small group, 50,000, as was pointed out--it is very \nsmall in the context of this entire bill when we are dealing with as \nmany as 12 million people--in this small group, at least we should do \nit the right way because, who knows, one of those folks who comes to \nthis country with an advanced degree in science or an advanced degree \nin medicine may be the person who produces the vaccine that saves us if \nwe confront a terrorist attack or produces the next thought process or \nsoftware process that creates the next engine of dramatic expansion in \nthe telecommunications world or is the next Bill Gates of the world.\n  Attracting people who have talent and ability should be one of our \npurposes. In the context of a lottery system, it should clearly be our \npurpose. Lottery, by definition, means you should win, and not only \nshould the people who win the lottery win, but the people who are \nbasically underwriting the lottery should win, and the way Americans \nwill win under the lottery system is to attract people who have a \nlikelihood of contributing significantly to the betterment of our \nNation.\n  That is why we propose this amendment. It is proposed by myself and \nSenator Cantwell. Granted there have been some big issues discussed in \nthis Chamber--this is not a big issue, but it is an issue of \nsignificance. I appreciate Senator Cantwell being a cosponsor of this \namendment. She comes from a State where commitment to high tech and \nintellectual property is something that has really built up that State \nand has been a great driver not only of the prosperity of Washington \nState, but of the whole Nation. So she understands the importance of \nthis type of approach. I thank her for joining me in this approach of \ntaking two-thirds of these available lottery slots and saying they \nshould be made available to people from underserved countries, but \npeople in those countries who have obtained degrees in the areas that \nwe as a nation determine are important to continuing to promote our \nprosperity as a culture and as an economy.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time is available, 10 minutes, \n5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 19 minutes remaining for the \nproponents of the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. \nI simply want to say that if I were a teacher and giving out grades for \ncommonsense amendments to the immigration legislation, I would give the \nGregg-Cantwell amendment an A-plus. I think everyone listening and \nthinking about this issue would feel the same way.\n  Here we are in the United States of America at a very competitive \ntime where we earn 25 percent of all the money in the world for just 5 \npercent of the people, and we know how we do that. We do it primarily \nthrough brain power. Eighty percent of our new jobs since World War II \nhave come from our advantage in science and technology. Of course, we \ngrow a lot of our own brain power, but increasingly we have been \ninsourcing.\n  Mr. President, of the 100 American Nobel Prize winners in physics, 60 \nof them are immigrants or children of immigrants. Go down to the Oak \nRidge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which is the largest science \nlaboratory in America. The top three positions are held by people with \ngreen cards, foreign nationals. There is a man at Oak Ridge who is one \nof those three who is in charge of the United States effort to \nrecapture the supercomputing lead in the world, which we lost to Japan. \nHe is a citizen of India. He has a green card.\n  So Senator Gregg and Senator Cantwell, I think, are exactly right. \nThey are saying that in this large immigration bill where we are \ntalking about bringing millions of more people into the United States \nunder certain conditions, two-thirds of the lottery tickets for 50,000 \npeople ought to go to the highly educated persons from these \nunderserved countries who then can come to our country and help us \ncreate a standard of living. It is in our interest to do this.\n  I am glad the Indian citizen is in Oak Ridge, TN, in charge of our \nsupercomputing effort to lead the world. I am glad Warner von Braun \ncame to the United States to help us win the space\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\nrace with the Soviets. I am glad that of the 100 Nobel Prize winners in \nphysics, 60 of them are immigrants, are sons and daughters of \nimmigrants. I want more of them to come to this country because I know \nwhat is going on in India, and I know what is going on in China.\n  Senator Bingaman and I, and many other Senators, Senator Gregg \nincluded and Senator Kennedy has been a leader in this area as well, \nasked the National Academy of Sciences to tell us a year ago exactly \nwhat we need to do to keep our advantage in science and technology. \nThey gave us a list of 20 recommendations.\n  Among the most prominent of those recommendations was, make it easier \nfor the most talented men and women in the world to research and study \nin the United States of America and to stay here, not to run them off. \nWe don't want them to go home; we want them to stay here. It is in our \ninterest for them to stay here.\n  There are already two provisions in the underlying bill which help \nwith that, both taken from the Augustine report, as we call it, \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' by the National Academy of \nSciences. But the Gregg-Cantwell provision is exactly in that spirit. I \ndo not think it is too much to say that the National Academy of \nSciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of \nMedicine, who are worried about America's competitive position in the \nworld, would think that the idea of making it easier for 35,000 or \n37,000 of the best and brightest scientists in science, math, \nengineering, and computing to come, stay, live, work, and do research \nin the United States, create more jobs and raise our standard of \nliving, I think they would give a big cheer. I bet they would give an \nA-plus. I am not authorized to give out A-pluses for anyone except \nmyself. But I would think that all over America, those who know about \nthe Gregg-Cantwell amendment, who know about our competitive position \nin the world, would say: Absolutely right. If we are going to have \n50,000 more people coming in here, let's let them be the best and the \nbrightest who can help create new jobs in America.\n\n  We heard plenty of speeches in this Chamber about outsourcing jobs. \nThis is an amendment which insources brain power. Over the last half \ncentury, 80 percent of our new jobs have come from our advantage in \nscience and technology. This would help us keep that. I would hope this \nwould be a bipartisan amendment, strongly supported on both sides of \nthe aisle, and would be adopted by the conference report and would \nbecome law. So I salute the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator \nfrom Washington for their vision, and I am glad to cosponsor the \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, who has \nbeen a leader on the issue of education and how we remain competitive \nin the world, for supporting this amendment and for coming down here \nand expressing his kind and very effective words with which I obviously \ntotally agree.\n  The cosponsor of the amendment, Senator Cantwell, can't get down here \nright now. I know Senator Kennedy wishes to speak in opposition to the \namendment. I understand we are not going to vote on this amendment or \nthe other amendments until later this afternoon. I would suggest that \nwe be allowed to reserve our time--if it is acceptable to Senator \nKennedy--we will reserve our time for Senator Cantwell, even though it \nmay not be taken with the time that is running right now, if that is \nagreeable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we would be glad to accommodate the \nSenator from Washington. As we know, we have a general order that we \nare going to vote on a number of these amendments at a certain time, \nbut we will give the assurance--I will--that we will let her have her \ntime prior to the vote. We can work that out.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it might be as much as 15 minutes that she \nmay wish to take.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Whatever time remains on that side, as I understand, \nwould be hers and we will accommodate her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the diversity program is a small but vital part of our \nimmigration system, and I urge my colleagues to preserve the program by \nvoting against the Gregg amendment. This amendment would all but \ndestroy the diversity visa program, which has served our country well \nand continues to do so. Yet it would have no meaningful effect on \nskill-based immigration, which is already favored by our immigration \nlaws and is already being addressed elsewhere in the bill. That is why \ncivil rights groups and ethnic groups are united with business groups \nin opposition to this amendment.\n  I understand the thinking behind the Gregg amendment, and there are a \nfew people in the Chamber who have been more consistent supporters of \nhigh-skilled immigration than have I. I continue to support high-\nskilled migration, and the original McCain-Kennedy bill doubled the \nnumerical limits on high-skilled, employment-based migration. I also \nsupported additional changes in the Judiciary Committee to increase H-\n1B visa limits and to make it easier for H-1B immigrants to adjust to \npermanent status.\n  But the diversity visa program serves a wholly different purpose. The \npurpose of the diversity visa is not just to advance narrow economic \ninterests but, rather, to preserve our very heritage as a nation of \nimmigrants, a true melting pot. Unlike other visa categories, the \ndiversity visa is not about whom you know or to whom you are related. \nIt is a totally unique program because anyone with a high school \ndiploma or 2 years of meaningful work experience can apply.\n  Without the diversity visa program, our family- and employment-based \nimmigration system would ensure that virtually all immigrants to the \nUnited States would come from just a small handful of countries. The \ndiversity program ensures that America continues to be a beacon to the \nentire world and not just to a dozen or so countries with high numbers \nof immigrants already living here.\n  This chart here behind me shows, right here on the left, that of the \ngroups coming in now, 36.8 percent are Asian, 46 percent are Latin \nAmerican; that is 85 percent coming from the Caribbean countries or \nfrom Asia. We have 10 percent from Europe, 3 percent from Canada, \nOceania, and 3 percent from Africa. That is currently the mix that is \ncoming here.\n\n  When we passed the 1965 act, we tried to provide 10,000 to 15,000 to \neach country so that we would have a flexible and diverse system. When \nwe found out that for a variety of reasons we were getting this kind of \na focus, what we did was develop a very modest diversity program so \nthat other countries which were not participating, either with the very \nspecial skills or family relatives, would have an opportunity to come \nhere. They had to demonstrate that they had a competency so that they \nwere able to have skills which would make them active participants in \nour society. But it is limited to 42,000 as compared to 847,000, and \nlook how it is distributed. It is an entirely different group. You have \nsome from Africa, still have some from Latin America and Asia, but \nstill a good many from Europe--essentially and effectively a different \nscene. That is what we are attempting to do.\n  Now, we have been reminded by others of the fact that, well, we need \nto get to the special skills. But I would mention to our friends who \nare concerned about that, this is 50,000. Now look at what we are doing \nin terms of the special skills. We have close to 750,000 to 800,000--\n800,000 in this legislation, but the diversity is only 42,000. No one \ncould suggest that we haven't been sensitive to understand the \nimportance of people with high skills and what they can do in terms of \nour economy, but they are effectively wiping out this diversity \nprogram.\n  Now, as you can see, the diversity visa is especially important when \nit comes to African immigration. Fewer than 4 percent of our family- \nand employment-based immigrants come from Africa, but almost 40 percent \nof the diversity visas are used for Africans. And even though only 1 in \n20 green cards is a diversity visa, 1 in 3 green cards issued to an \nAfrican is authorized through the program. One sure effect of the Gregg \namendment is that it would substantially reduce African migration to \nthis country. There is just no other\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\nvisa out there that would replace these flows. That is one reason the \ngroups are opposed to the Gregg amendment, including the NAACP, the \nCoalition on Human Rights, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Irish Lobby for Immigration \nReform, the Illinois Coalition for Migrant and Refugee Rights, and a \nnumber of other groups.\n  What does the Gregg amendment hope to accomplish in exchange for \ngiving up this program? While the diversity visa program has unchecked \nsymbolic importance and is an important mechanism to protect balance \nand equality in migration flows, it is tiny in comparison to the \nexisting high-skill program because the rules already favor the skilled \nimmigrants. Three different classes of employment-based visas are \nreserved for the skilled immigrants and five different temporary worker \nprograms: the H-1B, the L visas, the P visas, the O visas, the TN \nvisas. These visas are already set aside for skilled workers. These are \noffices of various international companies that come in here; a variety \nof different kinds of visas. Some on the H-1B are virtually effectively \nalmost automatic to be able to go to a university site, to be able to \nteach. They are not counted within the H-1B. So all but one of the \nprograms already admit more immigrants than the Gregg amendment would \ngenerate through this change.\n  Business groups oppose the Gregg amendment. I have letters from the \nChamber of Commerce, the American Council on International Personnel, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable--all \nmajor business associations which support high-skilled immigration and \nall opposing the Gregg amendment.\n  So here is what the Gregg amendment would do. It would change the \ndiversity program from a tiny slice of the pie to a minuscule slice. \nThese are the two, the diversity visas being at the top. It is now a \nsmall group, which is gray in this setting, and you can look over here \nand it is still gray, but it is a fraction of what it is in terms of \nthe diversity flows. The flows are already one-twentieth, just one-\ntwentieth of high-skilled flows, and under the Gregg amendment, they \nwould be cut to less than 2 percent. These charts actually understate \nwhat is going on by a wide margin because the underlying bill already \nroughly triples numerical limits on high-skilled immigrants. Is the \nbenefit to high-skilled employers of an extra 37,000 visas really worth \nthe price of eviscerating this successful program? Are we willing to \ngive up so much to gain so little?\n  Another reason to oppose the Gregg amendment is that for millions of \npeople around the world, the diversity visa has come to symbolize the \nAmerican dream. Eight million people applied for this. Eight million \npeople look to the United States and say: Maybe I will have a chance. I \nhave to complete my high school or the equivalent of 2 years of \ncollege, so I have to meet those kinds of standards. I have to meet all \nthe other national security standards. You have to demonstrate that you \nare not going to be a burden, an economic burden. But 8 million people \nin countries all over the world--all over the world--who look to the \nUnited States as being the country of hope and liberty have a crack at \ngetting into the United States. Not much of one--42,000--but they have \nto come from the areas where we don't have large flows of immigrants \ncoming in. That was the purpose, for the United States to be a diverse \nsociety, to be the true melting pot at the time.\n  This is just a very small kind of a program. We are going to \nsacrifice that aspect for 8 million people all over the world who think \nthey may be the ones who have a shot at getting into the United States, \nand we will say: Oh, no, it is just going to be the highly skilled, \nwhen we have 800,000 of those already coming in here, three times as \nmany as we have now. How many is enough? How many is enough? So the \ndiversity visa program symbolizes what makes America great because with \na little luck and hard work, anyone can succeed here. We are the only \ncountry that can say that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have how much time? Half an hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield myself another 3 minutes.\n  An advanced degree is an income test in most of the world. The \ndiversity program symbolizes what makes America great because, with a \nlittle luck and hard work, anyone can succeed here. We are the only \ncountry that can say that. By shifting most of the diversity visas to \nthe world's privileged elite, the Gregg amendment will dash the hopes \nof those who dream of a better life. It would also shift the visas away \nfrom Africa and the developing world and toward wealthier European and \nAsian states. This would overturn the whole point of the program. \nAccepting the Gregg amendment would send a terrible message about what \nAmerica is all about; not a land of opportunity but, rather, an \nexclusive club.\n  I believe our diversity is one of the greatest resources of our \nstrength and one of the truly unique things about this country. In an \nearlier time our laws discriminated against those coming from major \nareas of the world. We eliminated the national origin quota system \nwhich discriminated against many of those who came from the \nMediterranean basin. We eliminated the Asian Pacific triangle. In 1964 \nwe had 127 individuals who came from Asia or from India or from \nPakistan and those areas--127. We eliminated what we called the Asian \nPacific triangle, which was the remnant of what this country faced in \nterms of the ``Yellow Peril'' part of our history in the early 1900s. \nWhat we have been trying to do is at least say to the world, if you \nhave immediate family, we put a high priority on families. But also, if \nyou have some special skills, fine. It means further employment.\n  But as we were looking at the further employment, I thought we were \nalso trying to educate and train Americans to be able to fill those \njobs. That is what I thought we were trying to do: Have this as a \nprogram so, right now, we have not got the Americans who can fill the \nvery highly technical kind of jobs that are demanded because we have \nnot given the training or the education. In the earlier H-1B we said we \nwere going to have a training fee, we were going to put that fee in to \ntrain Americans to be able to take those jobs.\n  Oh, no, the other side says. Let's just drain the Third World of \ntheir smart people to come here. After we have gotten 800,000 special \nskills, let's drain them as well. It seems to me at some time we ought \nto say, How about those jobs for Americans? But it seems the mood and \natmosphere is, Let's have as many of those bright people who come in \nhere, and it doesn't make much difference. There is not much talk out \nhere in the Senate about training and educational opportunities, \ninvesting in Americans. How quick it is, when it is just get more visas \nout there in the high tech area. Let's go ahead and do that.\n  This is wrong for a lot of reasons. I hope it will not be accepted. I \nbelieve diversity is one of our greatest sources of strength, one of \nthe truly unique things about this country. In earlier times, as I \nmentioned, we discriminated against major areas in the world. In 1965 \nwe reformed our immigration laws to get rid of those discriminatory \nquotas. In 1990 we acted again to ensure greater equality of \nimmigration by creating the diversity visa program. The Gregg amendment \nwould be a major step backward, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have? I believe the Senator from \nIllinois is on his way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I intend to yield a major part of that to the Senator \nfrom Illinois and then maybe retain a couple of minutes for response to \nthe Senator from Washington when she addresses the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. As a point of inquiry, if I can get the attention of the \nSenator to Massachusetts, just for the point of clarification, how much \ntime is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. And 8 minutes is remaining on the side in opposition, is \nthat correct?\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that that time be set aside and we \nmove on to whatever is the next matter, but that time be reserved for \ndebate on this matter at whatever time the parties wish to pursue it \nlater in the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do I have 7 or 8 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Gregg \namendment. This amendment would literally destroy the diversity visa \nprogram and threaten the jobs of American citizens. It would make worse \nthe brain drain which is occurring now, where some of the most talented \npeople from the poorest countries in the world are migrating to the \nUnited States.\n  This morning's New York Times had an important story, a story about \nhow the United States, through this legislation and other efforts, \nplans to lure nurses from some of the poorest countries on Earth. I \nvisited some of those countries. Senator Brownback of Kansas and I were \nthere just last December, in Democratic Republic of Congo. In the Congo \nthere are only 7 doctors per 100,000. In the Eastern Congo, there is \nonly one doctor per 160,000, and, I was told a surgeon is literally one \nin a million.\n  Think of the circumstances from which those doctors and nurses are \nbeing drawn to the United States. We can use the talent, that is for \nsure. But we have to understand that there is a zero sum here. We take \nthe talent from somewhere that needs it desperately.\n  The diversity visa program which is currently in place is open to \npeople of many talents. They may not have a Ph.D, and they may not have \na medical degree. It may just be a very ambitious entrepreneur with a \nsmall shop somewhere in the world who is willing to wait in line for a \nchance to come to the United States and maybe open another shop here, a \nshop that may grow into a larger business, employ people and make a \nlivelihood for him and his family. That is what the diversity visa \nprogram is all about, to provide immigration from people all around the \nworld, those who otherwise might not come to the United States, and to \ncontinue to make America the most diverse country in the world. That is \na fact which I think is one of our strengths and not one of our \nweaknesses.\n  Diversity visas open the door for thousands of people from around the \nworld to come to America. We make 55,000 diversity visas available each \nyear, and the draw of America is such that over 5 million people \napplied for those 55,000 visas in 2005.\n  The diversity visa program is the only opportunity to immigrate to \nthe United States for many people from lesser developed countries, \nespecially African countries. For example, of 55,000 diversity visas \nissued in fiscal year 2005, 10,000 went to African immigrants.\n  A recent article in the New Yorker magazine called the diversity visa \nprogram ``a splendid overseas marketing campaign for the American \nDream.''\n  Let me give an example of one American citizen who came to this \ncountry under the diversity visa program, which would be destroyed by \nthe Gregg amendment. His name is Army Specialist Sola Ogundele from \nNigeria. He came to the United States and he joined the Army. He \nrecently took his oath of citizenship in Iraq where he was serving the \nUnited States and risking his life for this country. Here is what he \nsaid.\n\n       I'm the happiest man on Earth today to be a U.S. citizen. I \n     know the sky is the limit for me in the United States. I have \n     absolute freedom to pursue my dreams.\n\n  People like Specialist Ogundele make the United States stronger, and \nmake us proud. That is what the diversity visa program contributes to \nour country.\n  I am the son of an immigrant. I know when my grandparents brought my \nmother to this country at a very early age, they were looking for that \nAmerican dream. I don't think they would have imagined the possibility \nthat their grandson would be the 47th Senator in the history of the \nState of Illinois. That is what it is all about.\n  The Gregg amendment fundamentally alters the diversity visa program, \nsetting aside two-thirds of these visas for immigrants who hold \nadvanced degrees in science, mathematics, technology, and engineering, \nsaying you can only be considered if you have an advanced degree. These \nset-asides would favor immigrants from wealthier countries and reduce \nthe diversity of future immigration to our country. By bringing in more \nhigh-skilled immigrants, the Gregg amendment would also increase \ncompetition for jobs here, jobs like computer programmers and \nengineers.\n  The H-1B visa program already allows those with specialized education \nto come the United States. Why don't we keep the diversity visa program \nintact? Why don't we protect this program for the value that it brings \nto America?\n  The H-1B visa program already grants 65,000 visas to high-skilled \nimmigrants every year. This bill would increase that number to 115,000, \nand allow that cap to increase by up to 20 percent per year. I am a \nlittle concerned, I might add, that the H-1B visa is entirely too \ngenerous. The Gregg amendment would add insult to injury, creating even \nmore competition for Americans wanting to keep their jobs.\n  The Gregg amendment would essentially convert the diversity visa \nprogram into just another H-1B program, bringing many more highly \ntrained competitive people to America. You can argue that is good for \nus. But, as I mentioned earlier, it is at the expense of someone else. \nI am concerned the Gregg amendment would really make this brain drain I \nhave talked about even worse.\n  This bill already includes provisions that will increase the brain \ndrain. The New York Times story I mentioned reports on a provision in \nthis bill that will lift the annual cap on the number of nurses who can \nimmigrate to our country every year. The article, which is headlined, \n``U.S. Plan to Lure Nurses May Hurt Poor Nations,'' talks about the \nimpact of importing nurses into the United States. They now have a \nsituation in the Philippines where there are so many nurses needed in \nthe United States that medical doctors in the Philippines are signing \nup to come to the United States as nurses, where they will be paid more \nthan they are paid in the Philippines as doctors.\n  I need not tell you what that means for the people in the \nPhilippines--fewer and fewer medical professionals that they \ndesperately need. This bill already includes provisions that will \nincrease the brain drain.\n  I want to tell you candidly, I have stood up for hospitals in \nChicago, in poor areas, that needed nurses. I have even stood up and \nexplained on the floor of the Senate why Filipino nurses should be \ngiven the chance to immigrate here. But I have second thoughts about \nthat today, after what I read in the New York Times about what is \nhappening in the Philippines and around the world. We have to think \ntwice.\n  I have an amendment, the brain drain amendment, No.4090, which I hope \nwill be considered by the chairman for inclusion in the manager's \npackage. This amendment would take two modest steps to address the dire \nshortage of healthcare personnel in the least developed nations of the \nworld.\n  In exchange for financial support for their education or training, \nsome foreign doctors, nurses, and pharmacists have signed voluntary \nbonds or made promises to their governments to remain in their home \ncountries or to return from their studies abroad and work in the \nhealthcare profession.\n  My amendment would ask a simple question to healthcare professionals \nwho are applying to work in this country: have you signed a commitment \nto work in your home country in exchange for support for your education \nor training? If they have made such a\n\n[[Page S5072]]\n\ncommitment, they would be inadmissible until they have fulfilled this \ncommitment.\n  Second, my amendment would allow doctors and nurses who are legal \npermanent residents of this country to work temporarily in developing \ncountries without prejudicing their own immigration status.\n  Many immigrants who have come to this country would like to \nparticipate in the fight against global AIDS and other health crises. \nUnder my amendment, they could lend their skills to the cause without \nsacrificing their own American dreams.\n  These small but important steps will not stop the brain drain, but \nthey will signal American leadership in the effort to help stem the \nmigration of talent from the poorest countries in the world to the \nrichest.\n  The Gregg amendment, on the other hand, would increase the brain \ndrain, reduce the diversity of immigration to the United States, and \nincrease competition for jobs that Americans want. I will oppose the \nGregg amendment and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gregg amendment and stick with the \ndiversity visa program.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are about to go to the amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, with 20 minutes \nequally divided. This is an amendment which relates to adoption \nprocedures. It has been reviewed by both Senator Kennedy and myself. We \nare prepared to accept it. But I understand there are some who oppose \nthe amendment. If anybody wishes to speak in opposition, they ought to \ncome to the floor now because we gave notice a couple of hours ago that \nthis amendment was going to come up under the unanimous consent \nagreement after we concluded with the Byrd amendment. Anybody who wants \nto oppose the amendment should come to the floor at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, is recognized to control 10 \nminutes, with 10 minutes in opposition.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4025\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, Mr. \n     DeMint, and Mr. Craig, proposes an amendment numbered 4025.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, May 23, 2006, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the manager of this bill for \naccepting this amendment and for basically agreeing to it. I am very \nhopeful that no one will show up and object to this amendment because \nit has broad bipartisan support. I offer it on behalf of myself, \nSenator DeMint, Senator Craig, Senator Brownback, and others who have \nworked for years to bring this amendment to a position of getting it \napproved on the Senate floor.\n  This amendment was actually started by one of our colleagues and a \ngreat mutual friend of many of us, Senator Don Nickles, the former \nSenator from Oklahoma, who spent a great deal of his career, besides \nbeing an expert in finance and budget matters, as a tremendous advocate \nfor adopted children, for families with adopted children, and to make \nthe process more accountable, more transparent, to remove the barriers \nto adoption, to remove any corruption associated with adoption, and, \nmost of all, was such a ferocious and effective advocate for children \nwho need homes.\n  We have millions of children around the world who need an opportunity \nfor a family. When Senator Jesse Helms was here many years ago, Senator \nHelms and Senator Joe Biden led the joint bipartisan effort to pass a \nnew treaty that was a model for the world, that was profound in its \nessence, that basically said children should be raised in families, not \nalone, not in a cardboard box, not in a ditch, not under a highway \nsomewhere, not left alone but should be raised and nurtured by a \nfamily.\n  I do not know what took us so long to come to that. Governments do a \nlot of things well, but raising children isn't one of them. Children \nshould be raised in a family.\n  They set about creating a treaty, which has now been agreed to by \nmany countries in the world, to set up a process of international \nadoption which goes something like this: Every child should try to stay \nwith the parents who bring them into the world, but if they are \nseparated from those parents by death, disease, war, famine, violence, \nor perhaps in some cases, as we know, the terrible thing of parental \nabuse, and children have to be removed to keep them safe and keep them \nalive, then we need to find another home for those children as quickly \nas possible--in their extended family, the treaty says.\n  After that, if there is no extended family opportunity somewhere in \nthe community, and if there is no family that can be found in the \ncommunity, then some family in the country. But if no family can be \nfound in that country suitable to raise a child with siblings, which is \nwhat the treaty says, to try to keep siblings together, then the \nchildren have a right to try to find a family somewhere in the world \nbecause, frankly, we are one human family.\n  I am so aggravated, as you can tell a little bit, that it has taken \nus so long to pass something that is quite so simple. I am very \ninterested, if a Senator wants to come and debate this issue. We only \nhave 10 minutes to debate it. I wish we had more time. I am going to be \nvery interested if someone wants to debate this. I don't think a \nSenator is going to come and oppose it. We have been trying to pass it.\n  There are some objections by the State Department. When Senator Helms \npassed the original treaty, they didn't think this was a big enough \nissue for them. Of course, they have very serious issues to deal with--\nthe war in Iraq and other things. But some of us think American \ncitizens adopting children from all over the world deserve a little \nsupport from their own Government to get this done.\n\n  Parents go through a lot, some of them, to build their families \nthrough adoption, and some parents want to expand their families \nthrough adoption, and at great expense to themselves. It is a very \nfundamental value for Americans to want to do this, and 20,000 \nAmericans do this every year. Some Members of Congress have adopted \nchildren from overseas.\n  The bottom line is, this bill, which is the Intercountry Adoption \nReform Act, helped to establish a center in the State Department. It \nstreamlines the bureaucracy. It eliminates a lot of red tape, and \nhopefully it will eliminate the cost. But it also makes sure that there \nis a central agency that works with the States and with our adoption \nagencies around the country. It just makes the process work better.\n  As I have said--and I am going to conclude with this--our children \nare adopted, and I am proud of that. Our children are adopted from this \ncountry. But I know hundreds and thousands of people who have children \nadopted from other countries.\n  We are proud of this process that has been implemented. We need to \npass this bill to make sure that when children come into this country \nthey come in as citizens--just as American citizens give birth to a \nchild overseas, they become automatic citizens. They don't need the \nextra step of a visa.\n  In addition to setting up a certification process for agencies that \nwill be very helpful and effective as we again try to eliminate \nbarriers to adoption and give parents a central agency which is \nrequired under this treaty, which all the countries now in the world \nare moving to, and while it respects our States' roles and respects the \nrole of adoption agencies, it provides a central place where this \nimportant work can take place and have a focus.\n  That is basically what it does.\n  I think Senator DeMint wanted to speak on behalf of this amendment. I \nwill be happy to answer any questions, and I will stay here on the \nfloor until our time has expired.\n  I sincerely submit this to my colleagues. Hopefully, it can be \naccepted,\n\n[[Page S5073]]\n\nas the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Pennsylvania \nindicated. It might be accepted without a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was wondering, I support the Senator's \namendment. I think it is a good amendment, as does the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  We would like to, if it is agreeable, temporarily set the amendment \naside. I think under our agreement it would be set aside in any event \nbecause we have a sequence of votes coming up. It would be our \nintention, unless someone comes down here, to go ahead and voice-vote \nit through. But the manager thinks we ought to give at least another 15 \nor 20 minutes for an opportunity--and we can use the time now for the \nSenator from Texas. If someone does come down, we will try to get the \nSenator a few more minutes since she has been very accommodating to try \nto respond to another Senator. If they do not, our intention would be \nto voice-vote it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I already stated, I think it is a good \namendment. As I also stated, there may be some who object to it who are \nnot here to raise their objection. I suggest that we just keep it \nlisted on the vote order. When it comes up, unless somebody reserves \nthe remainder of the time, and when it comes up on the vote order, \nunless somebody objects or wants to be heard, we will simply accept it \nat that time. And if somebody calls for a vote, we will go to a vote.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have no objection to that. Could the \nSenator give me some timeframe? Would it be on for another hour or 2 or \nwill this go on for several days?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Our schedule is as soon as we conclude this we turn to \nthe Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, for 30 minutes equally divided. \nShe will finish at about 2:45. Then we would go to Senator Sessions' \npoint of order under a time agreement of 2 hours, which would be 4:45. \nBut my sense is that there will be some time yielded. It won't go all \nthe way to 4:45. That is the approximate timeframe.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand we could do this, which sounds fine to me: \nWe would be voting sometime today either by voice or rollcall.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We will vote in this sequence when the votes start at \n4:45, or earlier.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this immigration debate has proved \ndivisive on many levels, but I believe there can be a shining beacon of \nagreement. In all of this back and forth, one group has been voiceless: \nthe infants and young children longing for a loving home who don't care \nabout or understand borders.\n  In 2004, I introduced the Intercountry Adoption Reform Act, known \nsimply as ICARE, in the House of Representatives. I am pleased to rise \ntoday to join my colleague, the Senior Senator from Louisiana, who is \nintroducing ICARE in this Congress as an amendment to the Immigration \nReform Act.\n  Adoption represents the very best of the generous American spirit. In \n2004 alone, Americans opened their homes through adoption to over \n23,000 orphaned children from overseas. We must ask, how many more \nchildren would be with a loving family today if the maze of government \nregulation was not so complex?\n  The ICARE amendment takes two important steps to break down the \nroadblocks these children face on their journey to find a permanent \nfamily. First, and most importantly, it affirms that foreign adopted \nchildren of American citizens should be treated in many respects like \nwe treat children born abroad to an American citizen. Under existing \nlaw, these children are treated as immigrants, having to apply for, and \nbe granted, immigrant visas to enter the U.S.--a process that we all \nknow to be cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive. Had they been \nborn abroad to American citizens, they could simply travel back to the \nU.S. with a passport and enter as citizens. This amendment eliminates \nthis discrepancy and injects common sense into the way our law views \nthese children.\n  Second, this amendment streamlines the existing foreign adoption \nfunctions of the Federal Government. Rather than having to navigate \nthrough three Federal agencies the Departments of State, Health and \nHuman Services and Homeland Security--adoptive parents would instead \nhave to deal with only one: a consolidated office of intercountry \nadoptions located within the State Department. I believe this is an \nessential step to cut through the layers of redtape that currently bind \nadoptive parents trying to give the gift of a family to a child from \noverseas.\n  Mr. President, our laws simply must do a better job of accommodating \nthe unique circumstances surrounding intercountry adoption, and I \nbelieve that is exactly what this ICARE amendment will do. That is why, \ntoday, I ask my colleagues to join the Senior Senator from Louisiana \nand myself in affirming our commitment to protect these children and \nprovide them with a loving home.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, if the chairman will yield, I thank the \nchairman and the ranking member for handling this amendment in this \nfashion. It is an important amendment. We have moved it before. We are \ndoing so very well in the area of adoption, both domestically and \ninternationally, at this moment. This is a great facilitator. We thank \nthe chairman for its consideration in this fashion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest that we conclude the \nconsideration of the Landrieu amendment and now move to the Hutchison \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4101\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it will be in order to go \nto the Hutchison amendment for 30 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to take 10 minutes and then be \nnotified when I have taken 10 minutes so I can reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. President, there is something missing from the debate that we \nhave had so far. I do think that this debate has been productive. I \nthink it has been civil. I think our differing views have been aired. \nAnd I think there has been a fair consideration of the bill on the \nfloor of the Senate. But no one is talking about the underlying cause \nof the problem of illegal immigration in our country. What can we do \nabout the root cause of the problem?\n  Most of the people who are coming here--not counting the criminals--\nthe people who come here to do criminal acts, such as drug dealers and \nhuman traffickers, people who come into our country surreptitiously to \nbecome a part of a movement that would harm our citizens, those people \nare in a different category. They are criminals. They intend to be \ncriminals. And one of the reasons we are trying to secure our borders \nis to keep people like that out of our country. But the vast majority \nof people who are coming across our borders are not people who wish to \ndo us harm. They are people who come here to work, to do better for \ntheir families. They want a better life. They are people who want jobs. \nTheir countries do not provide the number of jobs to absorb them into \nthe system. So they go to a neighboring country--our country--to seek \nthose jobs.\n  Is this good for our country? I would say when people have to risk \ntheir lives to come here, it is not good for our country. Is it good \nfor Mexico? It is certainly not good for another country to have a mass \nout-migration, especially because the people who want so much to work \nand to do better for themselves are the enterprising people of this \nsociety. If they had training, education, and opportunity, they would \nbe able to add even more to the economy of Mexico. As it is, their U.S. \nearnings are the second largest economic producer in Mexico, second \nonly to tourism.\n\n  We need to start talking about how we can address the issue of jobs \nin our country, address the issue of illegal immigration as we protect \nour borders and as we protect the economy of our country, but also to \ntry to do what is right for the people involved in this issue.\n  I rise today, joined by my colleague, Senator Bond, to offer an \namendment that is called the Secure Authorized Foreign Employee Visa \nGuest Worker Program. I am going to call it the SAFE visa. It is for \npeople who want to work in our country but do not wish to be citizens \nof the United States. It is modeled after the Canadian guest worker \nprogram with Mexico that has been in place for over 30 years.\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\n  Our amendment creates an additional guest worker program available to \nworkers from NAFTA and CAFTA nations. It is a pilot program. It does \nnot displace the guest worker program in the Hagel-Martinez bill. It is \nanother option. It would be one that could be expedited to meet the \ndemand of more workers in certain fields. It would also be something \nthe employers would know is safe for them to hire based on this visa.\n  The amendment seeks to create a new visa category for those \nindividuals who want to enter and work in our country legally but do \nnot seek a path to residency or citizenship in the United States \nbecause they want to remain citizens of their country of origin. They \nwould be able to take the money that is earned here and use it to \nimprove their living conditions and the living conditions in their \ncountry of origin.\n  Any legislation addressing immigration must firmly address the safety \nand security needs of the United States. In a world where terrorists \ncontinue to seek to harm Americans, we must protect our citizens. We \nhave every right to know who is in our country, who has crossed our \nborders, the nature, purpose, and length of the visit. We are negligent \nif we do not know those things.\n  Everyone in the Senate and everyone with whom I talk with wants to \nsecure our borders. I have visited with many of the Hispanic leaders in \nmy home State. I have visited with my Hispanic-American supporters and \nfriends. They all want to secure our borders. They are Americans. They \nare loyal Americans. They want to secure our borders. I have supported \namendments throughout this debate to help secure our borders and to pay \nfor these measures.\n  When I came to the Senate 12 years ago, I started the process of \ndoubling the Border Patrol because we had never sufficiently manned the \nborder. We are still in the process of doing that. We are not nearly \nwhere we need to be. We must have a sovereign nation and control our \nborders.\n  My proposed amendment will not strike any of the provisions of the \nunderlying bill. It will not eliminate the H-2C visa program that has \nbeen put into the bill. Instead, it would be adopted so that workers \nand employers have a choice. The SAFE visa would be tamper proof so \nthat an employer could look at this card, test it, and know it is \nvalid. It would have either a fingerprint or an eye matrix that could \nnot be duplicated, that immediately would let the employer know he or \nshe is able to hire this person because that person is legal.\n  The tamper-proof card enables us to have something employers could \ncount on which is not the case today. Today, an employer is at peril \nbecause the employer will look at a Social Security card. It may look \nperfectly valid, but we all know there are many fraudulent cards out \nthere in the market. The employer cannot be the policeman. There are \nemployers who are doing the wrong thing who should be charged with \ndoing the wrong thing, but there are many employers who try to do the \nright thing, but we do not have a tamper-proof visa that allows them to \ndo that.\n  Here are the guidelines in my amendment. All SAFE visa applicants \nwould be required to apply while in their home countries. This would be \na program generated in the home country. A guest worker would be \nsubject to appropriate background checks and required to present proof \nof secured employment before receiving the SAFE visa. The employer \nwould be responsible for withholding all standard payroll deductions so \nthat all employees are on an equal footing. You would not put the \nforeign employee under the American employee, thereby giving an \nadvantage to the foreign employee.\n  Medicare withholdings for SAFE cardholders would go into a fund to \npay for emergency health care provided to foreign workers. The SAFE \nvisa holder would not be eligible for Medicare, and therefore the money \nthat goes from the Medicare deduction would go into a fund to pay for \nuncompensated health care that would be provided to foreign workers in \nour country.\n  This has been an issue for hospitals all across our country that are \nserving the illegal aliens in our country. They are not compensated. It \nis a burden on these hospitals which we can relieve with this program.\n  The program would be structured for a maximum of 10 months per year \nof work. The person would then go home for 2 months and would be able \nto come back and renew his or her job on an annual basis. It would be \nlike a driver's license but annually renewable.\n  A SAFE visa holder could remain in the program as long as they \ncontinue to meet the qualifications. The visa would be terminated if \nthe worker is unemployed for 60 or more consecutive days. The SAFE visa \nworker would not be eligible for Social Security Programs such as \nwelfare or unemployment compensation. They would be able to take what \nis deducted from their paychecks for Social Security home with them \nwhen they retire from the SAFE visa program.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished cosponsor of the amendment, \nSenator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that the \namendment has not yet been called up. The Senator may wish to do so.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 4101.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself and \n     Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 4101.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To enhance border security by creating a pilot SAFE Visa \n Program to grant visas to authorized nationals of a NAFTA or CAFTA-DR \ncountry who receive employment offers in job areas in the United States \nthat have been certified by the Secretary of Labor as having a shortage \n                              of workers)\n\n       On page 313, after line 22, add the following:\n\n      Subtitle C--Secure Authorized Foreign Employee Visa Program\n\n     SEC. 441.

Secure Authorized Foreign Employee Visa Program.''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 5 minutes to the cosponsor of the amendment, \nSenator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am proud to be a supporter of the \nHutchison amendment. This is a model for the way things should work for \nseasonal workers. I hope this construct is one that could be agreed to, \nperhaps, in conference with broader application. Many of the criticisms \nof the current system with which I agreed are addressed by this \namendment.\n  Workers come to America to fill jobs unwanted by Americans, but they \nare staying and they are not going home. Workers who declared an intent \nto leave, instead, are requesting permanent residency and a path to \ncitizenship.\n  This is not the way things used to be when workers came to the United \nStates, worked a spell, and then returned to their foreign homes and \nfamilies.\n  The Hutchison amendment returns to those days. Workers have to apply \nfor the program from outside. They come in for 10 months to work and \nthen must return home for 2 months. They cannot bring their family for \nthe temporary work, and they may not apply for renewal within the \nUnited States or for permanent residency.\n  I am also delighted Senator Hutchison has taken the suggestion to \nensure that enough visas remain midyear for cooler States, such as \nMissouri, where our seasonal agricultural work does not begin until the \nlate spring or after. Many Missourians claim to me that past programs \nallowed all visas to be issued in waiver States at the beginning of the \nseason, and that left out the northern States.\n  I heard these concerns, and Senator Hutchison accommodated them, for \nwhich I am grateful. I hope this amendment is agreed to as a model in \nconference for the seasonal work program.\n  I also use this opportunity to talk about a modest little amendment I \nhave, No. 4071. Senator Gregg is a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent additional cosponsors be added, including \nSenator Hutchison, Senators Alexander, Allen, Burns, Coburn, Sununu, \nand Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4071\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have an amendment, No. 4071, for the \nbenefit of America's workers, America's universities, and America's \neconomy.\n  While we rightfully have spent a lot of time in the debate so far \ndiscussing low-skilled, undocumented workers, I want to spend some time \ndiscussing our vital need for legal, high-skilled, high-tech workers.\n  America's workers face a battle for their jobs. They are the finest \nworkers in the world. American workers grow, harvest, and mine some of \nthe world's highest quality and most plentiful raw materials.\n  American manufacturing workers made the U.S. a global giant, turning \nback fascism, and lifting millions into the middle-class.\n  American workers are not just out in the fields or on the assembly \nline. They are in the storefront serving customers. They are in the \nbackrooms placing orders and balancing books. They are on the streets \ndelivering wares. They are on the floors stocking products.\n  And who do all these workers count upon? What does every company need \nto compete and succeed in today's modern economy? They all need high \ntechnology, innovation, and invention.\n  It has become increasingly clear that if American workers are not \nsupporting high tech products in demand today, they are losing their \njobs.\n  If Americans are not using cutting edge technology to extract raw \nmaterials efficiently, or produce record harvests, they are losing \ntheir jobs. If American workers are not part of innovative companies \nmaking the next new gadget or gizmo, they are losing their jobs.\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\n  Where will tomorrow's innovations and inventions come from? Where \ndoes the brainpower needed to make a cell phone smaller, a plasma TV \nbigger, or digital camera clearer come from? Where does the know-how to \nmake disease-resistant crops, infection-killing drugs, and cars and \npower plants emitting only water come from?\n  These are the products that will cause new orders--the products that \nwill stock shelves and bring in customers--the products that most \nimportantly will provide new, plentiful, good-paying jobs.\n  They will come from our best and brightest, our engineers, our \nscientists. They will come from our mathematicians. They will come from \nour technology experts, full of new ideas and know-how.\n  They are among us even now--at our universities across the Nation. \nThey are in physics class. They are in computer science class. They are \ndoing their papers, their thesis, their dissertations.\n  They are graduating with their masters degrees and their PhDs. They \nare completing their post-doctoral work. And they are vital to every \nworker in the Nation.\n  They call these people STEM students--for science, technology, \nengineering, and math. They form the lynchpin of our high-tech economy. \nWithout them, there is no innovation, no invention.\n  Who are these STEM students? Increasingly, many STEM students \ngraduating from U.S. universities are from other countries. We can all \npicture them. Engineering students from India, science majors from \nChina. Foreign students are earning 30 percent today's U.S. doctorates \nin engineering, 50 percent in math, and computer sciences.\n  We are lucky to have them because the number of U.S. citizens \nenrolling in science and engineering is way down. From 1993 to 2000 it \ndropped 14 percent in total, 32 percent in math, and 25 percent in \nengineering.\n  U.S. undergraduate programs in science and engineering report the \nlowest retention rates among all disciplines. Less than half of all \nU.S. undergrads who attempt engineering or science majors complete a \ndegree in one of these subjects.\n  American companies are calling, regardless of the student's home \ncountry. The companies of every manufacturing worker, every accountant, \nevery stockperson, every salesman, are vying for our STEM graduates.\n  Employers hiring international students from Missouri universities \nlast year included: Cisco Systems, Intel, Honeywell, Proctor & Gamble, \nBlack & Veetch, Emerson, Cummins, and Deere among others.\n  And what are we doing with many of our international students? We \nhave put so much money into them, with tuition grants, loans and \nfellowships. We have poured so much time into their instruction, \ntutoring, and study. What are we doing with this vital resource?\n  We are kicking many of them out of the country. We are giving them \ninsufficient time for U.S. companies to place them. We are requiring \nthem to leave for 2 years before coming back. We are hurting their \nemployment chances by putting their long-term residency in doubt. All \nof these are ways that our antiquated visa system is out of touch with \nthe needs of our 21st century economy.\n  This at the very time American workers need them the most--at the \nvery time American workers are struggling to meet the 21st century \neconomy, we are undercut by outdated student visa rules.\n  At the same time, China and India are exploding with new engineers \nand scientists. Last year, according to Fortune Magazine, China \ngraduated over 600,000 new engineers, India 350,000, and the U.S. only \n70,000.\n  China is pouring government funds into research and development. They \nrecently decided to double such funding to 2\\1/2\\ percent of their GDP. \nIndia just boosted R by 10 percent.\n  The result as the Wall Street Journal recently portrayed: ``Low \nCosts, Plentiful Talent Make China a Global Magnet for R''\n  Foreign-invested R centers in China more than tripled from 4 years \nago. U.S. companies such as Procter & Gamble, Motorola, IBM, and others \nare opening research centers in China.\n  Motorola now has 16 R offices in five Chinese cities, with \naccumulated investment of about $500 million. Emerson, based in my home \nState in St. Louis, MO, a global leader in electronics engineering and \ntechnology, recently established four R centers in Asia--three in \nChina and one in India.\n  What are we doing to counter this tidal wave? Many would say we need \nto invest in U.S. research and students--produce more U.S. scientists \nand engineers.\n  I would agree Wholeheartedly. I have long supported doubling the \nbudget of the National Science Foundation. I am a cosponsor of the \nProtecting America's Competitive Edge Act. It calls for more investment \nin U.S. science and research funding and education.\n  But it also recognizes that encouraging more U.S. kids to go into \nscience and math is not enough. It won't produce enough scientists and \nengineers. Our U.S. employers will not get the brainpower they need by \nthis alone.\n  The National Academy of Sciences that produced the recommendations on \nwhich the PACE legislation is based said as much.\n  They document America's high-tech needs in their report ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a \nBrighter Economic Future.''\n  A section of that report addresses the need of U.S. universities to \nget international STEM students--the need of U.S. employers to get \ninternational STEM students--the need for us to change our visa rules \nto allow us to keep our STEM graduates here at home, to the benefit of \nU.S. workers and the U.S. economy.\n  A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted this need. It begins \nwith: ``Last year, Stanford University awarded 88 PhDs in electrical \nengineering, 49 of which went to foreign-born students. U.S. business \nwould like to hang on to these kind of prized graduates and not lose \nthem to the world.''\n  And so I am thrilled that the Judiciary Committee, under Senator \nSpecter's fine leadership along with Senator Kennedy, included \nprovisions trying to answer this call. Similar provisions were included \nin Leader Frist's bill and in the Protecting America's Competitive Act, \nof which I am a proud cosponsor along with 61 of my colleagues.\n  We seek to provide an answer to U.S. workers losing out on good-\npaying jobs in manufacturing, raw material supply, distribution, \nadvertising, sales, and administration when their employers can't get \nthe high-tech innovators and inventors they need to compete with \nforeign companies in the 21st century economy.\n  We seek to answer taxpayers who are sending billions of dollars to \nU.S. universities to fund research and student education, only to see \nthe product of that hard work and money, U.S. university graduates from \nother countries, forced to leave the country to the benefit of foreign \ncompetitors.\n  We seek to update U.S. immigration laws to meet the needs of 21st \ncentury educators and workers. S. 2611's underlying provisions update \nvisa requirements so that U.S. universities can get the students they \nneed and U.S. companies can get the U.S. STEM graduates they need.\n  It provides U.S. advanced STEM degrees graduates up to 1 year after \ngraduation to be placed with a U.S. company in their field of study. \nThis will stop these valuable U.S. graduates from being forced out of \nthe country before they have time to be placed with a U.S. company \nneeding their expertise. It will also make the U.S. competitive with \nother countries with the same reform now attracting talented high-tech \nworkers to America's detriment.\n  It also makes U.S. advanced STEM degree graduates placed with a U.S. \ncompany eligible for permanent residency and gives them the time they \nneed to process their application. This will allow U.S. companies to \nkeep U.S. graduates to the benefit of U.S. jobs and the economy. Again, \nit will also make the U.S. competitive with other countries with the \nsame reform now attracting talented high-tech workers to our detriment.\n  With my amendment I want to ensure that we do not leave a portion of \nthese valuable STEM students behind. It ensures that in addition to the \nadvanced STEM degree students on F-\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\nvisas, we also include those same types of students on J-visas.\n  Most advanced STEM degree students come to the U.S. on an F-visa. \nThis is the primary student visa. But many may not know, including \nthose who advocate and practice in the immigration arena, that many \nadvanced STEM degree students also come to the U.S. on J-visas.\n  What's the difference with these students? Nothing really when you \nlook at who they are. They are STEM students pursuing advanced studies \nin biology, biomedical engineering, and similar disciplines. They are \nPhDs and they come to pursue and complete their postdoctoral studies at \nleading universities across the nation.\n  In Missouri, J-visa holders make up 10 percent our University of \nMissouri advanced STEM degree students. At Washington University in St. \nLouis they form 25 percent of the advanced STEM degree student body. I \nthink every Senator in this body will have advanced STEM degree \nstudents on J-visas at universities in their states and thus will \nbenefit from this amendment.\n  There is no substantive reason to include advanced STEM degree \nstudents on F-visas and not on J-visas. Indeed, I think it may have \nbeen just an oversight.\n  My amendment applies strictly to advanced degree STEM students on J-\nvisas. Other persons on J-visas in the U.S. for other reasons will not \nqualify for this program.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I am thankful for \nthe support of Senator Gregg, along with Senators Allen, Alexander, \nCoburn and Sununu cosponsoring this amendment. It is a modest set of \nprovisions, but its impact will be great.\n  Our workers need this amendment, our universities need this \namendment, the Nation's competitiveness in the 21st century needs this \namendment.\n  This amendment I am not calling up now because I understand it will \nbe included--I hope it will be--in the managers' package.\n  I will tell my colleagues what it does and also alert many Members \nwho are interested in it because it will keep our best and brightest \nstudents from abroad, the science, technology, engineering, and math \nstudents who come here for postgraduate degrees, in the United States.\n  Right now, there is a provision in the bill for the F-visa students \nto stay here, but it omits the J-visa students. American students who \ncome from overseas and study in our institutions, which we proudly \nsupport, ought to be making their contributions to the well-being of \nthe economy, to the knowledge and the skill base. I believe these \nstudents, if they want to stay here, ought to be given the opportunity \nto stay here.\n  Right now, under the J-visa system, you come in and you can be \nworking postdoctorate in a science area which is exploding and creating \nthe jobs of the future, and then the J-visa system says you have to go \nhome for 2 years. By the way, they go home for 2 years, and guess what. \nThey have started a business there, they have hired people in their \ncountry, and instead of having their skills, knowledge, and expertise \nthat was gained in the United States put to work here, they are putting \nit to work in other countries. It does not say they have to stay here, \nbut right now, the current system says you have to go home. We put a \nlot of money into training these great students. They are a wonderful \nresource.\n  I have visited many colleges in my State, and I have talked to the \nmaster degree student, doctorate degree, and postdoctorate \ninternational students working there. They want to stay here. And, \nreasonably, the universities want them to stay here because they form a \ntremendous support base for the universities.\n  These are people who not only can earn a good living for themselves, \nbut their scientific know-how, their technical, managerial, \nengineering, and mathematical skills can provide opportunities to put \nall of these workers with their skills into the hiring of workers in \nthe United States.\n  Regrettably, too many American students are choosing not to go into \nscience, engineering, and mathematics.\n  If there is time before 2:45, after Senator Hutchison completes her \nstatement, I ask to utilize that time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, we welcome having his \nparticipation. I wanted to be able to respond briefly. I don't know if \nSenator Hutchison will talk until 2:45.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I have 5 minutes remaining on my time which I wish to \nreserve for any rebuttal, and then I will be finished.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And did Senator Bond want something?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I definitely don't want to preempt the \nmanager from his comments, but if there is additional time, I would \nlike another 5 minutes after the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nSenator from Texas have made their comments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I will be glad to \ngive you 5 minutes of my time, if you want it.\n  Mr. BOND. Fine. That is most gracious.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If we could do that after my final comments.\n  Mr. BOND. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4101\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \nvision in the importance and the role that temporary workers can play \nin our society, but I have to reluctantly oppose her amendment.\n  We are on this issue of temporary workers. The body is being sort of \nwhipsawed. We started out with 400,000; and we have had good debates \nand discussions, and we have reduced the number of temporary workers to \n200,000. And we are going to have further amendments before the end of \nthe evening or on the morrow that will probably be to eliminate all of \nthe temporary worker programs. There is a number of our colleagues who \nfeel that way.\n  I had supported the number with Senator McCain of 400,000 temporary \nworkers, and then we reduced that number to 325,000. And now it has \nbeen reduced to 200,000. As I mentioned, we have amendments on the list \nnow that are going to try to, effectively, eliminate the temporary \nworker program. The Senator from Texas wants to increase it from \n200,000. It seems to me we had it right in the earlier time when \nSenator McCain and I had introduced the legislation. It still was at \nthe 325,000. I am going to advocate that we continue the program at the \n200,000, later on in the afternoon or evening, when we are going to \nhave attempts to eliminate it.\n  But this program is a very different program than the one that is in \nthe underlying legislation. I want to talk about that very briefly.\n  First of all, there is a dramatic difference in the recruitment \nprocess between what we have in our legislation in the underlying bill \nand what is in the Hutchison amendment. We have a very extensive \nrecruitment-and-posting program where we post, in a vigorous effort, to \ntry to recruit American workers and indicate also what they are going \nto get paid. That is very extensive. It is spelled out in some detail \nin our legislation. I think it is far more extensive than a general \ndesignation of a category where there are some jobs available.\n  Secondly, we have much stronger worker protections in terms of the \nwages and in terms of protecting workers' rights, such as if there is \ngoing to be a walkout or a strike, which does not exist in Senator \nHutchison's amendment. We have a complaint process and procedure, so if \nthere are violations of the rights or wages or working conditions of \nthese temporary workers, they will have the ability to file a complaint \nwith the Secretary of Labor, which does not exist in the Hutchison \namendment.\n  There is the ability for a temporary worker, if he or she does not \nget along with their particular employer, to be portable. He or she can \ngo to a different job and different employer so we can free these \nworkers from what has happened historically, and that is exploitation. \nThat is an enormously important protection for workers. That does not \nexist in the Hutchison amendment.\n  In our particular temporary worker program, it can last for 6 years, \nwhich is very desirable both from the workers' point of view and the \nemployers'\n\n[[Page S5078]]\n\npoint of view in terms of the training they give to the workers \nthemselves.\n  But most importantly--most importantly--after the 4-year period, the \nworker, under our proposal, can actually petition for permanent \ncitizenship--a green card, effectively. Then they have to start the \nprocess toward naturalization. It will take them 5 more years, but they \ncan get on the path. They have to work hard over the period of some 4 \nyears. If there is a green card available, they can move toward a green \ncard. If not, they will have to wait, and eventually they will get to \nthe process of citizenship--but not under the Hutchison amendment. \nAfter a total of 21 months, they return back home.\n  So there is a very dramatic difference in the concept of the \ntemporary worker program included in the underlying bill than that of \nthe Hutchison amendment. And that underlies the fact we are going to \nrespect these workers. In our underlying bill we are going to profit \nand learn from the historic past, where there has been the exploitation \nof workers, where workers have not been able to have portability, where \nworkers have not had a complaint procedure, where workers have not had \nwhistleblower protections, where we have seen workers exploited.\n  It gives them the opportunity, if they work hard, play by the rules, \nto be able to be law-abiding citizens. That gives them an opportunity, \nthen, to get on a path, with 5 more years, to be part of the American \ndream. Nine or 10 years it is going to take. They are going to have to \ndemonstrate that hard work, play by the rules, stay out of trouble, and \nhave a good work ethic to be a part of the whole American system.\n  That does not exist. I think that is important because it really is a \nreflection of the fact that we value this work. It may not be Americans \nwho are prepared to take these jobs, but, nonetheless, we value these \nindividuals. We value these individuals. We have the high-skilled \nindividuals, but we also value those individuals who are going to come \nhere, work hard, play by the rules, and are going to be able to be \neventually transitioned into citizenship.\n  So, first of all, we have the overall scope, the fact of the total \nnumbers we have; secondly, we have the protections. In the existing and \nunderlying bill, I believe a careful reading of the legislation will \nshow there are vastly more protections for the temporary workers than \nin the Hutchison amendment. I am concerned both about the numbers and \nthe failure of the protections for those particular workers.\n  Finally, it is limited to just certain countries. Our temporary \nworker program can include other nations, Asian countries, countries \nother than those on the particular list the Senator from Texas has \noutlined.\n  So it does seem to me we really do not need an additional temporary \nworker program. I hope we will not accept her amendment.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I do not know how much time I have \navailable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 12\\1/\n2\\ minutes. The Senator from Texas controls 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield 5 minutes of \nthat time to the Senator from Missouri after the Senator from Texas \nspeaks.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No. Mr. President, I would like to reserve the \nremainder of my time until the Senator is finished with the rebuttal so \nI can close on my amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I was just trying to accommodate the Senator. I \nwas going to yield the floor, and I thought both Senators wanted time. \nI say to the Senator, you have been very accommodating in working out \nthe time agreements earlier, so I was glad to yield some of my time to \nthe Senator, who is supporting your position.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much. I will \nyield to the Senator from Missouri to use the 5 minutes from the \nSenator from Massachusetts, and then I will wait if the Senator wishes \nto continue any kind of rebuttal, and then I will reserve my time until \nhe is finished so I can close on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, who are very \ngenerous.\n  I should have stated at the beginning that I very much support the \nprovision that Senator Specter and Senator Kennedy put in the \nunderlying bill. There were similar provisions in Leader Frist's bill, \nin the Protecting America's Competitive Act, of which I am a proud \ncosponsor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4071\n\n  Mr. President, this underlying bill provides that U.S. advanced STEM \ndegree graduates--that is science, technology, engineering, and math--\nget up to 1 year after graduation to be placed with a U.S. company in \ntheir field of study. It will make sure they can find a place to work, \nand then get permanent residency to process their applications. It will \nallow U.S. companies to keep U.S. graduates to the benefit of U.S. \njobs. And it will make our country much more competitive with other \ncountries with the same reform now attracting high-tech workers to our \ndetriment because they go overseas.\n  The amendment I have offered ensures that we do not leave a portion \nof these students behind. The underlying bill says it applies to \nstudents on F-visas. We include those same types of students on J-\nvisas.\n  There are a significant portion of J-visa students studying in my \nState, pursuing advanced studies in biology, biomedical engineering, \nand, particularly in my State, genetic engineering and plant \nbiotechnology. They are Ph.Ds. They come to pursue and complete their \npost-doctorate studies at leading universities in Missouri and across \nthe Nation.\n  In Missouri, J-visa holders make up 10 percent of our University of \nMissouri advanced STEM degree students. At Washington University in St. \nLouis, they make up 25 percent. I think every Senator will have J-visa \nSTEM students at universities in their States. There is no substantive \nreason not to include them in the underlying bill. I assume it was \nmerely an oversight.\n  When you bring in these workers, as I was saying earlier, American \nmanufacturing workers are getting good jobs because they have the \nscience and the math, the technology that is enabling them to produce \n21st century products and to do the kind of work that 21st century \nscience enables them to do.\n  It is becoming increasingly clear that if American workers are not \nsupporting high-tech products in demand today, they are losing their \njobs. As a recent book by Tom Friedman, ``The World Is Flat,'' \nexplains, those high-tech jobs can go anywhere in the world and be \nlinked up by computer. So Americans need to be using cutting-edge \ntechnology. Whether it is some of our basic activities--extracting raw \nmaterials efficiently or producing record harvests--we need to use the \ntechnology that is being developed. And with today's and tomorrow's \ninnovations and inventions, they are going to have to come from \nstudents who are studying at our universities.\n  Right now, foreign students are earning 30 percent of today's U.S. \ndoctorates in engineering, 50 percent in math and computer sciences. We \nare lucky to have them in the U.S. because the number of U.S. citizens \nenrolling in science and engineering is way down. It dropped 14 percent \nin total from 1993 to 2000; 32 percent in math, 25 percent in \nengineering.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4101\n\n  Mr. President, I reiterate my support for the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Texas. I am very proud to support her SAFE Visa Program \namendment because I do think the system she has laid out is one that is \nappropriate in a much broader field. I would like to see this measure \nin the bill because I think when the conferees start looking at how we \ndeal with guest workers, they are going to want a commonsense solution.\n  That solution is to say, you can come for 10 months. We want to make \nit possible for you to come here and work, knowing you can come back \nand forth freely, knowing you are not locked in here, so you can go \nhome and see your family and so you can take money home; and when you \nfinish work here, you will have that portion of Social Security taken \nout of your paycheck as your own savings account.\n  This will be a tremendous boom for them, and enable them to go back \nto\n\n[[Page S5079]]\n\ntheir villages or cities, or wherever they came from, and be able to \nprovide for themselves and their families, and also, we hope, \ninvigorate the economies of those communities from which they came.\n  So I am very proud to support the Senator from Texas, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join with her in supporting the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have 7 minutes. I was not going to make \na further comment on this amendment. The Senator from Alabama indicated \nhe had a few questions on this amendment, so I am glad to yield my time \nto the Senator. Then the Senator will make her concluding remarks. And \nthen I understand we are going to go ahead with the point of order of \nthe Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That would be correct.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me just clarify that the remaining \namount of Senator Kennedy's time would go to Senator Sessions for \nquestions, and then I would have 5 minutes after that to close; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time would remain, then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts retains 6\\1/2\\. \nThe Senator from Texas has 5 minutes.\n  Is there objection to the Senator from Alabama being allowed to \ncontrol the 6\\1/2\\ minutes of the Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I defer to the Senator from Alabama, \nand then I will use the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am very interested in and supportive \nof the concept embodied in the Hutchison amendment. A few weeks ago \nSenator Specter and I met with President Uribe in Colombia and with \nofficials of the Dominican Republic. President Uribe and the Dominican \nRepublic said they didn't understand this controversy. They have a good \nguest worker program. Both of them apparently had a guest worker \nprogram with Spain and Canada. Under those programs, the workers would \nsign up. I am not sure whether it was with the Colombian Government or \nthe Canadian Government. They would be given a visa to work for so many \nmonths with the clear understanding that they would be able to come \nhome to their families when they finished work and be able to sign up \nfor the next year unless something significant changed. They were both \nvery happy about that. To my knowledge, we have really nothing like \nthat in our legislation in the main part of the bill. I ask Senator \nHutchison, is this something similar to what you are proposing? If so, \nyou definitely have support from those two countries.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, that is what is missing from this \nbill. Many countries have temporary worker programs with other \ncountries that have worked very well. Many other countries even come \nacross the ocean for temporary work. In many places you have temporary \nworkers who go back and forth across international boundaries every day \nto work. In some countries it is considered that those workers are an \nunderclass. I disagree with that. Having the ability to go back and \nforth, a circularity, is healthy. We want commerce with Mexico and \nCentral and South America. We want to have the ability for people to \nwork 3 months and go home for 2 weeks and then come back and work 3 \nmonths, whatever the employer and employee can work out, as long as it \nis basically 10 months here and 2 months at home. You can have exactly \nwhat Senator Bond just said. You can have the money going into the \ncountry of origin which Mexico wants. They want the ability for their \npeople to work in the United States. But I don't think Mexico wants \ntheir good people to leave and become citizens of our country. Some \nwill want to. That is available to them. But not every one of them \nwants to. And why should we force that, or why should we encourage it? \nIf they want to go into the citizenship route, that is available.\n  In fact, one of the arguments that was made by the Senator from \nMassachusetts is, are we going to create a permanent underclass of \ncitizens? As long as you have the citizenship route, there is no \nunderclass because the people who abide by the laws and decide to learn \nEnglish and to do the things required for citizenship can get into the \ncitizenship track. There are many people who might not want to do that, \nwho would like to work but take their money home, maybe have their nest \negg with them when they retire to start a business at home or to pass \non to their children.\n  We should have more options. That is what this amendment does. We \nshould have a guest worker program in this bill that creates another \noption that is not now in the underlying bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Any of these guest workers that at some point decide \nthey wish to become a citizen or become a permanent resident wouldn't \nbe prohibited from applying under that provision of the bill that we \nwould pass that would allow them to get in that track, correct?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Absolutely. If they decided to go into the SAFE visa \nprogram, they would make the decision they are not going on the \ncitizenship track, but if they change their mind, they can withdraw \nfrom the SAFE visa program, take the Social Security that has been \ndeducted from their salaries home with them, go back to their home \ncountry and get in line for the citizenship track.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One of the problems is that people come into the \ncountry and they feel bound. If they come illegally, as they come today \noftentimes, they don't feel free to go back and forth. Then there is \npressure on them to try to bring their family. Whereas if they had a \ncard such as you propose and they could come and go and leave their \nfamily at home and just work for so many months like so many Americans \ndo, they work in different cities and towns all over America and come \nback home to their families, wouldn't that be a positive offering for \npeople who wanted to come work and not a demeaning thing?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is so important that we have the different \noptions. It is important that we give the opportunity to people not to \ndisrupt their families, to be able to go back and forth, if that is the \noption they would choose. Maybe they want to contribute in their home \ncountry, and they want to remain citizens. As long as you have the \ncitizenship route for people who want the rigorous test of citizenship \nthat goes with our country, then you should have two options on the \ntable and people can choose. This is a country of entrepreneurs who \nwant to have options, and we need programs that work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Alabama has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. I \nthank the Senator from Massachusetts for letting us have the colloquy. \nIt is so important that we recognize that we are in a system that does \nnot work right now. We have 11 million people living under the radar \nscreen. That is not good for them, and it is not good for our country. \nSince we had 9/11 and the wake-up call, we now know that we must secure \nour borders first. We must also not ignore the invaluable contributions \nmade by immigrants. We are a country of immigrants, of course. Many of \nus in this body had parents or grandparents who were immigrants, who \nwere the first to come to this country. They have known hardship. They \nhave assimilated. That is a good thing.\n  Why not have another option for people who would not want to go the \ncitizenship route but who could work. Some of these temporary worker \npermits in the underlying bill are limited to 3 years or 6 years. The \nSAFE visa is not limited at all. As long as the person still qualifies \nand there is a willing employer, the employer can train someone and \nknow that they will come every year and be able to keep that training. \nIt is a 10-month program, but any employer can figure out that they\n\n[[Page S5080]]\n\nwould hire one group of workers in January and another in March, so \nthey would have a full year employment if they don't have a seasonal \nbusiness and the jobs they need to fill are not filled by Americans, \nwhich is also part of the amendment. But you could have people in this \nprogram for 10 years. They could then take their nest egg back home \nwith them. They would be trained workers for the employer. So it is a \nwin for everyone.\n\n  If we are going to have a system that works, with secure borders, \nwith a guest worker program that allows people to work and not seek \ncitizenship, not be able to go into the social programs of our country, \nbut people who will be well paid, well treated, and be able to build \ntheir nest egg with their Social Security deductions, we should offer \nthat kind of opportunity side by side with the opportunity for \ncitizenship which is a longer track. That is a system that can work for \nthe long term.\n  We cannot make the mistake of 1986, when we passed an amnesty bill \nand said: This is the last one. In 1986 we didn't provide a guest \nworker program going forward that worked. As a result, we have millions \nof people under the radar screen not having the protections of the \nAmerican system. That is not good. It is not good for them, and it is \nnot good for us.\n  It furthermore sends a signal that if you come here illegally, you \nwill be able to eventually become legal through amnesty. That is not an \nordered system. An ordered system would be one in which we secure our \nborders, we have temporary worker programs that work, some with the \ncitizenship track, some without, and then you deal with the people who \nare here illegally one time. You do it in a rational and responsible \nway, but you know you have a system in place that is going to work for \nthe future.\n  I don't expect to carry this amendment. I do expect that the airing \nof this view should have an impact on the conference committee that \nwill meet to create a bill that I hope all of us will be proud to \nsupport. It will not be the bill that is going to leave the Senate \nfloor this week. This is not the bill that will provide a long term \nsolution. It is not the bill that is going to assure that we have \neconomic viability in our country as well as safety and security and \nprotection for American workers. We can get a good bill, but that bill \nwill have to come out of conference. I hope that the Senate speaks with \na strong voice that this should be part of the solution, that we should \nhave an option for people who could get into the system within a year, \nwho would have a tamper-proof visa, that they would be safe and the \nemployer hiring them would be safe to trust, and that they would be \nable to make a living wage and go home and keep the citizenship of \ntheir country of origin, if they choose to do that.\n  This is an option we should have. I hope we have a strong vote in the \nSenate so that this will become part of the solution to this issue that \nwe must reach to get control of our borders and create a strong \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support for \nmy amendment from the American Farm Bureau be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2006.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: Thank you for requesting the views \n     of the American Farm Bureau Federation on the Secure \n     Authorized Foreign Employee (SAFE) visa amendment to the \n     Hagel-Martinez immigration bill, S. 2611.\n       The SAFE visa would appear to provide agriculture with an \n     alternative temporary worker program in addition to the \n     existing H-2a program, to recruit workers from abroad when \n     workers cannot be found locally. The amendment would not in \n     any way affect other agriclultural provisions in the bill.\n       Under the SAFE program, growers would be required to pay \n     not more than the prevailing wage. Employers would be \n     responsible for transportation but could deduct those costs \n     from pay under an employment agreement.\n       In addition to the H-2a program, we believe that the SAFE \n     visa could help ensure that agriculture has access to a legal \n     foreign workforce during labor shortages and therefore, we \n     would support the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate on the Hutchison amendment \nhas expired.\n  Under the previous order, it is now in order for the Senator from \nColorado to offer a point of order.\n  Does the Senator wish to be recognized for that purpose?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I do. Following making my point of order, \nI would ask unanimous consent that the manager be recognized and then \nthere be an opportunity for Senator Sessions to make a few remarks. I \nwant to make a few remarks. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, 2 hours has been allocated for debate. One \nhour will be controlled by the Senator from Colorado making the point \nof order, 30 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, and \n30 minutes under the control of the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \nbill violates section 407(B) of H. Con. Res. 95, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to waive all applicable points of \norder under the Budget Act and the budget resolutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive the act is heard. Under \nthe previous order, the time allocated for debate will be on the motion \nto waive.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield to my colleague from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado. He \nis a senior member of the Budget Committee. He is capable and does, in \nfact, help us monitor spending in this body. I am pleased that he \nshares my view, and I hope our colleagues will listen to the \ndiscussions we have that indicate that this bill, indeed, is a \ntremendous budget buster. There is very little doubt about that in any \nfashion whatsoever. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that \nit busts the budget in the first 10 years. And they conclude, without \nmuch analysis at all, frankly, because the numbers are so much worse in \nthe second 10 years, that it clearly will break the budget in the next \n10 years. They generally do their studies on a 10-year basis.\n  This is a matter that is tremendously important. It is one of the \nreasons the legislation before us today is considered such an important \nmatter. It has importance beyond immigration. It has great importance \ntoward the financial stability of this Nation in the future, our \nability to make ends meet and not spend more than we take in. You have \nheard it said, and I have talked to some fine economists and they have \nit in their minds--well, let's say not a lot of them because most of \nthe economists we have heard testify here have the view that I share. \nBut a lot of people seem to think if we just bring in more people, that \nwill then raise revenues and that will then help us balance the Social \nSecurity default we are in. That is one of the myths that are out \nthere. It is a very powerful myth, and it is an appealing myth.\n\n  First of all, these kinds of pieces of legislation tend to get worse \nrather than better. I just point out that the Congressional Budget \nOffice study they gave us a few days ago--we have a response to it \ntoday to update it. It adds 4 million more people to their estimate in \nthe amnesty section of the bill than they estimated a few days ago. \nThat is a 33-percent increase, a third more than they estimated. These \nnumbers are hard to estimate. We know that in 1986, they predicted that \na little over 2 million would be eligible for that amnesty, and 3 \nmillion showed up, a 33-percent increase. These are the kinds of \nnumbers we are dealing with.\n  Further, I note, very troublingly, that until we got the initial \nreport from CBO on May 16, nobody had presented a cost estimate on this \npiece of legislation, and nobody really has today. In fact, the CBO \nscore just goes out 10 years. They don't attempt to deal with the \nsecond 10 years, which is\n\n[[Page S5081]]\n\nwhere the extraordinary growth in costs to our Government will occur.\n  So I challenge my colleagues. We will hear some talk, but I would \nlike to really see how any increase in revenue the Government might \nhave would have an ability to overcome the huge costs in the future. I \nthink it will be, in 20 years, clear that this amnesty bill--if it goes \nin like it is today--will add more in costs and will absolutely not \nhelp us pay for Social Security, and it will absolutely leave us in a \nweaker fiscal condition than we are today.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I used? And I ask to be notified at \n12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, according to the budget point of order \nthe Senator from Colorado has raised, he will be focusing on, I \nbelieve, the second 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office has told \nus that the first 10 years are net losers. They say that direct \nspending in this bill authorizes $54 billion. There will be $66 billion \nin revenue, and discretionary spending will be $64 billion, for a net \ncost in the first 10 years of $52 billion. That is really significant. \nThe numbers are far worse in the outyears.\n  Those of us who have watched this Congress operate over the years and \nhave been in it a few years realize that we make some of our biggest \nmistakes when we jump into programs that sound good at the time and we \nhave not calculated the long-term costs to our country, and we wake up \nwondering how it ever happened. Sometimes we need to go back to look at \nprecisely how it occurred.\n  Robert Rector has done some serious number-crunching for the second \n10 years. He was a chief architect of America's welfare reform bill. He \nis a senior analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a very well respected \ngroup in town. These are some of the things he says about that. He \nbelieves--let me tell you--that the numbers could be $50 billion to $60 \nbillion per year in the second decade. This is one of his quotes:\n\n       In the long run, this bill, if enacted, would prove the \n     largest expansion of Government welfare in 35 years.\n\n  The largest expansion of Government welfare in 35 years. He estimates \nthat the bill's provisions that put illegal aliens on a direct path to \ncitizenship will result in $16 billion per year of net additional costs \nto the Federal Government for benefits given to the amnestied \nindividuals alone. This is just the group that is in the first amnesty. \nThis will be in the amnesty of those who are already here. That will \ncost $16 billion per year.\n  He also points out that the fiscal impact of the cost to the Treasury \ncaused by the Senate bill will extend far beyond the benefits given to \nthe individual aliens, those who are here seeking amnesty. Once those \naliens receive legal permanent status--that is the green card, and that \nis what they will receive under the bill before us--they have an \nautomatic guaranteed right to bring their spouses and minor children \ninto the United States even if this had not been one of their strong \ndesires to begin with. Now they have an automatic right to do this. So \nthat will greatly expand the total number of people ultimately granted \ncitizenship under this bill's provisions. It is not just the people who \nare here.\n  Undoubtedly, the welfare estimate of $16 billion per year will \nincrease. That is a low estimate. Once an illegal alien becomes a \ncitizen, they have an additional unrestricted right to bring their \nparents in. Many of these parents will be elderly and need medical \ncare. The Heritage Foundation report points out that parents under the \nMedicare system could cost as much as $18,000 per person. They estimate \nthat even if 10 percent of the people who are provided citizenship--we \nare talking about getting into the second 10 years because it will take \nabout that long to go through the process of getting a green card under \nthe restrictions of the bill and under their request for citizenship. \nYou can bring your children and your wife with a green card. If you \nhave a green card, you can bring them. If you become a citizen, you can \nbring your parents and your brothers and sisters, and they can bring \ntheir children. But he estimates that would be $30 billion a year in \nthe outyears.\n  You say that cannot be. Well, all I know is Members of this body \ndebated for years welfare reform. The people who opposed welfare reform \nand opposed it steadfastly--and President Clinton vetoed it several \ntimes--said it was going to increase poverty. The others argued: No, it \nwill help lift people out of poverty. What has happened? Welfare rolls \nhave dropped by more than 50 percent, and the number of children being \nraised in poverty is lower than it was at that time. Who said that \nwould happen? Robert Rector at the Heritage Foundation. He was proven \ncorrect in that debate. I submit that he is one of the more brilliant \nstudents of public life today, of welfare and all of the related \nissues. He said it will be $50 billion to $60 billion a year in the \nnext decade. That is a lot of money. That is really a lot of money. \nOver 10 years, that amounts to a half trillion dollars.\n  So we have to think about this. I suggest to my colleagues that we \nhave not thought this through. We don't even have an official CBO score \non the second 10 years. We are asking the country, the American \ntaxpayer, who lifts the burdens and pays our fat salary and takes care \nof us and everything else in this Federal Government, to just take a \nwalk with us in the hope that something good might happen. I don't \nthink so.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, if you are concerned about this and other \naspects of the bill, to cast a vote against waiving the Budget Act. Our \nchairman has said: Well, we don't deny the Budget Act is being \nviolated, we don't deny spending increases more than it is supposed to \nunder the Budget Act, but with 60 votes, we want to waive it, and we \nwill move right on and pass something and send it to conference.\n  We have made some progress on the bill. We have had some good debate \nin the Senate. It is still not fixed, in my opinion, in a number of \nways. What really needs to be done is the bill pulled down and \nseriously talked about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 12 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to have 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I extend 2 more minutes to the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, that is what we are talking about. This \nis not a technical matter. I don't believe any study is going to show \nthat these numbers are fundamentally incorrect. I don't believe any \nnumbers will show that the approval of this bill will not be a net cost \nto the Treasury of the United States. One of the reasons that is sadly \nso is because so many of the people who are here illegally do not have \na high school education. That means they have less opportunity to \nsucceed than if they had come here with higher abilities and skills and \nwere in areas in our country where we really needed them. That could \nmake them be more successful.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor and yield back whatever time \nis remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to express in a public way my \ngratitude for Senator Sessions, the Senator from Alabama, for his \nefforts on behalf of many of us who have concerns about the immigration \nbill. I think we should recognize his yeoman work and the amount of \ntime he spent studying all of the ramifications of this bill.\n  All of us have begun to study this bill more and more over the past \nweek, and we began to realize the long-term implications the \nimmigration reform bill we have on the floor will have on America.\n  I have grave concerns with the effects of this bill on the future of \nthis\n\n[[Page S5082]]\n\ncountry, not the least of which is its potential fiscal impact.\n  Section 407 reads:\n\n       It shall not be in order to consider any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     would cause a net increase in direct spending in excess of $5 \n     billion in any of the four 10-year periods beginning in 2016 \n     through 2055.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office issued a May 16, 2006, cost estimate \nexplicitly stating:\n\n       Enacting S. 2611 would cause an increase in direct spending \n     greater than $5 billion in each of the 10-year periods \n     between 2016 and 2055.\n\n  The fiscal impact of this bill can be summed up in simply two words: \nbudget buster. This is a budget buster.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation would \nincrease direct spending by $54 billion over the next 10 years. While \nit is estimated to increase only $13 billion over the first 5 years, \nduring the course of the second 5 years, it is expected to skyrocket up \nanother $41 billion as the amnesty provisions begin to kick in.\n  Conveniently for the authors of the bill, CBO's cost estimate stops \nthere. See, under the bill, illegal immigrants have a 6-year waiting \nperiod from enactment to establishing legal permanent resident status. \nThen after another 5 years, they can become citizens. Thus, in the 11th \nyear, conveniently just out of reach of CBO's analysis, millions of \npeople who entered this country illegally will be granted citizenship.\n  Where the CBO leaves off, the Heritage Foundation picks up. They \nestimate that the additional cost to the Federal Government of \nproviding benefits to the individuals granted amnesty under this bill \nis around $16 billion annually.\n  On top of that, when an individual is granted citizenship, he is \nentitled to bring his spouse, minor children, and parents into the \ncountry. Once in the country, these individuals would become eligible \nto receive social services and government-funded medical care. Then \nafter 5 years, they could become citizens, whereupon they could be \neligible for supplemental security income and Medicaid at an average \ncost of $18,000 per person per year.\n  Think about that. That is about the time when many of us are talking \nabout a financial crisis around 2016 for Social Security and Medicare. \nThen on top of that, we are incurring this huge liability in this bill, \nif we happen to pass it in its current form.\n  The Heritage Foundation study provides this example: If only 10 \npercent of the parents of those receiving amnesty under this bill \nbecame citizens and enrolled in the aforementioned Government programs, \nthe extra costs to Government would be over $30 billion per year.\n  Obviously, we cannot predict how many spouses, children, and parents \nof those granted amnesty will come into the country, but one thing is \nfor certain. The pool is enormous and the potential long-term effects \nstaggering.\n  All this takes place against the existing backdrop of runaway Federal \nspending. Entitlement spending alone is on pace to exceed total \nGovernment revenues before the end of this century.\n  With the looming retirement of the baby boomers, we are grappling \nwith how to pay for existing entitlement programs. The last thing we \nneed to do is grow Federal spending by potentially hundreds of billions \nof dollars to provide benefits to millions of people who enter our \ncountry illegally. This stands in contravention to the rule of law and \nis unfair to the American taxpayer.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I believe it is my duty \nto bring to the attention of my colleagues, as well as the American \npeople, the staggering impact this legislation will have on the fiscal \nhealth of this country. This issue has not been thoroughly considered \nin the Senate. I bring it to my colleagues' attention today in hopes \nthat we will have the debate we need.\n  It would be irresponsible of me not to mention a violation of \npersonal duty to the American taxpayer, to stand idly by while my \ncolleagues enact a bill that drives a dagger into the heart of this \ncountry's fiscal health.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for \nthe concern he has expressed in a heartfelt way. I believe all of us \nhave the potential of reaching an agreement on comprehensive \nlegislation that we could actually support. I would think the Senator \nwould agree with me that good enforcement and a good workplace \nenforcement system would be critical.\n  According to an article in yesterday's paper, Mr. T.J. Bonner, who \nheads the Border Patrol union and has always been correct \nfundamentally, I believe, on these issues, is very dubious that even \nthe House plan is sufficiently effective on enforcement in the \nworkplace.\n  The next thing we would want to do is to figure out some way to treat \nthe people who are here illegally in a fair way. Most of them would \nwant to stay here. Most of them have been here for over 5 years. We \nneed to develop a system to allow people to stay here in a legal way, \nto come out from the shadows. I think that is a worthwhile goal, and I \nsupport that goal. But they do not need to be given every single \nbenefit that we provide to people who come to our country legally, \npeople who have waited in line to have their shot to come to our \ncountry. We should not give them every single benefit that a person \ngets who comes here legally. So we have to worry about that.\n  What happens when we give them a complete amnesty package is they are \nput on a guaranteed path to citizenship and then they automatically \nbecome eligible for these programs, with huge costs. They didn't ask \nfor that when they came to our country. That was not why they came \nhere. They came just to work and make some extra money and, for \nwhatever reason, they stayed.\n  We have to think this through. We cannot be operating on simple \nfeelings alone, but we should analyze it in a fair and objective way \nand even consider what they want. A lot of them don't want to stay and \nbecome permanent residents.\n  Then, finally, we ought to develop a system of immigration that \nprovides more incentives. Why shouldn't a young high school \nvaledictorian in, say, Peru, Brazil, Colombia, or the Dominican \nRepublic, who already has learned to speak English, has had some \ncollege, have an advantage of coming into our country over someone who \nis elderly and would have a guaranteed right under the bill to come in \nunder the parents provision, as Senator Allard suggested? That is what \ngets us in trouble. We have to think about this. It has real financial \nconsequences.\n  I reiterate what the Heritage Foundation found. They found that \nwithout any change in the current law, 9.5 million individuals would \nenter the country as legal permanent residents over 10 years. CBO \nacknowledges that 11 million illegal immigrants currently are residing \nin the United States and over 10 years will be given legal permanent \nresidence as a result of the bill, and an additional 7.8 million new \nlegal immigrants will come into the country under this bill.\n  Not only do we provide legal status for that large group of people \nhere illegally, we start a new system that allows very substantial \nincreases in legal immigration. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice numbers, over 28 million individuals, therefore, will obtain \nlegal permanent residence over the next 10 years if S. 2611 passes, \nwhich is three times the current level that would occur under current \nlaw.\n  People say this is just a bill to take care of people and to confront \nsome issues we have to confront, work on the border, and deal with the \nfuture flow of immigration. It increases it, according to him, three \ntimes in the next 10 years. That is almost 30 million people. That is \nabout 10 percent of the existing population of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. Rector of the Heritage Foundation estimates that the real number \nwould be higher. That is just an estimate. And I note, it does not \naccount for people who come here illegally. If we give amnesty for the \nsecond time, we are going to have a lot of people believing if they can \njust get here illegally, somehow they also will be allowed to stay in \nthe country eventually. So we are going to have a substantial number of \nillegal people. Remember, they are entitled, once they\n\n[[Page S5083]]\n\nget on this automatic path to citizenship, to bring in their parents, \npresumably elderly parents, and presumably they will seek, as they have \na right to, health care in America which could be $30 billion per year, \nand they have the option, although it does have to come in under the \ncaps, of also bringing brothers and sisters into the country.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Alabama. When we think about it, the \nCongressional Budget Office figures are way off. I do think the \nHeritage Foundation has probably come about as close as any figures I \nhave seen.\n  Here is what concerns me and concerns those of us who believe we \nought to have a balanced budget, those of us who believe we owe \nsomething to future generations of Americans: We have to be conscious \nof the cost of this type of legislation. It will have a huge impact. In \nfact, I am trying to think back in my career in the Congress to whether \nI have seen as expensive legislation. I don't believe I have. We are \nlooking at astronomical figures.\n  If we look at the Heritage Foundation figures, $30 billion each \nyear--and I think those are conservative and that builds into the base, \nso you have $30 billion the next year on top of that, as I understand \nit. It is astounding. We need to back up a little bit and think on what \nwe are doing to the cost of many of those programs. We need to think \nmore carefully about the solutions we are proposing and have in this \nbill.\n  I am real concerned about the costs. I am real concerned about \nescalating deficits, although I have to say I am pleased with the \nresponse to the President's efforts to stimulate the economy. By \ngrowing the economy, we bring down the deficits. They have been going \ndown. They went down last year. They are going down this year. When we \npass legislation like this, that is all for naught. That undoes \neverything the President has been doing to try to hold down deficit \nspending and what we have been doing in this Congress to hold down \ndeficit spending. For those of us who believe that we need to balance \nour budget, we are going in the wrong direction. It is awfully easy to \nstand here on the floor and say, Look, I support a balanced budget, I \nsupport eliminating deficit spending. But then bills like this come up \non the floor, and I think we forget about what we have been saying \nabout how important it is to the future of this country to reduce and \neliminate deficit spending and to bring our budget into balance.\n\n  This is an important piece of legislation if for no other reason than \nthe fiscal impact that carries with it. That is why I made my point of \norder, because I think that we need to step back and think about the \nresults of this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, just to drive home these numbers, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office report under the \nrefundable tax credit--and these are primarily the earned income tax \ncredit provisions--the Joint Tax Committee estimates that the bill \nwould increase outlays for refundable tax credits by $29.4 billion, the \nlargest direct spending effect in the bill over the first 10 years. \nThat is a really huge number. For the earned income tax credit, I have \nan amendment that will try to reduce that number. But ultimately it is \ngoing to be a cost because as a person becomes a citizen, they will be \nentitled to it. I personally am of the belief that this amount of money \nis not necessary to be provided to people who transfer from illegal to \nlegal status prior to citizenship, and I will offer an amendment. They \nweren't getting it before and they don't need to get it now. So I \nwanted to mention that point.\n  I would recall what Robert Rector said in a press conference \nyesterday. He referred to S. 2611 as a ``fiscal catastrophe.'' This is \na man who, I submit, knows more about welfare and health care benefits \nin America than probably anybody; he is certainly one of the top few in \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. I will \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-six minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, would 10 minutes be satisfactory to the \nSenator from Nebraska?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I don't believe I will need 10 minutes--\ncertainly less than 10 minutes--but any time yielded is appreciated.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska, my good friend, Ben Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my friends from \nAlabama and Colorado for this opportunity to rise in support of Senator \nSessions and our colleagues who are raising a budget point of order on \nthis bill. I have said throughout the entire debate and since I \nintroduced legislation last fall that we have to secure our borders \nfirst.\n  The budget implications of this all-encompassing, do-everything bill \nare just overwhelming, but what concerns me the most is that we are not \ndoing enough to secure our borders first. We shouldn't spend one dime \non any sort of amnesty provisions until we secure our border first. We \nshouldn't attempt to guess how many billions of dollars we are going to \nspend on how many millions of people might be coming into our country \nuntil we secure our borders. It is a very simple equation. We will \nnever get a real grasp on solving the problem of illegal immigration in \nthis country until our borders are secure. Border security first.\n  The deficit is real, and the problem of illegal immigration is also \nreal, and we should make a serious investment in securing our borders. \nBut to adopt an all-encompassing, do-everything bill with a multi-\nbillion-dollar price tag that won't match up with what the House has \npassed, and that doesn't do nearly enough to secure our borders, is \nirresponsible, and I can't support it.\n  That is why I am here today to support Senator Sessions and the \nbudget point of order he intends to raise against this bill.\n  If we don't get a bill out of Congress this year--and when I say out \nof Congress, I am talking about out of committee as well--the costs \nassociated with this illegal immigration issue that we have right now \nwill only continue to go up. That is why investing in border security \nfirst is, in fact, the right investment.\n  Now, not only does this do-everything bill cost a considerable amount \nof money--although we can't be sure exactly how much, but we do have \nsome idea from the CBO estimates that for the first 10-year window, it \ncould be as much as a net of $52 billion, and direct spending from 2017 \nto 2026 could be at least at $108 billion. So while we don't know \neverything about the costs, we do have estimates that would suggest \nthat the cost will be significant and even end up costing us more.\n\n  So we do have to address the border security first. Until we do, the \nimplications and the costs will continue to grow at an alarming rate.\n  Mr. President, there is an old saying that I imagine every parent has \ntold their child: When you are in a hole, the first thing you have to \ndo is stop digging. We have to stop digging. We must secure our border \nfirst, and we must shut down illegal immigration, and only then--only \nthen--can we move forward in a financially responsible way that secures \nour border and, at the same time, gives us an opportunity to put an end \nto illegal immigration and deal in a comprehensive manner with the \nillegal immigration that we already have. We must, in fact, stop the \nproblem from getting bigger in terms of the number of illegal \nimmigrants before we can deal with the problem of what we do with \nillegal immigrants already here.\n  It is not mean-spirited to want to protect our borders, to want to \nclose the back door on illegal immigration and look at opening the \nfront door to legal immigration. There is nothing irresponsible about \nwanting to secure the borders with appropriate barriers,\n\n[[Page S5084]]\n\nfences, and walls to make sure that we are secure against not simply \nillegal immigration for people who want to come to work, but also \nagainst the drug dealers, the smugglers, as well as the gang members \nfrom Central America who continue to come over the border at an \nalarming rate. We have a security issue. I stand today to support the \nbudget point of order.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 10 minutes to my colleague, the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I spend a lot of time on the floor on \nbudget issues and on spending issues, and I am first of all \nappreciative that this point of order was brought up. One of the \ngreatest problems we have is not thinking in the long run. We think in \nthe short run. We think in election cycles. We don't think in \ngeneration cycles.\n  Here are some facts that we do know: We are on an unsustainable \ncourse as a country. We have approximately $70 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities. That is greater than our private net worth today. And we \nare going to transfer those liabilities to our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  What is important about this point of order is a reflection of one of \nthe things we are going to be talking about in June in this body, and \nthat is budget process reform. Because the instructions to the CBO are \nso arcane that they didn't really even look at the real numbers \nassociated with this bill. They didn't talk about the discretionary \ncosts associated with this bill. This bill actually costs $40 billion \nover the first 10 years. After that, at a minimum, this bill will cost \nin the next 10 years one-half of $1 trillion. That is $500 billion.\n  Let me put that in perspective for a minute, what a billion is, \nbecause we throw that number around here all the time. A billion \nseconds ago it was 1959. Three hours and 20 minutes ago, we spent $1 \nbillion, over 3 hours and 20 minutes, this Government. The debt that we \nare transferring now is close to $27,000 per person; that is $8.3 \ntrillion. That is 8,300 billions. So the fact is that the scoring by \nthe rule says CBO has to say it costs in excess of $5 billion. The fact \nis, CBO didn't even look at this. The one thing that they did look at \nis that in one year, in 2016, the 10th year, the direct spending, the \ndirect cost is at a minimum of $11 billion. That is not counting EITC. \nThat is not counting figuring in the 12 million people who are here \nalready in any of the numbers or any of the costs associated with this.\n  So when we use CBO scoring to say it is a net plus in the first 9 \nyears, you have to ask, what does CBO say about where we would be on \nsurpluses? What does CBO say about the cost of Medicare when it was \nstarted and the cost of Medicare 10 years ago when they projected it to \nbe about 70 percent of what it is today, and the projected cost in the \noutyears of Medicare? They never get it right. One of the reasons they \nnever get it right is because we are not honest with them in the \nlegislation that we put through.\n  So if we are going to pass this bill out of the Senate, as I suspect \nwe will, the American people need to know not only the four things that \nare in this bill that are inappropriate for a constitutional republic \nthat is going to need to defend itself in the future--and I am not \ntalking about anti-Hispanic or anti-immigrant; I am talking about the \nrule of law and how that will impact us as a future country--we have to \nbe considerate about what this will do from a financial impact to the \nvery perilous state that we will find ourselves in 10 years from now \nanyway.\n  In 2016, we are going to be close to having 81 percent of the \nbudget--81 percent of the budget--consumed by Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, and interest on the debt. That means 19 percent is \ngoing to have to do everything else. So what you are talking about with \nthis bill in the outyears is at a minimum of $50 billion in new \nexpenditures per year starting in 2016. And probably the CBO scoring, \nbecause it does not reflect the direct costs of discretionary spending \nin this bill today for the 12 million who are here, this will be a net \ncost of several billion dollars over the next few years, up to $40 \nbillion to $50 billion in year 10, and $50 billion plus after that. \nThat violates the budget rules of this body.\n  We may not get the votes to win this point of order, but the American \npeople should know, even if they agree with everything that is in this \nbill, that they are transferring again a lower standard of living, less \nopportunity, and less future to the Americans who are here today by \npassing this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would let the other side use some time if they feel \nthey want to. If not, I will recognize the Senator from Louisiana and \nyield him 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of this budget \npoint of order under section 407, which is being raised against the \nComprehensive Immigration Reform Act. I encourage all of my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to look very hard at this fiscal impact and \nthis budget issue, because it has gotten very little attention in this \nentire debate but will have a dramatic impact on our country, our \nGovernment, and our budget for decades to come.\n  Section 407 of the Budget Act specifically is about impacts on the \nbudget of various legislation for the long term, and the point of order \nsays:\n\n       It shall not be in order to consider any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion or conference report that would \n     cause a net increase in direct spending in excess of $5 \n     billion in any 10-year period between 2016 and 2055.\n  That is $5 billion per decade. There is no argument. There is \nabsolutely no argument of which I am aware that this bill is not above \nthat mark. Everyone seems to agree--CBO, other experts--everyone seems \nto agree that this bill is above that mark, causing huge increases in \nspending--direct spending, Government liability, building into the \nbudget forever and ever, particularly after 2016.\n  The proponents of the bill were very smart. They specifically limited \ncertain benefits that would be available to new citizens under the bill \nin the first decade because there are other budget points of order, \nmore immediate budget points of order, more focused on that first \ndecade after the passage of any bill. But even in that first decade, \nthe expected net increase in expenses is very significant--about, \nperhaps, $52 billion in a 10-year window. But beyond that first decade, \nof course, it increases exponentially. It is much more, as previous \nspeakers have said.\n  I am disappointed, frankly, in the Congressional Budget Office. First \nof all, as I said, they make perfectly clear that this budget point of \norder is blown out of the water. The long-term impact is clearly more \nthan $5 billion per decade. But that is all they said. I would have \nhoped, I would have expected the CBO would do a more precise analysis \nto give us more exact numbers, better numbers. They have not been able \nto do that. All they have been able to say is:\n\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 2611 would cause an increase \n     in direct spending greater than $5 billion in each of the 10-\n     year periods between 2016 and 2055.\n\n  We are not only blowing that budget point for one decade or two \ndecades, but we are doing it for every decade because that is going to \nbe the permanent, everlasting impact, with no end in site on Federal \nGovernment expenditures and on the budget.\n  Other folks outside of Government have tried to perform a more exact \nanalysis. One of them, of course, is Robert Rector of the Heritage \nFoundation, who released a study on the welfare costs of S. 2611. In \nfact, his number, his study, goes way beyond this $5 billion per \ndecade. He says, to sum up, that this would be the biggest increase in \nFederal Government spending, welfare spending, in at least 35 years.\n  I find it particularly ironic that many of the leading proponents of \nthis bill also are some of the very vocal proponents of things such as \nearmark reform, getting spending under control, looking at the budget--\nthe dangers of increasing automatic spending and entitlement programs \nwithout end. I agree with them about all of those concerns. I am not \nsaying they are wrong about those things. They are exactly right. That \nis why I supported so many of those measures, including earmark\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\nreform. But this increase in spending under this bill will make those \nissues look penny ante, in dollar terms. This is of a magnitude far \nsurpassing that in terms of their very real and very legitimate budget \nconcerns.\n  We are just coming out of an experience I hope we never see again, \ndealing with horrific hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, with that \nunprecedented Federal spending in response to those storms, about $100 \nbillion. What concerns me even more is that this legislation threatens \nto build into our budget, particularly after the first 10 years, a \nHurricane Katrina-like event in terms of Federal spending every other \nyear forever, with no end in sight, just repeating that every other \nyear, as if a Katrina came across our shores and caused that need and \nthat amount of spending every other year forever. Of course those \nexpenditures would only increase over time.\n  Let me say, this is a very real, legitimate concern about this bill. \nI hope all of us focus on it more in the closing hours of this debate. \nIt has gotten far too little discussion up until now, and I encourage \neveryone to focus on the very real and frightening budget and fiscal \nimpacts of this bill.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusettes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think I have 30 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am going to speak briefly and then yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, it is important to deal with this document which is \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office. This is an authoritative \ndocument. We understand that the Congressional Budget Office--the CBO--\ndocument is the document we ought to listen to and we ought to regard. \nWhat do they say? On May 16, 2006:\n\n       CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that \n     enacting this legislation would increase direct spending by \n     $13 billion over the 2007-2011 period and by $54 billion over \n     the 2007-2016 period. Pursuant to section 407 of H. Con. Res \n     95 (the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, Fiscal Year \n     2006), CBO estimates that enacting S. 2611 would cause an \n     increase in direct spending greater than $5 billion in each \n     of the 10-year periods between 2016 and 2055. JTC and CBO \n     [The Joint Committee on Taxation and CBO] estimate that the \n     bill would increase total federal revenues by $66 billion \n     over the 2007-2016 period.\n\n  It would increase revenues by $66 billion. Actually, what CBO has \ndetermined is the passage of S. 2611 will actually reduce the deficit \nby $12 billion over 10 years. Do we understand that? This is CBO. They \nestimate we are going to reduce the Federal deficit by $12 billion over \n10 years. The newly legal immigrants will pay $66 billion into taxes \nand cost $54 billion. Net gain to the Treasury: $12 billion.\n\n  What else do they point out? They point out that after 2016, there is \ngoing to be, again, an expenditure of over $5 billion. So there goes \nthe budget. That is what those who are complaining and raising a budget \npoint of order are saying--which is true. But what they don't include \nis what is going to be paid in by the immigrants. Do we hear that? When \nwe look at what is being expended versus what was taken in, we are \nreducing the deficit by $12 billion. But the CBO did not review after \n2016 what will be coming. All they say is there will be more than $5 \nbillion going out. They are giving not even half the story.\n  We ought to look at the statistics and figures in the studies that \nhave been done. The most authoritative study was done by the National \nResearch Council. It is not a Democratic or Republican organization. \nThey are the ones that have been doing the studies. When the National \nResearch Council's report sought to estimate a bottom-line figure for \nthe fiscal impact of immigration, here is what they found:\n\n       When we simultaneously average across both age and \n     education to get a single summary measure of net fiscal \n     impact based on the characteristic of recent arrivals, under \n     our baseline assumptions, we find an average value of plus \n     $80,000.\n\n  Mr. President, $80,000 per immigrant is what the NRC says. That is a \ngood deal of money. In a country that absorbs about a million \nimmigrants a year, that means that each year of that pays $80 billion \nmore in taxes over the course of a lifetime, more than it consumes in \nservices.\n  So when we talk about waiving the point of order, we do it from a \nvery sound fiscal point of view. These are based upon the CBO, the \nNational Research Council. It is wise that we waive the point of order. \nIt is absolutely irrefutable that over the next 10 years, we are going \nto reduce the deficit by the $12 billion.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is the Senator aware whether the CBO included in their \nscoring the disaggregated cost of the 11 million people who are here \nalready in terms of the discretionary costs associated with them?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The CBO has an estimate in there, what is necessary for \nborder security.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am talking about the discretionary costs associated \nwith the implementation. There are 11 million people here today. In \nfact, if the Senator will yield for just a moment, they do not consider \nthat. That is just one of the flaws in the CBO's report.\n  I thank the Senator for allowing me to ask a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For pieces of legislation that are going through the \nbody, they have the request for the CBO requirements. The Congressional \nBudget Office conforms to those particular requests. That is the \nprocess which we are involved and engaged in, not some ancillary kinds \nof expenditures but to use the tried and tested evaluation the Budget \nAct requires. CBO has conformed with the Budget Act request. What I \nhave just related relates to what is necessary for the CBO to provide \nin response to the Budget Committee. When you do that, you find out the \nsurplus.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank Senator Kennedy for yielding. I will try to add a \nlittle bit different perspective.\n  Senator Kennedy is right. If you look at the chart with the numbers, \nthe revenues taken in at a point in time from the immigrant legislation \nexceed the outlays, and that is what CBO says. My good friend Senator \nCoburn and others dispute that. I think CBO is something you use when \nyou agree with them and something you run away from when they disagree \nwith you. Their methodology is probably flawed when I agree with them \nand it is probably flawed when I disagree with them.\n  What I am trying to bring to the table about the economic impact of \nthis debate is that there are more people involved than just the \nFederal Government. It does seem as if, from a Federal Government \nperspective, it is probably good business to get people to pay taxes \nand get them legalized versus having them undocumented. That is one of \nthe economic conditions we are dealing with, is how do you sign up \npeople, who are here to work, in a regularized fashion so we will know \nwho they are and they will contribute to social programs, not just take \naway, and they will not have to live in fear, and they can help through \ntheir tax contributions.\n  It is true some of them withdraw services from programs set up for \npeople who are on economic hard times, but generally speaking, I would \nargue the 11 million people we are talking about assimilating and the \nfuture flow people we are talking about coming here work very hard. We \nall have impressions of this group. My impression of the undocumented \nworkforce we are talking about is it is not a group of people sitting \naround wanting something for nothing. They are doing five and six jobs \na day, working very hard, and economically there has to be room in \nAmerica for somebody like that. If there is no room in America for \nsomebody who is willing to do the hardest job in America from sunup \nuntil sundown, then America has changed.\n  We have 4.7 percent unemployment nationally. I am a Republican. I am \ngoing to take credit for it, along with my President, and share it with \nmy Democratic colleagues. Whatever we are doing or failing to do, one \nthing I can tell you for sure: the economy is as good as it is ever \ngoing to get in your lifetime--4.7 percent unemployment. The GDP growth \nis over 4 percent. There is wage growth over 4 percent and an 11,000 \nstock market.\n\n[[Page S5086]]\n\n  One thing for sure is that the 11 million undocumented workers have \nassimilated into our economy and are not a drain because it is humming. \nThat is just a fact. We can't issue a press release on Monday taking \ncredit for the good economy and talk about a workforce that has been \nhere for years and say it is going to kill the economy because it has \nnot yet, nor will it ever.\n  Our biggest problem in America from an employer point of view is how \ndo you sign people up, knowing who is legal and who isn't. Let's fix \nit. Because you really don't know. What do employers tell me more than \nanything else? I need workers, particularly in the construction \nbusiness, tourism business, agricultural business. I advertise within \nthe native population, and I can't get enough workers. Our bill \nrequires proof that an American has not been put out of a job, a native \nAmerican citizen hasn't been put out of a job because of someone coming \nout of this pool of undocumented workers.\n  The truth is, colleagues, we need these workers.\n  A few years ago, Japan crossed a demographic line of having more \nolder people than younger people. We are getting there. It is going to \nbe impossible, because of the demographic changes in our country, to \nfill all of the jobs we need to keep this economy humming without \nassimilating more people. How do you do that?\n  That is what this bill is about. The economics of assimilating hard-\nworking people, who believe in hard work, who want to play by the \nrules, raise families, and join the military, is a net positive. You \nwill never convince economists that the people we are talking about are \na drain on our society. They have jobs that do not pay a lot right now, \nbut they have a heart and a mindset that makes America a wonderful \nplace to live. Just watch them go and watch them grow. Some of the \nchildren of this illegal immigrant, undocumented workforce are now in \ncollege, in military academies, and fighting our wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, just like every other group that came to America. You start \non the bottom, and people around you don't really appreciate you at \nfirst, but you eventually work your way up. That is going to happen \nhere.\n  The budget impact of assimilating this undocumented workforce into \nour economy needs to be looked at in terms of dynamic scoring. That is \nwhat Senator Kennedy is calling for--dynamic scoring--because that is \nwhat he is basically saying.\n  You need to look at all the things they do and not just at the \nservices they take. You need to look at the economic needs of our \neconomy for workers. We are short of workers. Let us not drive away \npeople who are willing to work. Let us punish people who broke our laws \nbut punish them proportionate to the crime.\n  There are several avenues in the bill as to how you can come to \nAmerica and work, but there is one thing in common for every approach \nto solving the illegal immigration problem. Here is what is in common: \nYou have to work to stay. We are not letting people come here and just \nsit on the corner and suck us dry. In the underlying legislation, if \nyou are out of work for over 45 days, you are ineligible for the \nprogram. You have to learn English, as part of this bill. You just \ncan't come here and not assimilate. You have to take a civics class. \nYou have to hold a job. You cannot break the law, and you have to \nassimilate into our society. An economic benefit will be gained if we \nallow that to happen. A social benefit will be gained if we allow that \nto happen. The cost of doing nothing is catastrophic.\n  And how do you score it? How do you score the cost of having a border \nthat is a joke? How do you score the cost of having a legal system \nnobody knows how to apply? How could you score the cost of having \nmillions of people living around you who are scared to death?\n  What I hope my colleagues will look at when it comes to the budget is \nnot only what the Congressional Budget Office says but the reality of \nwhere we are as a nation. We need good, honest, hard-working people, \ndecent people who will get up early and stay late to keep this economy \nhumming. And they are here among us. Make them pay a just and fair debt \nfor getting here by cutting ahead of the line, but do not ruin our \neconomy in the process.\n  I hope that when we look at the economic condition that this bill \nwill create in America for our budget and our society, we will look at \nit in a dynamic way, in a realistic way, and come to grips with the \nidea that in 2006, America has assimilated these 11 million people who \nare working very hard. What do we do with them now? They are here. How \ndo we control those who want to come after them?\n  I am all for employing people on our conditions--not theirs--of \nregularizing, legalizing, making people pay a debt, pay fines, pay back \ntaxes and future taxes, pay your way the best you can. But I am very \nconfident that the net benefit to our country and our society by \nassimilating a needed workforce in a humane fashion is a budget winner \nand a winner for our society as a whole.\n  I gladly will vote against this budget point of order because while \nyou look at the dynamics of the economic condition of our country and \nthe value the immigrant workforce has now and in the future, it is a \nplus for our country. And doing nothing is the consequence of this bill \nfalling or failing. What will be the cost for the next generation of \npoliticians to do something we can't do among ourselves now? It will be \nmore, it will be harder.\n  Let us do it now. Let us get it right the best we can and realize \nthat America needs honest, hard-working, decent people now more than \never. They are among us, and let us figure out a win-win.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the point of \norder and my colleagues' efforts to point out that this immigration \nbill is ill conceived and, I am afraid, misrepresented and oversold.\n  I would like to say up front that I appreciate all of my colleagues' \nattempts to solve a big problem for our country. Illegal immigration is \na huge problem which we must address. But, unfortunately, as this bill \nhas moved along, I am afraid it has gotten worse instead of better. I \nam afraid that we are failing to look out 10, 15, 20 years to see the \nfinancial tsunami, the category 5 fiscal crisis we have as nation, and \nwe are adding costs without thinking about it.\n  I am afraid the supporters of this legislation would have us believe \nthat it is a rather harmless effort to incorporate illegal immigrants \ninto our culture and that this bill will not have a detrimental impact \non our society and, more importantly, on the Federal Government's \nfinances. The truth is this bill would add billions of dollars of debt. \nAnd tomorrow, our children and grandchildren will have to pay for our \nirresponsibility today.\n  Let me point out a few examples.\n  This legislation would allow an unprecedented wave of immigrants, and \nwe cannot possibly assimilate that many immigrants in that period of \ntime. The Heritage Foundation estimates that the number of legal \nimmigrants entering this country under this legislation would be 66 \nmillion over the next 20 years. And this doesn't include the continued \nstream of illegal immigrants who are projected despite what we say we \nare doing to the border. This bill also does not prohibit tax credits \nfor illegal work done during illegal periods that these immigrants were \nhere. We are going to force them to do their tax returns, and some will \npay taxes. But most, we suspect, will actually qualify for an earned \nincome tax credit worth perhaps thousands of dollars. One projection is \nthat illegal immigrants--the average in the United States since 1986--\ncould qualify for up to $88,000 in earned income tax credits. We must \nnot force our fellow citizens and taxpayers to pay their bill.\n  In addition to this bad policy, it would also allow immigrants to get \nSocial Security benefits for the work they performed while in this \ncountry illegally. The Senate rejected efforts to prevent Social \nSecurity benefits from being awarded to immigrants for the time they \nworked illegally in this country. We need to realize that they will be \nworking with stolen Social Security numbers, which often causes chaos \nin the lives of Americans who have had their identities stolen. We\n\n[[Page S5087]]\n\ncannot reward this behavior with Social Security checks.\n  The bill would also provide some immigrant workers with greater job \nprotection than American workers. The bill supposedly would protect \nU.S. workers by ensuring that new immigrants would not take away jobs. \nHowever, the bill's definition of ``U.S. worker'' includes temporary \nforeign guest workers, so the protection is meaningless. Foreign guest \nfarm workers, admitted under this bill, cannot be ``terminated from \nemployment by any employer . . . except for just case.'' In contrast \nAmerican agriculture workers can be fired for any reason. Hence, there \nis really no protection for Americans, who could be terminated for \nalmost any reason, while providing more protection for those who are \nhere under temporary work visas.\n  In addition, this legislation straps States and local governments \nwith additional unfunded burdens that could cost $16 billion over the \nnext ten years, while providing no relief. This is perhaps the biggest \nhidden cost in all of this legislation.\n  The tremendous expenses from these illegal workers, who are here, \nwhether it be health care or education or the many things they have to \nprovide can not be easily paid for.\n  I can tell that I am running out of time, but I think it is important \nto note.\n  The Congressional Budget Office's projections are that this bill will \ncost our country $54 billion in mandatory spending over 10 years and \n$63.8 billion in discretionary spending over the next 10 years. \nHowever, the bill will only raise $66 billion in revenue. Put simply \nthis bill will give us $51 billion more debt in 10 years and, I am \nafraid, even more debt over a 20-year period. We cannot increase our \ndebt so significantly.\n  I rise in support of this budget point of order, and I thank my \ncolleague for raising it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nyielded 5 minutes from his time. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield in behalf of the Senator.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I speak in opposition to the budget \npoint of order. I have heard a lot of arguments in opposition to this \nbill, and I guess when all else fails and we are moving toward passing \ncomprehensive immigration reform, there is an opportunity to raise yet \none other objection, which is a budget point of order. The fact is, if \nwe did only a border security bill, if we just went about the fact of \nsecuring our border, which we must do, there is a cost associated with \nthat. That doesn't come free. Securing the border costs money. Sending \nthe National Guard to the border, increasing the number of Border \nPatrol, building vehicle obstructions and other barriers, electronic \nsurveillance--none of that comes free. All of that has a cost.\n\n  In fact, it is estimated it would cost about $25 billion. If we only \ndid border security and did not concern ourselves with more \ncomprehensive reform, that $25 billion would now be offset and it would \nbe an outlay of a net $25 billion. Our bill raises over $12 billion in \nrevenue. It collects $66 billion where the costs are estimated to be \nonly $55 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the arm \nof the Congress that is supposed to do this evaluation for us.\n  We also have been talking about the outyears, the period of time \nbeyond the moment, calls that may come about as a result of people \n``taking'' from the system. First of all, we could not do it without \nthe people here today, many of them working illegally, in an illegal \nsystem that, unfortunately, has perpetuated itself for too many years. \nIn the State of Florida we have a labor shortage today. The famous \ntheme parks that we hope many Americans choose to enjoy year after year \ncannot keep enough people on their payroll. They have a need for more \npeople than they have available to do the work of the theme park.\n  The same is true in our agricultural industry. I was meeting with \nfriends from the Florida Farm Bureau today. They were saying, whatever \nyou do, please, help us to keep a stream of labor so we can get our \nwork done. Talk to Florida home builders. The housing industry in \nFlorida would grind to a halt. The construction industry depends on \nwhat is now an illegal workforce. All of these people are not working \nfor the minimum wage, as the Heritage study would assume. Many move \nright on up the ladder.\n  The best thing I can do is use my own life as an example. Yes, my \nparents did come after I came to America. I came at the age of 15. They \ncame later. If I do dare say, over the time I have been fortunate to \nlive the American dream, I have made my contributions to the Treasury \nin taxes. So did my father, who came here at a much later time in life, \nwho went to work and made a living, paid his taxes. Far more than \nwhatever benefits may have been received were paid into the Treasury by \nthe taxes, by the Social Security withholdings and all the other ways \nin which taxes are paid--whether they be property taxes for the homes \nwe have bought, whether it be other contributions, not to mention the \ncharitable contributions.\n  Yes, believe it or not, immigrants do go to work on Sunday. We talk \nan awful lot about the few bad apples that always are in any group that \nhas come here, and their purposes are not good. What about the folks \nthat go to church on Sundays and put something in the basket, help a \nfellow neighbor, bring someone else along and help them to get a job or \ngive them a job?\n  Illegal immigrants in this country also create jobs. They open \nbusinesses. They do not just take; they give. That is the story of \nAmerica. I am not saying anything that is unique or different. All I am \nsaying is, a reflection, a mirroring of the America I have known in my \nlife, the same America for immigrants that came at the turn of the \ncentury from other places also understood and knew to be the America \nthey knew; it is the America that allows people to rise in accordance \nwith their hard work, the story of immigrants in America that work, the \nstory of hard work, people who come here to make a better life--not to \ntake, but to give--to be part of this great experiment we call America \nand to not change America by what they do, but to be changed by \nAmerica.\n  Beyond the issues of money, some worry that our culture will be \nchanged. I have heard that, too. The nature of our country will be \nchanged. How? Perhaps when Italian Americans came to our country, they \nintroduced us to the menu of pizza. Are we any different or worse today \nbecause there have been cultural differences that have enriched America \nwhile, at the same time, we harness to that ideal of being an American, \nof looking at our flag and being proud of it, of knowing what it is and \nwhat it means to be an American?\n  So, let me just say, what we are doing today is to look at a bill \nthat has been carefully crafted, that has been put together, that has \nhad a substantial majority of support. I was very pleased 73 of our \ncolleagues chose to vote to invoke cloture, to move forward, to end \ndebate and to proceed so we can bring the bill to final closure. This \nis one last attempt to try to derail this good legislation, the \nlegislation that our President eloquently spoke about, the need for it, \nthat he persuasively said is part of what he believes to be \ncomprehensive reform.\n  Beyond that, we have an opportunity today to begin to fix a broken \ndown immigration system. We need to overcome this hurdle. I encourage \nmy colleagues to vote against the budget point of order. It gives us an \nopportunity to move forward with this bill so that we may then engage \nin a conference with the House of Representatives and end up providing \na secure border for our country, which this bill does, and a pathway \nfor those who are here to be part of the American dream, to join in \nthis great experiment we call America, to allow them to do what I have \ndone in my own life, which is to become a part of the American dream \nand the American experience.\n  Today, I hope we will defeat this budget point of order so we can \nmove on to put this good bill in order and get to final passage.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator has 23 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S5088]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his leadership, \nalong with that of my friend from Massachusetts, on this issue. They \nhave done a great job in the last few days. Hopefully we are winding \ndown.\n  I pay special attention and appreciation to my colleague from the \nState of Florida who is the embodiment of the American dream, as is my \ncolleague on other side of the aisle, Senator Salazar, from Colorado. \nThey have provided the experience, the knowledge, the background and \nthe motivation to continue our efforts to see this bill passed.\n  Let's be clear. It is not a practice of mine to waive budget points \nof order. I believe the circumstances surrounding the validity of the \npoint of order and the actual intent of its sponsors warrants my \nsupport to the waiver.\n  First, I take issue with the Senators over the misinterpretation and \nediting of the CBO score of this bill. If one were actually to read the \ntext of that report, one would see that the CBO study also finds that \nthe impact of the compromise bill would actually be moderately positive \nfor the Federal Government during the next decade. Legalization would \nactually produce an increase in Federal revenues between 2007 and 2016 \nof $66 billion, mostly through increased collection of Social Security \nand income taxes but also from fees and fines.\n  Remember, we have at least a $2,000 fine being paid. That has been \nraised a couple of times already through amendments. Spending would go \nup by an accumulative $54 billion, but the surplus would be $12 \nbillion. In reality, this program has the possibility of producing a \nnet gain for the Federal budget.\n  However, putting the argument about the numbers aside, we have to get \ndown to the fundamental question of whether or not we really want a \nbill. We have voted several times over the past week and a half to \naffirm the intent of this Senate to pass a comprehensive immigration \nreform bill. It is clear to me that the Senators from Colorado and \nAlabama are not nearly as interested in saving money in our budget as \nthey are to sink the bill because we know that if this budget point of \norder were passed, it would take the bill down--as the Senator from \nAlabama articulated in his press release, relating to this point of \norder, ``to derail'' the bill.\n  So your vote on this amendment should be clear. Do Members want an \nimmigration bill or not? I understand there are Members in this Senate \nwho will answer that question with a resounding no. However, I believe \nthat is not the true intent of the majority of this Senate.\n  This Nation is calling for our borders to be secured and an overhaul \nof our immigration system, and that it be done in a humane and \ncomprehensive fashion. Vote after vote after vote has indicated that. \nThe President's speech to the Nation last week, which I thought was \ninspired, was greeted by 74 percent of the American people overnight \nfavorably, including his absolute determination to see the Congress of \nthe United States send him a bill which has a comprehensive approach to \nthis issue which we as a Congress and a Federal Government have ignored \nfor 40 or 50 years.\n  We will not be deterred from this effort. We will not be deterred \nfrom this effort. I tell my colleagues that the cloture vote indicated \nthe support for this bill. More importantly, the American people want \nus to act. And the American people, driven fundamentally by Judeo-\nChristian principles, want this issue handled in a humane fashion, \ntaking into consideration the highest priority, which is our national \nsecurity. No one believes that simply by enforcing the border we will \nbe able to solve this issue.\n  I thank my colleagues again for their efforts. I hope this may be the \nlast poison pill we have to fight off, but it may not be. Again, I \nappreciate the overwhelming support of my colleagues on this issue as \nwell as the cloture vote which I think sends a clear message.\n  I yield back the remaining time to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the effort by those raising the budget \npoint of order is pure and simple: Another effort to defeat this bill. \nThere have been a series of amendments, call them killer amendments, \ncall them poison pill amendments, which are directed to defeating a \ncomprehensive bill by those who are interested only in border security.\n  The fact is that the comprehensive bill which we have proposed is a \nmoneymaker. The direct spending costs over a 10-year-period are $54 \nbillion; the legislation produces $66 billion. So there is a net \nsurplus of $12 billion.\n  The budget resolution is a very complex resolution relating to $5 \nbillion in expenditures in any 10-year-period between 2016 and 2056. I \nam advised by the Parliamentarian that in the calculation on this \nbudget point of order--and the Parliamentarian is listening so I am \nsubject to corrections--that it is the expenditures which are \ncalculated but it is not the revenues to offset those expenditures in \nmaking this arcane, esoteric, complex, convoluted procedure under the \nBudget Act.\n  Over half of the fees collected from the guest worker program goes to \nborder security. The reality is, an orderly flow of guest workers into \nthe United States is--``vital'' is not sufficiently strong--is \nindispensable for the American economy.\n  We had hearings in the Judiciary Committee on the impact of this bill \non wages and economic benefit to the country. The views were unanimous \nthat this legislation will stimulate the economy.\n  We have an economy where a great many industries rely upon \nimmigrants, including the agriculture field, which has been attested to \nrepeatedly during the course of this debate regarding the need for \nagriculture workers. Also, the hotel industry and the construction \nindustry rely upon immigrants.\n  If we were to take away the 11 million undocumented immigrants, there \nwould be a tremendous shortage of necessary labor. As a Senator from a \nState with 12 million people, a whole procession of constituents have \ntalked to me about what would happen if the immigrant workers were \nsuddenly eliminated in the United States, in my State, Pennsylvania.\n  In this legislation we have an orderly way to handle the 11 million \nundocumented immigrants who are in this country. Putting them on the \npath to citizenship is a key ingredient. Specifying that they have to \nwork for substantial periods of time. They have to be employed, \ncontributing to the economy, contributing to the tax base. That is in \naddition to passing a criminal check and paying their back taxes and \nthe very, very substantial fees which are collected.\n  So there is no doubt, no doubt at all, in the aggregate, the \nimmigrants play a vital part in making our economy expand and thrive. \nIf you take it in the macro sense, where would this country be in the \nyear 2006 without immigrants?\n  For one thing--and perhaps a minor matter--Arlen Specter would not be \nhere because both of my parents were immigrants, and perhaps most of \nthe Senators would not be here, maybe even Senator Sessions. His \nancestry goes back to 1850. I know because I made a trip to the Amazon \nwith him, and we traced the path taken by an uncle. He is quoted in \ntoday's newspaper as still being angry that Abraham Lincoln killed one \nof his ancestors. But immigrants produced Senator Sessions. Immigrants \nproduced everybody in this room, and virtually everybody in the \ncountry.\n  Now, where would we be if the immigrants had not come to make this a \nthriving capitalistic country? Where would we be? The same thing \napplies to the future. If you are going to cut off the immigrants, the \n11 million who are here now and a calibrated guest worker program, it \nwould be devastating to the economy, taking into consideration all of \nthe ramifications.\n  So just because there is a scintilla--that may be an overstatement: \n``a scintilla''--that the budget point of order can hang on, on section \n407 of the Budget Act--I do not know of any substance smaller than a \nscintilla or I would cite it; perhaps a molecule is smaller than a \nscintilla. Scintilla is a legal term, which does not amount to very \nmuch when you talk about $5 billion over a 10-year period from 2016 to \n2056.\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\n  We have some very serious business at hand; and that is passage over \nan immigration bill to protect America's borders and to see to it that \nAmerica's economy is strong. It would be tragic if this bill were to \nfail on an arcane technicality. And I am concerned that this vote may \nbe close.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the broad picture here and, most \nfundamentally, not to use this artifice, this tactic to defeat an \nimportant bill.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 11 minutes \n10 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope that Republicans will not succeed in \nderailing comprehensive immigration reform through procedural \ngamesmanship. I hope the bipartisan coalition is strong enough to \nwithstand this ploy. With respect to funding, I find it ironic that the \nSenator who added a billion dollars to the bill is now complaining that \nit is too expensive and that so many in the Republican majority who \nhave failed to enact a budget and have violated the requirements of the \nlaw by their failure are considering using budget rules to defeat this \nmeasure.\n  We are long past the time when individual Americans dutifully file \ntheir taxes and the Congress is required to enact a Federal budget. \nThat date, April 15, has both those legal requirements. But unlike \nfiling tax returns and paying our income taxes, there is no provision \nin the law that allows the Republican-controlled Congress to call a \ntimeout or obtain an extension. Although Republicans remain in charge \nof the White House, the Senate, and the House, they have utterly failed \nto enact a Federal budget. With respect to the budget, they have \nsucceeded in turning the largest budget surplus in our history into the \nlargest deficit. They have run unprecedented annual budget deficits for \nyear after year of $300 billion to more than $400 billion. They have \nturned a $5 trillion surplus into a $9 trillion deficit. For \nRepublicans to attempt to take advantage of technical budget rules in \nthese circumstances is simply astonishing. I trust that the only affect \nwill be to remind the American people of their gross budgetary \nmismanagement.\n  This bill is expensive to be sure. The enforcement provisions it \ncontains and those that have been added will come at significant costs. \nWhen the Senate was considering the amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Alabama for $1 billion in fencing, I raised the question of how he \nintended to pay for these measures. I still await an answer. The \nbillions this bill will cost now have not been accounted for and are \nnot budgeted. Paying for the National Guard is requiring the diversion \nof funds that had been intended for capital accounts and technological \nimprovements. We heard last week from the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Committee about his frustrations and the \ndifficulties of funding these measures.\n  I trust that the bipartisan coalition working for improved border \nsecurity as part of comprehensive immigration reform will hold together \nto overcome procedural, technical, and budgetary objections. I have \nalready suggested ways to pay for these costly enforcement and security \nmeasures. I did so last week in connection with the $1 billion fencing \namendment of the Senator from Alabama.\n  After noting the irony of the President signing into law an extension \nof tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, I suggested that we end the \nmillionaires' tax breaks and direct those revenues to border security. \nIf we want to return to pay-as-you-go budgeting, that is an obvious way \nto do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  First of all, I would like to point out that this is not that \ndifficult to understand. There are two points of order we can make on \nspending. We can make a short-term point of order, which is within 10 \nyears, or we can make a long-term point of order, which is in the next \n40 years, which is long-term spending.\n  This point of order is made on the latter, the 40 years. All the \narguments that have been made on the floor have been on the first 10 \nyears. So what you can do in this kind of piece of legislation is, you \ncan lump everything to make it look good, and then after the 10 years \nyou put all your spending. That is why we have the long-term provision \nwhere you can make a point of order for those of us who are concerned \nabout long-term spending--programs such as Social Security and \nMedicare, and programs like what we are talking about in this bill that \nhave a profound long-term effect on spending. That is what the point of \norder addresses.\n  The Budget Committee is not out here fighting this bill. They are \npresenting figures to us. And this is what they say: Pursuant to \nsection 407 of House Concurrent Resolution 95, the CBO estimates that \nenacting this bill would cause an increase in direct spending greater \nthan $5 billion in each of the 10-year periods between 2016 and 2055. \nThat is the last 40 years we are talking about.\n  All the arguments on this floor have been on the first 10 years. This \npoint of order is about the next 40 years and long-term spending and \nwhat it is doing to the long-term fiscal health of this country and the \nhuge deficits that are going to lead to huge debts in the 40 years \nafter the first 10 years. That is what this point of order is all \nabout.\n  One other point I would like to make is that we are concerned about \nspending. The figures that are put in here by CBO--they are concerned \nabout spending--these are real figures that will make a difference in \nAmerican lives, in the next generation of American lives.\n  We need to face up to our responsibility. When pieces of legislation \nsuch as this are on the floor, we need to think seriously about the \nfiscal impact long term. That is why I made the point of order.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Nebraska?\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania yield time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank you and appreciate the time from \nthe distinguished chairman of our Judiciary Committee.\n  I rise in opposition to this budget point of order. I have listened \nattentively to the points made. Certainly, we are not a model of fiscal \ndiscipline in this body, in this Congress, as we have run up the debt \nin this country year after year. But let's be clear about some of the \nfacts.\n  First, as you have heard from others who have spoken on behalf of \nthis responsible comprehensive immigration reform bill, CBO has scored \nvarious dynamics of this. No matter what we do--and more importantly, \nunfortunately, we have not done much, but no matter what we do, it is \ngoing to cost some money. It is going to cost money to reinforce our \nborders and to do the things that all Members of Congress have felt \nstrongly about--enhancing the security of our border--and what the \nPresident has talked about.\n  But let's go a little deeper into these numbers. The CBO numbers have \nestimated that this bill will increase total revenues by about $66 \nbillion over a 10-year period. But even deeper than that, what happens \nwhen people go to work? What happens when people invest in communities? \nWhat happens when there is a multiplier effect in communities?\n  What happens is that there are more tax revenues. There is more \nemployment. There are more opportunities. There is better education, a \nhigher standard of living, more consumer spending. That is what \nhappens. And that is what we are talking about in this immigration \nreform bill as much as any one thing.\n  Now, I do not know how many of my colleagues have actually looked at \nthis bill. This is a pretty good-sized bill--I don't know--550 pages. I \nthink the American people, if they took any time to really read this--\nit would be boring, but if they would just peruse it, do you know what \nthey would find? They\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\nwould find answers we have been debating on the floor of the Senate. \nThey would find national security answers. They would find economic \nanswers. They would find job and employment answers. They would find \nsocial fabric answers in this bill.\n  This is not a bill about one or two things. Yes, the first part is \nsignificantly focused on border security. And again, there is little \ndebate about that. But the economic factor here, the consequences are \nsignificant, just as all have said today. But the fact is, to be \ndragged down into the underbrush with subsections of slivers of what we \nare trying to accomplish here is irresponsible.\n  Yes, this is an immigration reform bill. But it is also a job \ngeneration bill. It is an economic development bill. It is a social \nfabric bill. It says something about our country.\n  I think we have done pretty well over the last 4 weeks--in total what \nwe have devoted to debating on this bill--in that we have been able to \ndeflect and knock off amendment after amendment that has not taken a \nwider-lens view of what we are trying to accomplish.\n  If we do not address all of the pieces that are in play, the cost \nwill be far more than my dear friends on the other side are talking \nabout. The cost to this society, the cost to our economy will be far \nbeyond what they are talking about. This is not a cheap deal--just \nborder security alone. But I have had colleagues, from Senator Martinez \nto Senator Specter to Senator McCain, on the floor this afternoon \nexplaining what the real facts are.\n  So I hope our colleagues would recognize this is another attempt to \ndefeat this bill. If this budget point of order is sustained, it will \ndefeat immigration reform, it will defeat the President of the United \nStates, and it will defeat our country.\n  I yield the rest of my time to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a couple minutes, and then I \nam prepared to yield back the time.\n  This budget point of order does not mean that S. 2611 would result in \na significant net cost to the Federal Government over time. In fact, \nthe revenues that will be produced when the undocumented immigrants \nbecome legal residents and start paying income taxes will far exceed \nthe cost of any services they receive.\n  CBO has determined that passage of S. 2611 will actually reduce the \ndeficit by $12.1 billion over 10 years, and the newly legal immigrants \nwill pay $66 billion in Federal taxes. The cost during the same period \nwill be $54 billion. Thus, there will be a net gain to the Federal \nTreasury of $12 billion.\n  There is a reason to believe this same pattern--revenues coming in \nfrom immigrants in taxes exceeding the cost of services--will continue \nin subsequent years. The problem with the budget point of order is that \nit only looks at new spending in the outyears and does not consider the \nnew tax revenue offsetting the cost of that spending. It does not look \nat the full picture.\n  Raising this budget point of order at the end of the Senate's long \ndeliberations on this important legislation is an unfortunate diversion \nfrom the real question before us. This legislation will not cost the \nFederal Government money. It will actually raise revenue and reduce the \ndeficit. But, more importantly, this legislation will address the \nserious problem of illegal immigration, both by increasing border \nsecurity and by creating a path to earned citizenship for millions of \nundocumented workers. It will enhance our security, strengthen our \neconomy, and reaffirm America's fundamental values of justice and \ninclusion.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back time. I do not know what \nthe desire of those on the other side would be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to Senator Sessions. \nThen after his comments, I think we will be ready to wrap it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I do not want to impose, but if I might \nhave 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to say, nobody is \ntalking about ending immigration if this bill does not survive this \namendment. The 1 million people who are allowed to enter our country \nevery year will continue to be able to come in under current law. So it \nis not so to say a vote to pull this unwise and flawed bill, and send \nit back for further review, is an effort to end immigration, for \nHeaven's sakes.\n  We are going to pass, sooner or later, I believe, a bill that will \nincrease immigration, and I will be pleased to support that. However, \nthis one is about three times what the current rate is, and I think \nthat is higher than we ought to approve. So we need to talk about that.\n  I talked to the Congressional Budget Office people today. They only \ndid a 10-year score. Do you know why the first 10 years look better \nthan the second 10 years? Because under the bill, you basically do not \nget citizenship until the 11th year, and you become entitled to all the \nbenefits our country can give you in the 11th year, including that you \nhave a right to bring in your aging parents. If 1 out of 10 bring in \ntheir parents--1 out of 10--according to Mr. Robert Rector at the \nHeritage Foundation, that will be $30 billion a year. He also estimates \nthat the basic welfare medical cost for the people who will be given \namnesty will be $16 billion. So it is $46 billion. He actually said, in \nhis opinion, it would probably be between $50 billion and $60 billion. \nThat is what he said.\n  And we do not have a CBO score, people, for the second 10 years. We \ndo not have one. So we have here moving through this body one of the \nmost significant pieces of legislation in decades, and we have no idea \nwhat the score is. That is how we get in trouble with spending. The \nentitlements for the benefits under the bill will not really kick in, \nin big numbers, until the second 10 years.\n  But I asked CBO about it. Their 10th year was $10 billion. You \nfigure, if that just continued without an increase for the next 10 \nyears, the second 10 years, under the CBO score, would be over $100 \nbillion. Then, I asked a CBO guy, referring to the Heritage Foundation \nnumbers: Well, do you think it would be worse in the second 10 years? \nThis is the direct quote of what the CBO person told me: Very much so.\n\n  Shouldn't we know that? Shouldn't the sponsors of a bill that \npurports to be comprehensive, that is going to fix immigration problems \nin America, be able to tell us what the cost of the bill would be in 20 \nyears? The budget point of order goes out 40 years. Through 2056, CBO \nsays this will be a negative. This will be spending above $5 billion, \nand the budget point of order lies for any of those.\n  All I am saying to my friends is: We need to stop. We need not to run \nforward and go off on a bill that costs an extraordinary amount of \nmoney without giving it a great deal of thought. We haven't even \nconsidered it. Until I received this report on May 16 about what the \ncost was, nobody even had given any figures on the cost, none. Isn't \nthat how we get in trouble, good friends? Isn't that how spending gets \nout of control?\n  I urge my colleagues to understand that this bill has a direct and \ndiscretionary spending increase in it of $110 billion over 10 years, \nthat tax revenues come in at $66 billion, which is not countable as a \nmatter of law, but we will count it as a matter of practicality, \nleaving a total net loss to the Government in the first 10-year window \nof $52 billion. That is where the budget point of order lies. We ought \nto sustain it.\n  We have made progress in making this legislation better since it has \nbeen on the floor, but the flaws are so significant and the issues \nimportant to immigration have been so little addressed in many key \nareas that we ought not to go forward. We should pull the bill and get \na better one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 1 minute.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, is the other side ready to yield back \ntheir time?\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. No.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Then I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is a little surprising to find this \nbudget point of order being raised so late in the proceedings. We have \nbeen on this bill now for almost 2 weeks. We expect to finish up either \nlate tonight or tomorrow for the 2-week period which was allocated. So \nhad there been a judgment that this bill should fall on a budget point \nof order, it would have been expected to have been raised much earlier \nto save the Senate some time.\n  We have the same parties raising this objection who have raised \nearlier objections in what is an effort to defeat the bill. They have a \nright to offer amendments which may be poison pills or may be killer \namendments or to raise a budget point of order, but when we are dealing \nwith the vagaries of the Budget Act, we are talking about a $5 billion \nexpenditure, 10-year periods beginning in the year 2016, through 2055. \nWe are dealing in concepts that are not very tangible. And when \ncompared to the importance of this immigration bill, those arcane \ntactics and procedures are not nearly as weighty as getting some action \non this important bill.\n  I made the argument--Senator Kennedy followed through on it--that the \nproblem is that this calculation deals with expenditures and not with \noffsetting revenues. And the expenditures in the first 10 years, CBO \nsays, are $54 billion, and the revenues are $66 billion, for a net gain \nof $12 billion. That is to say nothing about the importance of these 11 \nmillion undocumented immigrants for the economy of the United States. \nThat is to say nothing about the use of guest workers calibrated very \ncarefully for the future.\n  I urge my colleagues not to accept this artifice and tactic to defeat \na bill which is enormously important.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 1 minute.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to quickly summarize by saying this \nis about long-term spending. The Congressional Budget Office, a week \nago, brought out a cost estimate that explicitly states: Enacting S. \n2611 would cause an increase in direct spending greater than $5 billion \nin each of the 10-year periods between 2016 and 2055. This is a big \nspending bill in the outlying years. That is what the point of order is \nall about. It is not difficult. It is straightforward. These are \nfigures that we were presented with from the Congressional Budget \nOffice a little over a week ago. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting no to grant a waiver.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: We will now \nproceed to a vote on the motion to waive the budget point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the motion to waive section 407 of the budget \nresolution. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under a previous agreement, the next order of \nbusiness is the Byrd amendment on which there is 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Byrd-Gregg amendment would provide $3 \nbillion for border security and interior enforcement by assessing a \n$500 fee on the illegal aliens who would benefit under title VI.\n  The bill authorizes appropriations for $25 billion over the next 5 \nyears with no means to pay for it. The Byrd-Gregg amendment is a modest \nfee increase that would help to provide essential border security \nfunds.\n  So for Senators who want to secure the border, this is the amendment \nthat will provide a source of funding to make it happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just so the membership knows, under the \nexisting bill, we are collecting $18 billion in fees. With the Cornyn \namendment, there is $5 billion to $6 billion in addition. That is \n$2,750 for every worker who is going to make their adjustment and try \nto become a citizen. These are the poorest of the poor. If they have a \nchild, it is going to cost them $100 for every extra child. This \namendment is adding another $500.\n  It seems to me that we have addressed the underlying issue in terms \nof cost, and this is going to be a major burden for people who work \nhard and are making the minimum wage. It is a big burden on them. We \nhave adjusted for it. With the Cornyn amendment, I think we have met \nthe responsibilities. If we need to have more, we can come back for \nmore. But I think this is adding an additional burden, and we are doing \nit for low-income workers who will be covered by this legislation. I \nhope it will not be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Byrd \namendment No. 4127.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, can we have order?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nadded as cosponsors: Senators Frist, Sessions, Alexander, and Bond.\n  I yield my minute to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield my minute to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator please restate his additional \ncosponsors?\n  Mr. GREGG. I filed them with the clerk--Senators Frist, Sessions, \nAlexander, and Bond.\n  I yield my minute to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the diversity \nlottery program. This is not the asylum program. This amendment is not \nthe H-1B program. This is not the broad immigration program. This is \nthe only program that was added to immigration legislation to try to \nget diversity from a number of countries that weren't sending \nimmigrants to the United States. This amendment simply says, for those \nimmigrants coming from those countries, let's try to get 70 percent of \nthem to be of the education degrees--technology, math, science--that we \nneed in the United States. That is a benefit to us because those are \noccupations and expertise which we need. It is also a benefit to those \ncountries as these individuals gain expertise that can later be used in \ntheir countries.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this ``best and brightest'' amendment \nbut still leave diversity for these countries and diversity for those \nwho are nonskilled as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who rises in opposition? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the time that the Senator from \nWashington has been in the Senate, I have never differed with her \nexcept on this one occasion I do.\n  We have 860,000 individuals who come here. They primarily come here \nfrom Asia or from South America. We have a diversity program to permit \nin 42,000 of the 8 million from around the world who apply for this \nprogram who otherwise would never have the opportunity to come here. We \nhave increased the high-tech people by three times in this \nlegislation--three times. All we are saying is America: diverse \nAmerica, melting pot America. If these individuals come here, they have \nto have a high school diploma, they have to meet the security \nrequirements, and they can't be a burden on the State. That is just one \nfeature of a very important immigration bill, but it has been an aspect \nand commitment of our Nation--diversity--since the history of this \ncountry.\n  Let me point out the opposition: the Chamber of Commerce, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, Business Roundtable, et cetera.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is an amendment which Senator Kennedy and I \nhad earlier stated we found agreeable. There have been some reports \nthat there might be objections. If there are no objections, we can take \nSenator Landrieu's amendment on a voice vote. I urge adoption of the \nLandrieu amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the time be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe we are now prepared to vote on \nthe final amendment in this sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes equally divided on \nthe Hutchison amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this amendment is a pilot program \nwhich is based on the Canadian guest worker program with Mexico. It has \nworked successfully for over 30 years. It would provide a safe, tamper-\nproof visa for people coming into this country to take jobs that \nAmericans are not filling. The guest worker would retain citizenship in \nhis or her own country. It doesn't replace anything in the bill. It is \nin addition to what is in the bill.\n  The American Farm Bureau supports this.\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\n  I hope that we will get a good, solid vote. This is something that \ncould be part of an overall balanced solution to the problem we are \nfacing. It is another option for people who want to work but do not \nseek citizenship in our country.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It could be part of \nthe final solution to a good bill that we would all like to support.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this creates an entirely new guest worker \nprogram without the kind of protections for the workers that are \nincluded in the underlying legislation. It is 10 months and then 10 \nmonths with no path to be able to go forward. We have a good temporary \nprogram that has been built in. It has been modified from 400,000 down \nto 200,000. But why now invite an entirely new guest worker program \nwithout the worker protections? This is going to be another Bracero \nissue question, and we don't need to repeat that period. I hope it will \nnot be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But it proves that Congress can respond to a \ngreat tragedy.\n  Certainly, with the Sago mine disaster of January 2, followed by \nother disasters, and now the recent Kentucky disaster, it was very \nimportant that we look at all the mine safety issues, all the \noccupational safety issues, and look at coal mining.\n  I want to pay tribute today to the staff that worked so diligently, \nthe staffs of Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, the staff of Senator \nMurray, my staff, and the staffs of the two distinguished Senators from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Byrd: Ilyse Schuman, Brian \nHayes, Kyle Hicks, Holly Fechner, Portia Wu, Sharon Block, Ed Egee, \nBill Kamela, David McMaster, Ellen Doneski, and John Richards.\n  These individuals worked tirelessly to bring a bill to this floor \nwhich we adopted unanimously. I am pleased to tell you the House \nintends to do the same tomorrow.\n  I particularly commend Senators Rockefeller and Byrd, in whose State \nthe Sago mine tragedy took place, who have worked tirelessly on behalf \nof the citizens in their State, and the Senators from Kentucky in their \nresponse to this tragedy that took place just last week.\n  But in symbol of all those brave miners, I want to pay tribute to \nGeorge Junior Hamner. I went to West Virginia to see the Sago mine \nfamilies 3 days after they had been found dead in that mine. I met \nJunior's wife and I met his 22-year-old daughter. His daughter gave me \nthis picture, taken on Christmas Eve, just 8 days before he died in the \nSago mine. And she said: Sir, if you will take this back to Washington \nand make sure, whatever you do, you pass legislation that hopefully \nwill keep people from ever facing the tragedy my father faced in that \nmine.\n  So as a tribute to Junior Hamner, to his daughter, to his wife, and \nto all the families of those who died in the Sago mine tragedy, I pay \ntribute to the Senators from West Virginia, the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray, to Senator Enzi, the tireless chairman of this \ncommittee, who has worked tirelessly to see this happen, and to all the \nMembers of this great body for passing legislation to respond to a \ntragedy--with hope, with reasoned responsibility, and with the promise \nfor better technology and better safety in the future of all coal \nminers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be in order; further, that these be the only \nremaining amendments in order other than the managers' amendment: \nSenator Boxer, amendment No. 4144, with 24 minutes equally divided; \nSenator Burns, amendment No. 4124, with 10 minutes equally divided; \nSenator Chambliss, amendment No. 4084, with 40 minutes equally divided; \nSenator Cornyn, amendment No. 4097, with 40 minutes equally divided; \nand that at the conclusion of the debate on these four amendments, we \nproceed to four stacked votes, with the first vote on the Boxer\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\namendment being 15 minutes, with 5 minutes overtime, according to our \npractice, and the following amendments being 10 minutes, with 5 minutes \novertime; and that tomorrow morning we proceed with the Dorgan \namendment No. 4095, with 30 minutes equally divided; Senator Bingaman, \namendment No. 4131, with 40 minutes equally divided; Senator Sessions, \namendment No. 4108, as modified, with 1 hour equally divided; Senator \nFeingold, amendment No. 4083, with 1 hour equally divided; provided \nfurther that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the above \namendments; provided further that the first four amendments on the list \nbe debated with the four votes occurring in a stacked sequence at the \nconclusion of debate on the four amendments, with 2 minutes equally \ndivided between each of the amendments, and that following agreement on \nthe managers' package, the bill be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to passage, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, we \ncannot yet come to agreement on the modification on amendment No. 4108 \nby Senator Sessions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are awaiting clearance on the \nmodifications as to Senator Sessions' amendment No. 4108, so I will \nrestate the unanimous consent request in a more limited form.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we may proceed to four amendments to \ndebate them this evening: Senator Boxer, amendment No. 4144, with 24 \nminutes equally divided; Senator Burns, amendment No. 4124, with 10 \nminutes equally divided; Senator Chambliss, amendment No. 4084, with 40 \nminutes equally divided; Senator Dorgan, amendment No. 4095, with 30 \nminutes equally divided; that the first vote on the Boxer amendment be \n15 minutes, in accordance with our usual practice, and the following \nvotes be 10 minutes; provided further that there be no second-degree \namendments in order to the above amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, then, we now proceed to Senator Boxer's \namendment No. 4144.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the amendment, as modified; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Boxer's amendment No. 4144, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4144, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides. We \nmade a technical modification. It doesn't change anything, but makes it \nclearer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Dorgan and Stabenow be added as \ncosponsors to amendment No. 4144.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Dorgan, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4144, as modified.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 265, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       ``(b) Required Procedure.--\n       ``(1) Efforts to recruit united states workers.--During the \n     period beginning not later than 90 days prior to the date on \n     which a petition is filed under subsection (a)(1), and ending \n     on the date that is 14 days prior to the date on which the \n     petition is filed, the employer involved shall take the \n     following steps to recruit United States workers for the \n     position for which the H-2C nonimmigrant is sought under the \n     petition:\n       ``(A) Submit a copy of the job offer, including a \n     description of the wages and other terms and conditions of \n     employment and the minimum education, training, experience \n     and other requirements of the job, to the State Employment \n     Service Agency that serves the area of employment in the \n     State in which the employer is located.\n       ``(B) Authorize the State Employment Service Agency to post \n     the job opportunity on the Internet through the website for \n     America's Job Bank, with local job banks, and with \n     unemployment agencies and other labor referral and \n     recruitment sources pertinent to the job involved.\n       ``(C) Authorize the State Employment Service Agency to \n     notify labor organizations in the State in which the job is \n     located, and if applicable, the office of the local union \n     which represents the employees in the same or substantially \n     equivalent job classification of the job opportunity.\n       ``(D) Post the availability of the job opportunity for \n     which the employer is seeking a worker in conspicuous \n     locations at the place of employment for all employees to \n     see.\n       ``(2) Efforts to employ united states workers.--An employer \n     that seeks to employ an H-2C nonimmigrant shall--\n       ``(A) first offer the job to any eligible United States \n     worker who applies, is qualified for the job, and is \n     available at the time of need;\n       ``(B) be required to maintain for at least 1 year after the \n     H-2C nonimmigrant employment relation is terminated, \n     documentation of recruitment efforts and responses conducted \n     and received prior to the filing of the employer's petition, \n     including resumes, applications, and if applicable, tests of \n     United States workers who applied and were not hired for the \n     job the employer seeks to fill with a nonimmigrant worker; \n     and\n       ``(C) certify that there are not sufficient United States \n     workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available at \n     the time of the filing of the application.''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Chair be so kind as to let me know when I have \n3 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my amendment would require that employers \ntake real steps to attract and hire U.S. workers prior to petitioning \nthe Department of Homeland Security for authorization to hire an H-2C \nnonimmigrant. In other words, what we are trying to say here is, if \nthere is a job available for an American worker, for a U.S. worker, \nlet's make sure that they get that job before we give it away to an \nimmigrant worker.\n  Over the next 5 years, a million foreign workers could enter the \ncountry under that guest worker program that is in the bill. This is a \nmillion new workers who will be competing with U.S. workers for jobs. \nAdvocates of the guest worker program claim that it is needed because \nAmericans are not willing to do the jobs that will be filled by these \nforeign guest workers. But it seems to me, whether you believe that or \nnot, we need to ensure that every step is taken to hire a U.S. worker \nfirst, because these jobs we are talking about are not agricultural \njobs. Those are addressed in a different section, the AgJOBS bill. We \nare not talking about high-tech jobs because we take care of that in \nanother portion of the bill. So let's take a look at the jobs we are \ntalking about. I have them here on this chart.\n  These are the jobs that will be taken by guest workers unless we can \nsay that, in fact, there is an American worker for their job. I ask \nrhetorically, will we have U.S. workers for construction jobs? Will we \nhave U.S. workers for food preparation jobs? Will we have U.S. workers \nfor manufacturing jobs? Will we have U.S. workers for transportation \njobs? Clearly, if you look at the jobs that are being held today, 86 \npercent of construction jobs are held by U.S. workers; food \npreparation, 88 percent; manufacturing, 91 percent; transportation, 93 \npercent. So obviously, there are workers in this country, U.S. workers \nwho can take those jobs, rather than importing a guest worker to take \nthem. These are good jobs. They pay well. Right now, again, the \noverwhelming number of them are held by U.S. citizens and legal \nworkers.\n  Why is it that U.S. workers want these jobs? It is because they pay \nwell. The average worker in the construction sector gets $18.21 an hour \nor $37,890 a year. Construction work is a good job. It is a job for \nwhich there are many U.S. workers. If we are going to open these jobs \nto foreign workers through the guest worker program, we\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\nbetter make sure that employers cannot find a U.S. worker who is \nwilling to do the job. U.S. workers deserve to get the first crack at \nthese jobs. All we are saying to the employers is, do anything you can \nfirst to make sure you can fill this job with an American worker.\n  The underlying bill is vague on what employers have to do. That is \nthe reason why we are working with the working people here. We have \ncome up with a very good way to ensure that there are concrete steps \nthat have to be taken by employers before they fill a job with a \nforeign worker. Again, the underlying bill says the employer has to \nsay: I made a good faith effort. But it does not lay out specific steps \nthat they have to take. So the bill doesn't do enough to ensure that \nU.S. workers will find out that there are openings, and it doesn't do \nenough to make sure that they have an opportunity to apply for a job \nbefore it is given away to a foreign guest worker.\n  This amendment throws light on the process. It makes sure the job \nlistings get to the U.S. workers in time to make a difference. I say to \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you stand with U.S. workers, \nthen vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  What is it that we ask employers to do? It is quite simple. We ask \nthem to submit a copy of the job offer to their local State employment \nservices agency before they file a petition for an H-2C worker. Then \nthe State employment agency is authorized to post the job on the \nInternet, job banks, and with unemployment agencies. In addition, the \nagency, if they wanted, could share the job listing with local unions \nrepresenting workers that are relevant to the job listing.\n  What else does the employer have to do? I already said they had to \nnotify the State employment agency. They have one more thing they have \nto do. They have to post in a conspicuous place in the workplace a \nnotice that says there is a job opening. That is all they have to do, \nput up a notice that there is a job opening. Put it in a conspicuous \nplace, tell the State employment agency there is a job opening, and \nallow them to recruit. We do not add any more time in the process. It \nall is done in the same timeframe.\n  This amendment is a win/win for everyone. It is a win for the \nemployers because they are going to give a good chance to a U.S. \nworker. It is a win for America's workers. The burdens that we place on \nemployers are practically nonexistent: To notify the State employment \ndepartment and to post a notice of the job opening.\n  There is no delay. The bill already requires employers to make a good \nfaith effort, and they have to do that 90 days before they file a \npetition. All of this will be done in that timeframe.\n  Our amendment helps U.S. workers find out about job openings before \nemployers file a petition for a foreign worker. Unemployment agencies \nand unions get a chance to find out about the jobs. They can present \nthose to qualified workers. In fact, both the AFL-CIO and the Teamsters \nstrongly support this amendment.\n  We think as a result of this amendment, the news of a job is spread \nbroadly. And hopefully a U.S. worker will fill the position. If not, \nthe employer is free to file his petition and recruit a foreign guest \nworker. I believe if we do not impose adequate recruitment procedures, \nit is the U.S. worker who will ultimately pay the price and, frankly, \nrevolt against this bill. Jobs that should have been filled \ndomestically will be given to foreign workers, and that is wrong. \nUnemployment will increase, and there will be downward pressure on \nwages and working conditions. This amendment would help ensure that \ncompanies will be able to get the workers they need and that U.S. \nworkers will have a chance to fill those positions.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the objectives outlined by the Senator \nfrom California I agree with; that is, to have a period of time to find \nan American worker so that we don't have a guest worker fill a job when \nthere is an American worker available. We ought to do that--to protect \nAmerican jobs before we bring in guest workers. The bill currently has \na 90-day period during which employers find out if there are willing \nAmerican workers before a job is offered to a guest worker. I believe \nthat is a preferable course. You spend 90 days looking for an American \nto fill the job, but if you find, at the expiration of the 90 days, \nthere is no American who wants the job, then you give the job to a \nguest worker, as opposed to giving the job to a guest worker and then \nlooking for somebody for 90 days after that. That keeps the guest \nworker on tenterhooks, not knowing whether he or she has the job or \nnot. That may lead the prospective guest worker to go elsewhere and \nconceivably could lead the prospective guest worker to try to enter the \nUnited States illegally since he or she doesn't know whether or not \nthey have the job.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. OK, on your time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is not what we do. Before a guest \nworker is hired, we ask the employer to do two things during the 90-day \nperiod, the same period. We ask him, like the bill says, to make a good \nfaith effort. And part of that we define as posting the job in the \nworkplace and calling the local State employment department. And then \nif they can't find an American worker, then they can hire a guest \nworker. We don't say it is after the guest worker is hired. I felt \ncompelled to tell my friend. Please, if you could reread the amendment, \nbecause what we say is during that 90-day period that you have, we are \nonly adding a requirement of simply posting that position and notifying \nthe department of employment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the current legislation, the bill, \nprovides that the employer must try to find an American worker, must \nmake that effort for 90 days before the employer offers a job to a \nguest worker. Isn't that correct, if I may direct that question to \nSenator Boxer?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I read the section of the bill several times. What you \nhave in the bill is very good. It says the employer must make a good \nfaith effort before hiring a guest worker, and he or she has to take 90 \ndays. All we do is say, in that 90-day period, the employer must post a \njob notice in the plant and notify the department of employment. That \nis all we are doing. We don't change anything in the bill. We just say \nduring the 90-day period, post the job and let the State Department of \nEmployment know. I don't understand why we have a problem with this.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment which I have before me, \noffered by the Senator from California, does more than that.\n  How much time remains on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 8 minutes \nand 25 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator from California has \naccurately described her amendment, we may not be too far apart. What I \nwould suggest is that we set aside the Boxer amendment so we can talk \nabout it--maybe we can come to terms--and proceed at this time to the \nBurns amendment. I believe Senator Chambliss is on the premises. This \namendment will not take long. We will be prepared to go to the \nChambliss amendment shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I assume the manager of the bill is \ninviting us to proceed with our amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Correct.\n  Mr. BURNS. And the Boxer amendment has been laid aside.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4124\n\n  Mr. Burns. I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 4124.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for himself, Mr. \n     Stevens, and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 4124.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\n     SEC. __. EXCLUSION OF ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM CONGRESSIONAL \n                   APPORTIONMENT TABULATIONS.\n\n       In addition to any report under this act the director of \n     the bureau of the census shall submit to Congress a report on \n     the impact of illegal immigration on the apportionment of \n     Representatives of Congress among the several States and any \n     methods and procedures that the Director determines to be \n     feasible and appropriate, to ensure that individuals who are \n     found by an authorized Federal agency to be unlawfully \n     present in the United States are not counted in tabulating \n     population for purposes of apportionment of Representatives \n     in Congress among the several States.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStevens and Senator Inhofe be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is a pretty straightforward amendment. \nThroughout this debate on immigration, we have heard how illegal \nimmigration affects practically every aspect of our life. What many may \nnot realize is that illegal immigration also affects the very \nfoundation of this country--our system of representation, especially in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Currently, the policy of this Government is to count illegal aliens \nin the U.S. census and to use those numbers for reapportioning seats in \nthe House of Representatives. Studies and census data also show that \nmost illegal immigrants reside in just a few areas of the country. And \njust by being there, illegal aliens have a great deal of influence on \nhow the seats of the House of Representatives are distributed among the \nStates.\n  I ask the manager of the bill how he wants to proceed on this \namendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if my understanding is correct, the \nthrust of the amendment by the Senator from Montana is to request a \nstudy on this issue.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is correct. This directs the Census Bureau to take a \nstudy and get the true impact of how counting illegal aliens affects \nthe reapportionment in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I believe the amendment is a good one. We are prepared \nto accept it and move to a voice vote.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask a \nquestion of the Senator from Montana. Some on our side have been \nconcerned that the amendment would give new mandates or authorities to \nthe Census Director beyond the study which you have described. Is this \namendment intended to give any additional authority to the Census \nBureau other than conducting a study as you described?\n  Mr. BURNS. It is not.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Again, to reiterate my understanding of the proposed \namendment, it is that you would request and require the Census Bureau \nto conduct a study on the impact of undocumented workers in this \ncountry on reapportionment?\n  Mr. BURNS. That is correct.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Montana.\n  The amendment (No. 4124) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the managers of this legislation. I felt all along \nthat we should look at this just like we looked at employers. So I \nthank the managers of the bill, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we are prepared to move to the \namendment by the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4084\n\n (Purpose: To modify the eligibility requirements for blue card status \n and to increase the fines to be paid by aliens granted such status or \n                    legal permanent resident status)\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4084.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4084.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Friday, May 19, 2006, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized for 20 minutes, and a Senator in opposition will \nbe recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. I \nrefer to it as an American values amendment because I think it reflects \nthe values that all Americans hold. It is no secret that I think the \napproach in this bill to reform immigration as it pertains to \nagriculture is wrong. I don't agree with amnesty, and I don't think it \nis in the best interest of American agriculture.\n  Even so, when I read the fine print of this bill, I am shocked to see \nwho can qualify for the agricultural amnesty provisions in the bill. \nThey are different and a separate amnesty for what exists for the 12 \nmillion or 20 million or however many millions of nonagricultural \nworkers who are expected to adjust status under the base bill.\n  We have heard the proponents of the bill on the floor of the Senate \ndiscuss how it is not an amnesty bill. They point to the strict \nrequirements that current illegal workers must meet in order to adjust \ntheir status. Illegal immigrants under the base bill, in order to \nadjust their status, must learn English, pay back taxes, pay a stiff \npenalty, and go to the back of the line in order to apply for \ncitizenship. The people who are telling the American people this are \nobviously not referring to the AgJOBS portion of this bill.\n  If they read the AgJOBS portion of this bill, they will see that, in \nfact, there are substantial differences relative to the requirements \nfor adjusting status. For agricultural workers to adjust status, they \ndon't have to learn English, they have to pay a total of $500, they \nhave to have worked a minimum of 150 hours over the past 2-year period \nleading up to December 31, 2005, and they don't have to wait at the \nback of the line.\n  This amendment I have filed does three very simple things. First, it \ninserts a requirement for agricultural workers to learn English if they \nare going to adjust their status. This is an important standard that we \nshould insist be met by all illegal workers who are going to be put on \na new path to citizenship. Why should agricultural workers be exempt \nfrom learning English when every other illegal worker under the base \nbill must demonstrate not only knowledge of English, but also a \nknowledge of U.S. history and Government?\n\n  The answer is that they should not be. We know it is important for \nthe folks to learn English. We also know it is far more likely that if \nthe requirement to learn English exists, then a far greater number of \nagricultural workers will learn it than not. In addition, this body \nvoted just last week to make English the official language of our \ncountry. The least we can do is require folks who are obtaining an \nenormous benefit and privilege--the right to be U.S. citizens despite \nhaving broken our laws--to learn English. They have to do that under \nthe base bill. They ought to be required to do that under the AgJOBS \nportion of this bill.\n  Second, this amendment would bring about the amount of fines that \nmust be paid by illegal agricultural workers into conformance with what \nother illegal workers must pay in order to stay in the United States \nwhile on a path to citizenship. The nonagricultural worker must pay a \npenalty of $2,000 to remain in the United States and work despite their \ncurrent illegal presence; whereas, agricultural workers must only pay \n$100. Well, $100 is not what I call a stiff penalty; $100 is one trip \nto the grocery store; $100 is two tanks of gasoline; $100 is a new pair \nof fancy tennis shoes; $100 is 33 gallons of milk; $100 is not the blue \nlight special price of U.S. citizenship.\n  Third, this amendment strengthens the prior work requirements for \nillegal agricultural workers to obtain blue card status, which puts \nthem on a new path to citizenship. Strengthening this requirement is \nimportant for two main reasons. First, because we know that agriculture \nis a traditional gateway for illegal immigration. Many illegal \nimmigrants come to the United States to work in agriculture for a \nperiod of time and then move on to other areas of the country and to \nother industries. We also know that the number of agricultural workers \nwho can adjust status under this bill is capped at 1.5 million.\n  If the threshold requirements, cost, future work and language \nrequirements\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\nfor adjustment of status are so much lower for agricultural workers \nthan for the rest of the illegal population, there will be a \nsignificant incentive for those folks who spent a minimal amount of \ntime in agriculture and have since moved on to try to adjust their \nstatus through the agricultural amnesty provision. After all, we all \ntend to choose the cheapest and easiest means of obtaining the things \nwe want. The folks who are here illegally will not do otherwise. I \nbelieve this incentive will result in a situation in which many folks \nwho are currently working in agriculture will be beat to the punch in \nobtaining a blue card by those no longer in agriculture, or who work \nonly part time agricultural jobs.\n  At the end of the day, it is very likely that this amnesty won't \nbenefit those it is intended to help. So while I wholeheartedly \ndisagree with granting amnesty, if we are going to do it for \nagricultural workers, let's make sure it is reserved for those working \npermanently in agriculture.\n  The second reason it is important to strengthen the past work \nrequirements is because they are generally reflective of future work \nrequirements. If someone cannot be employed for more than 150 days per \nyear, then they should not become a permanent U.S. citizen, but they \nshould be under a temporary worker program.\n  Again, the three things that this amendment does are: First, require \nthat agricultural workers learn English, just like everyone else, in \norder to be able to adjust status. Second, increase the penalty fees \nnecessary for agricultural workers to adjust status into conformity \nwith the fees paid by every other illegal worker under the base bill. \nThird, strengthen the work requirements an illegal agricultural alien \nmust meet in order to adjust status.\n  Because the first two goals are relatively clear, I will explain \nfurther the third one, the strengthened work requirements. If you look \non page 397 of the bill, you will see some important definitions for \nthe AgJOBS title. One that I am seeking to change with this amendment \nis the definition of a workday.\n  The term ``workday'' means any day in which the individual is \nemployed for 1 or more hours in agriculture in the AgJOBS title. A 1-\nhour workday will allow illegal aliens to meet their workday \nrequirements. There are many hard-working Americans across this country \nwho work long hours each day, some in multiple jobs, to provide for \ntheir families. It doesn't seem fair to those hard-working Americans to \nallow illegal immigrants to obtain the prized possession of U.S. \ncitizenship for a 1-hour workday. That is not an American value, and \nmost people spend 1 hour getting ready for work. You can wash and dry a \nload of clothes in 1 hour. You can watch two episodes of the Andy \nGriffith show in 1 hour. One hour is not a full workday, and I don't \nknow of a single farm in this country that requires folks to work for 1 \nhour per day--yet under this bill, that is possible.\n  Therefore, a key provision of this amendment changes the definition \nof a workday from 1 hour to 8 hours. This reflects what a workday is to \nmost Americans. Not only that, it is in line with what many \nagricultural workers are already doing. According to the latest \nNational Agricultural Workers Survey, published by the U.S. Department \nof Labor in March 2005, the average number of hours worked per week by \nagricultural workers was 42 hours.\n  A Congressional Research Service report, entitled ``Farm Labor \nShortages and Immigration Policy'' reveals that ``recent data reveal no \ndiscernible year-to-year variation in the average number of weekly \nhours that hired farmworkers are employed in crop or livestock \nproduction.''\n  According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service Farm Labor \nSurvey, ``the average work week of hired farmworkers has ranged around \n40 hours since the mid 1990s.''\n  Now, on page 398 of the bill, it tells you who can get a blue card, \nwhich is the amnesty mechanism for agricultural workers in this bill--\nbecause once you get a blue card, you are all but assured to get a \ngreen card. It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     shall confer blue card status upon an alien who qualifies \n     under this subsection if the Secretary determines that the \n     alien has performed agricultural employment in the United \n     States for at least 863 hours, or 150 work days, whichever is \n     less, during the 24-month period ending December 31, 2005.\n\n  If a workday is defined as one or more hours in agriculture and an \nillegal agricultural worker must have worked 150 days in agriculture \nover a 2-year period, then illegal aliens who work 150 hours in \nagriculture automatically become eligible for a blue card and then \nvirtually are assured of a green card after that.\n  Doesn't that seem like a low threshold requirement for getting \npermanent resident status in the United States, is the question I ask \nmy colleagues?\n  For many around the world, U.S. citizenship is the pot at the end of \nthe rainbow that they spend their lives chasing, and in this bill, we \nare going to give that away to those who worked 150 hours over a 2-year \nperiod in agriculture. I don't think that is right, and I don't think \nit is reflective of the values that most Americans hold.\n  Another key provision of this amendment, therefore, changes the past \nwork requirement necessary for an illegal agricultural worker to obtain \na blue card from 863 hours, or 150 days, over a 2-year period, \nwhichever is less, to 150 work days per year over a 2-year period.\n  Some might say this is an impossible requirement to meet, but \naccording to the National Agriculture Workers Survey published in March \n2005, only 8 percent of agricultural workers had worked on U.S. farms \nfor less than 2 years. Even if that were not the case, let's think \nabout what the bill proposes to do.\n  The bill proposes to confer permanent resident status on folks who do \nnot work more than 150 days per year. According to my calculations, \nthat is about 7 months per year. That leaves these agricultural workers \nunemployed for 5 months out of the year, and it seems to make more \nsense to me to make folks who work less than 150 days per year \ntemporary workers rather than legal permanent residents.\n  How are they going to support themselves working less than 8 hours \nper day and for less than 150 days per year? We already know that \nemployers of blue card workers do not have to pay more than minimum \nwage, and we also know that they don't qualify for public assistance \nfor the first 5 years they are here. So what are they to do? This is a \ncrisis waiting to happen. We have a temporary agricultural worker \nprogram that can and should be used by these employers who have jobs \nthat last less than 150 days per year.\n  While this amendment only changes three main things to try to provide \nparity between the agricultural adjustment program and other adjustment \nprograms within the bill, there are a number of other differences that \nmake the agriculture amnesty program much more attractive to illegal \nimmigrants. Let me run through some of the major discrepancies between \nwhat is required of illegal agricultural workers compared to what is \nrequired of the general population of illegal workers in order to \nadjust status under the base bill.\n  For those here illegally for 5 years or more who receive green cards, \nthey must have worked at least 3 years during the 5-year period ending \nApril 5, 2006, and must work for 6 years after the date of enactment of \nthis bill. In contrast, agricultural workers only must have worked 150 \nhours over a 2-year period and going forward only have to work 575 \nhours per year.\n  In addition to learning English, nonagricultural illegal aliens must \ndemonstrate a knowledge of history and Government in the United States \nin order to adjust to that status. In contrast, agricultural workers \nunder the bill do not have to learn English, nor do they need to have a \nknowledge of the history and Government of the United States. For \nnonagricultural workers, there is a requirement that illegal aliens \nregister with the Selective Service if within the age period required, \nbut agricultural workers do not have to do this.\n  Nonagricultural illegal aliens cannot adjust status until the earlier \nof either, one, the consideration of all green card applications filed \nbefore the date of enactment of this bill or, two, 8 years after the \ndate of enactment of this bill.\n  In the AgJOBS portion of this bill, illegal aliens can get a green \ncard in as short as 3 years without having to go to the back of the \nline.\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\n  Nonagricultural illegal aliens and their spouses and children must \nsubmit fingerprints to relevant Federal agencies to be checked against \nexisting databases relating to information for criminal, national \nsecurity, or other law enforcement actions that would render the alien \nineligible for adjustment of status. This is not the case for \nagricultural workers.\n  Illegal agricultural workers must submit proof of their prior work to \nqualify for a blue card, and the Department of Homeland Security is \naffirmatively barred from sharing that information with anyone unless a \nlaw enforcement entity asks for it in writing to use in connection with \na criminal investigation or prosecution or an official coroner asks for \nit in order to identify a deceased person.\n  And lastly, before a nonagricultural illegal alien is granted \nemployment authorization or permission to travel, the alien must \nundergo a name check against exiting databases for information relating \nto criminal, national security, or other law enforcement actions. Not \nso for agricultural workers. In the AgJOBS portion of the bill, an \nalien is given employment authorization in the same manner as if that \nalien is a green cardholder and can travel freely without such a \nbackground check around our country.\n  For those nonagricultural workers here illegally between 2 and 5 \nyears, they must have been employed in the U.S. before January 7, 2004, \nand not unemployed for longer than 60 days. In contrast, an \nagricultural worker only has to have been employed for 150 hours.\n\n  To qualify, the alien must complete an application that requires \nanswering questions concerning his physical and mental health, criminal \nhistory, gang membership, renunciation of gang affiliation, immigration \nhistory, involvement with groups or individuals who engage in \nterrorism, genocide, persecution, or to seek to overthrow the \nGovernment of the United States, voter registration history, claims to \nU.S. citizenship, and tax history. No such requirement is levied on \nagricultural workers under the AgJOBS title.\n  Illegal aliens who fall under the category of deferred mandatory \ndeparture status must be personally interviewed by the Department of \nHomeland Security. There is no similar requirement for agricultural \nworkers under the AgJOBS title. The alien cannot obtain the deferred \nmandatory status until he submits biometric data to the Department of \nHomeland Security and all appropriate background checks are completed \nto the satisfaction of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on, but there is a clear \ndifferential in how illegal agricultural workers are treated in the \nAgJOBS title and how illegal workers are treated under the base bill. \nWe should treat them all the same if we are going to give to them the \npathway to one of the greatest treasures in the history of this world, \nand that is American citizenship.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time would Senator Craig like?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first, how much time remains for the \nproponents of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute and 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask that I be yielded up to 10 minutes of the 20 \nminutes, and I be notified when my 10 minutes is expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I once again stand in opposition to a \nChambliss amendment, and I do so not with any great pride--frankly, \nwith disappointment--because I went to the Senator to see if we could \nwork out a few differences. But it was obvious that the Senator was \nintent on doing one thing, and that was to destroy the transitional \ntool that creates stability in the American agricultural workforce that \nis within this bill. That tool is right here. That tool is called the \nblue card.\n  We attempt to recognize those in this country who are illegal, who \nare working in American agriculture, who have been here for 3 years and \nsay: Come forward, and we will allow you then to work in a temporary \nstatus with a blue card--no, I am sorry, you do have to take a \nbackground check, and if you are a felon, you are out, and if you have \nthree misdemeanors, you are out, and, oh, by the way, now that we just \npassed Byrd-Gregg, you have to now pay a fine to enter to get the blue \ncard, not of $100, but $600. It is important we do the math on this \nbill and we get it right.\n  Once you have qualified for the 150 hours to get a permanent work \nstatus, then you pay another fine, not $400, but $900. That is what the \nnew math is as a result of the votes of just a few moments ago.\n  So I am not so sure we are making it easy on anyone who toils in the \nhot sun of America's agricultural fields, who create the stability in \nthe American agricultural workforce today. I don't think we are making \nit easy on anybody. But let's talk about the key to it, and I think the \nSenator from Georgia said it was the key, and that is the number of \nhours in the field.\n  When this negotiated package was put together, we used the Fair Labor \nStandards Act definition which said 1 hour of work in agriculture \ncreates the day. But we also knew the facts and the reality. Nobody \nhires any one worker for 1 hour and then they walk off the field. You \njust don't do that.\n  The Senator just admitted that the average time in the field was 40 \nhours a week. Those are the facts, those are the realities of the \nAmerican agricultural workforce. He requires in his amendment 8 hours a \nday, but here is what he didn't tell you. If you worked 7\\1/2\\ hours a \nday, it doesn't count. It is not an aggregate, it is an 8-hour work \nday.\n  What about the tomato harvesters in California? They average 6.3 \nhours per work day, but it doesn't count. It is not an aggregate. It is \n8 hours under the Chambliss amendment.\n  What about Lake County in California? They work 5 to 7 hours per day \nfor orange pickers, not 8. Those are national statistical facts.\n  What about the Oregon strawberry pickers? They work 7.3 hours per \nday, not 8. So they could labor in the field 4, 5, 6, 7\\1/2\\ hours a \nday, and as I read the Chambliss amendment, it doesn't count. They have \nto work 8 hours a day to begin to develop the standard established in \nthis bill, and that is fundamentally wrong.\n  What about the peach harvesters in the State of Georgia? Those are H-\n2A qualified farmers. They, by their own admission--and I have their \npaperwork--do not work their pickers 7 hours a day.\n  I think we are being phenomenally fair, but it is important that we \ndon't make this an easy test. These people did enter our country \nillegally, but they have been here, they have been working hard, they \nare the backbone of American agriculture, and we are saying: If you \ncome forward and you are honest and you haven't broken the law and you \npay a fine going in, you can begin to work, and over a period of 2 to 3 \nyears, 150 hours, you can get permanent work status. Then you can work, \nyou can go home, but you can work in other jobs, too, during the off \nseason of agriculture, if you want. That is the reward of what we are \noffering. It is fundamentally important that we get this right.\n  I would like to agree with the Senator from Georgia on his English \nlanguage requirement. The English language requirement that is in the \nbill that we just adopted, that was offered as an amendment and a \nqualifier for the bill, is not as tough as the provision the Senator \nfrom Georgia puts in his amendment.\n  I must say that when I read these facts that are in the amendment, I \nhave to make the determination that this amendment is not to modify the \nbill; this amendment is to destroy the transitional tool that creates \nthe stability in American agriculture. We know that nearly 70 percent \nof American agriculture is premised on an illegal employment base. \nAmerican agriculture knows it, and they want to fix it. They want to \nget it right.\n\n  The Senator from Georgia and I know that H-2A doesn't work. It \nidentifies 40,000-plus; we have over a million in the workforce. We are \nnot going to take them all, and we shouldn't, because we are saying \nthose who have been here for 3 years and can prove it and meet all of \nthese tests and continue to work in the fields are going to\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\nearn the right to stay and work, and that is the stabilizing factor in \nAmerican agriculture.\n  Already, instability is showing up in the workforce of agriculture. \nWhy? Because the borders are tightening, as they should be, and it is \ncritically important that we assure and create the transitional tool. \nSo the Senator comes with key plans, key ideas, key amendments. I \nagreed with his fines, but now we have fines already built in the bill \nthat are equal to his because of the Byrd-Gregg amendment. So that \nshouldn't be a factor of determination anymore.\n  I dramatically believe the workday is misrepresented. Let me tell you \nwhy. I have an interesting work form here from the Tifton Peach Farmers \nof Springfield, SC. They by their own admission don't work 8 hours a \nday; they work 7. No qualification for the hard-working person in the \nfield picking the peaches. That is just fundamentally unfair. Are they \nillegal? Yes. Did they break the law? Yes. We know that. Yes. Are we \nforgiving? Well, we fined them. We make them continue to work to \nqualify, and anybody who has been out there in that farm field knows it \nis awfully hard work and it is hot and it is dirty. I grew up bucking \nbails of hay in a farm field. I know a bit of what it is like. And if \nwe are going to require 150 days of work to get through this status \ninto a permanent work status and have the ability to come and go as a \nlegal worker, then we ought to have a well-defined program. Transition \nis what is important. Cut it off now and create instability.\n  In the Imperial Valley of California and in Yuma, AZ, we harvest \nnearly 10,000 crates of green vegetables a day. This past year, we did \n2,800 a day. Why? No workers. At some point, if we don't get this \nright, we will tip American agriculture on its head, and then who pays \nthe price? Who pays the price? The consumer ultimately pays the price, \nand the green vegetable industry goes south of the border where the \nworkers are available.\n  That is why, when we sat down to look at American agriculture 5 years \nago, we knew we had to have a transitional tool. We knew we had to \nassure the stability of the existing workforce while we secured the \nborder and while we made sure we got the hard-working illegal ones who \nhadn't broken laws right, and those who had broken laws, they leave the \ncountry. If you came in yesterday or if you came in last June or if you \ncame in the year before, you don't qualify for this. You had to have \nbeen here several years already--3 years. You have to prove that. You \nhave to go through a background check. All of that is part of what we \ndo.\n  Is it different from the other H-plus programs? Yes, it is, a little \nbit, because agriculture is different. It is the threshold work that \nthe Senator from Georgia talks about. It is where the foreign immigrant \nenters the country to work. They gain their experience there, \noftentimes before they move on or if they were to qualify for other \nprograms that are within this bill.\n  My effort is to secure and to stabilize. It is not to throw out the \nblue card. It is my opinion that the Chambliss amendment guts the \nagricultural provision by destroying the transitional tool we call the \nblue card, and I believe that is fundamentally important to creating \nstability to America's agricultural workforce.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are very near the end of the debate on \nthe Chambliss amendment. The Senator from Colorado is going to speak, \nand then we will be prepared to move to the amendment by Senator \nDorgan. I believe he is on his way, and I urge him to arrive at the \nearliest moment. It is 7:35 now, and we have a series of stacked votes. \nWe are trying to work out the amendment by Senator Boxer. But we are \ngoing to conclude this debate fairly soon, and I will repeat, we want \nto get started with Senator Dorgan's opening arguments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Idaho in \nopposition to the Chambliss amendment, with all due respect to my \ncolleague and friend from Alabama.\n  Over the last several weeks, I have heard many times from the \nagricultural community in Colorado. The agricultural community in \nColorado is strongly in support of the AgJOBS Program. It is only in \nthe last 2 or 3 weeks that I met with the dairy farmers of Colorado. We \nhave 156 dairy farms in my State. They told me that AgJOBS and its \npassage was so important to them that without having AgJOBS, our dairy \nindustry in Colorado would basically go down the tubes. From their \npoint of view, in their way of articulating the need for this \nworkforce, what they said is the very revitalization of great parts of \nrural Colorado was very dependent on the passage of AgJOBS. That is why \nI have been a cosponsor of AgJOBS with my friend from Idaho, because it \nis the kind of legislation we need to create stability within the \nagricultural workforce of America. It is not only the dairy farmers, it \nis also the meat growers, it is the nursery association, and it is all \nof those agricultural jobs which are so dependent on making sure they \nhave the kind of workforce to keep agriculture as a viable industry \nwithin our communities.\n  The Chambliss amendment is one that also makes it very expensive for \npeople to enter into the program. According to the amendment, it would \nraise the fine for obtaining a blue card from $100 to $1,000. I think \nabout the fact that these farmworkers are not paid $20 an hour, $100 an \nhour, $300 an hour. They don't make the kind of money other people in \nAmerica make. A farmworker is lucky if he can make $10,000 to $12,000 a \nyear. And with that kind of a wage, we are asking farmworkers to pay \n$1,000 in order to enter into this program if this amendment gets \nadopted.\n  The amendment as well doubles the amount of previous agricultural \nworkdays a farmworker has to be employed. In the reality of agriculture \nand how it works, it is a seasonal kind of labor need where you have \npotato farmers who require people to come and work sometimes for 2 or 3 \nweeks at a time. That expectation would essentially exclude a vast \nswath of farmworkers who otherwise would be coming in through the \nfunnel of the AgJOBS Program.\n  At the end of the day, what the proposed amendment does is it takes \naway the opportunity we have to create stability within the AgJOBS \nProgram. I would ask my colleagues to join us in making sure we have \nstability for American agriculture and hiring labor. I ask my \ncolleagues to join us as well in standing up for those farmworkers who \nare out there toiling in the fields. I don't think there is a State \nthat any of us cannot drive through and where we haven't walked or \ndriven through those fields and seen the people who are out there \ntoiling in the hot Sun, in the hot summer, July and August Sun, as many \nof us in this room may have done in the past.\n\n  The reality is we need to create a program that will, in fact, work \nwith the agricultural workers of America, as well as for the \nagricultural industry of America. That is why I am asking my colleagues \nto join us in opposition to amendment 4084.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time is left on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 5 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, unless the Senator from Idaho wants more \ntime, we are prepared to yield back.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I have 1 minute 20 seconds; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, if the Senator now plans to close, I don't \nbelieve we have anything else to say on this issue, and I yield back \nthe remainder for his closing statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 1 \nminute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I heard the response to the \npresentation made relative to my amendment. It is interesting to note \nthat a couple of things were not responded to.\n  First of all, as I said earlier, this amendment is pretty basic. It \nrequires everybody involved in agriculture who gets on a pathway to \ncitizenship to learn English. Apparently there is no disagreement with \nthat, and this bill does not, in the present way it is written, require \nthat. Apparently there is no disagreement to that.\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act does say that 1 hour constitutes a \nworkday. But the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to labor laws in the \nUnited States. It has nothing to do with the most cherished prize in \nthe world, and that is the citizenship of the United States of America.\n  Senator Craig is my friend, and I appreciate his hard work for the \nlast 5 years or whatever it has been. I had my first vote on modifying \nH-2A in the House of Representatives 11 years ago. That is how long I \nhave been working on this issue. When he says H-2A does not work, he is \nwrong. H-2A does work. But what this base bill does is it encourages \nfarmers--and I emphasize this--it encourages farmers to hire illegal \nworkers, and they are going to do that unless we give them the \nincentive to hire legal workers. The H-2A program will work if we \ncontinue to modify it and make it better, streamline it, and allow our \nfarmers to have a quality pool of workers under H-2A.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues support the amendment. Let's \nmake this base bill better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, \nis recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4095\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4095 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4095.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To sunset the H-2C visa program after the date that is 5 \n             years after the date of enactment of this Act)\n\n       On page 250, strike lines 5 through 10, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(a) Authority.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security may grant a temporary visa to an H-2C \n     nonimmigrant who demonstrates an intent to perform labor or \n     services in the United States (other than the labor or \n     services described in clause (i)(b) or (ii)(a) of section \n     101(a)(15)(H) or subparagraph (L), (O), (P), or (R) of \n     section 101(a)(15)).\n       ``(2) Sunset.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     after the date that is 5 years after the date of the \n     enactment of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of \n     2006, no alien may be issued a new visa as an H-2C \n     nonimmigrant for an initial period of authorized admission \n     under subsection (f)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     may continue to issue an extension of a temporary visa issued \n     to an H-2C nonimmigrant pursuant to such subsection after \n     such date.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 15 minutes and a Senator in opposition \nwill be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. The \nlegislation that has come to the floor of the Senate dealing with \nimmigration is legislation that not only describes how we might deal \nwith 11 million to 12 million people who are here illegally in this \ncountry, it also says in addition that we need to bring more people \ninto the country who now live outside of our country.\n  I have on other occasions come to the floor of the Senate and said \nthat I don't think it makes a great deal of sense to have what is \ncalled a guest worker program which brings additional millions of \npeople into the country who now live outside of America. Why don't I \nthink that is a good thing to do? Because I think the American workers \nare under a great deal of stress. They see in this country that there \nare substantial numbers of jobs being outsourced to China, outsourced \nto Indonesia, Bangladesh, and other countries. And as jobs are being \noutsourced in search of cheaper labor and American workers are having \ntrouble hanging on to their jobs or finding jobs or continuing to keep \ntheir jobs, even as that is the case, we now see a desire to import \njobs--cheap labor--through the back door. That is what this guest \nworker program is.\n  This guest worker program, by the way, is a program which purchases \nthe support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Export good American jobs \noverseas; import cheap labor through the back door. That is what this \nis all about.\n  I offered an amendment to strip the guest worker program out. I lost. \nI understand that. I didn't prevail. Many Senators here voted in a way \nthat says we need more people to come into this country who normally \nwould be illegal, but we will simply describe them as legal under a \nguest worker program. Well, when we had the vote on my amendment to \nstrip the guest worker program, the Washington Post the next day \nobserved that many of my colleagues many of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle came to the floor intending to vote for my amendment \nbut then switched their vote out of deference to the President who just \nthe evening before had expressed support for a guest worker program.\n  I understand the Senate has made a decision about this, but I suggest \nwith this amendment that at least with the guest worker program, the \nguest worker proposal, that we have a sunset after 5 years. The sunset \nprovision which I offer with this amendment would give Congress a \nchance to examine the impact of the so-called guest workers--or low-\nwage replacement workers, as I would call them--what impact they will \nhave on U.S. jobs and wages. It ought not be in debate.\n  I quoted a Harvard professor who did a study that shows the impact of \nthese illegal immigrants, or in this case legal, low wage immigrants \nwho now live outside of our country whom this bill will allow to come \ninto our country.\n  We now know the impact it will have on American workers. It drives \ndown American wages. It makes it more difficult for American workers. \nWe know that is the case.\n  Title IV of the bill, which is the guest worker title, calls on the \nCensus Bureau to prepare a study of the impact of guest workers on U.S. \njobs and wages. I suggest that not just gather dust. I suggest a study \nbe done and Congress take a good look at the impact and, at the 5-year \nmark, there will have been 1 million guest workers coming into our \ncountry. I suggest the underlying bill be changed at this 5-year point \nto sunset the guest worker provision so Congress can take a look at it \nand see what this has done to American workers.\n  I heard all of this discussion in this Chamber now for 2 weeks about \nimmigration: immigration, immigrants, illegal immigrants, legal \nimmigrants--all about immigration. Where is the discussion about the \nAmerican worker?\n  Alan Blinder, former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, a \nmainstream economist, says this. He says here is what the American \nworker faces. He says there are between 42 million and 56 million \nAmerican jobs that are subject to outsourcing by America's \ncorporations; 42 million to 56 million American jobs potentially could \nbe sent to China or Indonesia or elsewhere in search of cheaper wages. \nHe says, in his article in Foreign Affairs, not all of those jobs will \nbe outsourced. He understands that. But all of the workers in jobs in \nthat category that are subject to outsourcing are going to be competing \nagainst people who live elsewhere, who will accept much, much lower \nwages, and therefore it puts downward pressure on wages. That is a \nfact.\n  Let me describe some of the things that we have decided to sunset so \nwe can take a new look at it. After 5 years, if we sunset the guest \nworker program to evaluate what impact it has had on American workers, \nwe would be sunsetting it as we have done with provisions in the farm \nbill, the energy bill, the PATRIOT Act, the bankruptcy reform bill, the \nintelligence reform bill, the Trade Promotion Authority Act. Sunset it \nand take a look in 4 years, 5 years, 6 years; take a new look.\n  I propose with this amendment we sunset the so-called guest worker \nprovision. Let me say again I understand those who have put this \nlegislation together say this legislation has to hang together. If you \ncome to the floor of the Senate and you pull a loose thread, it is like \na cheap suit: If you pull a loose thread, the arm falls off and the \nwhole thing collapses. That is always the work of the people who bring \nsomething to the floor: It can't be changed.\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\nIf it is changed, it destroys the compromise. Shame on those who want \nto change it.\n  I am pulling a loose thread here and the arm is not going to fall \nout. I am saying maybe just once we would have somebody on the floor of \nthe Senate talking about the plight of the American worker. Who are \nthey competing against? What is happening to their wages? I will tell \nyou what is happening. On average, wages decreased $1,700 a year \nbecause of back-door immigration, cheap labor through the back door \nwhile they export good jobs through the front door. Send the jobs to \nChina and bring in cheap labor through the back door--that is what the \nconstruct is. That is what is happening and there is no discussion \nabout what is happening to the American worker.\n  I understand we have an immigration problem. My feeling is you ought \nto address it, the first step, with securing America's borders. When \nyou have done that, the second step then is to thoughtfully understand \nwhat you need to do with all of those who are here illegally. But there \nought not be a third step. If 11 or 12 million people who have come \nhere illegally, if this Congress decides they are legal, why is it we \nneed 400,000 or 200,000 of the people who live outside of our country, \nwho are not here, to come as guest workers, above the H-2A, H-2B, and \nall the other legal mechanisms by which people can come to this \ncountry?\n  My understanding is the numbers last year show this: 1.1 million \npeople tried to come into this country and were stopped, prevented, \nmost on the southern border; 1.1 million people were stopped at the \nsouthern border and turned back. Close to three-quarters of a million, \nin most cases through the southern border, got to this country \nillegally and became a part of the 11 or 12 million people here \nillegally. And 175,000 people came to the southern border and came into \nthis country legally because there are many ways in which to do that.\n  That is the process by which we deal with the immigration issue. We \nhave a lot of people who want to come in. We stop some, don't stop \nmany, and now the proposition is we should tighten up the border, we \nshould allow guest workers, and we should provide legal status for 11 \nor 12 million who are here.\n  I believe we ought to tighten the border, but we ought to do it in a \nway that makes sense, in a way that really is something that will work. \nI was here in 1986. All of the discussion we hear now we heard in 1986. \nNone of it worked. I also believe we ought to deal sensibly with the 11 \nor 12 million people who are already here.\n  I don't support those who say round them up and throw them out. It is \nnot something we should do or can do. We can't do that, frankly. But I \ndon't understand for a minute why we decide that it is not enough; we \nshould also suggest there are others who do not yet live in this \ncountry, don't come to this country, who have not been here, who live \nelsewhere, who should be invited in as guest workers.\n  It seems to me the underlying proposition of this bill is to make \nguest workers out of 11 or 12 million people. We need more? At a time \nwhen the American worker is under such siege by competition from \ncompanies that decide they want to access 33-cent-an-hour labor in \nChina and take American jobs and shift them to China and then, by the \nway, the jobs they don't ship overseas they want to replace with \nlow wage workers coming through the back door?\n\n  Just once I would like to hear some discussion about the plight of \nthe American worker.\n  I understand immigration is an important issue. I don't denigrate \nthose who come to the floor who have spent a great deal of time \nresponding to it. My colleague from Arizona is on the floor. He likely \nwill speak against my amendment. I am great friends with him. I have \ngreat respect for him. We just have a disagreement on this, as I do \nwith my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  All I ask is this. We have a very serious problem with jobs in this \ncountry, jobs for American workers, people at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder who are struggling, trying to figure out, How do I make \nenough money to provide for my family? How do I make a salary that is \nworthy? How do I provide for my family's health care when they are \nstripping health care benefits? How do I have a pension when they are \nstripping pension benefits away? How do I keep my job when they are \nsending my job to China and Indonesia and Bangladesh? How do I do that? \nAt the same time this Senate is talking about issues other than the \nplight of the American worker. I just wish we could have a mix and a \nbalance of discussions about both.\n  Yes, immigration is important. Yes, we ought to be sensitive in how \nwe deal with it and thoughtful in how we deal with it. But we also \nought to understand our first obligation, our first opportunity here in \nthis Chamber is to speak up and stand up for the plight and the \ninterests of the American workers who are having a pretty tough time.\n  This amendment is very simple. I suggest that we sunset this \nguestworker program after 5 years. A million guest workers will have \nbeen allowed in after 5 years. All of us know it will be far more than \na million, but a million under the 200,000 a year will have been \nallowed in after 5 years. Let's stop, let's take stock, let's evaluate \nand understand what the consequences are of this for the American \nworkers. Let's do that.\n  If we do it for the farm bill, the energy bill, the PATRIOT Act, the \nbankruptcy bill, the intelligence bill, the trade promotion bill, why \nwould we not do it here? Stop and take stock on behalf of American \nworkers and evaluate what has all of this meant? What has been the \nconsequence for American families at the bottom of the economic ladder, \nstruggling to make a living?\n  I hope my colleagues will support sunsetting this legislation, the \nguest worker provision of this legislation, at the end of 5 years so \nthe Senate can take a new look and evaluate what the consequences have \nbeen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota is not the \nonly champion of the American worker. When he asks why there isn't some \nconcern for the American worker, there is plenty of concern for the \nAmerican worker. This Senator, and I know many other Senators in this \nbody, have been very much concerned about imports, about currency \nmanipulation, about manufacturing job losses. We have spoken out and we \nhave acted on those matters. So when the Senator from North Dakota \nwants to sunset the guest worker provisions, that is fine; but when he \nasks, ``Who is concerned about the American worker,'' we are all \nconcerned about the American worker. But we have a great many problems \nwe have to accommodate and work on at the same time.\n  This effort to sunset the guest worker program is just a rehash of \nhis effort to eliminate the guest worker program. We went into great \ndetail on that--extensive debate. And the evidence was laid out from \nthe Judiciary Committee hearings that there is a minimal impact upon \nthe American worker by the immigrants. It is not true that all of the \njobs taken by immigrants would not be handled by American workers, but \nthe impact in terms of lost American jobs is minimal.\n  On the issue of the impact on salaries, again the economists \ntestified in the Judiciary Committee hearings that that impact was \nminimal. We went into all of that in debate on the earlier amendment, \nwhen the Senator sought to eliminate the guest worker program.\n  This bill is very carefully calibrated to have a guest worker program \nthat responds to the needs of the U.S. economy, while exhibiting ample \nconcern for the U.S. workers. I don't believe we need to debate this at \nany great length because we have already debated the subject on the \namendment by the Senator from North Dakota, trying to eliminate the \nentire guest worker program.\n  Let me yield at this time to the Senator from Arizona for 5 minutes, \nif that is sufficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first I would like to say I appreciate \nvery much my friend from North Dakota, with whom I have had the great \nprivilege and pleasure of working with on many issues. He is an \narticulate and impassioned advocate of the American worker, and his \nview of what is best for\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\nthe American worker I not only agree with, I respect.\n  But let's have no doubt about what this amendment is really all \nabout. This amendment, if we would sunset the temporary worker program, \nwhich is going to take a long period of time to get set up and \nfunctioning, obviously would be a killer for the legislation. If we \ntell people that after 5 years what is designed to be an ongoing and \ncontinuing program is going to be sunsetted, and the other parts of the \nlegislation obviously are not, we all know what the effect is.\n  I want to just make an additional comment about 1986. My colleagues \nkeep coming back and coming back to the failure of 1986. I am the first \nto admit that 1986 was a failure. But why did it fail? That was because \nthere was no enforcement on employers that hired people illegally. An \nintegral and vital part of this legislation--which we now have the \ntechnology in order to construct--is for these tamperproof documents, \nbiometric documents, and no employer can hire anyone else unless they \nhave that. That way it is easy when you go to find out whether the \nemployer is employing someone legally or illegally.\n  When the word gets out south of the border or north of the border \nthat you can't come here and work unless you have that one required \ndocument, then those illegals are going to stop coming illegally.\n  I think it is important to recognize that the difference between 1986 \nand this bill is, No. 1, there is an enforceable guest worker program \non both employers as well as employees, and there is a hard path to \ncitizenship. Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle who are \nadvocates for these people say this is way too harsh. I understand that \nit is harsh and it is difficult, and there will be many who fall by the \nwayside for a variety of reasons.\n  I worry that we have raised this payment so high now that we may be \ndisqualifying people and their families under that system. We have \nraised it from $2,000 I think, now, to over $3,500.\n  It is long and it is hard and it is a tough road. It is because they \nbroke our laws, even if it is for the best of motives. An integral part \nof it is a guest worker program which has to last as long as we are \nwilling to accept the premise of the temporary worker program. If we \nare not, then let's take it out of the bill. But to say after 5 years \nthat it is going to sunset obviously is a totally unrealistic approach.\n  I know my time is about to expire, but, again, I appreciate the \npassionate and articulate comments and statement which I think present \na cogent point of view on the part of my friend from North Dakota. I \njust happen to fundamentally believe that a temporary worker program is \na vital part of this comprehensive approach to immigration reform. \nBeing without it--after 2 years, 5 years, or 10 years--would obviously \ndestroy the whole concept behind this carefully crafted compromise.\n  I believe my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I inquire about the amount of time \nremaining on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 8 minutes 30 seconds, the \nSenator from North Dakota has 2 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have a great deal of respect for my colleague from North Dakota. I \nunderstand his heartfelt concerns as he comes to the floor to argue on \nbehalf of American workers. But I have to reluctantly oppose his \namendment which would sunset the temporary worker program.\n  While his amendment is well-intentioned, the amendment would \nundermine the carefully crafted compromise that has been struck in the \nunderlying bill. We know that one of the fundamental causes of \nundocumented immigration is that too few visas exist to meet employers' \ndemands for short-term immigrant labor.\n  The basic logic of this bill is to fix our broken immigration system. \nEarned legalization for those already here is an important part of the \nsolution. But on its own, legalization will not solve the problem of \nfuture flow. What we need here is a solution that is comprehensive and \nlong-lasting.\n  When you put the kind of sunset which is being proposed by my friend \nfrom North Dakota on this, it will only have a temporary solution in \nplace.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have had probably 3 years of hearings \nin the development of this legislation. As a result of the hearings, we \nfound that pressure exist on the border. We also found out in the \ncourse of these hearings that there is a great deal that can be done to \nmake the border secure. But if you think you are going to close the \nborder completely and eliminate the magnet of United States employment, \nthat is failing to understand the immigration issue in terms of the \nborder and what is happening here in the United States and what is \nhappening in Mexico and in Central America.\n  One of the most important aspects of this legislation is trying to \nget the cooperation of Mexico and the countries in Central America. One \nof the most important initiatives will subsequently be to try to help \nMexico develop so that people want to stay in Mexico and develop and \nsee their own country develop. But as long as we are going to have the \neconomic magnet here, there is going to be the draw. We can extend the \nfence 500 miles, 700 miles, 1,000 miles, 1,500 miles, but the idea that \nwe are going to close this border and put tens of thousands of border \nguards down there and not have the pressure to come in here doesn't \nrecognize what the problem is. This legislation attempts to understand \nthe problem.\n  What we try to do is say, Look, we have the magnet of the United \nStates, we have the vacancy in terms of American jobs, we have the \npressure of these people--young people, old people, women, whomever it \nis--in Mexico, Central America, and Asia who want to come here.\n  What we are saying is, come through in the orderly process and \nprocedure. Get your card and you will be able to come to the United \nStates with that card when there is a job not being filled by an \nAmerican worker. And you are going to have worker protection. So you \nare not going to decrease wages on American workers, and you will be \ntreated fairly and with dignity.\n  If we think we are going to terminate that and that is going to stop \nour problem, that fails to understand what the realistic situation is \non the border and the pressure that is there in these countries.\n  I hope that the amendment, with all respect to my friend from North \nDakota, is rejected.\n  As has been pointed out, this compromise is a compromise of legality \nand a recognition of the pressures that exist on that border.\n  We believe, if we establish an orderly process and procedure for \npeople to come here with the tamperproof card, and if we have effective \nimplementation and enforcement against employers, that is the best way \nto assure that we are going to have fairness, both in treatment for \nthese workers and also for American workers.\n  I stand with those who feel that this is not the right amendment. \nThis isn't the right time. This whole construct of the immigration \nlegislation isn't a 2-year, isn't a 3-year, isn't a 4-year, isn't a 5-\nyear--we are trying to establish something that will serve this country \nand also serve the countries of Mexico and Central America in the \nfuture. That is the construct.\n  To try to say we are going to terminate an aspect of this after a few \nyears really is a deathblow to the construct of this legislation. I \nhope that it will not be accepted.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 2 minutes 57 \nseconds. The opposition has 2 minutes 58 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, obviously the opposition has more time. If \nthey are prepared to yield, I will just make some observations for a \ncouple of minutes.\n  Let me say that I always find it difficult to disagree with my \nfriend. And I sort of have the code here in the Senate over the years. \nIf they say you are\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\nrespected, that means they think they are going to beat you by 5 votes. \nIf they say you are articulate, they think they are going to beat you \nby 10 votes. If they say you are passionate, they think they are going \nto clobber you by 20 votes.\n  I understand the language here a little bit.\n  Let me say this: What if this were a proposal for guest Senators. \nThere wouldn't be one vote for it, would there? But there are no guest \nSenators. No one here is going to have their job threatened by all of \nthis. This is about guest workers.\n  My colleague says we can't shut down the border, that there is going \nto be illegal immigration. Let us be real about this. So the \nproposition of being real is, let us label those who are going to be \nillegal ``legal.'' That is the way to deal with this. If we can't shut \ndown the border, they are going to come across anyway, so let us call \nthem ``legal.'' They won't have to call them ``illegal.'' I don't \nunderstand that at all.\n  There are 11 million to 12 million people who are here illegally who \nthis bill is going to say we will give a legal approach to, or an \napproach to establish legality, and that is not enough. That is not \nenough. We want to bring more through the book door? I don't think so.\n  I am not the only one who cares about American workers. I tell you, \nvery few are talking about the impact on American workers. That ought \nnot be some theory. We understand the impact on American workers, those \nwho are struggling to make ends meet, to get a decent salary, to have \nhealth care, to have retirement programs and care for their kids. They \nare wondering about their jobs. The good jobs are being shipped out the \nfront door and the other jobs are being replaced through the back door.\n  I ask the question: What is happening to the American worker? Take a \ngood look. I ask all my colleagues to take a good look at what is \nhappening to the American worker today in this country.\n  Alan Binder, a former Vice Chair of the Fed, a mainstream economist, \nsaid there are 42 million to 56 million American jobs subject to \noutsourcing. Not all will go, but all of them are eligible to go and \nwill be competing against people who work elsewhere for 33 cents an \nhour.\n  That is a fact. That is not being discussed in this discussion about \nimmigration.\n  What is the impact on the American worker? And what excuse do we have \nfor adding an additional 11 million to 12 million people and making \nthem legal by this to say we need more, those who live outside this \ncountry called guest workers, to come in?\n  One excuse we are told is we can't keep them out anyway, so let us \ncall them ``legal.'' I don't think that is the way to deal with this. I \ndon't support that.\n  This is baby step in the right direction, not a big step. At least \nwith this guest worker program, let's sunset it after 5 years, take a \nlook at what it means to the American worker, what it means to this \ncountry, what it means to wages and jobs for the American worker. Let's \ndo that after 5 years. This is a baby step. Let's vote for this baby \nstep in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time remains, 2 minutes 58 \nseconds?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might inquire, I thought you were \nintending to yield back the time. That was the proposition under which \nI decided to speak. I said that if the other side was prepared to yield \nback the time, then I will use my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I don't believe anybody said we are ready to yield back \ntime.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, normally the Member who offered the \namendment would close. That was my assumption, to close the debate on \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator from North Dakota like 2 more minutes \nto close?\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator wishes to speak, proceed. My understanding \nwas we were going to yield back the time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would you like 2 more minutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes. That will be \nthe fastest way to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 2 minutes 42 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, what I have to say is not worth arguing \nabout, but I appreciate the opportunity to say it.\n  My good friend from North Dakota and I have worked together on \nprotecting the American workforce from unfair pressure. The American \nworkforce is under assault from unfair trade practices. The truth is \nthat America needs all the decent, hard-working people she can lay her \nhands on.\n\n  In my State, the tourism industry, the construction industry, and the \nagricultural industry are very dependent on the new blood of migrant \nworkers. And we have a system where people come in and can't be \ndocumented. There is no control. To sunset the temporary worker program \nwould create havoc for our economy. From South Carolina throughout this \nland, these 11 million have assimilated into our workforce. They are \ndoing a darned good job. They are important to our economy.\n  Unemployment is 4.7 percent. It will never get any lower. Wage growth \nis over 4 percent. Gross domestic product growth is at 4.5 percent, and \nthe stock market is at 11,000.\n  The truth is, we have already assimilated these workers, and they are \nadding value to our country and our economy. The demographics in this \ncountry are relevant and won't change. Japan is faced with this. They \nhave a culture that is closed to outside influences, and there are more \nolder people in Japan than younger people. We are about to get there.\n  We need new people now like we did in the 19th and 20th centuries--\ngood, honest, hard-working people--to keep our economy humming.\n  If you sunset this provision of the bill, you are bringing sunset to \na problem that is overdue to be solved. Let's not let the sun go down \non the problem of immigration any longer.\n  I know what the Senator is trying to do. I respect it, but this would \nkill this bill.\n  We should have done this many sunsets ago. We have been derelict in \nour duty to control immigration, and we are about there. We need those \nworkers.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me point out that to the 11 million to \n12 million people who have come to this country illegally, this sunset \nissue has nothing to do with those folks. They are here.\n  I have not come to the floor suggesting that we interrupt the bill \nwith respect to their plans for these folks. I have said in addition to \nthe 11 million to 12 million, the suggestion that we need to bring in \nmore who now live outside the country makes no sense to me. Even as \njobs are moving out the front door of this country--nearly 4 million of \nthem have gone in the last 5 years--you can hardly make a strong case \nthat we ought to bring jobs in the back door, and particularly low-wage \njobs.\n  I know that there are not many of us here who spend our days trying \nto figure out how you get a job at the bottom of the economic ladder, \nor how do you make ends meet on a minimum wage that hasn't been raised \nfor nearly 9 years, or how you provide for your family at the bottom of \nthe economic ladder and have health care being stripped away and no \nretirement program. Not many of us experience that. But that is what a \nlot of American workers are experiencing every single day.\n  This provision deals only with the issue of the extra guest workers \nwho do not now live here but who this bill says we should bring here \nbecause we need them to be here to do those jobs. The fact is these \njobs ought to go to people in this country who are struggling at the \nbottom of the economic ladder. We ought to be fair to those American \nworkers.\n  I am not anti-immigrant. That is not my point. We have a lot of them \nin this country, and they enrich and nourish this country. But first \nand foremost our responsibility is to stand up for the American workers \nwho are struggling.\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\nIf Members do not believe they are struggling, look at the data. Look \nat what is happening in their lives. Look at the jobs that are gone. Go \nto Shenzhen, China, and look at the American jobs that now exist there. \nThey are paid 33 cents an hour, 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day. If \nAmerican workers were asked to compete with that, they can't.\n\n  My point is very simple. Let's stand up for the American worker. \nLet's sunset this guest worker provision. Let's do the right thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4144, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to return to No. 4144, \nSenator Boxer's amendment. We had a brief debate, and it appeared we \nmight be able to work it out. I believe we have. The Senator will need \nto modify her amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent she be permitted to modify her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  Is there an objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4144), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 265, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       ``(b) Required Procedure.--Except where the Secretary of \n     Labor has determined that there is a shortage of United \n     States workers in the occupation and area of intended \n     employment for which the H-2C nonimmigrant is sought--\n       ``(1) Efforts to recruit united states workers.--During the \n     period beginning not later than 90 days prior to the date on \n     which a petition is filed under subsection (a)(1), and ending \n     on the date that is 14 days prior to the date on which the \n     petition is filed, the employer involved shall take the \n     following steps to recruit United States workers for the \n     position for which the H-2C nonimmigrant is sought under the \n     petition:\n       ``(A) Submit a copy of the job opportunity, including a \n     description of the wages and other terms and conditions of \n     employment and the minimum education, training, experience \n     and other requirements of the job, to the State Employment \n     Service Agency that serves the area of employment in the \n     State in which the employer is located.\n       ``(B) Authorize the State Employment Service Agency to post \n     the job opportunity on the Internet through the website for \n     America's Job Bank, with local job banks, and with \n     unemployment agencies and other labor referral and \n     recruitment sources pertinent to the job involved.\n       ``(C) Authorize the State Employment Service Agency to \n     notify labor organizations in the State in which the job is \n     located, and if applicable, the office of the local union \n     which represents the employees in the same or substantially \n     equivalent job classification of the job opportunity.\n       ``(D) Post the availability of the job opportunity for \n     which the employer is seeking a worker in conspicuous \n     locations at the place of employment for all employees to \n     see.\n       ``(2) Efforts to employ united states workers.--An employer \n     that seeks to employ an H-2C nonimmigrant shall--\n       ``(A) first offer the job to any eligible United States \n     worker who applies, is qualified for the job and is available \n     at the time of need, nothwithstanding any other valid \n     employment criteria.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, thank you very \nmuch. Your staff was extremely helpful.\n  Now we have with this bill more protections for American workers. We \nhave stated in this amendment very clearly that an employer is going to \nmake every effort to offer a job to an American worker before he or she \nhires a guest worker by simply doing two things: posting the available \njob, posting that information on the premises; and, second, notifying \nthe department of employment in the State in which the business is \nlocated so they can advertise the slot.\n  I thank, again, Senator Specter, Senator Kennedy, and both their \nstaffs for all their hard work.\n  I ask this amendment be agreed to by voice vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from California.\n  The amendment (No. 4144), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are very close to having a unanimous \nconsent agreement setting forth the proceedings to conclude the bill, \nbut there is still a need to review some more documents. My suggestion \nis we proceed with a vote on the Chambliss amendment. In between the \nvotes we hope to have the final unanimous consent agreement formed so \nthe Senators will be aware of what we are doing before the second vote \nstarts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4084\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. My question is, What time does the leader want to come in \nin the morning? I understand it is 9:15.\n  Mr. FRIST. We will be coming in at 9:15 in the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that means we are, most importantly, on a \nfinal glidepath. Those are the amendments which will be considered with \nthose times, and then we will be able to vote on final passage on the \nbill.\n\n\n                     Senator Warner's 10,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to pay special tribute to the senior \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. John Warner. Tonight he just cast his \n10,000th vote.\n  (Applause, Members rising.)\n  Mr. FRIST. This year, Senator Warner became the second longest \nserving U.S. Senator from Virginia in the 218-year history of the \nSenate. Since arriving in the Senate 27 years ago, he has forged a long \nand distinguished record, especially on issues concerning the Armed \nForces. He has addressed some of the most fundamental security issues \nfacing this Nation, including the revitalization of the Armed Forces \nunder President Reagan, the restructuring of the military following our \nsuccess in the Cold War, and the countering of emerging threats from \nforeign nations and terrorist groups.\n  It is my pleasure to call Senator Warner a colleague and a friend. He \nis a Senator's Senator, representing the best in this august \ninstitution. We all congratulate him on his lifetime commitment to \nserving this country with honor and distinction.\n  (Applause, Members rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, I had the \nhonor of serving on the Environment and Public Works Committee with \nJohn Warner. During part of my tenure there, he was chairman of that \ncommittee. No one is more of a gentleman than John Warner.\n  John Warner has a background that is really something all Americans \nshould understand. John Warner was born in Virginia, attended \nWashington and Lee College, Virginia Law School. At age 17, he joined \nthe Navy. That was during World War II. But that wasn't enough for him \nfor military service. He again joined the military during the Korean \nconflict, joining the Marine Corps. He thereafter became Secretary of \nthe Navy and served with distinction as Secretary of the Navy.\n  I think it is only appropriate that John Warner cast his 10,000th \nvote just a week or two after his partner and friend, Carl Levin. There \nis no better example of teamwork than we have had on the Armed Services \nCommittee with John Warner and Carl Levin. It is good that these two \nbrothers were both honored for having cast their 10,000th vote within a \nmatter of weeks of each other. It has been a pleasure to work with both \nof them.\n  (Applause, Members rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Since I got there first, I insist upon being recognized \nfirst. I will be very brief. I will only say that there is no greater \nexample of civility and decency and honor and integrity in the U.S. \nSenate than John Warner. It is a privilege and true honor to have \nserved with him. He is the most accommodating of Senators. I will sum \nit up with one thing: as long as there are John Warners in the Senate, \nthe Senate is in good hands.\n  (Applause, Members rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, as the senior Senator from Virginia always \nrefers to me as the ``junior Senator from Virginia,'' what an honor it \nis to serve with Senator John Warner. He has served our country since \nWorld War II, through Korea, in a variety of ways. He is a genuine \nAmerican hero who has just made history tonight, his 10,000th vote \ncast.\n  There have only been 25 other Senators in the 218 years of the U.S. \nSenate who have cast that many votes. I know I speak for the people of \nVirginia, as his partner, and for all of our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, we look forward to casting many more votes with this \ngenuine American hero who has devoted his life to freedom, to justice, \nand showing us the proper manners, cordiality, and also the way to get \nthings done for the American people.\n  We all salute you, Senator John Warner.\n  (Applause, Members rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the hour is late. I humbly thank the dear \nLord for the strength and wisdom He has given me, for the support and \nthe friendship of--I calculated--the 241 Senators I have served with \nduring this time, and for a family that has stood by me for these many \nyears.\n  To the people of Virginia, I express thanks. And to whoever up there \nprovides luck, I am the luckiest man you have ever met.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4095\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Dorgan amendment No. 4095. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi) and the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. \nLott).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my amendment to \nS. 2611, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006. This \namendment will clarify the process for countries to enter the visa \nwaiver program, which enables foreign nationals of member countries to \ntravel to the United States for tourism or business for 90 days or less \nwithout obtaining a visa. In doing so, the program facilitates \ninternational travel and commerce. In addition, the visa waiver program \neases the workload of consular officers who are already struggling to \nprocess a significant backlog of visa applications.\n  Since 1986, when it first began as a pilot program, the visa waiver \nprogram has been a success. Over 27 countries have become certified to \nparticipate in the program in the past 20 years, and our Nation has \nrealized substantial diplomatic and economic rewards. Relationships \nwith our allies have been\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\nstrengthened by the gesture of good will and the increase in tourism \ndue to the visa waiver program has greatly benefitted the Nation's \ntourist economy.\n  Admission into the visa waiver program has never been an easy task. \nAt this time, to qualify for the program, a country must do all of the \nfollowing: it must offer reciprocal privileges to U.S. citizens; it \nmust have had a nonimmigrant visa refusal rate of less than 3 percent \nfor the previous year; it must certify that it has established a \nprogram to issue its citizens machine-readable passports that are \ntamper-resistant and incorporate a biometric identifier into their \npassports. In addition to these requirements, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, in consultation with the Secretary of State, must also \ndetermine that the country's inclusion into the program will not \ncompromise the law enforcement objectives or security of the United \nStates.\n  As current law dictates, once all of these requirements have been \nmet, the Attorney General may then designate the country a member of \nthe visa waiver program. This means that even if a country has expended \nthe time and effort to go through this rigorous process and has met our \nGovernment's stringent standards, its application could still be denied \nor, at best, indefinitely delayed by the Attorney General.\n  This amendment addresses two issues. First, it will revise the \ncurrent law to reflect changes in the administration of the visa waiver \nprogram since 9/11 and codify those into law. While the Department of \nJustice continues to play a role in the designation of visa waiver \nprogram countries, the final certification of a visa waiver country is \nnow made by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, \nrather than the Attorney General. My amendment will ensure that the \nSecretary of DHS is specified as the final authority on this matter.\n  Second, this amendment will designate a nation a member of the visa \nwaiver program as soon as all of the requirements have been met. In \ndoing so, this amendment provides potential member countries with the \nassurance that their applications will not be held up by bureaucratic \nredtape or inefficiencies. It also advances our attempts to build \npositive relationships based on good faith with applicant countries. \nThe visa waiver program is one means by which we can recognize our \naffinity with nations who share our principles and goals for a future \nof peace, justice, and freedom. Consequently, quicker inclusion into \nthe visa waiver program once the requirements have been met is vital to \nfostering and maintaining close cultural and economic ties with \nfriendly nations.\n  In addition to helping build strong diplomatic relations between \nnations, the visa waiver program has become key to the ongoing success \nof our tourism industry and business community. By eliminating the visa \nrequirement, the program has facilitated international travel to our \nNation for both business and for pleasure. In 2004, 15.9 million \nvisitors entered the United States under the visa waiver program, \nconstituting 58 percent of all overseas visitors.\n  The program encourages foreign visitors to plan their vacations in \nthe United States, which can result in increased economic growth and \ntourism dollars for the United States. Over the years, the visa waiver \nprogram has played a vital role that has become critical to our \nNation's tourist industry. According to the Office of Travel and \nTourism Industries, all but 1 of the top 10 ten tourism-generating \ncountries to the United States are visa waiver program nations. For \nstates such as California, Florida, and my own home State of Hawaii \nwhich depend heavily on the tourist industry, the visa waiver program \nis integral to the strength of our economy. Clarifying the mechanism \nfor countries to enter the program would strengthen the program and, in \ndoing so, strengthen the economy on both a local and national level.\n  Given the considerable benefits that the visa waiver program affords \nthe United States, it is imperative that nations who are interested in \nengaging in the lengthy and complicated process to become a visa waiver \nprogram feel confident that, if they strive to meet our strict security \nstandards, they will be allowed to participate in the program. I urge \nmy colleagues in the Senate to support this amendment which will update \ncurrent legislation to more accurately reflect the post-9/11 \nadministration of the program and perhaps, more important, confirm our \ncommitment to those nations which would like to participate in the \nprogram that as soon as they have fulfilled our requirements, we will \nfulfill our promise.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Gregg amendment No. 4054 would \nundermine this tradition by significantly reducing the number of visas \nthat are available under the Diversity Visa Program. Diversity visas \nwere created in 1990 to ensure that America would always welcome \nimmigrants from all parts of the globe, in the tradition of our \nforefathers. Diversity visas are available through a lottery system to \napplicants from nations that are underrepresented in other immigration \nprograms. In order to apply, an individual must be from a country that \nhas sent less than 50,000 immigrants to the U.S. in the preceding 5 \nyears.\n  This special visa program allows immigrants from nations in Africa \nand from a number of developing nations to have a chance to apply to \nemigrate to the U.S. In 2004, diversity immigrants were just 5 percent \nall admissions of legal permanent residents, but diversity visas were \n33 percent of all legal permanent resident admissions from Africa. For \nthis reason, the Congressional Black Caucus and the NAACP oppose the \nGregg amendment. In addition to African nations like Ethiopia and \nNigeria, immigrants from Ireland, Albania, Poland, and Ukraine have \nbenefited from the program.\n  Diversity visa immigrants are not given a free pass to cross our \nborders and make a new life in American. Successful applicants must \nhave at least a high school diploma and at least 2 years of work \nexperience so that when they arrive in the U.S. they can contribute to \nthe nation's economic health. They are not exempt from the tough \nsecurity checks that all immigrants undergo. Applicants must complete \nconsular processing overseas and pass Department of Homeland Security \ninspection. Fraud is prevented through fingerprinting and the use of \ndigital photographs. Applications are screened and run through Homeland \nSecurity databases to ensure that an individual cannot game the system \nby filing multiple applications.\n  The Gregg amendment would take two-thirds of the 55,000 diversity \nvisas that are available each year and redirect them to applicants with \nadvanced degrees in science, math, and engineering. I support bringing \nmore high-skilled immigrants to the U.S., but there are already a large \nnumber of such visa slots in the bill before us today. The bill raises \nthe cap on H-1B visas from 65,000 per year to 115,000 per year. In \naddition, it adds an escalation clause so that in future years, if that \nnew cap of 115,000 is met, the cap will be raised by 120 percent the \nfollowing year. I think that this is a significant increase in high \nskilled worker visas. We can always revisit the issue in future years \nif the new levels do not provide an adequate number of visas for \nimmigrants who bring science and technological skills to our Nation. We \nneed not and should not undercut the Diversity Visa Program. The \ndiversity visa program honors the hopes and aspirations of hard working \nand industrious individuals who want a chance to achieve the American \ndream.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a small amendment that \ndeals with a problem each one of us has heard about in our States--the \nextremely long backlog at the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration \nServices.\n  One of the privileges of being a Senator is being able to help \nconstituents. In my State offices, I get thousands of requests from \nIllinoisans trying to get their VA benefits or clear up a problem with \ntheir Social Security check or deal with any number of government \nbureaucracies. It is great when we can get involved and help folks cut \nthrough the redtape. We are helping make government work, one case at a \ntime.\n  If your office is like mine, a large number of the cases involve \nimmigration. And if your office is like mine, the most common complaint \ninvolves FBI name checks. I have only been in office 16 months, but in \nthat time I have received 2,211 requests for assistance on immigration; \n426 of these\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\ncases, almost 1 in 5 deal with the FBI name check.\n  One step that legal immigrants have to take to stay in the country \nlawfully is going through a security check by the FBI. This is a \nstandard procedure, and it is critically important to screen the folks \nto which we are granting citizenship and permanent residence. \nUnfortunately, the system is overwhelmed.\n  The FBI's National Name Check Program is asked to review 62,000 names \na week--62,000 a week. In 2005, the FBI was asked to check 3.3 million \nnames, a 20-percent jump from 2001. A great majority of these people \nare cleared automatically by computer, but for many, FBI agents have to \ncomb through paper records spread across more than 265 sites across the \ncountry.\n  According to a November 2005 GAG report, the FBI background check is \none of the top factors beyond the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration \nServices' control that contributes to long wait times and an extended \nbacklog. The report found that 11 percent of applications studied took \nlonger than 3 months, and a significant portion of those took much \nlonger. The Department of Homeland Security has taken many steps to try \nto speed up this process, but unfortunately there are just too many \nrequests being sent to the FBI, and not enough analysts to deal with \nthem.\n  Many of my constituents have reported waiting as long as 2 years to \nget cleared by the FBI. These are innocent people who have jumped \nthrough every legal hoop we have put in front of them. But because of a \nbureaucratic mess, they are put in legal limbo.\n  My amendment isn't overly ambitious. It just gives the FBI a small \namount of resources to start tackling this problem. It authorizes \n$3.125 million a year for the next 5 years to allow FBI to hire \nadditional staff and take other steps to improve the speed and accuracy \nof the background checks. It also requires the FBI to report back to \nCongress on the size of the backlog and the steps it is taking to \nreduce it.\n  This is a problem we can do something about. And at a time when we \nare trying to stem the flow of immigrants entering the country \nillegally, this is a problem we must address. We should not punish the \nfolks who have been responsible and applied to enter the country \nlegally. We should make the system as efficient as possible. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5107-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak against the bill. I want \nto begin by saying that America has a proud history of immigration. \nWhen we say that America is a nation of immigrants, we mean that deep \nin our national consciousness is the image of America as a haven and a \nplace of opportunity for people from all over the world.\n  Our policies have reflected that image. America has always had more \nopen immigration policies than any other country. But those policies \nhave been the result of choices the American people have made.\n  We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. Like \nall sovereign nations, America has the right to determine who may enter \nour country and who may not. The American people have chosen to strike \na legal balance between their desire to provide opportunities to new \nresidents of diverse backgrounds and the economic reality that too much \nimmigration too fast will depress the wages and diminish the hopes of \nmillions of our own citizens.\n  I say with the utmost respect that the bill before us completely \nabandons that traditional balance. It provides an amnesty to those who, \nhowever understandable their motives, have chosen to trespass on our \nhospitality and violate our laws and does so under conditions that \nhistory has shown will increase rather than decrease illegal \nimmigration in the future. It allows a vast new immigration for decades \nto come, with no regard whatsoever for the impact on the lives and \nhopes of our own citizens who have the first claim to the American \ndream, and it does little or nothing to repair the existing system of \nlegal immigration which regularly confounds the expectations of \nmillions around the world who claim a legal right to enter the United \nStates.\n  Moreover, the Senate has regrettably and inexplicably rejected \ncommonsense amendments which were designed to restore the balance \nAmericans want and have the right to expect. For those reasons, I could \nnot support voting to end debate on the bill, and I will not now \nsupport its final passage.\n  I should say at the outset that I do support the border security \nprovisions in the bill. Border security is a national security issue \nrather than an immigration issue. For that reason, I recently sponsored \nbipartisan legislation, the Border Security and Modernization Act, in \norder to help secure America's border with additional manpower, new \nbarriers, and high-tech surveillance equipment.\n  The bill I cosponsored authorizes new funds for technology to assist \nour Border Patrol, to construct roads, fences, and barriers along the \nborder and to purchase air assets such as helicopters. In addition, the \nBorder Security and Modernization Act will increase resources for \nborder detention centers and enact stricter criminal penalties for \nhuman smuggling, falsifying work entry documents, and drug trafficking.\n  The immigration bill before the Senate contains many provisions \nsimilar to those in the bill which I cosponsored, and I am pleased the \nSenate approved an amendment which I also cosponsored to strengthen \nthose provisions providing for the construction of at least 370 miles \nof triple-layered fence and 500 miles of vehicle barriers at strategic \nlocations along the southwest border. But the good done in the \nimmigration bill by these provisions could largely be accomplished by \nthe President without new statutory authorization and is, in any case, \nfar outweighed by the negatives in the bill.\n  I oppose the bill first because it grants a broad-based amnesty--the \nright to legal residence and even citizenship--to 10 to 12 million \npeople who violated our laws. Permanent residence in the United States, \nnot to mention American citizenship, is a valuable and important \nprivilege.\n  Granting these privileges under these circumstances rewards and \ntherefore encourages unlawful immigration. It demoralizes and punishes \nthe millions of people around the world who have respected our rules \nand who are trying patiently to immigrate legally into the United \nStates, and it makes a mockery of the policy that is supposed to form \nour immigration laws--the desire to balance our need for workers and \nvision of America as a place of opportunity against the importance of \nprotecting jobs and wages at home.\n  If Congress grants an amnesty under these circumstances, what will be \nthe argument against granting another amnesty 5, 10, or 20 years from \nnow if millions more people, in response to the incentives created by \nthis bill, manage to enter the United States illegally?\n  To those who say this will not happen, I say that it has already \nhappened. Congress granted an amnesty 20 years ago for largely the same \nreasons under the same conditions and with the same assurances being \noffered in support of this bill before us today. Far from preventing \nillegal immigration, that amnesty has magnified the problem by four- or \nfivefold. What reason do we have to believe the same thing will not \nhappen if we pass this bill, especially since the amnesty procedure in \nthis bill is certain and takes effect immediately, while the border \nsecurity provisions may not work at all and will, in any event, take \nyears to implement? I suspect the pressure on our borders is increasing \neven now simply because the Senate is seriously debating an amnesty.\n\n  I also oppose the bill because it authorizes a vast and unvalidated \nincrease in immigration. The bill allows 70 to 90 million immigrants to \nenter the country over the next 20 years--not, by and large, \nscientists, doctors, or engineers, but people who will compete directly \nagainst Americans for\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\njobs in the hospitality industry or for craft work in construction or \nmanufacturing.\n  I begrudge no one the desire to come to the United States to make a \nbetter life for themselves. My grandparents did that, and so did my \nwife's mother. I certainly hope the economy will grow fast enough that \nwe will need additional workers, but our first responsibility is to our \nown people. We cannot sustain the American dream if we do not provide \nopportunity for all Americans, including those who do not or cannot go \nto college. I can think of nothing more likely to cause conflict and \ndivision, and raise the ugly specter of ethnic prejudice than making \nmillions of Americans compete against foreign workers, sometimes in \neconomic recessions, for the jobs their families need to make ends \nmeet.\n  Congress should be willing to increase legal immigration where our \nemployers have proven needs that our own workers cannot meet. I believe \nsuch shortage exists today in certain parts of the economy, such as \nagriculture, and I would be willing to consider increases in the \ncurrent limits in those areas. But that decision should be made on the \nbasis of evidence, not speculation, and Congress should make it \ncarefully and for short periods of time rather than guessing what the \nlabor situation will be 10 or 20 years from now.\n  These decisions we are considering today matter. They affect the \nlives of millions of our people who rightly expect that we will look \nout for their interests, not make them feel guilty about their \nlegitimate concerns for themselves and their loved ones. Moreover, the \nlegal immigration provisions in the bill will cost our taxpayers $54 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That fact is not disputed, even by the \nsponsors of the bill. Because of the deficit, our health care programs \nare under pressure. Congress is begrudging disaster relief to our \nfarmers. The Nation's transportation infrastructure is underfunded, and \nsome are proposing to reduce the defense budget or increase taxes. I \nsimply cannot understand why, at a time like this, Congress would \nundertake an additional budgetary commitment of this magnitude to \nforeign workers our economy may not even need.\n\n  Finally, I oppose the bill because it does very little to fix the \ncurrent legal immigration system. The great irony of this whole debate \nis that it has focused largely on the wrong problem. If we want to help \nthe economy and provide justice to immigrants, we should concentrate \nfirst on making our current programs at least minimally workable.\n  As Senators are probably aware, there are significant backlogs in our \ncurrent system due to the sheer volume of aliens eligible to legally \nimmigrate to the United States. As of December 31, 2003, the U.S. \nCustoms and Immigration Service, that is the USCIS, reported 5.3 \nmillion immigrant petitions pending. USCIS decreased the number of \nimmigrant petitions by 24 percent by the end of fiscal year 2004--that \nis a pretty good job--but they still had 4.1 million petitions pending. \nEvery new applicant who is not an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen \nmust go to the end of lines that vary in length according to country, \nthe prospective immigrant's relationship to their American sponsor, and \nprofession.\n  According to the State Department, experienced laborers from India \nface a 5-year wait for a visa, while Filipino siblings of Americans \nwait more than 22 years.\n  In my office, we live with this problem with the current immigration \nsystem every day. I have five caseworkers who spend parts of each day \nin response to constituent requests, assisting those who actually claim \na legal right to enter our country. These prospective immigrants have \nrespected our laws. They and their Missouri sponsors spend large \namounts of time and money trying to navigate the existing system. We \nhave almost 200 pending cases in our office alone.\n  They include Missourians who want to adopt children from abroad, \nforeign doctors who want to work in rural areas where they are \ndesperately needed, and world renowned researchers who want to bring \ntheir knowledge to the United States. These people have a right to \nimmigrate under the current laws. Yet the bill does nothing for them. \nIn fact, the bill makes their situation worse because it puts them at \nthe back of the line. The bill inevitably means that the time and \nattention of the Immigration Service will be spent processing the \napplications of undocumented workers and administering a vague new \nguest worker program for 70 million to 90 million people, rather than \non the cases of legal immigrants which, in some cases, have been \npending for years.\n  What I have just said is the answer to those who claim this bill is \nnecessary because it is the only practical solution to our current \nsituation. Mr. President, anybody even marginally familiar with our \ncurrent legal immigration system knows that it is in disarray. I honor \nthe work of our border agents, but the reality is that our existing \nborder security system is in every respect inadequate. I recognize that \nmany diligent government workers are trying to process the claims of \nlegal immigrants, but here again, they and the system are overwhelmed, \neven in trying to administer the current complicated visa system. The \nidea that our current immigration infrastructure can take on the real \njob of border security, process a multitiered amnesty program for 10 \nmillion to 12 million illegal aliens, and administer the claims of 70 \nmillion to 90 million new immigrants, in addition to its current \nresponsibilities, is sheer fantasy. And to argue in favor of this bill \non the grounds that it is a practical solution to anything shows how \nfar from reality the proponents of this legislation have really \ntraveled.\n  Mr. President, I suppose there are many in Missouri who support this \nbill, and I know many Senators have worked hard to come up with this \nlegislation. But in the last month, I have received over 4,000 calls, \ne-mails, and letters urgently in opposition to this measure before us, \nand I think a word should be spoken on behalf of the concerns of those \nconstituents. They are not paranoid because, in a world of terrorism, \nthey want the border under control. They are not ungenerous because \nthey worry about jobs for themselves and their children. And they are \nnot less progressive than Washington opinionmakers because they believe \nin the sovereign right of a democratic people who decide who and who \nshouldn't become a resident of this country.\n  The Senate had a chance to pass a good bill, a bill that secured the \nborder, that fixed the system of legal immigration, that developed the \nbiometrics our border security and immigration agents need to enforce \nthe law that stops the coyotes and the fly-by-night employers from \ncircumventing the law and paying cash to unlawful workers. The Senate \nhas fumbled that chance. I suppose this bill will pass, based on the \nvotes we have had in the last week or so. My hope is that in conference \nwith the House, the Senate will agree to a commonsense bill that I can \nsupport, one that respects the balance which the American people want, \nare waiting for, and have the right to expect.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5108-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I want to follow up on the comments of my \nfriend from Missouri as he leaves the Chamber and just to acknowledge \nand to second his comments. He said we are indebted to those who work \nso hard to try to piece together this compromise legislation, and I \nagree. We will attack a lot of difficult issues this year--we already \nhave--and I think few of them are more difficult than the one that we \nhave been working with this week, last week, last month, and we will \nprobably be dealing with in the months to come to try to hammer out a \nfinal bill to send to the President for his consideration.\n  Let me just make a couple of observations. First of all, let me say I \nam\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\ntold that last week some 10,000 people came across our borders \nillegally. We understand that roughly 10,000 will come across our \nborders illegally this week. Roughly another 10,000 will enter this \ncountry illegally next week. Some people have suggested amnesty is the \nanswer. I don't believe that it is.\n  We have heard it said on this floor today, and I will say it again \ntonight, simply providing amnesty sends the wrong signal to a lot of \nfolks. It sends the wrong signal to people who live south of our \ncountry who, if they come in illegally, eventually we will let stay. It \nalso sends the wrong signal, in my view, to people who are waiting--in \nsome cases for years--to become legal residents or citizens of this \ncountry and who, even though they have been trying to play by the \nrules, we let other folks come in ahead of them who have not played by \nthe rules. I think that is wrong.\n  What I think we need to do is to take an approach similar to that \nwhich we are taking here as we debate this legislation and amend this \nlegislation and, I hope, improve on this legislation. We need a policy \nthat is tough. We need an immigration policy that is smart. We need an \nimmigration policy that is comprehensive.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues, including my friend from Missouri \nwho has just spoken. I believe it begins with tougher borders, tougher \nborder security. We have seen an increase in the number of Border \nPatrol who man our borders along the border of the United States and \nMexico. I am told we have seen between 1995 and 2005 a doubling of the \nnumber of Border Patrol who patrol that area. Meanwhile, between 2001 \nand this year, we have seen a drop by almost a third of the folks who \nare apprehended coming into this country illegally. That makes no \nsense.\n  I think in terms of being on the border, we may need more Border \nPatrol. We are certainly voting for more Border Patrol, and I think \nthat is the right step. But it is also important that the folks to whom \nwe assign these responsibilities do a better job of tightening the \nborders and apprehending those who attempt to come through illegally.\n  The President proposed--and we have signed off on it--the deployment \nof National Guard troops along our border to work in conjunction with \nBorder Patrol. I support that. As an old commander in chief of the \nDelaware National Guard for 8 years, I believe the National Guard can \nplay a constructive role here.\n  One idea that I think makes sense is sort of a synergistic approach. \nWe have a number of Air National Guard units around the country that \nhave for their aircraft that they work with, they have pilotless \ndrones. And I could see using several squadrons of those pilotless \ndrones along our border to supplement the Border Patrol, to make them \nmore effective, to put into the air these aircraft that can detect the \nmovement of individuals, of vehicles moving toward our border. They are \neffective in the daytime and at night with infrared technology. I think \nthat is a smart use of our National Guard and provides the kind of \nsynergy that I think we ought to be looking for in deploying along our \nborder for maybe a 12-month period.\n  I know some people are uncomfortable with the notion of building a \nfence along any portion of our border with Mexico. I have traveled to \nIsrael and seen a fence being built throughout that country, the \nintention of which is to protect the Israelis from terrorists. And I \nknow some people are offended by the construction of that fence. \nPersonally, I am not. I am not offended by the notion of a fence along \nportions of our border with Mexico. I don't know that it makes sense, \ndollars and cents, to construct a fence along the entire 2,000-mile \nborder of the United States and Mexico. But there may be stretches, \nseveral hundreds of miles, maybe 300, 400 miles where a fence is cost \neffective, or where a fence can complement and enhance the ability of \nour Border Patrol, the ability of our Guard units to provide the kind \nof balance and deterrence that we need.\n  With respect to technology, technology can be a great help to us. \nUnmanned aircraft is just one example. Also, simply better \nidentification that would be awarded to people when they come here \nlegally, whether it is as a guest worker or on a more permanent working \nbasis, to provide them with identification that is, as best we can make \nit, tamper-proof.\n  I am reminded every time I go through the security checkpoints at \nairports, waiting to get through the checkpoints to get on a plane, I \nsee people, usually crew members, who simply go to the front of the \nline. They go through quickly, and in many cases they have their own \nidentification. Maybe they have biometrics. It may involve \nfingerprints, eyes, retinal scans. They can get through quickly.\n  I read recently, I think it was in Business Week, of that kind of \nidentification that may become available commercially to folks who are \nwilling to put out $100 or so, maybe less than that, in order to get \nidentification that is pretty much tamper-proof, that would really say \nthat whoever possesses this identification is indeed the person they \nprofess to be. That is the kind of technology I think we need.\n  We need more detention beds. The idea that somebody shows up from \nMexico, and we simply take them back to Mexico, that is fine. But if \nthey happen to be from Guatemala or Honduras or Peru or Chile, we \nsimply take them to a detention center. We have beds, we put them in \nthat detention center to await an arraignment hearing. If we don't have \nbeds, we say: Come back in a week or a month or two or three. We \nrelease them on their own recognizance, and we shouldn't be surprised \nthat a lot of times they don't come back. I don't think we should \nexpect them to come back.\n  We need more detention beds, and rather than simply turning people \nloose, knowing that they are unlikely to show up, we ought to be--we \nought to be--smarter than that. Part of the solution is more detention \nbeds.\n  Another aspect of a comprehensive law is to better enforce, to \nrigorously enforce the laws that we have on the books and to strengthen \nthem with respect to employers who knowingly hire folks who are here \nillegally. If you look at the number of prosecutions over the last half \ndozen or so years, it is pitiful in terms of the employers we know are \ndoing something illegal, that they are not doing the right work in \nmaking sure that the folks who are working for them are here lawfully. \nThe employers aren't doing it, and, frankly, we haven't been doing much \nabout it. We need to be tougher on that. This bill calls for that. But \nthe best laws, the toughest penalties on the books are no better than \nthe enforcement. In fact, we need much better enforcement.\n  The President has been a big advocate of a guest worker program. I \nthink he was calling for 400,000 guest workers this year, next year, \nthe year after that. I think we have significantly scaled back the \nscope of that guest worker program. I think it is acceptable that it be \na small portion of a comprehensive bill, but not as the President \nearlier suggested as really the centerpiece.\n  Let me say a word or two about the 10 million or 12 million people \nwho are here illegally, what to do with them. I know we have some who \nsay just send them all back, line them up, put them on a bus or an \nairplane and send them back where they came from. I don't understand \nhow practical that is. I understand the sentiment some feel in wanting \nto do that. What we are suggesting in this bill is we take an approach \nfor people who have been here illegally, violated our laws, done so \nrepeatedly, either committed a felony or multiple misdemeanors--that is \nit. They don't have a chance to stay here, no chance to be on a \nprobationary period for 6 years or six decades and work their way \ntoward citizenship. That is how it should be.\n\n  On the other hand, folks who have been here for 5 years or more, they \nworked, essentially they abided by the laws as a citizen here, they \npaid taxes--if those people are willing to serve an additional \nprobationary period for 6 years or more, continue to work, continue to \npay taxes, stay out of trouble with the law, to learn English, to pay a \nsubstantial fine--and frankly the size of that fine continues to grow; \nwe grew it further tonight to be somewhere in excess of $3,000--folks \nwho are willing to abide by the conditions of that kind of probation \nand do so religiously, year after year for half a dozen years or more, \nthey have a chance to work their way toward citizenship.\n  Similarly, for those who have been here from 2 to 5 years, they would \nhave a chance if they are willing to go back\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\nand come into this country through a couple of dozen entry points along \nthe border, to get valid identification so we know who they are and we \nknow they are here, that they, too, after a period of time would have a \nchance to enter the same kind of 6-year probationary period, abide by \nthe law, pay taxes, work, pay a fine, learn English--those kinds of \nthings. If they do those things, they, too, would have a chance to work \ntoward citizenship.\n  For people who have been here less than 2 years or people who \nviolated our laws, violated our laws repeatedly, they are out of luck. \nThey will go back to where they came from, and ultimately, if they have \nnot been lawbreakers, they would have a chance to reapply. I don't \nthink their chances of getting back here any time soon would be good.\n  The last thing, I say it is not in this bill and I think it is \nunfortunate that it is not--they talked about it in our caucus, and \nthere has been some serious discussion about whether we ought to raise \nthe minimum wage in our country. We raised the minimum wage when I was \nGovernor. I think 20 or so States have done so, ahead of the Nation. It \nhas been 20 years or more since we raised it. To the extent we actually \npay people a better wage in this country, we encourage more Americans \nto do these jobs which allegedly Americans will not do, which only \nforeigners are willing to do. Unfortunately, that increase in the \nminimum wage is not going to be part of this bill. I think that is \nprobably a mistake, but it is what it is.\n  In closing, at least with respect to immigration tonight, I again \nwant to say it is not good when 10,000 people are coming across our \nborders last week, this week, next week. Amnesty is not the answer. I \nbelieve the answer is legislation that is tough, that is smart, that is \ncomprehensive, that begins with a heavy focus on making our borders \nmore secure, enforcing the laws that are supposed to be in effect with \nrespect to employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens, trying to make \nsure the identification folks bring to this country to demonstrate to \nemployers--that we better ensure it is tamper-proof and we use \ntechnology to do that sort of thing.\n  There are a couple of outcomes that could come out of our work here. \nWe are going to take up this bill tomorrow with some final amendments, \nand we will vote on whether to pass it and to go to conference with the \nHouse, which has a somewhat different bill, as we know. It is not a \ncomprehensive bill but a bill not without some virtue.\n  I think we will have a chance to pass this bill tomorrow and go to \nconference. There are some people saying today in our own cloakroom \nthere is no way we are ever going to get a compromise out of a \nconference with the House. We may pass this bill, but that will be \npretty much the end of it. They may be right. I hope they are wrong.\n  Maybe among the outcomes here, maybe the worst would be to pass a bad \nbill and send the President a bad bill he might sign. That would be a \nmistake.\n  Almost as great a mistake as that would be, I believe, would be to do \nnothing and to leave here this year having not addressed our problems \nand to know that people are going to continue to stream into this \ncountry illegally. In most cases, they are just folks who want to come \nto work. In some cases, they are people who are criminals. Maybe in \nsome cases, they are people who would come here as terrorists. That is \njust unacceptable.\n  I am, frankly, proud of the Senate and the work we have done. I think \nin a way the center has sort of come together and held. The center has \nheld with respect to this bill and sort of rejecting extreme views on \neither side. I find that encouraging.\n  I don't have to say complimentary things about the President. I think \nin this case, in this instance, he has shown leadership and willingness \nto use some of that political capital he earned back in 2004 and I \nthink to put it to pretty good use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5110-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5110-S5111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          Corporal Cory Palmer\n\n                      Marine Corporal Sean Barney\n\n                           Stephen Snowberger\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I would like to change gears, if I could. I would like to \ntalk about a place in southern Delaware, a place called Seaford. Most \npeople in this Chamber--my guess is most people around the world--have \nnever heard about Seaford, DE, but almost everybody in this country and \naround the world has heard about a product called nylon. The first \nnylon plant in the world was built in Seaford, DE, by the DuPont \nCompany, I think roughly 60 years or so ago. It is a plant that is \nstill in operation, though run by a different firm today. There are \nstill close to 1,000 people who work there. So Seaford is really known \nin our State, and to the extent they are known around the country, as \nthe home of the first nylon plant ever built in the world.\n  Seaford is a small town. I don't know exactly how many people live \nthere now, but it is less than 10,000 people--maybe 5,000 or so. There \nis a lot of pride there, about their heritage with DuPont and a number \nof other reasons as well. It is in the southwestern part of our State, \nSussex County. A number of people in Seaford have gone on to serve in \nthe Armed Forces of our country. This month, two of our young Seaford \nnatives who had gone on to serve in Iraq have given their lives, have \nlost their lives. A young man named Cory Palmer, earlier in his life, \nmaybe 10 years ago, came up to the Governor's house. I was hosting the \nGovernors Fall Festival. We kicked off the Governors Fall Festival \nevery year with a 5-kilometer race. I remember Cory and other members \nof his family running in that race with the rest of us.\n  Earlier this month, Cory was in a humvee in Fallujah, with his \nteammates and the humvee exploded. It hit an IED, a big one, and Cory \nand his team, I think now maybe all six of them, at least five, have \nlost their lives.\n  I had the privilege of visiting with Cory Palmer's parents about 12 \ndays ago. As I sat there in the living room of that home with Cory's \nmom and dad, with his grandparents, siblings, I talked about another \nyoung man, a fellow who came to my attention--gosh, 6 years ago.\n  I got a phone call from Bill Bradley, Senator Bill Bradley, who was \nrunning for President. Bill Bradley called me to talk about a couple of \nguys who had worked in his Presidential campaign. He said: I am pulling \nout of the Presidential campaign. I have several people in my \nPresidential campaign whom you ought to talk to as you consider your \nrun for the Senate.\n  One of the names he shared with me that day was that of Sean Barney. \nSean Barney came to work for us and ended up being my research director \nin our campaign for 2001. One of the smartest people I have ever met, \nhe was also one of the hardest working people I have ever met. Sean \nworked as a research director in our campaign. In the campaign, he came \nearly, he worked late. He didn't just do it once in a while, he did it \nevery day and every night. I think one of the reasons we were \nsuccessful in that campaign was because of his hard work and sort of \nnever-say-die attitude.\n  I got elected, came to the Senate, and I asked Sean if he would join \nus on my Senate staff and he said that he would be pleased to do that. \nHe came to work in January of 2001, one of the first people we hired. \nHe came on board as a senior legislative aide.\n  I will not soon forget the day he came into my office and said to me, \nafter 9/11, that he felt the need to do something more to serve our \ncountry. He knew that I had served in the Navy. He said he had always \nrespected the service that I had to my country during the Vietnam war \nand later on in the Cold War. He said he felt the need to do that kind \nof thing as well.\n  Sean was then in his mid- to late 20s. I said: Sean, you served your \ncountry already. You do a great job of serving Delaware, you serve your \ncountry, you do it right here in the Senate, and we are lucky that you \ndo. Why don't you just stay here with us and continue the service you \nperform and perform so well?\n  Just like in the campaign where he came early, worked late, in the \nSenate he was just the same. He had a whole range of issues, from tax \npolicy, budget policy, Social Security, Medicare--he didn't take the \neasy issues, he took the tough issues. He came early, worked late. He \nhad a great sense of humor,\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\nwas a great person to boost the morale of the office, just a terrific \nteam player, a guy we felt lucky to have on our team.\n  As it turned out, on the Friday that I was sitting in the living room \nthere in Seaford, DE, talking with Cory Palmer's parents about the loss \nof his life shortly after he left Fallujah in a Medevac, I told them \nabout Sean Barney who had gone in the Marine Corps. Sean Barney decided \nhe was going to be a marine. Despite my encouragement to the contrary, \nto stay with us and serve here in the Senate, he elected to go on to \nactive duty. Here is a guy, a college graduate. He could have gone to \nQuantico, gone through OCS. He didn't. He decided he was going to \nenlist and not take the easier route--not that there is an easy route \nin the Marine Corps, but he said he wanted to go to Paris Island basic \ntraining. He finished there with distinction, headed on to finish, \nafter that, his advanced training. After having spent a little less \nthan a year on active duty, he came back to Washington--with shorter \nhair but with a good spirit--and rejoined my staff. He picked up on the \nissues he worked on before, and he worked just as hard, came early, \nworked late, good humor, a great member of our team.\n  Late last year, he got word that he was going to be activated. I had \nreally had a premonition that this was happening. When he had gone \nthrough his basic training and finished that and his unit was \noverseas--units were based up in New Jersey, the Marine unit--they were \noverseas, but he was not sent there to join them. They came back, and \nhe continued to train with them in the United States. He had not been \nactivated himself. He learned he was going to be activated late last \nyear and be on active duty, I think this year.\n  He went through training here in this country and a month or two ago \nheaded over to Iraq. He went to Fallujah. As I was sitting again in \nSeaford, with the Palmer family, trying to provide some comfort to \nthem, about 12 days ago, I told them about Sean Barney.\n  Little did I know that just hours before I went to their home, Sean \nBarney was shot. He was shot in Fallujah, on the streets of Fallujah. \nHe was shot by a sniper, and the bullet struck him in the neck, just \nmissed his Adam's apple. It severed the carotid artery, apparently \nnipped the jugular vein, barely missed his spine. Sean ran about half a \nblock, got behind some building or debris, and by a miracle, apparently \na humvee that was not too far away was called in by one of Sean's \nbuddies. I think it had a corpsman, Navy corpsman on board, maybe even \na doc. They got to Sean and Sean was still conscious. The last thing he \nremembered was hearing the corpsman say: Let's get the tourniquet out \nand use it. Sean was thinking, with a wound in the neck, where are they \ngoing to put the tourniquet? That is Sean, a good sense of humor, maybe \nin this case gallows humor.\n  Within 12 minutes, they had Sean in the humvee and into the hospital \nin Fallujah. They applied first aid en route, got him to Fallujah. \nThere was a doctor there, if I can find his name here, a fellow whose \nname is Captain Donovan. Captain Donovan, who just happened to be \nstarting a 30-day rotation at Camp Fallujah Hospital, was able to stop \nthe bleeding and put the carotid artery back together again. The fact \nthat Sean is alive today--and he is alive today, he is in Bethesda \ntonight--is a miracle.\n  I know a lot of us prayed earnestly for Sean, for his life. He has \nbeen spared and returned to be here with his wife Daisy and his \nparents. He is going to be checking out of Bethesda later this week, we \nhope, and go on to Philadelphia where his wife is going through a \nresidency in her medical training. She becomes a doctor, too.\n  That is a happy ending. While he has some problems with his shoulder \nin terms of ability to use that shoulder now, he is going to get great \ncare and hopefully rehab and maybe someday will be able to regain his \nfull capacity.\n  There is another young man from Seaford, though, subsequent to the \ntime I visited with the Palmers, who we learned had been shot and \nkilled in Ramadi.\n  Earlier today, a young man, Rick James, 20 years old, also a marine, \nwas buried in Seaford. And 12 days ago, Cpl Cory Palmer was buried at \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  Last night, I was back at Seaford visiting the family of Marine Cpl \nRick James, trying to comfort them in the funeral home as they got \nready to say goodbye to their son, their grandson, their brother, their \ncousin, and their friend.\n  It has been a tough month in Delaware. We are a little State. We have \nhad a number of people--maybe a dozen or so--who have lost their lives \nprior to this month in Iraq and Afghanistan. We lost three last month, \nwhich is tough for a little place.\n  There is another young man whose family doesn't live in Delaware but \nhe grew up in our State, Steven Snowberger, who went to William Penn \nHigh School. I was at his high school in New Castle, DE, last week. At \nthe age of 16, he moved on to complete his education elsewhere and to \njoin the Army. He died at the age of 18, about a week ago. We just said \ngoodbye to Steven this past week.\n  Those are three causes for great sorrow in our State, the loss of \nthree young men, the oldest being 22 years of age.\n  I must say that I am encouraged to talk to the families and see how \nproud they are of their young men, their sons, their grandsons, their \nbrothers, their cousins, their friends.\n  I have never seen a town that small, Seaford--or, frankly, a larger \ntown--sort of welling up, really with pride, as they have these last \ncouple of weeks, supporting those who have lost their lives and their \nfamilies as well. It was extraordinary.\n  One of our colleagues, John McCain, was invited to go to Delaware \nlast weekend by my colleague, Mike Castle, to do a campaign event over \non the coast. Senator McCain was good enough, at the urging of \nCongressman Castle, to swing through Seaford, DE, and stop to make an \nappearance there and say wonderful, supportive words about our young \nmen--heroes. All of us in Delaware are grateful to him for doing that.\n  While we mourn the loss of our marines and our Army PFC, we are just \ngrateful that later this week another marine part of our family in the \nSenate, Sean Barney, is alive. I think he is going to be OK. I do not \nknow that he will ever come back and work with us in the Senate family. \nHe has been accepted to law school at Stanford, and my guess is he will \nprobably--when he recovers enough and is ready to go onto the next part \nof his life and separate from the Marines--head for points west and \npick up his life and his wife.\n  To those in Seaford, and the Snowberger family down in North Carolina \ntoday who lost their son, Steven, our hearts go out to you. To the \nextent we can be helpful, you know we are there for you, like the whole \nState is.\n  To our friend, Sean, we are just glad that miracles still happen and \nthat one of them involved you.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5111-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5111-S5112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FORMER SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Catherine and I were deeply saddened to \nlearn of Lloyd's passing. Lloyd and his wife Beryl Ann or as she is \nknown to friends, B.A. were part of our Senate family for 22 years. \nThey were good friends to Catherine and me, and they were quite a \ncouple. Their sense of humor could lighten any situation. I recall B.A. \nonce read an erroneous news report that Lloyd was worth $70 million. \nShe responded, ``Where is it?''\n  B.A. was a great companion and partner for Lloyd in all things, and \nour hearts go out to her and their three children and eight \ngrandchildren.\n  Lloyd was Texan through and through. He used to tell stories about \ngrowing up on his father's ranch with the sign at the end of the road \nthat read: ``To heck with the dog, beware of the owner.'' You would \nthink someone raised up the road from a sign like that would have a \ntemper, but nothing could have been further from the truth. Lloyd was \ngracious, composed, polished, and pressed. He was a true gentleman. \n``Gravitas,'' he liked to say, ``is gray hair and a pressed suit.''\n  Lloyd was also a patriot. As fellow World War II veterans, we were \ncomrades in the deepest sense of the word, and I admired him greatly. \nHe was an accomplished legislator and statesman. He was also a dear \nfriend.\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\n  Those in Alaska will never forget his support of our State. In 1981, \nLloyd came to the floor and spoke in favor of a waiver that would \nenable the construction of the Alaska natural gas pipeline. Congress \nrecently approved the financial incentives needed to begin this \nproject--and we owe a great debt to Lloyd for always making sure those \nin the Senate never forgot how important the Alaska gas pipeline is to \nour country's energy independence.\n  Since Lloyd greatly respected the late House Speaker Sam Rayburn, I \nwill close with one of Sam's sayings:\n  ``You cannot be a leader, and ask other people to follow you, unless \nyou know how to follow, too.''\n  Mr. President, those are words to live by, and no one understood them \nbetter than Lloyd.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Lloyd Bentsen, a \ndearly departed former Member of this body. Senator Bentsen died \nyesterday at the age of 85, and he leaves behind a legacy of fiscal \nresponsibility, steadfast service, and unwavering statesmanship.\n  Senator Bentsen was born in Mission, TX, in 1921, a descendant of \nDanish immigrants. From a young age, he excelled in nearly all his \nendeavors: he was an Eagle Scout, a distinguished graduate of the \nUniversity of Texas Law School, and a fighter pilot, flying B-24 combat \nmissions during World War II. At the young age of 23, Senator Bentsen \nwas promoted to the rank of major, a post that gave him command of over \n600 men. For his valiant service during the war, the Army Air Corps, \nnow the Air Force, awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross, one of \nthe military's highest honors.\n  Senator Bentsen went on to serve the people of Texas as Hidalgo \ncounty judge, U.S. Congressman, and, beginning in 1970, as U.S. \nSenator. He was overwhelmingly reelected to this body three times, in \n1976, 1982, and 1988.\n  As a Senator, Lloyd Bentsen was a champion of sound national economic \npolicy and fiscal responsibility. He served as chairman of the Joint \nEconomic Committee and the Committee on Finance, and balanced his keen \neye on progressive causes such as women's rights with a dogged \ndetermination to cut taxes and support our Nation's businesses. As his \ncontemporaries will no doubt attest, Senator Bentsen's political acumen \nwas unmatched, and the coalitions he built crossed party, ideological, \nand even international boundaries.\n  Bentsen resigned his seat in the Senate in 1993 to serve as the 69th \nSecretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. He helped \nPresident Clinton set the course for what would be our country's \nstrongest fiscal climate in recent memory. As Treasury Secretary, \nBentsen was known to be a firm and sound counselor on economic policy; \nthe Houston Chronicle reports that an autographed picture from \nPresident Clinton was inscribed: ``To my friend Lloyd Bentsen, who \nmakes me study things until I get it right.'' President Clinton went on \nto award Bentsen the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999.\n  Throughout his career, Lloyd Bentsen set a standard for no-nonsense \nservice, responsible business practice, and judicious public policy. I \nhonor his good work today, and the memory of a life lived strong and \nfull.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I had the honor of serving with Lloyd \nBentsen for 20 years, and I respected him as a Senator's Senator. He \nhad a style about him. He was this really classy Texas gentleman who, \nwhen he walked into this Chamber or into a hearing room, you could just \nfeel his presence and his desire to work something out.\n  I admired him because he used the power of that office to help \nmillions and millions of Americans, especially the people he felt \nneeded it most, the very young and very old among us.\n  Everyone in America who has an IRA and is saving for retirement can \nthank Lloyd Bentsen. Every American worker whose pensions are \nprotected, is because of Lloyd Bentsen. He improved access to health \ncare for needy women and children--not with some massive sweeping bill \nthat would never have passed Congress but, incrementally, every year, \ngiving a new benefit so more and more people were helped.\n  When he went to Treasury, he was the architect of President Clinton's \neconomic plan that eventually balanced the budget and created millions \nof jobs and brought credibility and leadership back to this country \nwith other industrialized nations.\n  I express my sympathy to his family, and especially his wonderful \nwife B.A. He liked to call her his best asset, but she was an asset to \nall of us. Our prayers are with her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5112-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5112-S5113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JUDGE DANNY J. BOGGS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nKentuckian who is one of the finest legal scholars of his generation. \nDanny J. Boggs, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit, has served on the bench for 20 years, and over the course of \nhis stellar career he has made many friends and impressed all who know \nhim--this Senator included.\n  Judge Boggs is renowned for having an engaging, active mind, with \nwhich he tackles not only the law but a host of other subjects. Well-\nread in history, geography, literature, mathematics, and political \nscience, he is a true Renaissance man. And not only does he voraciously \ningest knowledge, he loves to share it with others.\n  Ask any clerk or former clerk of Judge Boggs, and he or she will tell \nyou: They are liable to be asked a question any time, on anything. One \nof his former clerks, who now works in my Washington office, recalls a \ntime when Judge Boggs called in to the office while on a business trip \nto find out the population of Montana not the present-day State but the \nMontana territory.\n  Judge Boggs delights in hiring clerks of any and all political \npersuasions, as long as they have a keen mind and are always ready for \ndebate. Of course, these poor clerks know that Judge Boggs will almost \nalways win. But his interest is not winning or losing. It is in \nensuring that the final product--the legal brief--is as rigorous as it \ncan be.\n  Judge Boggs is infamous for giving a trivia quiz to his clerkship \napplicants although perhaps ``trivia'' is not the right word for it. He \nprefers the term ``general knowledge'' test. But I don't think there is \nanything general about the scope of Judge Boggs's knowledge. Just \nlisten to one question from a recent test of his: ``If the moon were \nmade of green cheese, and if green cheese floats in water, what is the \nmost that the moon could weigh (within a factor of 10)?''\n  Believe it or not, most of Judge Boggs's clerks actually enjoy \nrunning this intellectual gauntlet--so much so that three of them \nappeared as contestants on the popular television game show ``Who Wants \nto Be a Millionaire.'' Two of them picked Judge Boggs to be their \n``phone a friend'' lifeline a superior mind to turn to for a \nparticularly difficult question. Judge Boggs himself has tried to be a \ncontestant on the show, so far without success, but I suspect his true \ncalling may be to work for the show and write the questions.\n  Born in Havana, Cuba, Judge Boggs grew up in Bowling Green, KY, and \nearned his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1965. He earned \nhis law degree in 1968 at the University of Chicago while being elected \nto Order of the Coif. After graduating, Judge Boggs taught at the \nUniversity of Chicago Law School the following academic year--quite an \naccomplishment for a newly minted lawyer.\n  Judge Boggs answered the call of public service in several capacities \nbefore he attained his current post. After a few positions in Kentucky \nState government, he ventured to Washington, where he served as \nAssistant to the Solicitor General, Assistant to the Chairman of the \nFederal Power Commission, and Deputy Minority Counsel for the Senate \nEnergy Committee. Judge Boggs also worked in private practice, in the \nWhite House as a Special Assistant to the President, and from 1983 to \n1986 as Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy.\n  President Ronald Reagan appointed Judge Boggs to his current position \nin 1986, and on October 1, 2003, Judge Boggs became the Chief Judge of \nthe Sixth Circuit. Many times, his opinions have been upheld \nunanimously by the Supreme Court, both when he is written in the \nmajority and in dissent.\n  He has taught American jurisprudence in the Soviet Union, the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, and Russia. Chief Justice of the \nUnited States William H. Rehnquist appointed Judge Boggs to several \nimportant posts\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\nin the Judicial Conference of the United States, and Judge Boggs also \nserved as chair of the Appellate Judges Conference of the American Bar \nAssociation from 2001 to 2002.\n  Judge Boggs entire career has been marked by energy, accomplishment, \nand scholarly brilliance. His fertile, polymath's mind has unlocked a \nlove of learning in countless others. And his 20 years of distinguished \nservice on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit \nhas inspired us all. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in commending Judge Danny J. Boggs for his 20 years on the bench and \nfor his continued service to the law and his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5113-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INCLINE HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, from April 29 to May 1, 2006, approximately \n1,200 students from across the country participated in the national \nfinals competition of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, \nan educational program developed to educate young people about the U.S. \nConstitution and Bill of Rights. The We the People Program is \nadministered by the Center for Civic Education and funded by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education through an act of Congress.\n  During the 3-day competition, students from all 50 States \ndemonstrated their knowledge and understanding of constitutional \nprinciples. The students testified before a panel of judges in a \ncongressional hearing simulation focusing on constitutional topics. I \nam pleased to announce that Incline High School from Incline Village, \nNV, received the Western Region Award.\n  I had the chance to meet these bright young students from Incline \nHigh while they were here in Washington, DC. Of the many groups from \nNevada that I have met with, I have rarely been asked such intelligent \nand thoughtful questions. I was impressed with their interest and \nknowledge of complex constitutional issues. These young students are an \nexample of the future of America, and they should be commended for \ntheir hard work.\n  Mr. President, the names of these outstanding students from Incline \nHigh School are as follows: Kent Bergantz, Roxanne Casselberry, Dan \nDriver, Julie Gregory, Amy Hanna, Andrew Herr, Annie Horton, Alisa \nJohansson, Taylor Lane, Cara Langsfeld, Stephen McKay, Scott Nikkel, \nCourtney Pennacchio, Mia Perhacs, Tony Ring, Cara Sheehan, Ryan \nSpizman, Lara St. John, Christin Thompson, Shea Wickland, Alethia \nWilliams, and Carly Wood.\n  I would also like to commend the teacher of the class, Milt Hyams, as \nwell as the State coordinator, Marcia Stribling, and the district \ncoordinators, Daniel Wong and Shane Piccinini, who have donated their \ntime and energy to prepare these students for the national finals \ncompetition. Without the hard work and dedication of these individuals, \nour students would have missed an amazing learning experience.\n  Mr. President and my colleagues in the Senate, please join me in \ncongratulating these young constitutional experts for their outstanding \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5113-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5113-S5114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NATO AND IRAN\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to share with our colleagues \nremarks I have made recently at the Atlantic Council, the Council on \nForeign Relations, and other forums regarding a role NATO should \nconsider by joining others seeking to achieve a diplomatic resolution \nof the potential nuclear weapons threat posed by Iran.\n  I have long been, and remain to this day, a steadfast supporter of \nNATO. No alliance, since World War II, has achieved a more successful, \nsteadfast record of achieving peace.\n  I applaud NATO for embracing the concept of ``out of area'' missions. \nIn Iraq, despite continuing violence, a new unified government is \nemerging. Even with the differences of opinion among NATO nations \nrelated to Iraq, NATO did step forward to participate in the important \nmission of training Iraqi security forces.\n  There is no better example of NATO undertaking important ``out of \narea'' missions than the leadership NATO is providing in the \nInternational Security Assistance Force, ISAF, in Afghanistan.\n  Recently I was in Afghanistan and saw firsthand how ISAF is expanding \nits reach to provide security and stability throughout Afghanistan. \nISAF forces are accepting risks in the face of a rising number of \nattacks, while the new Government forges ahead putting down roots of \ndemocracy so that Afghanistan can take its place among the free nations \nof the world.\n  The principal focus of my remarks today is on how NATO might respond \nto the greatest threat to regional and global stability that we face \ntoday: Iran.\n  I had the privilege this week to join Senator Lugar and other Members \nin a private meeting with Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA. Dr. ElBaradei generously \nshared his insights on the situation with Iran, and how he continues to \ntry to fulfill the responsibilities of his organization. I greatly \nrespect his views.\n  I agree that when faced with a fork in the road between negotiation \nand confrontation, the world has rightly chosen, for the present, the \npath of negotiation. There is time--but not unlimited--to pursue a \npeaceful resolution to persuade Iran not to pursue steps leading to the \ndevelopment and acquisition of nuclear weapons.\n  Underway at this very moment are negotiations--the United States \ntogether with France, Great Britain, Germany, and other members of the \nEU, are doing everything to persuade Iran not to develop nuclear \nweapons.\n  The U.N. Security Council and the IAEA are also playing important \nroles in these diplomatic efforts.\n  Currently, Iran boasts about its inventory of missiles which can \nrange throughout the Middle East and reach Europe. If Iran defies \ndiplomacy and develops nuclear weapons, the threat will increase \nexponentially.\n  Free nations are and must face this reality now. As the Israeli Prime \nMinister Ehud Olmert warned in his address to a joint session of \nCongress this morning:\n\n       A nuclear-armed Iran is an intolerable threat to the peace \n     and security of the world. It cannot be permitted to \n     materialize.\n\n  I support the principle of preserving as many options as possible in \ndiplomacy.\n  One of those options is to engage in bilateral talks between the \nUnited States and Iran, and/or between one or more other nations that \nshare our objectives and Iran.\n  Just this morning, the international press is reporting that the \nIranian leadership is making serious overtures to the United States to \ninitiate a bilateral dialogue. Dr. ElBaradei confirmed in our meeting \nwith him that Iran is open to such a dialogue. The United States should \nkeep this option on the table, and consider when it is timely to \nexplore procedures for bilateral talks.\n  Iran needs to understand that the free nations of the world are \nserious. Iran can go ahead with its civil nuclear program, under the \ninspection regime of the IAEA, insofar as it relates to Iran's \nlegitimate energy needs, but we will not, as a consortium of free \nnations, permit Iran to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.\n  Another option is deterrence. Let's reflect on the worst case \nscenario: If diplomacy did not succeed, at some point in time, and \nthere is confirmation that Iran is defiantly going forward with a \nnuclear weapons program, what is the response of the team of nations \nconducting the diplomacy?\n  We should reflect on the lessons of the Cold War, when deterrence \nsucceeded. We should consider erecting a ``ring of deterrence'' that \nwould surround Iran and deter the use of actual force, as was done so \nsuccessfully during the Cold War.\n  Initially, such a plan could be limited to a stand-off naval force \noperating in international waters, and a stand-off air capability in \ninternational airspace.\n  Has any organization had a better record for planning and effecting a \npolicy of deterrence than NATO?\n  I call upon the North Atlantic Council of nations to discuss the \noption of deterrence and hopefully to initiate a study of what is a \nlogical sequence of actions to show support to the path of negotiation.\n  Such a step forward would give NATO a place at the international \ntable as a partner in the diplomatic efforts being pursued by the IAEA, \nthe\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nU.N. Security Council, and a consortium of nations who are deeply \nconcerned such as Great Britain, France, Germany and the United States.\n  Such an initiative would signal the seriousness with which the 26 \nNATO nations view the concerns of the international community, and \nwould lend important support to the combined diplomatic efforts \nunderway.\n  I bring to your attention two quotes which, though not directly in \ncontext, demonstrate general thinking on why NATO should begin to \nprepare to address the potential threats from Iran.\n  In a speech on November 3, 2005, the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap \nde Hoop Scheffer, said:\n\n       Either we tackle challenges to our security when and where \n     they are, or they'll end up on our doorstep.\n\n  He is absolutely right.\n  On February 10th of this year, 2006, the Secretary General said at a \npress conference:\n\n       Iran is of course a very, very, relevant subject for NATO. \n     That Iran can be discussed in NATO, yes.\n\n  With a sense of fairness, I point out that in his remarks of February \n10, 2006, the Secretary General also said the following:\n\n       We follow the EU-3 in their negotiations with Iran, \n     together with America, we follow Russia, the IAEA, and we \n     have no intention of playing the first violin, or playing any \n     direct or active role in this dispute.\n\n  I say, most respectfully, to the Secretary General: Mr. Secretary, \nthe problem of Iran could be on your doorstep very soon, if it is not \nalready there. The time to join the roundtable of diplomacy is now.\n  As we in the Congress, and others, continue our work and support of \nNATO, we have got to prepare for the many challenges in this troubled \nworld. We may not know today what some of those challenges may be, but \nwe must keep NATO strong, viable, and forward thinking.\n  NATO's most valued asset is the respect, confidence, and, above all, \nthe trust people have for its past record of success and future \npotential.\n  We sleep better at night knowing that NATO is standing watch.\n  I say to all who support NATO, we cannot allow ourselves to lapse \ninto an exercise of nostalgia, basking in the greatness of this \norganization, greatness achieved by our predecessor trustees and \nrespected leaders of NATO, down through the past half century.\n  In my most recent consultation with General Jones, I recorded a few \nnotes, which I share with you today. We agreed on the following: ``NATO \nhas been and must remain a great alliance. Great alliances do great \nthings. It is possible that NATO's most important days and most \nimportant missions lie ahead in the future.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5114-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution which \nwas drafted by my esteemed colleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins, \nand thank my other colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. \nThis resolution was previously introduced in the 107th Congress, passed \nthe Senate, but, unfortunately, time ran out in the House of \nRepresentatives to be passed. This resolution reflects the resolution \nintroduced in the 107th Congress and is supported by the emergency \nmanagers from the participating States.\n  Disasters know no boundaries. In January 1998, the worst ice storm in \nour region's history demolished power lines from Quebec, through \nupstate New York, across Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, and into the \nMaritimes. As many as 4 million people were without electricity, some \n700,000 for as long as 3 weeks, and damage topped $6 billion. And in \nAugust 2003, a blackout left millions of American and Canadian citizens \nand businesses again without electrical power. These events, and many \nof the more than 100 federally declared disasters in the Northeast in \nthis past quarter century, have necessitated State and provincial \nemergency management organizations to request out-of-jurisdiction \nmutual assistance to deal with the emergency.\n  In response to the ice storm, in June 1998, the New England Governors \nConference and Eastern Canadian Premiers signed and later adopted, in \nJuly 2000, the International Emergency Management Assistance Compact, \nmore commonly referred to as the compact. The compact is an arrangement \nof necessity in providing mutual assistance amongst jurisdictions for \nmanaging any type of emergency, or disaster, whether arising from \nnatural, technological, or man-made causes. The State of Maine, along \nwith New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and \nConnecticut, has entered into such a compact with the provinces of our \ngood Canadian neighbor of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, \nNova Scotia and Newfoundland.\n  This compact arrangement provides the form and structure to the \ninternational mutual aid and addresses such issues as liability, \npayment, et cetera, in advance, before an emergency occurs, allowing \nfor expedited deployment of resources and personnel at the time of the \nemergency. One crucial lesson learned of Hurricane Katrina is that in \nthe aftermath of such a crisis, emergency responders need to focus on \nrecovery, and not bureaucratic processes and redtape. Having this \ncompact in place enables our emergency responders to focus on their \nmission of response and to avoid cross-jurisdictional obstacles.\n  Enhancing an environment of joint communication, coordination and \ncooperation is crucial for a more secure region and an effective \nemergency response capability, and an International Emergency \nManagement Group meets regularly to do just this, by implementing the \ncompact and working closely together to develop plans, train and \nexercise for disasters and emergencies. This compact concept serves the \nbest interests of our citizens of the United States, and of Canada, our \ngood northern neighbor, as well.\n  In summary, the best way to handle an emergency is to forward plan \nand to take as many actions of readiness and preparedness as possible, \nin advance, and as feasible. Our readiness and preparedness \ncapabilities are indeed most enhanced when an obstacle-free platform is \ncreated for our emergency responders. This compact arrangement does \njust that, particularly addressing international and cross-\njurisdictional issues. It is for this reason, I urge my fellow \ncolleagues to, again, support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5114-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LIBYA AND PAN AM BOMBING\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to address the \nadministration's decision to restore full diplomatic relations with \nLibya and remove it from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. I \nagree with the President that Libya has made progress in renouncing and \nfighting terrorism, but we must not overlook that the families of the \nvictims of the Pan Am bombing continue to wait for the remaining \ncompensation from Libya that was agreed to in 2003. We also must not \noverlook the victims and their families affected by the La Belle \nbombing in Germany in 1996, when two American servicemembers were \nkilled and many others were severely injured.\n  I urge the administration to work toward a solution that ensures that \nthe victims' families are fully compensated. At the same time, the \nGovernment of Libya should know that as we review this diplomatic \nproposal over the next several weeks, we will be looking for Libya to \ncontinue their forward progress in rejoining the international \ncommunity. We urge them to make good on their promises to the families \nwho have suffered so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5114-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5114-S5115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE WILLCOX\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute to Lawrence \nWillcox, who has served me admirably for the past 3\\1/2\\ years as staff \ndirector of the Senate Republican Policy Committee and, before that, as \nlegislative director and tax counsel in my personal office. Lawrence \nhas made the decision to return to the private sector and pursue a \ncareer in tax law.\n  Lawrence joined my personal staff in 2001, where he served me ably, \nespecially in the tax policy arena. When I was elected chairman of the \nPolicy Committee at the end of 2002, I asked Lawrence to become the \nstaff director. Lawrence has come to be a trusted adviser, and I have \nappreciated his good work. He promptly and dutifully carried out every \ntask that I charged him with, and he led the staff members of the \nRepublican Policy Committee to\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\nachieve a level of excellence that I believe has been of value to \nSenators and their staff.\n  During Lawrence's time as staff director, we have produced more than \n200 policy papers, and dozens of legislative notices. In each case, our \ngoal was a first-rate product--one that would be thorough, accurate, \nand reliable--that would serve Senators, their staffers, the press, and \nthe public. I commend him for all of his work and his successes in that \nregard.\n  Additionally, Lawrence has served as my agent and adviser on Senate \nleadership matters. He has attended leadership meetings with me and \ngiven me sound counsel. He has also managed and attended the Policy \nCommittee's weekly luncheons.\n  I should mention that it was Lawrence who instituted the Policy \nCommittee's practice of issuing detailed amendment descriptions in \nanticipation of every rollcall vote. The reception from this new \nservice has been very positive: It has made the jobs of legislative \ndirectors and legislative aides vastly easier in preparing Senators for \nvotes. That is just one example of innovations Lawrence has overseen.\n  I think it would be fair to suggest that many of my colleagues here \ntoday and others in the Senate reading these words in future days would \nwant to join me in thanking him for a job well done. We would not be \nable to do the work we do were it not for staff members of the caliber \nof Lawrence Willcox.\n  Before I close, I note that Lawrence has been in public service for \nnearly all his working life. In addition to his more than 8 years of \nexperience on Capitol Hill, including 3 years as a staffer in the House \nof Representatives, he served 5 years active duty as a naval officer, \nand he has also worked in both the judicial and executive branches, \nserving in various capacities, including as a law clerk on the U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims and as a trial attorney in the Department of \nJustice's Tax Division. Lawrence holds a bachelor's degree from the \nUniversity of Michigan, a law degree from American University, and a \nmaster's degree in tax law, LL.M., from New York University.\n  Lawrence is a person who is always growing from his experiences, \nputting his newfound knowledge to work in newer and better ways. So, \nwhile I wish him well, I am also confident that he will do well, and I \nhope to retain his friendship in the years ahead. Thank you, Lawrence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5115-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5115-S5116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO COAST GUARD AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Her steadfast support reinforces her \norganization's honorable goal of building better lives for America's \ndisabled veterans and their families.\n  The Disabled American Veterans is a service organization for the \nbrave men and women who have become sick and disabled as a result of \nwartime military service. Founded in 1920, this organization serves \nveterans who have fought in combat since World War I.\n  Ms. Buchanan began work as a keypunch operator for the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans on October 12, 1964. In her four decades of service, \nshe has helped the organization grow from supporting 178,864 members to \nrepresenting 1.3 million members. Over the years, she has risen to the \nposition of executive assistant at the National Headquarters in Cold \nSpring, KY. During her tenure, Ms. Buchanan has served combat veterans \nof every war and conflict since World War I.\n  I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in thanking Ms. Buchanan \nfor her dedication and commitment to the Disabled American Veterans. \nHer devotion to our Nation's combat heroes serves as an example to all \ncitizens of the Commonwealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5116-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING ST.

St. Elizabeth has been \nnamed as a magnet hospital by the American Nurses Credentialing Center.\n  Designation as a magnet hospital by this organization is an extremely \nprestigious honor, so much so that some have called it the Nobel Prize \nof hospital nursing. Fewer than 200 providers have received this \nrecognition. This puts St. Elizabeth in the company of only 3 percent \nof U.S. hospitals.\n  Just as the award it has received indicates, St. Elizabeth acts as a \nmagnet for nursing. It offers the exceptional quality of nursing care \nand attracts and retains the most talented nurses. Not only is this \ngood news for St. Elizabeth, but it is good news for the community--\nthey know that if they go to this facility, they will be receiving some \nof the best care in the country. I am extremely excited that northern \nKentucky is receiving the nursing care that it deserves.\n  I congratulate St. Elizabeth Medical Center on this achievement. \nEveryone involved with this institution is an inspiration to the \ncitizens of Kentucky.

A bill to provide for the mandatory revocation, in addition \nto the mandatory denial, of passports of individuals who have a certain \nlevel of child support arrearages; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that \nhelps to prevent children from living in poverty and ensures that \nnoncustodial parents pay child support, instead of fleeing off to hide \nfrom their responsibilities. I commend my fellow Kansas colleagues, \nCongressman Jerry Moran and Congressman Dennis Moore, for introducing \nsimilar legislation in the House.\n  The problem is this: a noncustodial parent could potentially avoid \npaying their responsible share of child support by leaving the country. \nState child support enforcement agencies must certify cases to the \nState Department for passport denial if the child support debt is over \n$5,000. The $5,000 is slated to be reduced in October 2006 to $2,500 in \naccordance with Public Law 109-171. The loophole that emerges is for \nthose deadbeat parents who already have a passport. Under current \nimplementation of the law, the next opportunity point of enforcement is \nat the renewal of the passport, which could be several years down the \nroad. The legislation I offer today closes that loophole, and simply \ninstructs the State Department to revoke, in addition to denying, a \nnoncustodial parent's passport once the individual's child support debt \nexceeds the amount set in law.\n  Studies show that the receipt of child support is a key factor that \nkeeps a child and single parent family from living in or near poverty. \nBeyond that financial security that steady child support provides, \nthere is a greater likelihood that the noncustodial parent is \npersonally involved in their child's life. If a parent shows \nresponsibility financially, there is a bigger chance that he or she is \ninvolved emotionally. The impact of a noncustodial parent's involvement \nin his child's life, in many cases, results in better grades and fewer \nbehavioral problems.\n  In Kansas alone, there are currently 131,000 child support cases \nopen, including those receiving public assistance, and those above that \nincome bracket. Last year, the Kansas Child Support Enforcement program \ncollected $156 million in child support. However, that number \nrepresents only 54 percent of all payments owed to children. \nUnfortunately, that missing 46 percent of child support overdue \naverages out to\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\njust over $7,000 per child. That is quite a loss for a single-parent's \nhousehold budget to absorb.\n  Now, you might ask: What percentage of the population will this help? \nI would concede that, although this may not impact a high percentage of \nthose children and families receiving child support, the impact on an \nindividual family is very significant. According to my State's limited \nrecords on this issue, approximately 50 passport applications and \nrenewals are denied on a yearly basis. That figure does not include \nthose passports that should be revoked. Coupled with the upcoming \nreduction in allowable debt, the Kansas Child Support Enforcement \nProgram estimates that the number of deadbeat parents affected would \nincrease to 250. The security afforded by the steady stream of child \nsupport could be the lone determinant of a family living in poverty or \nexisting on adequate financial ground.\n  I encourage my colleagues to add their support to this important fix. \nWe must ensure that the tools provided to the States have the teeth \nnecessary to discourage deadbeat parents from running out on their \nfinancial responsibilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2999. A bill to improve protections for children and to hold \nStates accountable for the safe and timely placement of children across \nState lines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Today I join with my colleagues Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Domenici to introduce the Safe and Timely Interstate Placement \nof Foster Children Act of 2006. I am proud to have had the opportunity \nto again work with my friend, Senator Rockefeller, on the important \nissues affecting the most vulnerable and at risk children--children in \nfoster care. This is an important bill and I hope we will be able to \npass swiftly.\n  In 1997, I worked on the Adoption and Safe Families Act, an important \nbill that worked to provide timelier placement of children in foster \ncare. Since that time, it has been successful. Dramatically more \nchildren are being adopted. Children are spending less time languishing \nin foster care and have greater opportunities to find a permanent home \nor family. However, there are barriers that remain for children in \nfoster care--particularly for children who are placed across state \nlines for various reasons--including trying to place them with family \nmembers or if a family in another state is looking to adopt that child. \nThese children are shown to continue to remain in foster care for much \nlonger periods of time. Through no fault of their own--they wait for \nplacement and wait for a permanency in their lives that children long \nfor and deserve.\n  I also want to thank the work that the States have done to alleviate \nthe problems we currently find in interstate placement. This has been a \nproblem for many years, but recently States have been active in \ncreating and promulgating guidelines for dealing with complications \nthat can arise related to interstate placement. I hope that we can see \nthese guidelines soon implemented. The primary power to move these \nchildren to homes rests with the States, and we want to encourage their \nquick action.\n  This bill will require and support States in the expeditious study of \nhomes for children in foster care who may be placed or adopted across \nState lines. This bill would allow a 60-day period for such study to \noccur--while 2 months is a long time in the life of a child, we feel \nthat it is an appropriate balance between the needs of the State and \nchild welfare agencies to conduct thorough assessments and the needs of \nthe child to be in a more permanent home.\n  This bill also expresses the sense of the Congress that States should \naccept the home study evaluations done by another State. This would go \na long way to reduce time waiting for placement and redundancy of \neffort in the child welfare system.\n  Importantly, this bill is not just another mandate on States. This \nbill would provide resources to enhance and speed up their systems for \ninterstate placement--but States do have to earn it. If passed, it \nwould provide $1,500 per child who was placed within a 30-day period. \nStates can use this money to improve their systems for placement, hire \nmore staff to conduct placement, or otherwise use it for improvement of \nservices for foster children in their State.\n  This bill will also improve the rights of children and their foster, \npre-adoptive parents, or family caregivers to be heard in court \nproceedings concerning their case within the child welfare system. It \nis important that a child's needs are appropriately represented and \nthis bill will work to ensure that the parties most involved in the \nchild's life are present when important matters are being considered. \nCourts will also be required to work more closely with their \ncounterparts in other States when the situation warrants. The judges \nwho work with the child welfare system hold so much power in so many \nchildren's lives. We must continue to encourage their cooperation with \noutside stakeholders, including child welfare systems and court systems \nin other States, to quickly move these children to permanent homes. \nThere is no excuse for a child to languish in a system for months and \nsometimes years of their lives due to court inaction or delay.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their work and support of \nthese efforts. I am confident that we can work together to quickly pass \nthis legislation and put it to work for our Nation's children.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Today, I rise to join my colleagues Senators DeWine \nand Domenici to introduce the Safe and Timely Interstate Placement of \nFoster Children Act of 2006. This is a bipartisan initiative that I \nhave been working on for several years.\n  This legislation could help to deliver on the promises made in the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 which stated that geographic \nbarriers should not delay or deny adoptions. Unfortunately, data \ncontinues to suggest that it can take twice as long for a child to \nleave foster care to an out-of-state placement. When a child leaves \nfoster care and goes out of state, half of the time the child is being \nadopted and gaining a permanent home. In about twenty percent of the \ncases, a child is being placed with a parent or caretaker. These are \ngood, permanent options for children, and it should not take twice as \nlong to achieve such a placement.\n  This new legislation could provide incentives for States to process \nthese out-of-state claims more quickly. In my view, this complements \nand builds upon actions by many States to update the 1960 Interstate \nCompact for the Placement of Children. The purpose of this legislation \nis to add specific time-frames and to provide federal incentives to \nachieve the goal set in 1997 of reducing and eliminating geographic \nbarriers.\n  As technology has vastly improved, and more families seek to open \ntheir hearts and homes to children in foster care, we need improved \nregulations and policies to serve such families. This legislation is \npart of the DeWine-Rockefeller bill, called the ``We Care Kids Act''. \nThanks to the leadership of Chairman Grassley, the major provisions of \nWe Care Kids Act were included in the reconciliation package to invest \nin court training and data to help judges have insight and the \ninformation needed to care for the vulnerable children in foster care. \nBut action could not be taken to improve interstate case planning \nwithin the reconciliation bill. In 2004, similar legislation passed the \nHouse of Representatives. Today, we are re-introducing the legislation \nfor timely placements of children across state lines. Hopefully the \nSenate will act, and we can help children in foster care get a \npermanent home in a timely manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 3000. A bill to grant rights-of-way for electric transmission \nlines over certain Native allotments in the State of Alaska; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will resolve an ongoing dispute in our State concerning rights of \nway in the Copper River Valley region.\n  In 1906, Congress passed the Alaska Native Allotment Act, which \nallowed Alaska Natives to each claim up to 160 acres of land. Between \n1906 and 1970, Alaska Natives filed allotment applications. The \nmajority of these were filed\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\nin the late 1960s. In 1971, Congress repealed the Alaska Native \nAllotment Act as part of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. \nCongress then resolved all outstanding land claims by approving pending \napplications in the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation \nAct. This approval was subject to valid existing rights.\n  When it settled the outstanding land claims in our State, Congress \nunintentionally created an issue which is now the subject of several \nlawsuits. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Federal Government and the State \nof Alaska granted rights of way to the Copper Valley Electric \nAssociation to run power lines across areas in our State which were \nlater claimed by Alaska Natives. These rights were conveyed before \nAlaska Native allotment claims had been filed and processed.\n  Since outstanding land claims were approved through ANILCA in 1980, \nseveral Native allottees have come forward and claimed the Copper \nValley Electric Association is trespassing on their lands. In 1987, the \nInterior Board of Land Appeals affirmed this position, finding Native \nallotees have priority over other competing uses of land--in this case, \nthose of the utility company--regardless of the fact that the rights of \nway were granted prior to the conveyance of the property in question to \nthe allotees. This situation is still unresolved and has resulted in \nyears of litigation.\n  We have been unable to settle these disputes through existing \nremedies. These conflicts now jeopardize existing transportation and \nutility corridors. This issue threatens future infrastructure \ndevelopment in the region.\n  At my request, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, reviewed \nthis situation. The GAO issued its report and recommended solutions. \nThis bill incorporates the GAO's recommendation. It compensates the \nowners of the Native allotments, while ensuring that the utility \ncompanies are able to provide residents with the infrastructure and \nservices they need. I believe this is the most equitable solution \navailable, and I urge the Senate to pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3001. A bill to ensure that all electronic surveillance of United \nStates persons for foreign intelligence purposes is conducted pursuant \nto individualized court-issued orders, to streamline the procedures of \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and Enhancement Act of \n2006.\n  First, I would like to thank Senator Feinstein and her staff for \ntheir work on what I believe is an excellent and much needed proposal.\n  No one disputes that preserving our homeland must be our first \npriority. Without that, every other goal falls away. And no one can \ndispute that the enemy we face today is an enemy beyond negotiation. It \nis an enemy that believes it is on a mission from God to establish a \nworldwide theocracy and destroy all those who preach tolerance of other \nideas. It is an enemy that regards mercy as a moral failing, and \nproudly plays videotapes of its followers beheading innocent civilians.\n  At the same time, no one disputes that we must, in fighting to \npreserve America, ensure that we protect what is uniquely American--our \nway of life, our principles, and our belief in liberty. Throughout our \nhistory, we have balanced the need to protect our Nation with the need \nto preserve our freedom.\n  No one disputes that we must continue to achieve both of these ends. \nThe question is how to do so.\n  I believe that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and \nEnhancement Act goes a long way to answering this question. It is a \nresponsible bill that establishes a workable framework for the future.\n  This bill eliminates some artificial and outdated constraints in \nFISA:\n  It grants the executive branch 7 days, instead of 3 days, for seeking \nan emergency order--a change that the FISA judges who testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee advocated; it cuts through redtape by \nconfirming that applications for FISA orders may be made by delegees of \nthe Attorney General, such as the Deputy Attorney General and Assistant \nAttorney General of the National Security; it creates new emergency \nprovisions, allowing extended periods of surveillance in the event our \nNation is once again attacked; and it allocates additional personnel to \nDOJ to prepare applications for FISA orders in a prompt and timely \nmanner.\n  This bill also ensures that our civil liberties are protected by \nstrengthening oversight of the executive branch:\n  It eliminates the current ambiguity in FISA and the National Security \nAct of 1947, and makes it clear the executive branch must inform all \nmembers of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on all \nelectronic surveillance programs; it requires the executive branch to \nsubmit an additional report to the congressional Intelligence \nCommittees listing any recommendations for legislative or \nadministrative improvements in FISA, so that we in Congress can update \nFISA as needed; it establishes rigorous reporting requirements for the \nexercise of emergency surveillance powers; and it establishes a \ndocument management system to ensure that information concerning \nelectronic surveillance programs is readily available for review by the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court and Congress, to allow for \nshort term decisions and long-term accountability.\n  I do have one concern over the bill, a concern over \nconstitutionality. The bill states that the only way the President may \ncarry out electronic surveillance is through the procedures outlined in \nFISA or the Federal Criminal Code. During the four hearings I held in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, numerous scholars and five FISA judges \ncalled this provision into question. They testified that the President \nhas certain inherent powers that we in Congress cannot take away. They \nexplained that to the extent a bill purports to override the \nPresident's inherent powers, and tell the President that he may not use \nthem, the bill might be unconstitutional.\n  I think this is precisely the type of complex and weighty concern \nthat we should work out in the Judiciary Committee, through study, \nanalysis, and discussion. And I look forward to having those \ndiscussions with Senator Feinstein and the other members of the \ncommittee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nImprovement and Enhancement Act of 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. \n        Chafee):\n  S.J. Res. 37. A joint resolution granting the consent of Congress to \nthe International Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of \nUnderstanding; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleagues, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, \nthe senior Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, and Senator Chafee in \nintroducing this joint resolution, which would affirm the Senate's \ncommitment to recognize the International Emergency Management \nAssistance Compact, IEMAC. The purpose of IEMAC is to provide mutual \nassistance among the States of the Northeastern United States and the \nProvinces of eastern Canada for responding to any type of disaster, \nwhether arising from natural or manmade causes.\n  A number of recent disasters and emergencies have necessitated mutual \naid and assistance among the Northeastern States and eastern Canadian \nProvinces. For example, both the January 1998 ice storm and the August \n2003 blackout left millions of people without electrical power, knocked \nout public water supplies and other essential services, and caused \nbillions of dollars in property damage or business losses. In the past \nquarter century alone, there have been more than 100 presidentially \ndeclared disasters and emergencies in the Northeast, or, on average, \nabout four per year. Many of these events required State and Provincial \nemergency management organizations to request out-of- jurisdiction \nmutual assistance to deal with the emergency.\n  The importance of mutual assistance was made clear by Hurricane \nKatrina, in which 44 States and the District of\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\nColumbia received presidential emergency declarations. This was the \nlargest number of declarations ever made for a single disaster in FEMA \nhistory. Most of these declarations were not the result of States \nreceiving direct damage from the storm but rather because they reached \nout to assist the devastated States through the nationwide Emergency \nManagement Assistance Compact, EMAC, sending personnel, equipment and \nsupplies into the stricken areas. In addition, numerous host States \nopened shelters to assist hurricane evacuees.\n  The genesis of IEMAC was the 1998 ice storm. The worst ice storm in \nour region's history demolished power lines from Quebec, through \nupstate New York, across Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. As many as 4 \nmillion people were without electricity, some 700,000 people for as \nlong as 3 weeks, and damage topped $6 billion.\n  The following June, the New England Governors Conference and Eastern \nCanadian Premiers signed Resolution No. 23-5 to adopt an International \nEmergency Management Assistance Agreement. The resulting memorandum of \nunderstanding was adopted by the conference in July 2000. In October of \n2004, the memorandum of understanding was the renamed International \nEmergency Management Assistance Compact. The Governors and Premiers \nestablished the International Emergency-Management Group, IEMG, to \nimplement the compact and to work closely developing plans to train and \nexercise for disasters and emergencies that could affect the \nNortheastern States and Provinces. The Management Group meets regularly \nand has recently developed a draft operational manual to fully \nimplement the compact, which is slated to be approved at the IEMG \nmeeting in Quebec this month.\n  The members of the compact are the States of Maine, New Hampshire, \nVermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and the \nProvinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, \nand Newfoundland. Other States and Provinces may join the compact in \nthe future.\n  IEMAC provides form and structure to international mutual aid between \nthe Northeastern States and eastern Canadian Provinces. It addresses \nsuch issues as liability, payment, and credentialing before the \nemergency occurs, which allows for expedited deployment of resources \nand personnel in time of emergency. Working out the myriad legal and \ntechnical details in advance is especially important when resources and \npersonnel must cross international boundaries.\n  The value of the compact already has been demonstrated. When \nHurricane Juan slammed into Nova Scotia in late September of 2003, \npartners in the existing memorandum of understanding provided quick and \nsubstantial aid to the stricken province. When Nova Scotia, still \nrecovering from the hurricane, was hit again just a few months later by \n``White Juan,'' a powerful blizzard, effective mutual aid again \nalleviated the suffering.\n  The compact was formed in the aftermath of a powerful ice storm, but \nthe terrorist attacks of 9/11 amplified its importance. The \nNortheastern United States and eastern Canada are home to major \npopulation centers, vast industrial facilities, major cargo ports, and \nnuclear power plants--all potential terrorist targets. In the event of \nan attack, tighter border security would be both inevitable and \nnecessary, and the prearrangements made through the compact would be \ninvaluable.\n  The role of the compact is ever expanding. There are a multitude of \nthreats facing the Northeast States and eastern Canadian Provinces \ntoday, and the close working relationship of the member jurisdictions \nfosters a cooperative environment and creates a strong partnership. \nThese strong bonds contribute to the goals of a more secure region and \nan effective response capability when a disaster or emergency does \noccur.\n  As has been seen numerous times in the past, disasters know no \nboundaries--municipal, State, provincial or international. I ask you to \njoin me in adopting the International Emergency Management Assistance \nCompact so that in a time of disaster the boundaries that separate \njurisdictions are not barriers to cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 37\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL CONSENT.\n\n       Congress consents to the International Emergency Management \n     Assistance Memorandum of Understanding entered into between \n     the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, \n     Rhode Island, and Connecticut and the Provinces of Quebec, \n     New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and \n     Newfoundland. The compact is substantially as follows:\n\n     ``Article I--International Emergency Management Assistance \n       Memorandum of Understanding Purpose and Authorities\n\n       ``The International Emergency Management Assistance \n     Memorandum of Understanding, hereinafter referred to as the \n     `compact,' is made and entered into by and among such of the \n     jurisdictions as shall enact or adopt this compact, \n     hereinafter referred to as `party jurisdictions.' For the \n     purposes of this agreement, the term `jurisdictions' may \n     include any or all of the States of Maine, New Hampshire, \n     Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut and the \n     Provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, \n     Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and such other states and \n     provinces as may hereafter become a party to this compact.\n       ``The purpose of this compact is to provide for the \n     possibility of mutual assistance among the jurisdictions \n     entering into this compact in managing any emergency or \n     disaster when the affected jurisdiction or jurisdictions ask \n     for assistance, whether arising from natural disaster, \n     technological hazard, manmade disaster or civil emergency \n     aspects of resources shortages.\n       ``This compact also provides for the process of planning \n     mechanisms among the agencies responsible and for mutual \n     cooperation, including, if need be, emergency-related \n     exercises, testing, or other training activities using \n     equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect \n     of the giving and receiving of aid by party jurisdictions or \n     subdivisions of party jurisdictions during emergencies, with \n     such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency \n     periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the \n     use of emergency forces by mutual agreement among party \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     ``Article II--General Implementation\n\n       ``Each party jurisdiction entering into this compact \n     recognizes that many emergencies may exceed the capabilities \n     of a party jurisdiction and that intergovernmental \n     cooperation is essential in such circumstances. Each \n     jurisdiction further recognizes that there will be \n     emergencies that may require immediate access and present \n     procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and \n     effective response to such an emergency because few, if any, \n     individual jurisdictions have all the resources they need in \n     all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering \n     resources to areas where emergencies exist.\n       ``The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources \n     of the participating jurisdictions, including any resources \n     on hand or available from any other source that are essential \n     to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event \n     of any emergency or disaster, shall be the underlying \n     principle on which all articles of this compact are \n     understood.\n       ``On behalf of the party jurisdictions participating in the \n     compact, the legally designated official who is assigned \n     responsibility for emergency management is responsible for \n     formulation of the appropriate inter-jurisdictional mutual \n     aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact, \n     and for recommendations to the jurisdiction concerned with \n     respect to the amendment of any statutes, regulations, or \n     ordinances required for that purpose.\n\n     ``Article III--Party Jurisdiction Responsibilities\n\n       ``(a) Formulate Plans and Programs.--It is the \n     responsibility of each party jurisdiction to formulate \n     procedural plans and programs for inter-jurisdictional \n     cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed \n     in this section. In formulating and implementing such plans \n     and programs the party jurisdictions, to the extent \n     practical, shall--\n       ``(1) review individual jurisdiction hazards analyses that \n     are available and, to the extent reasonably possible, \n     determine all those potential emergencies the party \n     jurisdictions might jointly suffer, whether due to natural \n     disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster or \n     emergency aspects of resource shortages;\n       ``(2) initiate a process to review party jurisdictions' \n     individual emergency plans and develop a plan that will \n     determine the mechanism for the inter-jurisdictional \n     cooperation;\n       ``(3) develop inter-jurisdictional procedures to fill any \n     identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies \n     or overlaps in existing or developed plans;\n       ``(4) assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing \n     jurisdictional boundaries;\n       ``(5) protect and ensure delivery of services, medicines, \n     water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical \n     lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\n     and material to the extent authorized by law;\n       ``(6) inventory and agree upon procedures for the inter-\n     jurisdictional loan and delivery of human and material \n     resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or \n     forgiveness; and\n       ``(7) provide, to the extent authorized by law, for \n     temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances, over \n     which the province or state has jurisdiction, that impede the \n     implementation of the responsibilities described in this \n     subsection.\n       ``(b) Request Assistance.--The authorized representative of \n     a party jurisdiction may request assistance of another party \n     jurisdiction by contacting the authorized representative of \n     that jurisdiction. These provisions only apply to requests \n     for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. \n     Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request \n     must be confirmed in writing within 15 days of the verbal \n     request.

Each party jurisdiction \n     shall afford to the personnel of the emergency forces of any \n     party jurisdiction, while operating within its jurisdictional \n     limits under the terms and conditions of this compact and \n     under the operational control of an officer of the requesting \n     party, the same powers, duties, rights, privileges, and \n     immunities as are afforded similar or like forces of the \n     jurisdiction in which they are performing emergency services. \n     Emergency forces continue under the command and control of \n     their regular leaders, but the organizational units come \n     under the operational control of the emergency services \n     authorities of the jurisdiction receiving assistance. These \n     conditions may be activated, as needed, by the jurisdiction \n     that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of \n     exercises or training for mutual aid and continue as long as \n     the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the \n     emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources \n     remain in the receiving jurisdiction or jurisdictions, \n     whichever is longer. The receiving jurisdiction is \n     responsible for informing the assisting jurisdictions of the \n     specific moment when services will no longer be required.\n\n     ``Article V--Licenses and Permits\n\n       ``Whenever a person holds a license, certificate, or other \n     permit issued by any jurisdiction party to the compact \n     evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, \n     mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is \n     requested by the receiving party jurisdiction, such person is \n     deemed to be licensed, certified, or permitted by the \n     jurisdiction requesting assistance to render aid involving \n     such skill to meet an emergency or disaster, subject to such \n     limitations and conditions as the requesting jurisdiction \n     prescribes by Executive order or otherwise.\n\n     ``Article VI--Liability\n\n       ``Any person or entity of a party jurisdiction rendering \n     aid in another jurisdiction pursuant to this compact are \n     considered agents of the requesting jurisdiction for tort \n     liability and immunity purposes.

Good faith in this article \n     does not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or \n     recklessness.\n\n     ``Article VII--Supplementary Agreements\n\n       ``Because it is probable that the pattern and detail of the \n     machinery for mutual aid among 2 or more jurisdictions may \n     differ from that among the jurisdictions that are party to \n     this compact, this compact contains elements of a broad base \n     common to all jurisdictions, and nothing in this compact \n     precludes any jurisdiction from entering into supplementary \n     agreements with another jurisdiction or affects any other \n     agreements already in force among jurisdictions. \n     Supplementary agreements may include, but are not limited to, \n     provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other \n     persons and the exchange of medical, fire, public utility, \n     reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications \n     personnel, equipment, and supplies.\n\n     ``Article VIII--Workers' Compensation and Death Benefits\n\n       ``Each party jurisdiction shall provide, in accordance with \n     its own laws, for the payment of workers' compensation and \n     death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of \n     that jurisdiction and to representatives of deceased members \n     of those forces if the members sustain injuries or are killed \n     while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same \n     manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were \n     sustained within their own jurisdiction.\n\n     ``Article IX--Reimbursement\n\n       ``Any party jurisdiction rendering aid in another \n     jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall, if requested, be \n     reimbursed by the party jurisdiction receiving such aid for \n     any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in, the operation \n     of any equipment and the provision of any service in \n     answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in \n     connection with those requests.

Res. 491\n\n       Whereas Ignacy Jan Paderewski, born in Poland in 1860, was \n     a brilliant and popular\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\n     pianist who performed hundreds of concerts in Europe and the \n     United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries;\n       Whereas Paderewski donated the bulk of the proceeds of his \n     concerts to charitable causes, including the establishment of \n     the American Legion's Orphans and Veterans Fund;\n       Whereas, during World War I, Paderewski worked for the \n     independence of Poland and served as the first Premier of \n     Poland;\n       Whereas, in December 1919, Paderewski resigned as Premier \n     of Poland, and in 1921 he left politics to return to his \n     music;\n       Whereas the German invasion of Poland in 1939 spurred \n     Paderewski to return to political life;\n       Whereas Paderewski fought against the Nazi dictatorship in \n     World War II by joining the exiled Polish Government to \n     mobilize the Polish forces and to urge the United States to \n     join the Allied Forces;\n       Whereas, on June 29, 1941, Paderewski died in exile in the \n     United States while all of Europe was imperiled by war and \n     occupation;\n       Whereas, by the direction of President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt, the remains of Paderewski were placed alongside \n     the honored dead of the United States in Arlington National \n     Cemetery, where President Roosevelt said, ``He may lie there \n     until Poland is free.'';\n       Whereas, in 1963, President John F. Kennedy honored \n     Paderewski by placing a plaque marking his remains at the \n     Mast of the Maine at Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas, in 1992, President George H.W.

Mr. President, on behalf of my colleagues Senators \nMikulski, Durbin, Murkowski, and Voinovich, I rise to submit a \nresolution recognizing the accomplishments of Ignacy Jan Paderewski on \nthe 65th anniversary of his death on June 29, 1941.\n  Born in Poland in 1860, Paderewski is remembered for his \ncontributions as a musician, philanthropist, statesman, and as one of \nthe great men of his time. Paderewski was a brilliant and popular \npianist who performed hundreds of concerts in Europe and the United \nStates during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, donating the \nproceeds to numerous charitable causes. During World War I, Paderewski \nplayed a central role in helping achieve Poland's independence, serving \nas the first Premier of Poland from 1919 until 1922, when he left \npolitics and returned to music.\n  The German invasion of Poland in 1939 spurred Paderewski to return to \npolitics where he fought against Nazi Germany in World War II and \njoined the exiled Polish Government, where he helped mobilize Polish \nforces against the Nazis.\n  Paderewski died in 1941. At the direction of President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt, Paderewski's remains were placed alongside America's honored \ndead in Arlington National Cemetery. He did not live to see the U.S. \nand Allied Forces free Europe from the tyranny of Nazi control. \nPaderewski's legacy inspired movements throughout Europe, including \nSolidarity in Poland.\n  In 1992, Solidarity Leader Lech Walesa, the first democratically \nelected President of Poland since World War II, asked U.S. President \nGeorge H.W. Bush to return Paderewski's remains to his native homeland. \nOn July 5, 1992, Paderewski's remains were interred in a crypt at the \nSt. John Cathedral in Warsaw, Poland.\n  Mr. President, Ignacy Jan Paderewski's life and legacy is testimony \nto the enduring bonds between the United States and Poland. As we near \nthe 65th anniversary of Paderewski's death on June 29, 1941, my \ncolleagues and I are honored to submit this resolution honoring Ignacy \nJan Paderewski and ask that it be appropriately referred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5124-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5124-S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 492--TO AMEND THE STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE TO \n  PROHIBIT MEMBER FROM USING CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS FOR PERSONAL GAIN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

(a) A Member of the Senate shall not use for personal \n     or political gain any organization--\n       ``(1) which is described in section 501(c)(3) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under \n     section 501(a) of such Code; and\n       ``(2) the affairs over which such Member or the spouse of \n     such Member is in a position to exercise substantial \n     influence.\n       ``(b) For purposes of this paragraph, a Member of the \n     Senate shall be considered to have used an organization \n     described in subparagraph (a) for personal or political gain \n     if--\n       ``(1) a member of the family (within the meaning of section \n     4946(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) of the Member \n     is employed by the organization;\n       ``(2) any of the Member's staff is employed by the \n     organization;\n       ``(3) an individual or firm that receives money from the \n     Member's campaign committee or a political committee \n     established, maintained, or controlled by the Member serves \n     in a paid capacity with or receives a payment from the \n     organization;\n       ``(4) the organization pays for travel or lodging costs \n     incurred by the Member for a trip on which the Member also \n     engages in political fundraising activities; or\n       ``(5) another organization that receives support from such \n     organization pays for travel or lodging costs incurred by the \n     Member.\n       ``(c)(1) A Member of the Senate and any employee on the \n     staff of a Member to which paragraph 9(c) applies shall \n     disclose to the Secretary of the Senate the identity of any \n     person who makes an applicable contribution and the amount of \n     any such contribution.\n       ``(2) For purposes of this subparagraph, an applicable \n     contribution is a contribution--\n       ``(A) which is to an organization described in subparagraph \n     (a);\n       ``(B) which is over $200; and\n       ``(C) of which such Member or employee, as the case may be, \n     knows.\n       ``(3) The disclosure under this subparagraph shall be made \n     not later than 6 months after the date on which such Member \n     or employee first knows of the applicable contribution.\n       ``(4) The Secretary of the Senate shall make available to \n     the public all disclosures filed pursuant to this \n     subparagraph as soon as possible after they are received.\n       ``(d)(1) The Select Committee on Ethics may grant a waiver \n     to any Member with respect to the application of this \n     paragraph in the case of an organization which is described \n     in subparagraph (a)(1) and the affairs over which the spouse \n     of the Member, but not the Member, is in a position to \n     exercise substantial influence.\n       ``(2) In granting a waiver under this subparagraph, the \n     Select Committee on Ethics shall consider all the facts and \n     circumstances relating to the relationship between the Member \n     and the organization, including--\n       ``(A) the independence of the Member from the organization;\n       ``(B) the degree to which the organization receives \n     contributions from multiple sources not affiliated with the \n     Member;\n       ``(C) the risk of abuse; and\n       ``(D) whether the organization was formed prior to and \n     separately from such spouse's involvement with the \n     organization.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on January 1, 2007.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting aims to \nensure that charities under the control of Senators can be viewed in \nthe most ethical terms.\n  Mahatma Gandhi once said: ``Men say that I am a saint losing myself \nin politics. The fact is that I am a politician trying my hardest to be \na saint.''\n  That sums up the purpose of my resolution. We in the Senate run for \noffice to do good. We try to make the country better. We try to serve. \nWe strive to do the right thing.\n  As much as we try, however, even innocent gestures can be perceived \nas self-serving, or at worst, unethical.\n  Some of us have started charities that we believe help to serve our \ncountry and important public needs.\n  Senators may innocently employ staff who they trust at the charity. \nSenators may use lawyers who they are familiar with to ensure that \nrequirements are met. Senators may accept\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\ncontributions from corporations because the funds will be spent on a \nworthy cause.\n  The activities that I have listed may betray nothing more than an \ninnocent effort to carry out charitable works. But the public has a \nright to be skeptical. The public has a right to know what companies--\nthat may or may not have business before the Senate--are donating to \ncharities controlled by Senators.\n  My resolution would not ban Senators from starting charities. But it \nwould address the healthy skepticism that the public has expressed \nabout the rules governing charities controlled by Members of Congress.\n  As the Washington Post noted in an editorial on Tuesday, March 7 \n``[W]hen lawmakers have a personal interest in the charity, the \nopportunities for abuse are greatly magnified.''\n  Because of the potential for abuse, and because of the perception of \nabuse, I believe that rules governing charities controlled by Senators \nshould be ``greatly magnified.''\n  I am glad that the bill reported by the Homeland Security Committee \ntakes a step to provide more disclosure in this area. The Homeland \nSecurity Committee bill would require disclosure of gifts by lobbyists \nto charities controlled by Members of Congress.\n  This is a good first step, but I think we can do better.\n  My resolution would do the following: First, it would require that \nany gift over $200 to a charity substantially influenced by a Senator \nbe disclosed if the Senator or their senior staff are aware of the \ngift. While disclosing gifts from lobbyists is important, it is equally \nimperative that gifts from corporations and individuals are also \ndisclosed.\n  Second, my resolution prohibits Senators from using a charity they \nsubstantially influence for what can be perceived as their personal \ngain.\n  How does the resolution do this? Under Senate Rule XXXVII, concerning \nconflicts of interest, a Senator would be barred from deriving personal \ngain from a charity that they substantially influence.\n  The resolution defines personal gain in the following way: (1) When a \nSenator or their family member is employed by the charity in a paid \ncapacity (2) When a member of the Senator's staff is employed by the \ncharity in a paid capacity (3) When an individual or firm that receives \nincome from the Senator's political action committee serves in a paid \ncapacity to the charity (4) When the charity pays for travel or lodging \ncosts by the Senator on a trip where the Senator also engages in \npolitical fund raising (5) And, finally, when another charity receives \npayment from the Senator's charity to pay for the Senator's travel and \nlodging.\n  In vetting this proposal, I have heard concerns that prohibition on a \nSenator's family serving in a paid capacity of a charity they \nsubstantially influence may be too broad. The example of my friend \nSenator Elizabeth Dole is raised. When her husband, Senator Bob Dole \nserved as our distinguished majority leader, Senator Elizabeth Dole \nserved as the president of the American Red Cross. The purpose of my \nresolution is not to clamp down on this from occurring.\n  That is why my resolution would allow Senators to seek a waiver from \nthe Senate Ethics Committee when a family member has substantial \ninfluence over a charity, and the family member's influence over the \ncharity clearly does not provide any benefit to the Senator.\n  I know that some Senators may argue that more rules do not ensure \nethical conduct. That is true. Every Senator is responsible for \nbehaving ethically. My resolution will not automatically make unethical \narrangements ethical. Nor should the resolution be viewed as a \nstatement on the ethical conduct of members that currently maintain and \ncontrol charities. As Ecclesiastes chapter 3, verse 17 says, ``God \nshall judge the righteous and the wicked.''\n  My resolution simply aims to do better--to give the public confidence \nthat when a Senator starts a charitable organization it is for \ncharitable purposes. It is to fulfill the commandment expressed in \nDeuteronomy that ``Every man shall give as he is able. ``\n  My resolution has been endorsed by the watchdog groups Public Citizen \nand the National Committee on Responsive Philanthropy.\n  I urge the Senate to support my resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5125-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5125-S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 493--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM \n TO ESTABLISH IMMEDIATELY A FULL, INDEPENDENT, PUBLIC JUDICIAL INQUIRY \n INTO THE MURDER OF NORTHERN IRELAND DEFENSE ATTORNEY PAT FINUCANE, AS \n RECOMMENDED BY INTERNATIONAL JUDGE PETER CORY AS PART OF THE WESTERN \nPARK AGREEMENT AND A WAY FORWARD FOR THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n       Whereas human rights defense attorney and solicitor Patrick \n     Finucane was brutally murdered in front of his wife and \n     children at his home in Belfast on February 12, 1989;\n       Whereas numerous international bodies and nongovernmental \n     human rights organizations have made note of serious \n     allegations of collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and \n     British security forces in the murder of Mr. Finucane;\n       Whereas, in July 2001, the Irish and British Governments \n     made new commitments in the Weston Park Agreement to hold \n     public inquiries into high profile murders if the Honorable \n     Judge Peter Cory recommended such action, and both \n     governments understood that such an inquiry would be held \n     under the United Kingdom Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act \n     1921;\n       Whereas Judge Cory found sufficient evidence of collusion \n     to warrant a public inquiry into the murder of Patrick \n     Finucane and recommended that such an inquiry take place \n     without delay;\n       Whereas, in his conclusions, Judge Cory set out the \n     necessity and importance of a public inquiry into the \n     Finucane case and that the failure to hold a public inquiry \n     as soon as reasonably possible could be seen as a denial of \n     the agreement at Weston Park;\n       Whereas, on May 6, 2004, Judge Cory testified in Congress \n     before the United States Helsinki Commission and presented \n     his report, which is replete with evidence of possible \n     collusion relating to activities of the army intelligence \n     unit and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in the Finucane \n     case;\n       Whereas the United Kingdom adopted new legislation after \n     the public release of the Cory Report, the United Kingdom \n     Inquiries Act of 2005, which severely limits the procedures \n     of an independent inquiry and which has been rejected as \n     inadequate by Judge Cory, the Finucane family, the Irish \n     Government, and human rights groups;\n       Whereas, on March 15, 2005, Judge Cory submitted written \n     testimony to the Committee on International Relations of the \n     United States House of Representatives stating that the new \n     legislation is ``unfortunate to say the least'' and ``would \n     make a meaningful inquiry impossible'';\n       Whereas the written statement of Judge Cory also stated \n     that his recommendation for a public inquiry into the \n     Finucane case ``contemplated a true public inquiry \n     constituted and acting pursuant to the provisions of the 1921 \n     Act'' and not the United Kingdom Inquiries Act of 2005;\n       Whereas section 701 of the Foreign Relations Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) and House \n     Resolution 128, 106th Congress, agreed to April 20, 1999, \n     support the establishment of an independent, judicial inquiry \n     into the murder of Patrick Finucane; and\n       Whereas the Senate expresses deep regret with respect to \n     the British Government's failure to honor its commitment to \n     implement recommendation of Judge Cory in full: Now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Finucane family, wife Geraldine and son \n     Michael, who have testified 5 times before the United States \n     Congress (Geraldine in 2000, 2004, and 2005 and Michael in \n     1997 and 1999), for their courageous campaign to seek the \n     truth in this case of collusion;\n       (2) welcomes the passage of a resolution by the Dail \n     Eireann on March 8, 2006, calling for the establishment of a \n     full, independent, public judicial inquiry into the murder of \n     Patrick Finucane as the most recent expression of support for \n     the Finucane family by the Government of Ireland;\n       (3) acknowledges the United States Helsinki Commission \n     charged with human rights monitoring for their work in \n     highlighting this case;\n       (4) supports the efforts of the Honorable Mitchell Reiss, \n     special envoy of President Bush for the Northern Ireland \n     Peace Process, in pushing for the full implementation of the \n     Weston Park Agreement and the establishment of an \n     independent, judicial inquiry into the murder of Patrick \n     Finucane; and\n       (5) calls on the Government of the United Kingdom--\n       (A) to reconsider its position on the Finucane case to take \n     full account of the objections of the family of Patrick \n     Finucane, Judge Cory, officials of the United States\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\n     Government, other governments, and international bodies, and \n     amend the United Kingdom Inquiries Act of 2005; and\n       (B) to establish immediately a full, independent, public \n     judicial inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane, as \n     recommended by Judge Cory, which would enjoy the full \n     cooperation of the family of Patrick Finucane and the wider \n     community throughout Ireland and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5126-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4183.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5037, which was just \nreceived from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5037) to amend titles 38 and 18 of the United \n     States Code to prohibit certain demonstrations at cemeteries \n     under the control of the National Cemetery Administration and \n     at Arlington National Cemetery, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on an \namendment I am offering with Senators Inhofe and Frist to H.R. 5037, \nthe ``Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act. H.R. 5037 passed the \nHouse a couple of weeks ago by an overwhelming margin--408 to 3. It was \nconceived in response to hateful, intolerant demonstrations taking \nplace at the funeral services of deceased servicemembers of the global \nwar on terror. The fringe group responsible for these demonstrations \nbelieves that 2,752 of our Nation's finest have lost their lives in \ndefense of America because, unbelievably, God is exacting His revenge \non the United States for its permissive laws respecting homosexuality. \nIt is a sad irony that the same 2,752 servicemembers who fought to \nguarantee the right of this fringe group to hold and express their \nbeliefs are, along with the families of deceased servicemembers, now \nthe victims of those same hateful, but protected, ideas.\n  First, it is important to point out that the House, led by \nRepresentative Mike Rogers of Michigan and Chairman Buyer, went to \ngreat lengths to carefully craft the House-passed legislation to \npreserve the dignity of military funerals while at the same time \nbalancing first amendment rights. I applaud them, and Senator Jim \nInhofe, the original sponsor of the Senate version of the bill, for \nbeing proactive in addressing a problem that no military family should \nexperience at a VA national cemetery or at Arlington National Cemetery. \nLet me describe in brief the many provisions of their legislation that \nare left untouched by this amendment. We retain the prohibition on \nunapproved demonstrations on VA or Arlington cemetery grounds. We \nretain the language used to describe exactly what kind of \ndemonstrations are prohibited. We retain the criminal penalties \nattached to those who violate the prohibitions. And we retain the \nlanguage expressing the sense of the Congress that States enact \nlegislation to restrict demonstrations near any military funeral. My \namendment would only modify the language of the underlying bill that \nrestricts demonstrations that are within 500 feet of cemetery property. \nLet me explain why.\n  Many VA cemeteries are tucked in the middle of residential \nneighborhoods. Thus, the reach of the proposed Federal law in the \nunderlying bill would extend to all private residences located within \n500 feet of any VA cemetery property or Arlington National Cemetery. I \nam always sensitive to expanding zones of Federal influence or \nregulation, especially to cover lands that are not its own, unless it \nis absolutely necessary. And, furthermore, in a report by the \nCongressional Research Service and analyses from constitutional law \nexperts, it was concluded that a 500-foot buffer zone around the \nperimeter of all cemetery lands may not be sufficiently narrow to pass \nconstitutional muster. Constitutional questions surrounding the \nlanguage are, of course, open to debate. But my goal here was to move \nlegislation that was as narrowly tailored as possible and that didn't \ntake away any of its effectiveness in prohibiting these offensive \ndemonstrations at our national shrines.\n  There have yet to be any unapproved demonstrations either on VA \ncemetery property or outside of its grounds. There have been \ndemonstrations at Arlington National Cemetery, but those demonstrations \nhave been limited to the gates outside the front entrance of the \ncemetery. Practically speaking, if there were to be any demonstrations \nat VA cemeteries they would likely be at cemetery access points, just \nas at Arlington. It is VA's policy to hold funeral ceremonies at \ncommittal shelters located on its cemetery grounds. By design, those \nshelters at open national cemeteries are a minimum of 300 feet from any \nproperty line. And the line of sight from the property line is, also by \ndesign, typically obstructed by trees, shrubs, or other foliage. In \naddition, each national cemetery has three or four committal shelters, \non average, which could be used for ceremonies. According to VA \nofficials, only the cemetery superintendent knows beforehand where the \ncommittal shelter to be used for a particular funeral ceremony is \nlocated. So it is unlikely that demonstrators could effectively \n``disrupt'' a cemetery funeral ceremony at any point other than an \naccess point when a funeral procession was entering or leaving cemetery \ngrounds. There simply are too many distance, visual, and logistical \nobstructions to overcome.\n  Therefore, my amendment would do the following. It would prohibit \nindividuals who, as part of any demonstration, and within 150 feet of \nany point of ingress to or egress from cemetery property, be it by \nroad, pathway, or otherwise, willfully make, or assist in the making, \nof any noise or diversion that disturbs or tends to disturb the peace \nor good order of a funeral, memorial service, or ceremony. This \nlanguage will ensure that as a funeral procession is entering or \nexiting any cemetery that there is sufficient distance between the \nprocession and the demonstrators, and that no slowdown of the \nprocession is precipitated by a large gathering of demonstrators near \nthe gates of cemetery property. Furthermore, my amendment would \nprohibit any demonstration, irrespective of its character, that is \nwithin 300 feet of cemetery property that would impede access to or \negress from the property.\n  The principles behind my amendment are simple: As a funeral \nprocession approaches a national cemetery, there should be no \nobstruction of that procession for any reason. The closer the \nprocession is to the gates of the cemetery, the tighter the \nrestrictions on demonstrations should necessarily be to ensure a \ndignified, solemn, and respectful burial at our national shrines.\n  Again, I thank Representative Rogers of Michigan and Senator Inhofe \nfor their leadership on this issue. And I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4187) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to, \nas follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON STATE RESTRICTION OF \n                   DEMONSTRATIONS NEAR MILITARY FUNERALS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that each State should enact \n     legislation to restrict demonstrations near any military \n     funeral.\n\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 5037), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the bill we just passed was the Respect for \nAmerica's Fallen Heroes Act. I would like to comment briefly, and I \nexpress my thanks to my colleagues for allowing me to proceed with this \nlegislation and interrupt their debate.\n  I would like to read briefly from a news report that appeared in the \nChicago Tribune this past April. And I quote:\n\n       Army Private First Class Amy Duerksen was 19 when she died \n     last month in a U.S. military surgical hospital in Baghdad, 3 \n     days after being shot in an accident. By all the accounts of \n     her family, friends and superiors, she had been a model \n     soldier, an impassioned patriot and a deeply devout \n     Christian.\n       But none of that mattered to the six members of the \n     Westboro Baptist Church who drove all night from their \n     headquarters in Topeka, KS to show up outside Duerksen's \n     March 17th funeral waving hateful placards.\n\n  I will not sully this institution or the memory of Amy Duerksen by \nrepeating this group's detestable message. But I will tell you that \ntoday the Senate unanimously passed the Respect for America's Fallen \nHeroes Act, originally introduced by Congressman Mike Rogers of \nMichigan and passed in the House with near unanimous support.\n  Here in the Senate, we agreed, as one, that families like the \nDuerksens should never have to be harassed by protesters of any stripe \nas they bury their fallen warriors.\n  The Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act will protect the sanctity \nof all 122 of our national cemeteries as shrines to our gallant dead.\n  It will ban demonstrations that occur within 500 feet of the cemetery \nwithout prior approval from an hour before a funeral until an hour \nafter it. Violators will be fined up to $100,000 and spend a year in \njail.\n  It's a sad but necessary measure to protect what should be recognized \nby all reasonable people as a solemn, private, and deeply sacred \noccasion.\n  The bill has been carefully crafted to meet constitutional muster. As \neven the ACLU acknowledges, ``The right of free expression is not an \nabsolute right to express ourselves at any time, in any place, in any \nmanner.''\n  And as the courts have identified, our national cemeteries are places \ndeserving of the respect and honor of those interred or memorialized.\n  I thank Congressman Rogers for bringing this issue to our attention. \nAnd I conclude with a passage from the Bible:\n\n       Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. \n     Matthew 5:4.\n\n  We may never understand what compels a small group of small minded \nand mean hearted people to harass a family in mourning. But that is not \nour responsibility here. Our duty is to protect the solemn right of our \nmilitary families to grieve the loss of America's fallen heroes in \nprivate, with the respect and dignity that is their due.\n  I look forward to this bill reaching the President's desk and being \nsigned into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5130-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5130-S5134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PUEBLO DE SAN ILDEFONSO CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, in the morning we will work toward passage \nof the immigration bill. We have our final amendment list lined up. We \nwill likely debate the amendments and stack them together very early in \nthe afternoon. I do anticipate passage of the bill by early afternoon \nfollowing those votes.\n  Following passage of this comprehensive immigration bill, we will \nproceed to the cloture vote on the Kavanaugh nomination. I filed \ncloture the night before last. We are attempting to reach a time \nagreement on the Hayden nomination. I feel strongly we need to complete \naction on the Hayden nomination before we leave. It is an important \nposition, General Hayden being the right man for this position at a \nvery important time in our history. We also have the Portman nomination \nfor OMB and the Schwab nomination at the USTR to clear this week, as \nwell. It is my goal to reach an agreement with the other side of the \naisle as to when we might be able to bring him to the Senate.\n  Finally, I mention that I filed a cloture motion on the nomination of \nour former colleague, Dirk Kempthorne, to be Secretary of the Interior. \nI have tried over the course of the day, to no avail, to be able to \nbring that to a vote and was unable to do so with an objection on the \nother side of the aisle. I have filed cloture tonight. This vote will \noccur on Friday.\n  We end Wednesday, at a late hour, having had a very productive day \ntoday, very productive day yesterday, really, this whole week. I \nappreciate the collegial approach our colleagues have taken in allowing \namendments to come forward, to be debated, thoroughly debated, \ndiscussed and voted upon. We set out on this immigration bill well over \na month ago. We had a hiatus over the recess, came back and in a very \nbipartisan spirit had an agreement to proceed to consider votes with \nthese amendments and have the votes taken.\n  We have had huge progress. The debate has been very good. Everyone \nhas participated in that debate. Everyone has had the opportunity to \nsubmit amendments and have them debated.\n  With that, we have progressed in our understanding of both the \nimportance of this bill but also the importance of having a \ncomprehensive solution to the challenges we face, with 12 million \npeople here illegally, the need, absolute necessity of having a strong \ntemporary worker program in this country for economic reasons and \nemployment reasons and then, first and foremost, sealing our borders, \nlocking down our borders in the sense we can have legal immigration and \nnot illegal immigration coming across at ports of entry.\n  I have been very pleased with the debate. It has been very tough, \nvery challenging, for a number of our Members. There is no consensus in \nthe sense that everyone has gotten exactly what they wanted, but I will \nbe absolutely satisfied with this bill as a reflection of the will of \n100 Senators, the will of this Senate after this very long time in the \nSenate but very good and productive time where so many amendments have \nbeen considered.\n  We will complete the bill tomorrow. I expect the bill to pass \ntomorrow. I can't predict what the final outcome will be, but I think \nit will reflect this very open, free, deliberate process we have seen \nover the last several weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/24/senate-section/article/S5134-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:15 A.M.
