Mr. President, I am rising to discuss the budget as \npresented yesterday to the U.S. Congress and to the American people by \nthe President of the United States. Let me begin by saying I think the \nPresident has been courageous. He has stepped forward and addressed \nsome of the most critical problems that we have as a nation, one of \nthem being the fact that we are running excessive deficits, another one \nbeing the proper prioritization of our spending in a time of fiscal \nrestraint. It is appropriate, as the President has proposed, that we \nreturn to a period of fiscal restraint so that we do not end up passing \non to our children massive amounts of debt, and so that we can assure \nthe international community and our own people that we are going to \nlive in a fiscally responsible way as a Government. That is what the \nPresident's budget has proposed.\n  I think it is important, before we address the specifics of the \nbudget, to talk a little bit about the context in which this budget is \nsent to us. Remember, when this President took office we were headed \ninto a fairly significant recession. It was a recession that had arisen \nout of the most rapid economic expansion in our history. It was called \na bubble, and was appropriately defined as a bubble, the Internet \nbubble of the late 1990s. When that bubble broke, it was very likely \nand it would be historically consistent if we had gone into an \nextraordinarily deep recession. But the President of the United States \nhad the foresight at the beginning of the recession to propose to the \nCongress, and the Congress supported it, a fairly significant tax cut \nwhich was able to shallow out the recession. That is the classic \napproach to addressing a recession, in trying to move out of recession: \ncut taxes so you create more economic activity. You leave more revenues \nat home with the people, allow them to spend more of their own money, \nand as a result you come out of the recession more quickly. And that is \nexactly what happened.\n  Today we are seeing a robust recovery. We are seeing a very low \njobless\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\nrate. I think it is down to 5.2 percent, in fact. Even though there was \na significant revenue reduction, a tax cut in the first term of this \nPresidency, we are now seeing revenues growing at an extremely robust \nrate: Last year, 9.2 percent, this year they are going to grow by 6.5 \npercent, it is projected next year at 7 percent, and so on into the \nfuture. As a result of his economic policies, we are seeing a recovery.\n  In addition to being confronted with a recession, he was, of course, \nconfronted with the fact that the United States was attacked, attacked \nmercilessly by evil people. The damage caused by that attack was not \nonly personal loss, which was dramatic and obviously horrible, but it \nwas also economic loss, having a significant impact on our economy and, \nas a result, causing us in the Federal budget to specifically have to \nspend a lot of money we hadn't anticipated spending fighting the war, \nand also having an impact on our revenues as a Federal Government.\n  The President has been prosecuting this war against terrorism in an \nextremely aggressive and appropriate way and the results are pretty \nobvious. We have not been attacked, now, for almost 3 years. We invaded \nIraq to change a totalitarian, despotic regime, and we have been \nsuccessful there. We have seen an extraordinary event there, the \nelections which just occurred. Afghanistan is on the road to democracy. \nThe success in the war on terror cannot be denied. We are making \nsignificant progress, but it is still a war we need to fight and we \nneed to expend considerable resources to accomplish that. So there has \nbeen this dual pressure put on our Federal Government: first a \nrecession, and, second, fighting a war on terror that had not been \nanticipated when this President came into office but has been well \nhandled by this President since he has been in office.\n\n  As a result, we now confront some significant fiscal questions that \nwe must address. Having put in place the tax cut, which has caused very \nstrong economic recovery and which is starting to show significant \nrevenue increases, and having pursued a course of fighting a war that \nhas cost us a great deal of money, we now must make decisions on how we \nproperly balance our fiscal house in Washington. The President has \nsuggested we do that essentially by looking at all functions of the \nFederal Government and trying to address them in a comprehensive, \nthoughtful way, and at the same time in a fiscally responsible way.\n  There are two issues we confront in the area of fiscal \nresponsibility. The first, of course, is the short-term deficit. How do \nwe get this deficit down? How do we reduce its size so we do not end up \ntaking bills that we are incurring today and passing those bills on to \nour children to pay tomorrow. The President has put forward a budget \nthat reduces the deficit in half over the next 4 to 5 years. That is an \nextremely aggressive timetable, but it is one which is very doable. The \nPresident has put forward an aggressive and effective outline to \naccomplish that.\n  The second thing this administration has proposed is to address the \noutyear issue, which is even a bigger problem for us as a nation. This \nis a function of the huge population in this country called the baby \nboom population. We are going to see a massive shift in the \ndemographics of this country. Beginning in the year 2008, the baby boom \npopulation will start to retire. It is the biggest population segment \nof our society, and the pressure that it will put on the systems that \nsupport our retirement, people who are in retirement, will be dramatic, \nboth in the area of Social Security and in the area of health care.\n  As a nation we have had a very strong commitment to senior citizens, \never since the days of FDR. We can take great pride in the success of \nthat commitment, and we intend to continue that commitment, but the \nwhole genius of the Social Security system, and to a large degree the \nMedicare and Medicaid system, was the concept it would always be a \npyramid; that there would always be a lot more people working than \nwould be those taking out of the system; that there would be many \npeople paying into the system to support individuals who are on \nretirement.\n  In 1950, for example, there were 12 people paying into the Social \nSecurity system for every 1 retired person supported by that system. \nToday it is about 3.5 persons paying into the retirement system for \nevery 1 taking out of that system. But because of the size of the baby \nboom generation, beginning in the year 2008 those numbers change \ndramatically, and by 2016 there will only be 2 people paying into the \nsystem for every 1 taking out, and we go from a pyramid to essentially \na rectangle and it is simply not supportable in its present form.\n  The practical effect of that is that those children who will be \nworking, our children and our grandchildren whom we want to see have a \nbetter lifestyle, those two people will have to pay a much higher \nburden of taxation in order to support that one person who is retired \nunless we do something about that, unless we address that issue.\n\n  So the issue is, do we want to pass on to our children a system that \nwe know will not work, or that we know will put them in a position \nwhere they have to pay so much in taxes that their lifestyle will be \nless favorable than ours has been or will we address this issue today \nand start to get ready for that retirement boom, that large demographic \nshift, and as a result taking the burden off our children and \ngrandchildren to a certain degree and assuring them that they also have \na retirement system that works?\n  The President has not only suggested a budget which in the short term \naddresses the deficit by reducing it by half over 4 years, as I \nmentioned, he has also stepped forward on this critical issue and \nsuggested we do need to address these major entitlement programs. And \nhe has made proposals in the area of Social Security that have been \nhotly debated here and that will continue, obviously, to be a subject \nof considerable consideration.\n  In this budget he has specifically addressed the issue of entitlement \nspending, especially in the area of health care and Medicaid, and in a \nnumber of other areas such as agriculture. It is those entitlement \nprograms which we as a Congress have an obligation to try to fix today \nso that they do not end up bankrupting our children and our children's \nchildren tomorrow.\n  The importance of this is highlighted by this chart behind me, the \neffect of entitlements on the spending of the Federal Government. If \nyou look at this chart, the orange line is entitlement spending, the \nyellow line is defense spending, the red line is nondefense \ndiscretionary spending, and the bright red line is interest.\n  You can see that in the year 2000, entitlement spending was about 55 \npercent of the Federal budget. This year it will be about 56 percent. \nBy the year 2015 it will be 64 percent of the Federal budget. As a \nresult, it will essentially absorb all the revenues of the Federal \nbudget--all the revenues of the Federal budget--unless we address these \nprograms today so we have them in order so they do not put that type of \npressure on our Federal budget and on our children who have to pay the \ncosts of that budget through their tax burden in the future. That is \nwhy reforming Social Security is so important. It is why this budget is \nsuch a positive step, a step in the right direction toward reforming \nthe way we, as the Federal Government, operate. That is why I \ncongratulate the President for it.\n  What the President has proposed is essentially a budget which, for \nlack of a better term, gores everybody's ox. He essentially has said: \nListen, if we are going to get our fiscal house in order, we can have \nno sacred cows. Everybody's programs have to be on the table. We have \nto look at every program and prioritize in those programs. Yes, there \nis a significant increase in defense spending, but the increase in the \ndefense spending is not as great as it had been projected it would be. \nIn other words, the President has looked at the base, the defense \nspending base, and actually reduced that. If you don't believe me--you \ndon't have to believe me on that. All you have to do is listen to some \nof the folks outside this building who advocate defense spending for \nprograms they support. We are already hearing from a number of defense \ncontractors, a number of people in the activity of supporting the \nDefense Department, that their contracts are being impacted because the \ndefense budget has been reduced from what it was projected to be.\n  The President has put defense on the table. Obviously, he has put \nnondefense\n\n[[Page S1069]]\n\ndiscretionary on the table; that is, all the other spending on the \ndiscretionary side in that he has limited the increase in these \naccounts to about 1 percent less than the rate of inflation. He has \npicked priorities. He has named 150 programs that he is either willing \nto reduce or actually eliminate. That is a courageous step on his part. \nThe Congress doesn't have to stick with those priorities.\n  There are some programs I have concerns about, which everybody else \nin this Chamber has talked about--this program or that program. But we \nhave to acknowledge the basic goal of limiting nondiscretionary to an \nincrease of 1 percent, which is a reasonable goal. And within that \nincrease, we as a Congress can set the priorities. We don't have to \naccept all 150 programs the President sent up here as his suggestion \nfor places where we cut or where we will reduce programs. We can pick \nother programs, but we do have to pick. That is our responsibility in \ngovernance.\n  We have to be willing to step up to the table and say yes, there are \npriorities in times of a tight fiscal process. We have to make some \ndifficult judgments, and those judgments should be subject to a \nlimitation--a number on which we all agree. And, in my opinion, the \nPresident has picked a reasonable number, which is about a 1-percent \nrate of cut in these accounts.\n  In the entitlement area, the President has also said we have to slow \nthe rate of growth of entitlements. This chart, as I mentioned, shows \nthat as being an absolutely critical decision. It is about time we do.\n  He, of course, has suggested an entire national debate on the issue \nof Social Security. It is not part of this budget. In the Budget \nCommittee, I don't have much impact on Social Security. It is outside \nour purview. But he also has been willing to step forward on a number \nof other entitlement programs--specifically Medicaid, where he has made \na suggestion which I think makes a lot of sense as a goal. He \nessentially said, Governors, we will give you an increase that you can \nuse for the purposes of bringing more kids into the Medicaid Program, \nwhich is what our goal should be under Medicaid, but the increase isn't \ngoing to be as great as you want. However, at the same time, we are \ngoing to give you dramatically more flexibility on how you spend that \nmoney.\n  I don't know a Governor who is worth his or her salt in this country \ntoday who wouldn't be willing to get a little less money with a lot \nmore flexibility and feel they can do a lot more effective job of \ndelivering that money and getting services out to people who need \nMedicaid.\n  I think it is a good proposal, the type of proposal we should embrace \nand say that is probably going to be very good policy.\n  In any event, the difficulty of slowing the rate of growth of \nMedicaid and giving more flexibility to the Governors is one which I \nthink we as a Congress can move forward and hopefully can be part of \nthe budget.\n  I don't get to make the decisions as Budget chairman. I don't get to \nmake any decisions. The leader may make decisions, and the Senator in \nthe chair. But as Budget Committee chairman, I theoretically put \nforward a budget--sort of a blueprint, the mark that people work off of \nfor the rest of the year. The Budget Committee comes out with top-line \nnumbers. Then it is up to the Finance Committee to do the mechanics of \nhow that number is going to work.\n\n  The President has laid out those specific ideas. But the Finance \nCommittee is led by some very creative people. Senator Grassley is one \nof the most creative people around. He has a talented group of people \nwho may come up with a different way to approach this. But we should be \nable to agree that the rate of growth of those entitlements should be \nslowed. The same is true in other entitlement accounts which the \nPresident has addressed. I congratulate him for that.\n  There are two issues which have received a fair amount of attention \nfrom the press, and from the naysayers who gather around this Capitol \ntalking about fiscal discipline, trying to use this basically as a \nstraw-dog argument. I always ask these folks, Where is your idea? Where \nare you going to make your difficult decisions for controlling \nspending? You don't usually get that answered. What you usually get is \nthis: He doesn't include the issue of the war costs; or, he doesn't \naccount for his tax cuts; or, the tax cuts are too high.\n  Let us address both of those issues.\n  First, on the war costs, the war costs should not be in the basic \nbudget. They should be accounted for, and we are going to account for \nthem. They should be very visible and transparent, and they will be. \nBut these are not one-time items. Unfortunately, they are not. They are \ncertainly two- or three-time items, and they won't be occurring 4 or 5 \nyears out. This is a 5-year budget. The war will be over, hopefully, \nwithin a year or a year and a half when our need to put a lot of money \ninto Iraq will drop dramatically. It is looking like that may be the \ncase after these elections. We don't want to build into the base of the \nDefense Department the war costs so that 5 years from now we are giving \nthe Defense Department all the money they are spending in Iraq as part \nof their base, because they are not going to need it.\n  This argument that the war costs are not included is a straw dog. It \nsimply is not a good approach to fiscal accountability. It is \nappropriate that we account for it, and we will. It is appropriate that \nit be highlighted, and it will be. But it shouldn't be built into the \nbase of the budget if 3 or 4 years from now we would be spending a lot \nof money on defense which was spent on the Iraq war and it should not \nbe spent any longer on defense; it should be spent on something else or \nreturned to the taxpayers in tax cuts, which gets me to the second \nissue.\n  You can't have it both ways, but some of our colleagues would like \nthat. You cannot be opposed to the tax cut 2 years ago and then say \ntaxes need to go up this year when the numbers show pretty distinctly \ntwo things.\n  One, as I mentioned earlier, because of the tax cut the recession was \nshallower, more people got back to work quicker, more people had money \nin their pockets to spend sooner, and as a result the economy recovered \nfaster.\n  Two, tax revenues are up. They are up dramatically, and they are \nprojected to continue to go up. They are up by 9.2 percent last year, \n6.5 percent this year, and headed toward 7 percent next year. They are \nheaded to continue to grow at that type of compounding for the \nforeseeable future, which means tax revenues are headed back to their \nhistorical place as a percentage of gross national product, which is \nabout 7.9 percent; and they are getting there because we have more \neconomic activity as a result of having put in place tax laws which \ncreate an incentive for capital formation--jobs and economic activity.\n\n  The tax cuts are working in generating more revenue. If you were to \nraise taxes now on top of this embryonic economic recovery we are \nexperiencing, you would flatten the recovery. And as a result, you \nwould probably be reducing revenue rather than raising revenue because \nthe economy would start to slow down. It would be the absolute wrong \npolicy.\n  I await with great anticipation a budget from the other side of the \naisle. I certainly hope they will put one out this year. They did not \nput one out when they were in charge of this place, and they didn't put \none out last year, or the year before. I await with great anticipation \nto see the tax increases they will actually bring forward. Maybe they \nwill be the same taxes or the exact same policy which we saw from \nSenator Kerry when he was in charge--not in charge. I should not say \nthat, but when he was running for President. His proposal was to raise \ntaxes on the highest income Americans and then spend the money, the net \neffect of which he was going to spend $1 trillion more than he would \ntake in which would have aggravated the deficit by $1 trillion. That \nis, of course, a policy which, if those on the other side of the aisle \nwant to continue to debate, we look forward to debating.\n  The bottom line is this: The President has proposed a stringent, \nresponsible budget which moves us toward reducing the deficit by half \nin the next 4 years. That is what we need to do.\n  More importantly, the President has stepped forward on the key issues \nof the outyears--specifically Social Security and entitlement \nspending--to try to address so we can assure our children do not end up \nhaving to pay so\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\nmuch in taxes in order to support us in our retirement years when they \ncannot live as good and as full of a life as we have had.\n  I congratulate the President on his budget, and I look forward to \nworking with this Congress in passing such a budget and moving toward \nfiscal responsibility in this country.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I am pleased to hear our Budget \nchairman stand up and talk about real fiscal responsibility. I am also \nvery pleased to see that we have a President who continues to provide \nthe kind of strong leadership Americans demand.\n  In 1994, when I was elected to the House of Representatives, I \ncampaigned long and hard on the fact that we needed to move the Federal \nGovernment back to the same type of fiscal responsibility we ask every \nsingle American to make every month when they sit around their kitchen \ntable; that is, not spend more money than we take in. Thank goodness, \ndue to the economy thriving and surging ahead and due to fiscal \nresponsibility on the part of Republicans and Democrats in the 1990s, \nwe were able to not only balance the budget but achieve surpluses. Then \nalong comes September 11, 2001. Since that point in time, we have \noperated in a deficit situation for a number of reasons.\n  First, revenues have been declining from the projected increases we \nthought we would have. But most significantly, we have seen an increase \nin Federal spending both in defense and nondefense areas, but also in \nhomeland security-related areas irrespective of whether it is defense \nor nondefense. Therefore, we have seen ourselves projected back into a \ndeficit-spending situation.\n  But we have a President who has made a commitment to the American \npeople. He made it during the course of the campaign, and he is living \nup to what he talked about during the campaign; that is, we need to \nreturn to more of a balanced budget scenario so our children and \ngrandchildren can see us operating in the black in the future, and we \ncan tell them that we were fiscally responsible and that we will turn \nthis country over to them with a new, sound fiscal condition.\n  Unless we have somebody who is as bold as this President is with this \nbudget which he has come forward with, that is never going to happen. I \nam very pleased to see the President is leading us in the right way \nfrom a fiscally responsible standpoint.\n  That having been said, there are a number of programs in the \nPresident's budget that he has proposed eliminating. I think there are \nsome 150 programs. In last year's budget that came from the White \nHouse, we saw a proposal to eliminate some 61 or 71 Federal programs \nthat were not performing up to the standards at which they should be \nperforming. Therefore, the President was proposing to eliminate those, \nvery much like what he has done this time.\n  The problem is when those proposals reach Capitol Hill, we tend to \nlook at those programs and then somebody has some parochial interest in \nthose programs and they never get eliminated. I don't know what the \nprograms are this time. I have not looked at the budget in that kind of \ndetail. But I do hope--and I know under the leadership of Senator Gregg \nas well as Senator Conrad, who is very fiscally minded always--that we \nlook at these programs which the President is suggesting, that we look \nat eliminating them, and that we give them serious consideration \nrelative to their efficiency, to whether they are performing at the \nstandard we have always anticipated they perform at, and if they are \nnot performing, then we ought to consider eliminating them.\n  There are two areas of the budget I do have some concerns about. \nFirst of all, we are seeing an increase of about 5 percent in defense \nspending. I know the President is like me. He is very strong minded \nwhen it comes to defense issues. We have a very difficult situation, a \nvery complex situation on our hands right now, relative to Iraq. We are \nstill in the midst of a war. It is imperative that we continue to spend \nthe money necessary to make sure America's military forces are the best \ntrained, the best equipped fighting forces in the world. We need to \nmake sure they have in their possession the latest, most \ntechnologically advanced weapons systems that are made anywhere in the \nworld so they can protect freedom and democracy around the world; that \nthey can accomplish what is being accomplished in Iraq today; that is, \nthe liberation of the Iraqi people; that we are giving hope and \nopportunity to the people of Iraq in making sure they live in a free, \nopen, and democratic society, in a country where freedom does reign; \nwhere they have an opportunity to provide a better quality of life for \nthemselves and their children, unlike the society in which they have \nlived for the past 30 years under Saddam Hussein.\n  In order to do that, it is imperative we look at the weapon systems \nwe are going to be purchasing over the next decade, over the next two \ndecades, and into the future, because we not only have this conflict to \nconsider, but we must also keep in mind there will be future conflicts \nout there. We need to make sure our men and women will continue to have \nthe best weapon systems available to them to continue the fight for \nfreedom around the world when freedom calls us.\n  In that regard, there are two particular weapon systems that are \nproposed to be eliminated in this budget that I have serious questions \nabout: the FA-22--not that we are eliminating it, but the number we are \ngoing to buy--and also the C-130, which is a great weapon system, a \nweapon system that has been in our inventory for at least four decades, \nand we are into the fifth decade. Any time you turn on the TV, whether \nyou see the Baghdad International Airport or whether you see the \ntsunami relief effort, you see C-130s flying the flag of America as \nwell as other countries participating in national security issues.\n  It is critically important that we review the proposals relative to \nthese two weapon systems. The C-130 is proposed to be eliminated, and \nthe FA-22, we are thinking in terms of not buying as many as we \noriginally thought we would buy.\n  I was in a meeting this morning at the Pentagon that the President \nhappened to be in, and we had a very good discussion, a frank \ndiscussion with the Secretary of Defense and his colleagues relative \nnot just to this issue but to the overall issues relative to Iraq, as \nwell as the budget. I was pleased to hear they are going to continue to \nlook at these two weapon systems, and hopefully we will make some \nchanges from the budget that are more realistic, more reasonable, and \ndecisions that are a lot more correct than the decisions contained \nwithin the budget.\n  The second area I will talk about that concerns me relative to this \nbudget is the proposal to reduce the budget of the Department of \nAgriculture by some $5.7 billion over 10 years. In 2002, we wrote the \nlatest farm bill. That farm bill was a controversial farm bill. It has \nbeen criticized by conservatives. It has been criticized by liberals. \nIt has been applauded by both sides as well. I happen to think it is \nthe right kind of farm bill that allows our consumers in America to go \nto the grocery store and be able to continue to buy the most reasonable \nfood products of any industrialized country in the world. We spend less \nmoney per dollar on food products in this country than any other \nindustrialized country in the world. We have a guarantee that those \nproducts are safe and secure, and at the same time we provide the \nresearch that allows our farmers to produce the highest quality and the \nlargest yields of agriculture products of anyone in the world.\n  All of that happens for one simple reason; that is, the action this \nbody, as well as the House of Representatives, takes when we write a \nfarm bill. That is exactly the result that happened from the 2002 farm \nbill.\n  This budget seeks to rewrite that farm bill and to reduce the amount \nof\n\n[[Page S1071]]\n\nfunding under that farm bill. That is wrong. We have to look at the \nproposals and make sure farmers and ranchers participate in the deficit \nreduction, which they have always been willing to do. They are the \ngreatest people in America, even though they are small in number these \ndays. They are hard-working, dedicated men and women who have made \nplans under the current farm bill for 6 years, which is the length of \nthat farm bill. They made financial commitments, they leased land. They \nhave their crop rotations planned out for 6 years. We are in the middle \nof that. We are in the third year of that.\n  Those who wrote the farm bill told the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Members of the Senate as well as the farm \ncommunity that when we wrote that bill we were changing it \nphilosophically to a farm bill that would extend a helping hand to our \nagriculture community in times of low yields and low prices, but when \nprices were good and yields were good the Federal Government was not \ngoing to be there in the way of commodity payments; that is exactly \nwhat happened.\n  It was projected by the CBO that we would spend for the first 3 years \n$52 billion. The fact is, we have spent $37.9 billion. The reason is, \nfor 2 of those years, we have had good yields and we have had good \nprices, so payments have been down.\n  While I applaud the President and I applaud his administration for \nbeing fiscally responsible and coming forward with a budget that does \nmeet his goal of cutting the deficit in half during the next 4 years, \nwe have to be careful and make sure we do not throw the baby out with \nthe bath water and that we make sure we approach this budget for the \nnext 5 years in a sound and sensible manner, in a manner that makes \nsure our defense community is looked after and makes sure that all of \nAmerica is looked after when it comes to our agriculture production and \nour ability to buy safe and secure products in the grocery store.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a process that \nmany Americans face each year. Imagine your average American family \nwith paper and pencil in hand, gathered around the kitchen table \ndiscussing their budget for the year. Their funds are limited--and \ngoing into a deficit is not an option for them, like it is for their \nGovernment. They must choose their priorities, cut the wasteful \nspending, and make sure that their spending does not add up to more \nthan their income.\n  Here in the U.S. Congress, we've been tasked with the same job. Those \ntaxpaying families that toil over their own budgets expect us to put \nthe same thoughtfulness into how we spend their hard-earned money here \nin Washington, DC. And for too long, we have been largely irresponsible \nwith how we spend their money. First, we have to prioritize our \nspending--and that means making tough choices.\n  Our Our top priority today must be our security. That includes the \nsecurity of our borders and the safety of the brave servicemen and \nwomen in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world who are helping secure \nour borders and our freedom. We must be vigilant in making sure that \nour military has the tools it needs to get the job done.\n  We also cannot afford to turn our backs on the economic growth that \nwe have been experiencing. Economic growth continued job creation are \nwhat will help bring increased revenue into the Government coffers and \nultimately help reduce our deficit even further.\n  Now some critics of the President's budget in the Senate might say \nthat we should raise taxes on the American family to reduce the \ndeficit. I don't think that takes us in the right direction.\n  That kind of thinking fails to recognize how the tax cuts of 2001 and \n2003 have helped our economy grow. This growth has resulted in 20 \nstraight months of increased employment. In 2004 alone, America created \n2.2 million new jobs. Each of these workers is gainfully employed and \ntaking care of their own family. They are also paying taxes.\n  In fact, as a result of increased employment, even with lower tax \nrates, individual income tax revenue will increase almost $73 billion \nthis year. Overall revenue is expected to increase by almost $125 \nbillion this year. I think this is proof that the tax cuts worked. This \nis one important reason we have to make sure that we don't raise taxes \non American families this year and in the years to come.\n  After we decide what our priorities are when it comes to spending, we \nhave to make more difficult decisions about what we will cut from our \nbudget. As we would tell our children and as we must sometimes remind \nourselves, ``Money doesn't grow on trees.'' Our budget must reflect the \nunderstanding that there are limits to how much we can spend--as is \ntrue for the typical family creating a budget.\n  Although it might be easier to continue throwing money at failing \nprograms, it is not the right thing to do. If a program is not \neffective, it cannot expect to cruise on the Federal dole indefinitely. \nWe must demand accountability, and we must focus on programs that are \nmaking a difference. I applaud President Bush for taking the position \nthat ``. . . a taxpayer dollar must be spent wisely, or not at all.'' \nThat is the leadership we need in order to make these difficult \nreductions.\n  All Americans can work together to reduce Federal spending. Every \ntaxpaying American should demand spending reform, demand that earmarks \nand pork barrel spending in the appropriations bills be eliminated, and \ncall on Congress to eliminate the ineffective programs. Rather than \nhaving lobbyists and activists calling on Congress to increase spending \nfor every program, Congress should force these groups to identify cost \nsavings too.\n  For example, it you want more spending for one of the more successful \nhousing programs, housing activists should be forced to identify a \nhousing program that is a failure. That way Congress can reallocate \nresources to the better run programs. This goes for every federally \nfunded program. It should no longer be acceptable in America for our \nelected officials not to ask that hard question before increasing \nspending from one year to the next. The future of America's financial \nhouse demands a changed way of thinking.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

President John Kennedy used to say that to govern is to \nchoose. Certainly that is what a proposed budget is all about. It is \nabout choices and priorities and the values that underlie them.\n  A budget is not just numbers. There are a lot of figures in there, \nbut ultimately a budget is about people and priorities and what kind of \nan America we want. It speaks about the values of our country.\n  On that score, President Bush's proposed budget for 2006, sent \nyesterday to the Congress, speaks in the starkest of terms. Gone is any \npretense of compassionate conservatism. Gone is any pretense of concern \nfor the most needy in our society. Instead, what we see in the budget \nreleased yesterday is an unvarnished message that the far right rules, \nthat the gloves are off, and future budgets will reflect traditional \nhard right priorities.\n\n[[Page S1072]]\n\n  Specifically, the President's position is that the tax cuts for the \nvery rich must not be touched. In fact, they must be made permanent. \nMoreover, two additional tax cuts for the very wealthy--tax cuts passed \nin the 2001 tax bill which become effective next year--must also not be \ntouched. Meanwhile, President Bush proposes to slash critical life-\nsupporting programs for veterans, schoolchildren, the sick, the poor, \nthe disabled, the most vulnerable in our American family.\n  This proposed budget is the antithesis of compassionate governance. \nYes, President Bush still trots out the conservative rhetoric about \ntightening our belt and making difficult choices in next year's budget. \nBut he has a double standard. On the one hand he says times are tough. \nWe can't afford to properly fund education for Iowa's schoolkids, \nhealth care for our veterans, economic development for rural \ncommunities or programs to keep police officers on our streets. On the \nother hand, the President says, times are not too tough for yet another \ntax giveaway bonanza for the wealthiest Americans.\n  Specifically, the budget released yesterday calls for implementation \nnext year of two new tax cuts worth billions of dollars, with more than \nhalf of the benefits going to those making more than $1 million a year. \nIn short, President Bush's proposed 2006 budget is easy on the rich and \nprivileged and tough on children and the poor.\n  Hard-working Americans are looking at these proposals and saying: \nThose aren't our priorities. Those are not our values. This is not our \nidea of fairness or shared sacrifice. Why should a Wall Street \nspeculator making more than $1 million a year get yet another big tax \ncut while kids in rural Iowa are getting kicked off of Head Start?\n  I made an inquiry about the slashes in Head Start. I was told: It is \nonly 25,000 kids. The cuts in the Head Start Program in the President's \nbudget would only deny 25,000 kids nationally to Head Start.\n  Only? I thought we were not going to leave any child behind. Yet we \nare going to say to 25,000 of the neediest kids in America: Sorry, we \ndon't have room for you in Head Start. Only 25,000?\n  These are wrong choices and misplaced priorities, and they reflect \nbad values, values that are offensive to the basic decency and caring \nand fairness of the American people.\n  Let's be clear about the game being played here--only it is not a \ngame; it is a deadly serious ideologically driven plan--the objective \nof this plan is best expressed by Republican leader Grover Nordquist \nwho said his goal is to ``cut government in half . . . to get it down \nto the size where we can [drag it into the bathroom and] drown it in \nthe bathtub.'' That is their goal.\n\n  To that end, over the last 4 years President Bush has engineered a \nfiscal train wreck, a methodical, purposeful, deliberate train wreck. \nHe has cut taxes by trillions of dollars, vastly increased spending on \nthe Pentagon, spent hundreds of billions on the war in Iraq, rammed \nthrough an ill-conceived prescription drug plan costing half a trillion \ndollars, he has proposed borrowing more than $4 trillion for his scheme \nto privatize Social Security, a scheme that does nothing to address the \nlong-term shortfall in Social Security, and now the President has the \ngall to point to this fiscal train wreck, his train wreck, and say the \ndeficits are out of control, but since the tax cuts are untouchable, we \nhave to cut programs for our most needy citizens: We need to cut \neducation, cut health care, cut rural development, cut police officers, \nand firefighters.\n  In short, what the President is saying is, we have to tighten belts \non members of our American family whose belts are already tightened to \nthe last notch. But to those whose coffers are full, whose stomachs are \nfull, he says: We will give you a bigger belt. In case you are down to \nthe end notch, we will give you a bigger one.\n  Here are just a few of the most egregious cuts in the budget that was \nsent to us. First, there are deep cuts in education for the first time \nin 10 years, at a time when our schools are struggling to meet the \nrequirements of No Child Left Behind, eliminating funding for education \ntechnology, school counselors, alcohol abuse reduction, dozens of other \neducation initiatives.\n  Secondly, at a time when U.S. workers are fighting for jobs in the \nglobal economy, the President's budget cuts job training by $330 \nmillion and eliminates vocational education funding.\n  Next, the budget would slash $1.6 billion in funding for local \npolice, while eliminating drug task forces and the successful High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program which has been so helpful in \nfighting the meth epidemic in Iowa and other places.\n  Next, the budget calls for some 2 million veterans to pay a new $250 \nannual fee to receive health care, and it doubles the cost of their \nprescription drugs. Welcome home, Iraqi veterans, welcome home.\n  Rural America is singled out for deep cuts, cuts in programs to help \nfamily farmers and rural small businesses to survive, cuts in \nagricultural conservation programs, cuts in clean drinking water for \nour small towns and communities. The budget slashes funding for rural \nhealth programs by 80 percent. It cuts health profession training by 64 \npercent. It zeros out the block grants for preventive health care, the \none thing we need to do to move from a sick care system to a health \ncare system and have preventative health care block grants. It zeros \nthem out.\n  Last, the budget calls for giving States more ``flexibility'' under \nMedicaid. But this is nothing more than a code word for cuts, cuts of \nbillions of dollars in health care for the poorest, for the mentally \nill, those with disabilities.\n  These are the wrong choices, the wrong priorities, and the wrong \nvalues. Why in the world are the President's tax cuts for the rich \nuntouchable? We are no longer in a recession. The President says the \neconomy is strong and creating jobs. During the Clinton years, we \ncreated 100 times more jobs per month, and we did it not by cutting \ntaxes but by balancing budgets. That is what a budget is. It is to \nimpose some self-discipline. But the budget President Bush sent up \nyesterday refuses to impose self-discipline except on the poorest and \nthe neediest.\n  For 2006, the President is demanding a $2.6 trillion Government, but \nhe is refusing to raise any revenue to pay for it. In order to preserve \nthe tax cuts, the President is saying: We are going to have to borrow \nat least $390 billion, an amount equal to the entire Pentagon budget, \nand pass it on to our children and grandchildren.\n  This does not reflect the values of working Americans who sacrifice \nevery day to balance their own budgets. I intend to challenge the \nPresident's priorities. I do not accept his idea that tax cuts for the \nvery rich are untouchable while essential programs for our most \nvulnerable citizens are fair game for cuts or zeroing out. It is wrong \nto put virtually the entire burden of deficit reduction on the backs of \nour poorest citizens, yet this is what is being done with this budget.\n  I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share these \nconcerns. The President's budget is deeply disappointing and \ndisturbing. But the President's job is to propose a budget. We now know \nwhat President Bush's values are. We know how he wants America to look. \nThat is what he is proposing. It is our job in Congress to write and \npass a budget and to reflect the values and the choices that Americans \nwant for their future. I appeal to my colleagues, let us join to write \na budget that is fair, a budget that reflects the essential American \nvalues of fairness and shared sacrifice and compassion toward the most \nvulnerable in our American family.\n  In closing, I noticed last week an article in the newspaper that said \n``Bush prays for poor.'' It said:\n\n       President Bush followed his State of the Union address with \n     a prayer Thursday morning, saying that praying reminds the \n     faithful to hear ``the cry of the poor and the less \n     fortunate.''\n\n  Well, I believe in the power of prayer. I always have. But maybe the \nPresident's prayer is a little misplaced. Maybe who we ought to be \npraying for is the rich. Maybe we ought to be praying that those who \nhave a lot in our society, those who have the biggest homes and the \nnicest cars, who have the biggest and the fattest bank accounts, those \nwho are able to pass on wealth to their children, maybe we ought to be \npraying for them in this way: That in their hearts they will understand \nand know that what we are doing here is wrong; what we are doing\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\nto our American family is not in the best interests of fairness and \ndecency and compassion.\n  Let us pray for those who have the most in our society, that they \nwill get to this President and say: Mr. President, we have enough. We \ndon't need any more. We need to pay our fair share. We don't need these \ntwo new tax cuts that are coming down next year. Take those off the \ntable. Let's have shared sacrifice for all in our society.\n  And maybe those who the President listens to the most, the rich and \nthe powerful, maybe if they could get to him with a change of heart, \nthen maybe we can change our priorities. Maybe rather than praying for \nthe poor, we ought to be praying for the rich to have that change of \nheart, to talk to this President, to talk to the leaders in Congress \nabout fairness and equity and justice for the least in our society.\n  That is what a budget is about. It is not numbers. It is about who \ngets and who doesn't. It is about what kind of a structure our country \nwill have. It is about hope. It is about giving hope to those who have \nthe least--that they, too, can have a brighter future; that they, too, \nare members of our family; that they, too, are valuable. And while \nthese poor kids in Head Start don't have a rich parent to get them into \na private school, to get them tutoring, who do they rely on for their \nkids to get that Head Start? They rely upon us--the Government--because \nthey don't have a rich parent or a rich uncle. So, yes, this Government \ncan give hope to people--not just the wealthiest but to those on the \nbottom. That is what this budget is about and that is why I intend to \nchallenge the President on this budget, to make sure we have our \npriorities right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1073-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TURNING UP THE HEAT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I noticed a plethora of articles recently \nabout the Republican National Committee turning up the heat on Minority \nLeader Harry Reid. I notice here that there is some other stuff coming \nout from the Republican National Committee saying they are going to \n``Daschleize'' Reid, making Harry Reid, our minority leader, the \nobstructionist.\n  Again, this is not what working together means. Look, we Democrats \nare in the minority. I believe we are the loyal opposition. We need to \nprovide a different view for the American people. This last election \nwas very close. There is no mandate for one side or the other to run \nroughshod over the other. This is a mandate for us to try to get \ntogether and work things out. It is not a mandate for the Republican \nNational Committee to trash, demonize, and drag down the good name of \nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada. But that is what is happening. It has no \npart here. I was hoping maybe we would be beyond that. I would think we \nare beyond that.\n  I have known our minority leader for the last 30 years. He is a good, \ndecent, kind human being. He is tough, but we expect him to be tough in \nmaking sure our rights are protected, and making sure the debate flows \nin the Senate, so we are able to come together and work things out, \nwith having the President of the United States say this is the way it \nis going to be and you have to follow suit. That is not the way our \ncountry works; it is not the way the Senate works.\n  I am hopeful the RNC will look into their own hearts and see that \nthis is not the right way to do things. It is going to make it tougher \nto get things done around here. It is going to make it much tougher if \nthe Republican National Committee continues to try to drag down Senator \nHarry Reid, demonize him, call him an obstructionist, and to \n``Daschleize'' him--whatever that means. I guess it means to make \nSenator Reid the object of scorn for the Republican National Committee. \nI hope the Republicans in this body will tell the RNC to back off.

Mr. President, in a few moments we are going to be \nmoving to the class action bill. Senator Durbin is due to arrive to \noffer an amendment. In the intervening time, I would like to take a few \nminutes to discuss my decision to retain the chairmanship of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation. The Appropriations Committee has been considering the \nformation of a new subcommittee on intelligence. Under my seniority \nposition, I would have been in a position to take that subcommittee \nassignment. I have had a very keen interest in intelligence, chairing \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee in the 104th Congress, being coauthor \nof the homeland security bill, and the fight against terrorism is \nobviously our No. 1 priority. So, I have been very strongly tempted to \ntake on that chairmanship.\n  It now appears that the status of that subcommittee is in doubt \nbecause the decision has been made to not make a disclosure of the \ntotal funding for the intelligence community. With the announcement of \nthe President's budget, which is austere, we are facing major problems \nwith the deficit and the President has come in with a very restricted \nbudget, which impacts very heavily on the subcommittee that I have \nchaired now for many years.\n  The Department of Labor, for example, has cut some $400 million; the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has been cut by $1.8 billion; \nthe Department of Education cut by some $500 million. So that the total \nimpact on the subcommittee has been a reduction of $2.4 billion, which \nis very difficult when you are talking about education and health and \ncapital investments. Those are not expenditures, they are capital \ninvestments--as are programs related to worker safety.\n  The President has proposed some programs that are excellent. There is \n$45 million for a new gang youth initiative, which has been sponsored \nand spoken about by First Lady Laura Bush. There is $125 million for \nhealth care information technology, which is an increase of $25 \nmillion. This is funding the subcommittee had started some time ago to \nenhance technology and information. We have had an increase in \ncommunity health centers of about $304 million. There is a new program \nfor high school risk initiatives, for high school students who are at \nrisk.\n  At the same time, there have been major eliminations. For example, \nthe so-called GEAR UP program, which provides for the transition from \nthe seventh grade on through high school, has been cut by more than \n$306 million. The vocational and technical education programs have been \ncut by $1.3 billion. Educational Technology State Grants have been cut \nby $496 million, and correctional educational programs have been cut by \n$26.8 million. There have also been major decreases in training; some \n$333 million is cut from employment and training programs; $29 million \nis cut from the Job Corps; $35 million from a program for ex-offenders \nhas been eliminated.\n  There has been a decrease in Healthy Start. The Centers for Disease \nControl has been cut by $555 million, which is a little hard to \nunderstand at a time when we are calling on the CDC to undertake so \nmany new actions. The program for low-income home energy assistance--a \nvery vital program, especially for seniors who have to make decisions \non limited compensation as to whether they will heat or eat--has been \ncut by some $182 million. Graduate medical education has had a decrease \nof $101 million. Perhaps of greatest concern--and it is hard to \nprioritize these cuts--has been the budget proposed by the \nadministration for the National Institutes of Health, which has an \nincrease of one-half of 1 percent, which will not maintain the research \nprogram of NIH.\n  I am joined on the floor by my distinguished colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, who has been with me as chair of the subcommittee for \nmore than a decade. Senator Harkin and I have established what might be \nreferred to as and others have called a model for bipartisan \ncooperation. We have had\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\nchanges in the gavel on the chairmanship and they have been seamless. \nOur efforts on many important items, which I will not detail at this \ntime have, I think, been very important for the health and education \nand labor of Americans.\n  We have increased NIH funding from $12 billion to $28 billion, which \nhas provided for enormous improvements. There has been a march toward \ncures in Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and many other \nillnesses. In the context of what is happening with these programs, I \nhave decided to stay and fight rather than switch.\n  I am delighted to yield to Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my leader and chairman for yielding to me. Again, \nI want to thank him for his decision to stay as chairman of the \nAppropriations subcommittee that funds basically all of our health, \neducation, labor, biomedical research programs, preventive health care \nprograms, such as the CDC, which are all underneath this subcommittee.\n  Senator Specter and I have worked together, as he mentioned, going on \nI think almost 15 years. The gavel has moved back and forth. It has \nbeen seamless, as he said. I could not ask for a better partner and a \nbetter chairman to work with on this subcommittee. There are countless \nnumbers of people in this country today--I think mostly of the kids--\nwho are maybe coming down with Parkinson's or diabetes, who have \nillnesses facing them that a few years ago were hopeless. But now they \nhave hope. Now they can see certain lights at the end of the tunnel, \nthat they will be cured, that they will be well.\n  This is due in no small part to the great leadership of Senator Arlen \nSpecter of Pennsylvania, who has doggedly through the years fought to \nmake sure we put the money into medical research, into finding the \ncauses, preventions, and cures of these illnesses. It was through his \ngreat leadership that we were able to double the funding for the NIH.\n  There are also countless kids in America today who are getting good \nschool programs, who are in Head Start Programs, as I mentioned \nearlier, and others, because of the leadership of Senator Arlen Specter \nof Pennsylvania. So I thank him for that leadership and for his \nfriendship and, as always, for his willingness to work across party \nlines to get things done.\n  Someone once mentioned that there are really two powerful committees \non Appropriations: One is the Defense Appropriations Committee and the \nother is what is now called the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, which the Senator chairs and on which I am the ranking \nmember.\n  Someone once said that the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee is the \ncommittee that defends America. The Appropriations Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education is the committee that \ndefines America. I believe that really is true.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, we \nhave defined America well in terms of providing good education, health \ncare programs, job training programs, dislocated worker programs--I am \nnot going to go through the whole list--the Centers for Disease Control \nprograms and the public health service they do across our country. \nUnder the leadership of Arlen Specter, we have defined well for \nAmerica.\n  We have some tough choices, as he pointed out, in this budget, and we \nare going to have to work together to make it work. One thing I can \nsay, having worked with Senator Specter all these years, one thing of \nwhich I am confident is that Senator Specter will be fair, \ncompassionate, reasonable, and judicious in helping us work out this \nbudget so that the poorest and the most needy in our society are not \nleft behind.\n  I thank him for his leadership. I thank him for his willingness to \nstick with it and to stay as the chairman of this very vital \nsubcommittee. I say to him here on the Senate floor and in public, I \nlook forward to his leadership and his guidance and working with him to \nhelp continue to define America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIowa for those very complimentary comments. It has been very gratifying \nfor me to work with Senator Harkin for these many years as we have had \nthe seamless exchange of the gavel.\n  I would not want my statement to suggest that there are not other \nareas of major concern as to the Administration's budget. The zeroing \nout of Amtrak is something which will have to be addressed by the \nCongress. There have been efforts made since Senator Baker, the then-\nmajority leader, convened a meeting in his office with OMB Director \nDavid Stockman in 1981, and we maintained Amtrak's funding. Veterans \nwill have to be reexamined, and many other items. I know we are going \nto move ahead on the class action bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement in further \nexplanation of my decision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Statement of Further Explanation\n\n       Since January of 1989, I have had the privilege of serving \n     as either the Chairman or the ranking member of the \n     Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations. Since that \n     time, Senator Harkin and I have fought to dramatically \n     increase funding for the NIH, replace deteriorating and \n     outdated laboratory space at the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, increase funds for elementary and secondary \n     education and aid to disadvantaged college students, and \n     provide for worker protection. These accomplishments have not \n     come without challenges. The Subcommittee's allocation has \n     limited our ability to increase programs as much as I would \n     have liked, and dividing funding among many worthy programs \n     has been a struggle. But I have enjoyed these challenges, the \n     all night conferences with the House, and balancing the \n     Congressional and Presidential priorities.\n       This year when the Senate passed a resolution to create an \n     Appropriations Subcommittee on Intelligence it was at a time \n     when the policy position of the Senate was to have an \n     Intelligence budget that was unclassified. Subsequently, the \n     decision was made to maintain the status quo and keep the \n     budget classified. Since it would be difficult to create an \n     Intelligence subcommittee with a classified budget, it may \n     not be possible to do so at this time. However, discussions \n     are still underway and if such a subcommittee were to be \n     created, given my seniority on the Appropriations Committee, \n     I would have the opportunity to chair that subcommittee. I \n     have given serious consideration to taking that chairmanship. \n     I believe that heading the Intelligence subcommittee at a \n     time when this Nation's intelligence community is being \n     restructured is very significant and is something in which I \n     have great interest.\n       I am reluctant to give up the Subcommittee on Labor, \n     Health, Human Services, and Education and the reasons for my \n     reluctance are many.\n\n\n                     national institutes of health\n\n       I have been on the Labor, HHS, Education Subcommittee since \n     I first came to the Senate in 1981. At that time the funding \n     for the NIH was something less than $3.6 billion. As I begin \n     my 25th year, the current budget is $28.6 billion. Senator \n     Tom Harkin and I have had a significant impact on this budget \n     and as a result of our leadership and persistence we achieved \n     our goal of doubling the medical research budget from FY'98 \n     to FY'03.\n       But doubling the NIH budget is not enough. One of the most \n     important reasons to continue my Labor-HHS Chairmanship is to \n     continue to increase support for the NIH. Science has made \n     great strides in extending life expectancy--in the early \n     1900s, 47 years was the average life span--today 77 years is \n     the norm. Polio, smallpox, and other infectious diseases no \n     longer kill or cause suffering to large numbers of people. \n     Deaths due to heart disease have been cut by more than half \n     since 1950. Cancer deaths in both men and women have \n     decreased and some cancers like multiple myelomas have been \n     reduced from a death sentence to a chronic condition as a \n     result of new drugs developed through biomedical research. \n     But there is still an enormous challenge. Heart disease \n     continues to be the number one killer and cancer is now \n     number two.\n       Last year, I lost two of my closest friends as a result of \n     breast cancer--Carey Lackman Slease and Paula Kline. While \n     the best medical teams worked on their cases--no cure could \n     be found. Several times a week, I receive calls from friends \n     and constituents asking me to contact the NIH to see if there \n     is any cutting edge treatment for diseases that affect them \n     or their families. And while there are some successes there \n     are many losses--like Carey and Paula.\n       We also receive many requests from constituents and \n     advocacy groups asking me to hold hearings to focus attention \n     on their particular ailments in the hopes of \n     receiving increased medical research for their disease. \n     There is a long list of maladies that people suffer from \n     where there could be cures: autism, Parkinson's, \n     scleroderma, muscular dystrophy, osteoporosis, cervical \n     cancer, lymphoma, prostate cancer, colon cancer,\n\n[[Page S1075]]\n\n     brain cancer, pediatric renal disorders, glaucoma, sickle \n     cell anemia, spinal cord injury, arthritis, a variety of \n     mental health disorders, hepatitis, deafness, stroke, \n     Alzheimer's, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral \n     sclerosis--commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease--\n     diabetes, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, \n     pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, \n     multiple sclerosis, macular degeneration, heart disease, \n     infant sudden death syndrome, schizophrenia, polycystic \n     kidney disease, Cooley's anemia, stroke, primary immune \n     deficiency disorders.\n       The tragic aspect of these deadly diseases is that they \n     could all be cured, I do believe, if we had sufficient \n     funding. Continuing my Chairmanship will permit me to fight \n     for increased dollars to find these cures.\n\n\n                               stem cells\n\n       In December of 1998, I held the first Congressional hearing \n     on the issue of human embryonic stem cells. The Labor, HHS, \n     Education Subcommittee provides funding for biomedical \n     research at the NIH. At that time, no federal funds were \n     going to this critical research. As Chairman, I have been \n     able to focus attention on the promise of these stem cells to \n     alleviate suffering and save lives. In 2004, NIH funded $24.2 \n     million in the area of human embryonic stem cell research. I \n     continue to lead the effort to provide additional funding for \n     stem cell research without arbitrary restrictions. To \n     continue to focus attention and provide resources for the \n     incredible potential of stem cell research to save lives, it \n     is critical for me to remain as Chairman of the Labor, HHS, \n     Education Subcommittee.\n\n\n                             women's health\n\n       I have long held a strong interest in issues related to the \n     health of women. As Chairman, I supported the creation of an \n     Office of Women's Health at the NIH to ensure adequate \n     research into diseases and maladies affecting women; \n     supported the funding of the first Healthy Start \n     Demonstration sites to improve the health of pregnant women \n     and their babies, now funded at $104 million; supported \n     increases in family planning programs, funded at $288 million \n     this year, that empower women to make healthy reproductive \n     decisions; and supported increases in rape prevention and \n     domestic violence prevention. These programs remain important \n     to me. To continue to nurture these programs, it is important \n     for me to remain as Chairman of the Labor, HHS, Education \n     Subcommittee.\n\n\n               centers for disease control and prevention\n\n       In 2000, I visited the Centers for Disease Control & \n     Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, GA. I was surprised by \n     the dilapidated state of the buildings where you had eminent \n     scientists working in deplorable conditions. Expensive \n     scientific equipment was housed in hallways and under leaky \n     roofs. At that time, funding for facilities at CDC was only \n     $17.8 million. The Labor, HHS, Education Subcommittee began \n     to focus resources in 2001 to reconstruct the infrastructure \n     of the CDC, whose critical public health mission is to \n     protect the American people from outbreaks of disease. In \n     2001, we were able to provide $175 million and we have \n     provided over $250 million in each of the last three years. \n     This effort continues as several substandard facilities \n     remain. To continue to provide the resources for critical \n     infrastructure at the CDC, it is important for me to remain \n     as Chairman of the Labor, HHS, Education Subcommittee.\n\n\n                           worker protection\n\n       The Labor, HHS, Education Appropriations Subcommittee has \n     jurisdiction over the principal federal agencies responsible \n     for protecting the American workforce. These ``worker \n     protection'' agencies include: The Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration, the Mine Safety and Health \n     Administration, and the National Labor Relations Board. The \n     jurisdiction also includes the Employment Standards \n     Administration, which is charged with enforcing minimum wage \n     and overtime laws, child labor protection, and administering \n     workers' compensation benefits. In addition, the Employee \n     Benefits Security Administration oversees private pension, \n     health and welfare plans, and would administer proposed \n     Association Health Plan legislation to assist small \n     businesses in purchasing affordable health coverage. Under \n     the leadership of Tom Harkin and myself, we provided $1.5 \n     billion for these agencies this year. Continuing my \n     partnership with Senator Harkin will ensure sufficient \n     dollars will be available to protect this nation's workers.\n\n\n                                asbestos\n\n       As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have a \n     longstanding commitment to crafting a legislative solution on \n     asbestos compensation, and once enacted, to ensuring that it \n     is expeditiously implemented. As chairman of the Labor-HHS-Ed \n     Subcommittee which oversees funding for the Department of \n     Labor, I will be in the unique position to ensure that an \n     administrative system is established promptly, and that \n     claims are processed fairly.\n\n\n                               education\n\n       In the area of education, I know from personal experience \n     the opportunities that are created through a high-quality \n     education. As a Senator, I have sought to make the American \n     dream a possibility for each and every American, whether it \n     means great public schools for America's children, affordable \n     alternatives at our Nation's outstanding colleges and \n     universities, high-quality career and technical education \n     programs, or investments in Head Start and other early care \n     and development programs.\n       In my role as Ranking Member or Chairman of the Labor-HHS-\n     Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have helped increase \n     the budget of the U.S. Department of Education from $24.7 \n     billion in FY95 to $56.6 billion in FY05, an increase of 129 \n     percent. This was made possible by the strong, bi-partisan \n     working relationship I have with Senator Tom Harkin, my \n     partner on the subcommittee.\n\n\n                          no child left behind\n\n       Since 1995, the Subcommittee has increased Federal support \n     for K-12 education by more than 100 percent, and most of the \n     increases have been provided in programs that provide \n     significant flexibility to States and local schools so they \n     can direct funds to the areas that will best support improved \n     student achievement and to eliminate the achievement gap in \n     this country. Today under the No Child Left Behind funding is \n     $24.4 billion, up more than 40 percent or $7 billion, since \n     the Act was passed by Congress in December 2001. As Chairman \n     of the Labor, HHS, Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I \n     am proud to have played a part in the many positive \n     developments in the area of education, but more work needs to \n     be done.\n       I believe that the future of the United States will be \n     shaped by the minds, skills and abilities of today's \n     students, and it is my hope and intent to help make sure that \n     they are prepared to make that future even brighter than it \n     is today.\n\n\n              individuals with disabilities education act\n\n       We have made substantial progress in meeting our \n     obligations under the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act. When the law was enacted in 1975, the Federal Government \n     promised to be a 40 percent partner in meeting the extra \n     costs associated with improving educational opportunities for \n     students with disabilities. For the first 20 years after the \n     law was signed, the Federal contribution hovered around 8 to \n     9 percent. I am proud to report that over the past 10 years \n     we have improved on that record by raising the Federal \n     contribution from 8 percent to 19 percent almost halfway to \n     the 40 percent goal. As Chairman, along with my partner Tom \n     Harkin, we will continue to ensure that the Federal \n     contribution continues to increase and that students with \n     disabilities are assessed with suitable tests, provided the \n     supports they need to achieve at the best of their ability, \n     and supported in their transition to employment and further \n     education.\n\n\n                              pell grants\n\n       During the past decade, the Pell Grant program has helped \n     millions of students with the cost of furthering their \n     education. By raising the Pell Grant maximum award to $4,050 \n     in FY`05, up $1,710 over the FY`95 award maximum, millions of \n     low and middle income students have received more grant aid \n     that assists them with the increasing price of a post-\n     secondary education. Appropriated funds have more than \n     doubled over the FY`95 level, and, as a result, more than 5.3 \n     million students currently receive grant assistance to make \n     post-secondary education more affordable. As Chairman, I will \n     continue to make sure that every qualified student desiring \n     to attend college can afford to do so and work in a \n     profession of his or her choosing, without overbearing \n     student loan payments.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Continuing my Chairmanship on the Labor, HHS, and Education \n     Subcommittee will give me the opportunity to continue to \n     target funds to programs and projects that are of great value \n     to the State of Pennsylvania. These dollars have created \n     jobs; increased the biomedical infrastructure of the State \n     making it more competitive; provided health care facilities \n     and supported seed monies for local programs related to \n     abstinence, mental health, education and bioterrorism.\n       I have been contacted by 281 individuals or organizations \n     requesting that I continue my Chairmanship. The reasons for \n     their requests are many: labor groups are asking for my \n     continued support on worker protection programs; biomedical \n     research groups are asking me to once again champion \n     increased medical research dollars; women's groups are \n     requesting my continued support for women's health and family \n     planning programs; education groups urge me to continue to \n     increase Federal support for elementary, secondary and higher \n     education.\n       The Chairman of the Labor, HHS, and Education Subcommittee \n     will face many challenges in this Congress. The most \n     difficult will be finding funding for the Congressional and \n     Presidential priorities within the current fiscal environment \n     and achieving the proper balance so that all priorities can \n     be met.\n       Continuing my Chairmanship would afford me the opportunity \n     to protect the programs and priorities that I have long \n     championed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1075-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1075-S1076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair states to all Senators present, I \nwas giving some leeway as the morning business continued. I will now \nclose\n\n[[Page S1076]]\n\nmorning business. Morning business is closed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1076-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1076-S1086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT OF 2005\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 5, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 5) to amend the procedures that apply to \n     consideration of interstate class actions to assure fairer \n     outcomes for class members and defendants, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer has noted, we \nare continuing consideration of class action reform. Yesterday, we had \nopening statements, which I led off as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and the ranking member, Senator Leahy, made his opening \nstatement. Senator Hatch spoke. We will be going to an amendment this \nmorning by Senator Durbin on mass actions.\n  The class action bill has as its central focus to prevent judge \nshopping to various States and even counties where courts and judges \nhave a prejudicial predisposition on cases. The issue of diversity of \ncitizenship has been created in the Federal courts to eliminate \nfavoritism. When diversity jurisdiction was established, it was \nundertaken in the context of the claimant from one State, \nillustratively, Virginia coming to Pennsylvania, and the concern there \nwas there might be some favoritism for the local resident in \nPennsylvania. So the jurisdictional amount, when I was in the practice \nof law, was $3,000. It is now $75,000 which would put the case in the \nFederal court where there would be more objectivity. That is what they \nare trying to do here, to eliminate judge shopping.\n  If the cases which stay in the State court have two-thirds of the \nclass from that State, it would go into the Federal court. If one-third \nor less is not from the State--in the one-third to two-third range--it \nwould be the discretion of the judge.\n  As I said yesterday, there is, as far as I am concerned, a very \nimportant purpose here: to put cases in the Federal court to avoid \nforum shopping and judge shopping.\n  With respect to the substantive law, it is my view that the \nsubstantive law ought not to be altered. I commented briefly on the \nBingaman amendment yesterday where I think it is important that the \nFederal judges who have the cases would have the discretion to apply \nState law. But that will be taken up sometime when we debate the matter \nlater.\n  I want to yield now to Senator McConnell for leadership time or time \nas he may choose.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I rise to speak about a case that I believe perfectly illustrates \nsome of the problems with our current class action system. This case \nis, unfortunately, not at all unique. These outrageous decisions happen \nall too frequently. The bill currently under consideration will help \nfix some of these problems.\n  I have a chart. It is kind of hard to see. Basically, it is a letter \nthat a member of my staff recently got. It included a check. The check \nis made payable to a member of my staff who received it in the mail. On \nthe check's ``Pay to the Order of'' line, I have covered up the name of \nthe staffer so she may remain anonymous.\n  I also obscured the name of the defendant in this case. Plaintiffs' \nlawyers have already soaked them once, and I do not want to give them \nthe opportunity to do it again. I would hate to see others able to sue \nthe company because they heard the company settled at least one class \naction lawsuit.\n  Along with this settlement check, my staffer received a letter which \nsays in part:\n\n       You have been identified as a member of the class of . . . \n     customers who are eligible for a refund under the terms of a \n     settlement agreement reached in a class-action lawsuit . . . \n     The enclosed check includes any refunds for which you were \n     eligible.\n\n  Imagine her excitement. As you know, Senate staffers are certainly \nnot the highest paid people in town. So this woman on my staff told me \nshe was, indeed, thrilled to anticipate what she might be receiving. \nAnd then she looked at the enclosed check to see just how big her \nwindfall was. It was a whopping 32 cents. That is right, she received a \ncheck made out to her in the amount of 32 cents. I guess it goes \nwithout saying that she was a little bit disappointed to find out her \nnewfound riches had disappeared already.\n  Do not misunderstand me. I am not suggesting my staffer deserved a \nbigger settlement check. In fact, she told me she had no complaint \nagainst the defendant, and she never asked to be a part of the lawsuit. \nApparently, she just happened to be a customer of the company that was \nsued, and it was determined that she theoretically could bring a claim \nagainst the defendant. So she became a member of ``a class'' who was \ndue a settlement.\n  If this does not precisely illustrate the absurdity of the current \nclass action epidemic in this country, I do not know what does. To \ndemonstrate just how far out of whack the system is, let's start with \nthe letter notifying my staffer that she was a member of a class action \nlawsuit and had been awarded a settlement.\n  This letter and check arrived via the U.S. mail. The last time I \nchecked, it cost 37 cents to send an envelope through the U.S. mail. \nThe settlement check is only for 32 cents. You can probably see where I \nam headed with this. It cost the defendant in a class action suit 37 \ncents to send a settlement check worth 32 cents. I don't have the \nexpertise in economics like my good friend and our former colleague \nSenator Gramm of Texas, but I can tell you, forcing a defendant to \nspend 37 cents to send somebody a 32-cent check does not make much \neconomic sense, and it certainly defies common sense.\n  Let me point out the most disturbing element about this lawsuit. My \nstaffer researched this case, and it may be of interest to all of our \ncolleagues to note that the unwitting plaintiff received 32 cents in \ncompensation from this class action lawsuit, and her lawyers pocketed \nin excess of $7 million--$7 million. All in all, not a bad settlement \nif you happen to be a plaintiff's lawyer rather than a plaintiff.\n\n  And in case you think my staffer received an unusually low settlement \nin this litigation, let me quote from the letter accompanying the \nsettlement check:\n\n       At the time of the settlement, we estimated that the \n     average [refund] would be less than $1--\n\n  The average refund would be less than a dollar--\n\n     for each eligible [plaintiff]. That estimate proved correct.\n\n  So you see, while the settlement was being arranged, it was clear \neach plaintiff on average would receive less than $1. It was clear that \neach plaintiff would receive less than $1. Yet the plaintiffs' lawyers \nstill rake in more than $7 million.\n  My colleagues may also be interested to know how much the defendant \nwas forced to spend defending the lawsuit. Knowing the extent of the \ndefense costs is instructive in demonstrating how unjust these abusive \nsuits can be. So we asked the defendant how much it spent defending \nthis suit that provided each plaintiff with pennies and the lawyers \nwith millions. Perhaps not surprisingly, the defendant was not willing \nto discuss the matter. You see, the defendant told us that if it were \nreadily known just how much they spent defending the suit, then that \ninformation would almost certainly be used against them in the future. \nThe defendant feared that if their defense costs were known, then \nanother opportunistic plaintiff's lawyer would file another one of \nthese predatory suits, and then that lawyer would offer to settle for \njust slightly less than the millions he knew it would cost the \ndefendant to defend the suit.\n  This case illustrates how plaintiffs' lawyers exploit and abuse \ndefendants under the current system. Can there be any doubt that the \ncurrent class action system is in need of repair? When the lawyers get \nmore than $7 million and the plaintiff gets a check for 32 cents, \nsomething is terribly wrong. When defendants fear to disclose how much \nthey spend fighting these ridiculous suits because to do so would \ninvite even more litigation, something is terribly wrong. Justice is \nsupposed to be distributed fairly. This is clearly not a fair way to \ndistribute justice.\n  By passing this legislation, we are not going to end every 32-cent \naward to\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\nplaintiffs and multimillion dollar award to lawyers, but we certainly \ncan curb a great deal of this nonsense.\n  I know some of my friends on the other side of the aisle will \ncomplain this bill will sound the death knell for class actions in \nState court. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation, but it is also a moderate and \nreasonable piece of legislation.\n  Frankly, I liked the original version, but we are where we are today, \nand I will talk more about that in a moment. The bill on the floor is \nthe product of not one, not two, but three carefully crafted \ncompromises. Not one, not two, but three carefully crafted compromises. \nThese carefully crafted compromises have us to a point where we can \nenact meaningful reform that respects the ability of States to \nadjudicate local controversies as class actions while allowing Federal \ncourts to decide truly national class actions.\n  The House, frankly, would prefer a stronger bill, and so would I. I \nlike the original bill that stalled out at 59 votes last year. But the \nHouse also understands that the legislation on the floor is a good \nbill.\n  Therefore, the House is prepared to take this up and pass it without \namendment, assuming that our carefully crafted compromise is itself not \ncompromised on the Senate floor.\n  I had an opportunity to talk to Majority Leader Tom DeLay this \nmorning and he reiterated the statement that he and Chairman Jim \nSensenbrenner made last Friday and it is this: If this bill is passed \nwithout amendment in the Senate, the House will take it up immediately, \npass it, and send it to the President for signature. If it is altered \nin any way, the House will then follow the regular order and maybe \nsometime during this Congress we will get a class action bill.\n  Frankly, in my judgment, those who are skeptical of this bill would \nbe better off with this compromise version than having the House go \nthrough the regular order, in which case they would probably pass a \nbill much different from this compromise. We would ultimately have a \nconference and in all likelihood, out of that conference might come a \nbill more like the one we had last year, which stalled out at 59 votes.\n  So I would say that for those who are not terribly enthusiastic about \nthis compromise, it could get a lot worse from their point of view. \nThis compromise is one that people who have worked on this bill for \nyears are willing to take, and so our challenge is to keep it clean, to \ndefeat the amendments that would slow down the process and prevent this \nimportant piece of tort reform legislation from getting to the \nPresident for an early signature. So that is where we are.\n  We have a marvelous opportunity to demonstrate at the beginning of \nthis Congress that we are indeed going to be able to accomplish some \nimportant things on a bipartisan basis. This compromise bill appears to \nhave at least 62 Senators who are for it. Let us hold it together. Let \nus keep it as it is and demonstrate to the American public that we can \nwork together on a bipartisan basis and pass important legislation for \nour country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the next Senator to seek recognition is \nSenator Dodd. I am informed Senator Lott will be coming to the floor \nshortly to speak, and that soon thereafter Senator Durbin will offer \nhis amendment. It is now 11:18. That should take the time for floor \naction until the hour of 12:30 when we are scheduled under a previous \norder to recess for the party caucuses. So I now yield to Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I begin by thanking our colleague from \nPennsylvania for his leadership on this issue as the new chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, and also to commend our colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the committee. Despite \ntheir differences on this legislation, we are debating this bill \nbecause the managers have gone through the committee process and have \nproduced a product for the consideration of the full Senate. I am \npleased this bill is finally before us once again. It has been a year \nand a half since we last considered this legislation.\n  I also commend the two leaders, Senators Frist and Daschle, for \nworking as early as the fall of 2003 to try and craft a compromise. \nSenator Reid of Nevada has picked up on this and I want to particularly \ncommend Senator Reid. He has some strong reservations about this bill, \nas many of our colleagues do, but he has arranged, as the Democratic \nleader can, for this matter to come forward. Certainly all of my \ncolleagues are fully aware that a determined minority can pretty much \nstop anything from happening, but the Senator from Nevada, despite his \nreservations about this legislation, has worked through the process \nwith the distinguished majority leader.\n  The chairman of the committee, the ranking member, and those who are \ninterested in this bill are trying to move this matter forward. So I \nwould not want to begin my comments without commending the leaders, but \nparticularly the Democratic leader, my leader, for putting in the time \nand effort to see to it that this matter dealing with class action be a \npart of the Senate debate.\n  The legislation has had a rather long and torturous history, going \nback a number of years. I am not going to recite at length that \nhistory. I will only note that several of our colleagues deserve to be \nacknowledged for their long and steady persistence in bringing the \nSenate to this point. Those Senators include Senator Grassley of Iowa, \nSenator Kohl of Wisconsin, Senator Hatch of Utah, and Senator Feinstein \nof California. They have worked on the Judiciary Committee, in a very \nstrong bipartisan fashion, to try and bring this matter up.\n  I also want to highlight and mention Senator Carper of Delaware who \nhas been tireless in his support for this effort. Senator McConnell as \nwell has worked on this issue. Senator Landrieu, and Senator Schumer, I \nshould mention as well, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, have \nalso been a part of an effort to try and come up with a bill that could \nenjoy broad-based support.\n  I mentioned Senators Specter and Leahy at the outset of my remarks as \nthe chairman and ranking member who also worked well together to bring \nus to this point. I want to point out to my colleagues, of course, as \nsomeone who was very much involved in the negotiations back in the fall \nof 2003, that when the cloture motion failed, as pointed out by the \nSenator from Kentucky, within a few moments of that vote this Senator \nrose and offered to the majority at that point a willingness to sit \ndown that day in fact to try and work out differences that would allow \nfor this bill to go forward.\n  The distinguished majority leader accepted that offer and we \nimmediately began a process to put this bill together. In fact, several \nof us sent a letter at that time to Senator Frist. The letter was sent \nby myself, Senator Landrieu, Senator Schumer, and Senator Bingaman, \noutlining four areas that we thought if we could be accommodated in \nthese areas the bill could go forward in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter dated November 14, 2003, from \nthree of my colleagues and me to Senator Frist be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: We agree with the fundamental \n     principle of the pending class action legislation that would \n     permit removal of national class actions to federal court. \n     Under current law, there have been a number of instances of \n     unjustified forum-shopping and other abuses of the legal \n     process. We are committed to helping to reform the law to \n     ensure fair adjudication for all Americans. To that end, we \n     are writing to outline the policies that need to be addressed \n     in order to move the Senate toward a bill that can pass \n     before Congress adjourns for the year.\n       While we support the general thrust of S. 1751, there are \n     some instances where the legislation goes beyond the scope of \n     what we believe must be addressed. It is our view that we are \n     very close to having a bill that we can support and if we can \n     satisfactorily address each of the following issues, we can \n     move forward quickly with you to pass a reform bill.\n       Based upon our understanding of the issues that have been \n     discussed by you and the\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\n     Democratic Leader, we believe that most of our concerns are \n     readily solvable [while a narrow subset may require some \n     further negotiation to resolve.]\n       We believe more consideration must be given to the formula \n     for federal removal. We agree that many types of cases are \n     best considered in federal court. At the same time, we would \n     not want the Senate to fashion rules that permit the removal \n     of cases that are truly single-state cases which are \n     appropriately considered in state court. Additionally, we \n     should permit federal court judges to consider a set of \n     factors that includes both state and federal concerns when \n     determining whether a case in the ``middlethird'' of the \n     current formula should be removed.\n       Mass tort actions that are not brought as class actions \n     should be removed from the bill. The bill passed by the \n     Judiciary Committee did not contain this language. We \n     understand that the peculiarities of state law in two states \n     may need to be addressed. However, the current mass tort \n     standard is much broader than necessary to address issues \n     raised by two of the fifty states. We want to write a rule \n     that is as precise as possible--in this case, by encompassing \n     actions that are truly class actions, while at the same time \n     excluding any cases that are not.\n       There are several places in the bill that pre-empt current \n     law or allow for significant deviation from standard \n     practice. This has the effect of encouraging manipulation or \n     abuse by either side, and should not be allowed in reform \n     legislation. The current version of the removal provision \n     permits removal at any time, even during trial. This includes \n     a potential ``merry-go-round effect'' of repeated removal and \n     remand between state and federal courts. Additionally, the \n     underlying bill does not specify when the court would measure \n     the plaintiff class and it creates a new appellate review of \n     remand orders.\n       In many cases, plaintiffs, who take the risk of coming \n     forward, should be able to be compensated for that risk. The \n     bill currently requires their recovery to be precisely the \n     same as all other members of the class. Different risks and \n     different damages in civil rights and other claims, should \n     receive different compensation, upon approval of the trial \n     judge.\n       Lastly, the underlying bill simply restates current law in \n     requiring judges to review coupon settlements. Given the \n     clear problems that have been raised with abusive coupon \n     settlements, we believe it is imperative to include stronger \n     provisions that the attorneys' fees to the actual coupons \n     redeemed.\n       While time is short in this session, there is no reason why \n     the Senate cannot consider this legislation in a bi-partisan \n     spirit. If we indeed reach agreement, it is critical that the \n     agreement be honored as the bill moves forward--both in and \n     beyond the Senate. We are prepared to work with you toward \n     that end and we look forward to hearing from you soon as \n     possible as to how we can best move this legislation forward.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mary L. Landrieu.\n     Charles Schumer.\n     Christopher J. Dodd.\n     Jeff Bingaman.\n\n  Mr. DODD. As a result of that letter, we went through several days of \nnegotiations on this bill. The four areas that we sought changes in the \nbill are the following: Removal of formula including the definition of \nmass torts; the so-called merry-go-round problem in the bill; coupon \nsettlements; and fair compensation for named plaintiffs. Those are the \nfour areas we identified in the November 14 letter. As a result of our \nnegotiations, we came back with 12 improvements in this bill, agreed to \nby myself, Senators Frist, Grassley, Hatch, Kohl, Landrieu, and \nSchumer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of the 12 changes that was a \nresult of that negotiation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of Changes to S. 1751 as Agreed to by Senators Frist, Grassley, \n            Hatch, Kohl, Carper, Dodd, Landrieu, and Schumer\n\n\n          The Compromise Improves Coupon Settlement Procedures\n\n       S. 1751 would have continued to allow coupon settlements \n     even though only a small percentage of coupons are actually \n     redeemed by class members in many cases.\n       The compromise proposal requires that attorneys fees be \n     based either on (a) the proportionate value of coupons \n     actually redeemed by class members or (b) the hours actually \n     billed in prosecuting the class action. The compromise \n     proposal also adds a provision permitting federal courts to \n     require that settlement agreements provide for charitable \n     distribution of unclaimed coupon values.\n\n\n The Compromise Eliminates the So-called Bounty Prohibition in S. 1751\n\n       S. 1751 would have prevented civil rights and consumer \n     plaintiffs from being compensated for the particular \n     hardships they endure as a result of initiating and pursuing \n     litigation.\n       The compromise deletes the so-called ``bounty provision'' \n     in S. 1751, thereby allowing plaintiffs to receive special \n     relief for enduring special hardships as class members.\n\n\n  The Compromise Eliminates the Potential for Notification Burden and \n                               Confusion\n\n       S. 1751 would have created a complicated set of \n     unnecessarily burdensome notice requirements for notice to \n     potential class members. The compromise eliminates this \n     unnecessary burden and preserves current federal law related \n     to class notification.\n\n\n        The Compromise Provides For Greater Judicial Discretion\n\n       S. 1751 included several factors to be considered by \n     district courts in deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction \n     over class action in which between one-third and two-thirds \n     of the proposed class members and all primary defendants are \n     citizens of the same state.\n       The compromise provides for broader discretion by \n     authorizing federal courts to consider any ``distinct'' nexus \n     between (a) the forum where the action was brought and (b) \n     the class members, the alleged harm, or the defendants. The \n     proposal also limits a court's authority to base federal \n     jurisdiction on the existence of similar class actions filed \n     in other states by disallowing consideration of other cases \n     that are more than three years old.\n\n\n        The Compromise Expands the Local Class Action Exception\n\n       S. 1751 established an exception to prevent removal of a \n     class action to federal court when 2/3 of the p1aintiffs are \n     from the state where the action was brought and the ``primary \n     defendants'' are also from that state (the Feinstein \n     formula). The compromise retains the Feinstein formula and \n     creates a second exception that allows cases to remain in \n     state court if: (1) more than 2/3 of class members are \n     citizens of the forum state; (2) there is at least one in-\n     state defendant from whom significant relief is sought and \n     who contributed significantly to the alleged harm; (3) the \n     principal injuries happened within the state where the action \n     was filed; and (4) no other class action asserting the same \n     or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants \n     on behalf of the same or other persons has been filed during \n     the preceding three years.\n\n\n The Compromise Creates a Bright Line For Determining Class Composition\n\n       S. 1751 was silent on when class composition could be \n     measured and arguably would have allowed class composition to \n     be challenged at any time during the life of the case. The \n     compromise clarifies that citizenship of proposed class \n     members is to be determined on the date plaintiffs filed the \n     original complaint, or if there is no federal jurisdiction \n     over the first complaint, when plaintiffs serve an amended \n     complaint or other paper indicating the existence of federal \n     jurisdiction.\n\n\n        The Compromise Eliminates the ``Merry-Go-Round'' Problem\n\n       S. 1751 would have required federal courts to dismiss class \n     actions if the court determined that the case did not meet \n     Rule 23 requirements. The compromise eliminates the dismissal \n     requirement, giving federal courts discretion to handle Ru1e \n     23-ineligible cases appropriately. Potentially meritorious \n     suits will thus not be automatically dismissed simply because \n     they fail to comply with the class certification requirements \n     of Rule 23.\n\n\n           The Compromise Improves Treatment of Mass Actions\n\n       S. 1751 would have treated all mass actions involving over \n     100 claimants as if they were class actions. The compromise \n     makes several changes to treat mass actions more like \n     individual cases than like class actions when appropriate.\n       The compromise changes the jurisdictional amount \n     requirement. Federal jurisdiction shall only exist over those \n     persons whose claims satisfy the normal diversity \n     jurisdictional amount requirement for individual actions \n     under current law (presently $75,000).\n       The compromise expands the ``single sudden accident'' \n     exception so that federal jurisdiction shall not exist over \n     mass actions in which all claims arise from any ``event or \n     occurrence'' that happened in the state where the action was \n     filed and that allegedly resulted in injuries in that state \n     or in a contiguous state. The proposal also added a provision \n     clarifying that there is no federal jurisdiction under the \n     mass action provision for claims that have been consolidated \n     solely for pretrial purposes.\n\n\n  The Compromise Eliminates the Potential For Abusive Plaintiff Class \n                                Removals\n\n       S. 1751 would have changed current law by allowing any \n     plaintiff class member to remove a case to federal court even \n     if all other class members wanted the case to remain in state \n     court. The compromise retains current law--allowing \n     individual plaintiffs to opt out of class actions, but not \n     allowing them to force entire classes into federal court.\n\n\n The Compromise Eliminates the Potential for Abusive Appeals of Remand \n                                 Orders\n\n       S. 1751 would have allowed defendants to seek unlimited \n     appellate review of federal court orders remanding cases to \n     state courts. If a defendant requested an appeal, the federal \n     courts would have been required to hear the appeal and the \n     appeals could have taken months or even years to complete.\n       The compromise makes two improvements: (1) grants the \n     federal courts discretion to refuse to hear an appeal if the \n     appeal is not in the interest of justice; (2) Establishes \n     tight deadlines for completion of any appeals\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\n     so that no case can be delayed more than 77 days, unless all \n     parties agree to a longer period.\n\n\nThe Compromise Preserves the Rulemaking Authority of Supreme Court and \n                          Judicial Conference\n\n       The compromise clarifies that nothing in the bill restricts \n     the authority of the Judicial Conference and Supreme Court to \n     implement new rules relating to class actions.\n\n\n                   The Compromise Is Not Retroactive\n\n       Unlike the House bill, the compromise will not \n     retroactively change the rules governing jurisdiction over \n     class actions.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I will not go through and name each one of them. Some of \nthem are rather arcane but nevertheless important provisions of this \nbill, the point being that we were prepared basically in the fall of \n2003 to go forward.\n  We were notified at that point that the first item of business in \nJanuary of 2004, more than a year ago, would be the class action reform \nbill. Well, here we are in February of 2005 finally getting to this \nmatter. There was a prepared bipartisan bill over a year ago on class \naction and we are now dealing with exactly the same bill. As the \nSenator from Kentucky pointed out, he would have preferred the House \nbill, the bill that was not approved when the cloture motion was held, \nand reluctantly is supporting this bill.\n  There are those of us who could not have supported the House bill or \nthe version that came up in the Senate earlier, but we have worked very \nhard to put this compromise together over a year ago. So we could have \ndealt with this a long time ago, but nonetheless we are here today and \nthat is the good news.\n  I am heartened that the other body has agreed to accept this version \nif it goes unamended over the next day or so during the debate and \nconsideration of this legislation. I am hopeful that will be the case.\n  Very briefly, I will go through what we have achieved. As I \nmentioned, following the vote Senator Frist asked myself and others, \nincluding my good friend from Delaware who is on the floor today, to \nenter into discussions with him and other Members to explore whether \nthere might be some ways of building greater support for this bill. \nSenators Schumer and Landrieu joined in writing a letter to the \nmajority leader, which I have put into the Record already, in which we \nlaid out the four areas of our concerns. We subsequently entered into \nthose negotiations among our four offices. Senators Grassley, Kohl, \nHatch, and Carper played very important roles in that consideration. \nThose negotiations were very productive. We reached significant \nagreement not on the four original areas of concern but on eight others \nas well. That point deserves special emphasis. We went into the \nnegotiations seeking improvement on four issues. We emerged with \nsignificant changes on 12 issues.\n  The result is a bill that is now before this body. In my view, it is \nvery fair and balanced, rather modest legislation that addresses a \nnumber of well documented shortcomings in our Nation's class action \nsystem. It shows what we can accomplish in the Senate when we work \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion. As with all good compromises, this \nbill is entirely satisfactory to no one and in some respects \nunsatisfactory to everyone.\n  There are those who will say this bill does not go nearly far enough \nin rectifying the shortcomings of the class action system in our \ncountry. On the other hand, there are those who believe that the sky is \nfalling, that the bill severely impairs the ability of people to gain \naccess to our courts. In my judgment, claims of both sides are vastly \noverstated. One of the reasons why I believe this is so is that the \npeople on both sides of the legislation, proponents and opponents \nalike, agree our compromise has made this bill better. It targets more \nprecisely those problems in need of reform and addresses them in an \nappropriate and effective manner.\n  We will no doubt discuss those problems in more detail in the coming \nhours, but allow me to briefly mention two of them. Perhaps the central \nproblem addressed by the compromise is the forum shopping issue. \nArticle III of the Federal Constitution sets forth the circumstances \nunder which cases may be heard in Federal court. Article 2 of Article \nIII extends Federal jurisdiction to suits ``between citizens of \ndifferent States.'' These are known as diversity cases. The Framers had \ntwo separate but related reasons for allowing Federal courts to hear \ncases between citizens of different States.\n\n  Very simply, one was to prevent the possibility that the courts of \none State would discriminate against the citizens of another State. The \nsecond reason was to prevent the possibility that the courts of one \nState would discriminate against interstate business and thereby impede \ninterstate commerce. Over the years, however, class action rules have \nbeen interpreted in such a way that plaintiffs' lawyers have been able \nto keep class actions out of Federal court, even those that are \nprecisely the kind of cases for which diversity jurisdiction was \ncreated, because of their interstate character. They do this by adding \nnamed plaintiffs or defendants solely based on their State of \ncitizenship in order to defeat the diversity requirement.\n  Alternatively, they allege an amount in controversy that does not \ntrigger the $75,000 threshold for removing cases to Federal court. The \nresult is frequently an absurd one. A slip-and-fall case in which a \nplaintiff alleges, say, $76,000 in damages can end up in Federal court. \nAt the same time, a case involving millions of plaintiffs from multiple \nStates and billions of dollars in alleged damages is heard in State \ncourt, just because no plaintiff claims more than $75,000 in damages or \nbecause at least one defendant is from the same State of at least one \nplaintiff.\n  Section four of the bill modifies these diversity rules to allow \nFederal courts to hear diversity cases that have a strong interstate \ncharacter. In particular, it allows Federal jurisdiction if the amount \nin controversy alleged by all plaintiffs exceeds $5 million and if any \nmember of the plaintiff class is a citizen of a different State than \nany defendant. At the same time, the bill creates careful exceptions \nthat allow cases to remain in State courts where those cases are \nprimarily intrastate actions that lack national implications.\n  The legislation attempts to bring diversity rules more in line with \nthe original purpose of Federal diversity jurisdiction. Cases that are \ninterstate in nature because they involve citizens of multiple States \nand interstate commerce may be heard in Federal courts. Cases that are \nnot interstate in nature remain in State courts.\n  A second problem the compromise addresses is the so-called coupon \nsettlements. As our colleagues may know, a growing number of class \naction cases involves these type of settlements. In a typical coupon \nsettlement, class members receive only a promotional coupon to reduce \nthe cost of a defendant's products while the lawyers for the class \naction receive a rather large fee that is disproportionate to any \nclient benefit.\n  For instance, in one case a soft drink company was sued for \nimproperly adding sweeteners in apple juice. The company agreed to \nsettle the case. The settlement required it to distribute to customers \na 50-percent coupon off the purchase of apple juice. Meanwhile, class \ncounsel received $1.5 million in cash.\n  I have no problem with attorneys earning a fee for their services. In \nfact, the compromise bill places no caps at all on attorney fees, \nalthough there were those who wanted to do that.\n  But what is particularly disturbing about these coupon settlements is \nclass members typically redeem only a small portion of the coupons \nawarded. In fact, over the years only 10 or 20 percent of coupons were \nactually redeemed. Yet the attorneys are paid regardless of how many \ncoupons are cashed in.\n  In effect, there is a negative incentive for counsel for both \nplaintiffs and defendants to enter into such settlements. Counsel for \nthe plaintiff is paid their fee regardless of the percentage of coupons \nredeemed. At the same time, counsel for the defendants know they are \nlikely to pay in redeemed coupons only a fraction of what they would \npay if they paid cash to settle a case. Meanwhile, the actual class \nmembers--the ones who have actually been aggrieved--receive a benefit \nof little or no value at all.\n  Our compromise takes several steps to remove this negative incentive \nto enter into coupon settlements. Most importantly, it states that an \nattorney's fee incurred to obtain a coupon\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\nsettlement can only be paid in proportion to the percentage of coupons \nactually redeemed. For example, if an attorney's fee for obtaining a \ncoupon settlement is $5 million but only one-fifth of the coupons are \nactually redeemed, the attorney can only recover one-fifth of his or \nher fee--roughly $1 million.\n  In addition, the bill requires that a judge may not approve a coupon \nsettlement until he or she conducts a hearing to determine whether \nsettlement terms are fair, reasonable, and adequate for class members.\n  There are other provisions of the bill that are also important.\n  In the interest of time--I see my colleague from Mississippi also \nwants to speak before our colleague from Illinois offers the first \namendment--I will defer discussing them in detail at this hour. \nHowever, to reinforce my central argument that this is a reasonable, \nmodest piece of legislation, it is worth mentioning what the bill does \nnot do.\n  First, it does not apply retroactively, despite those who wanted it \nto. A case filed before the date of enactment will be unaffected by any \nprovision of this legislation.\n  Second, this legislation does not distinguish in any way or alter a \npending case.\n  Third, it does not in any way alter substantive law or otherwise \naffect any individual's right to seek equitable and monetary relief.\n  Fourth, in does not in any way limit damages, including punitive \ndamages.\n  Fifth, it does not cap attorney fees.\n  These are all matters that some people wanted to include in the bill.\n  And, it also does not impose more rigorous pleading requirements of \nevidentiary burdens of proof.\n  As some of our colleagues have said, this legislation is actually \nmore court reform than tort reform. Candidly, I think they are more \nright than wrong about that. This is more court reform than tort \nreform. It stands in very sharp contrast to some of the other \nlegislation considered by the Senate in the last Congress. That \nincludes the Energy bill, which extinguished pending and future suits \nagainst makers of MTBE, a highly toxic substance that pollutes ground \nwater.\n  It also includes legislation that shielded gunmakers and gun dealers \nfrom many types of lawsuits.\n  Incredibly, we were about to adopt legislation that would completely \nexclude an entire industry even when there was complete negligence on \ntheir behalf of being sued. I suggested when we were about to adopt \nthose bills that Members think about talking about tort reform. Those \nmatters cause this Senator deep concern, despite the fact I represent \nthe largest gun producers in the United States. I cannot imagine my \ninsurance companies getting a deal as the gun manufacturers were about \nto get. Nonetheless, those bills died, as they should have, in my \nopinion.\n  The legislation before the Senate today does not close the courthouse \ndoor to a single citizen in this country. Maybe that citizen will end \nup in Federal court rather than State court, but no citizen will lose \nthe sacred right in America to seek redress or grievance in a court of \nlaw.\n  When this compromise was written 15 months ago, it was said that it \nwas critical that this bill be honored as the bill moves forward--both \nwithin and beyond the Senate. I continue to believe that to be the \ncase.\n  In the words of the Senator from Kentucky earlier today, as well as \nstatements made by Speaker Hastert, this Member is assured that, in \nfact, the agreements will be kept. In fact, I had a conversation with \nthe staff of Mr. Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, who reinforced the notion that if we adopt this bill as it \npresently reads, then there will no changes in the House and they will \naccept the Senate language. That is good news for those of us who have \nworked on this compromise.\n  Certainly, this is not a perfect bill. No bill is. We all know that, \nbut I think it strikes a careful balance between remedying the \nshortcomings and retaining the strengths of current class action \npractice in this country.\n  Obviously, the bill is not yet through the Senate. But the consent \nagreement entered into by the two leaders is an auspicious beginning to \npreserving the balance.\n  Let me, once again, reiterate my thanks to Senator Reid of Nevada, \nthe distinguished Democratic leader, and for Senator Frist entering \ninto that agreement which allows us to have this debate, and for all \nrelevant and germane amendments to be considered to this legislation. \nCertainly, that is the way it ought to be done.\n  Moreover, I note that the leadership of the other body has indicated \nits willingness to respect the balance that this bill strikes, as well. \nThat, too, is a positive development.\n  I stand in strong support of this legislation. I think it is a good \ncompromise. It is not a perfect one. I know my colleagues may offer \nsome amendments that I might have been attracted to under different \ncircumstances which I may support, but when you try to reach agreement \nhere, it is not easy. And when you do, I think it is worthy of support, \nparticularly when those agreements cover as much territory as we did \nduring the compromise efforts 15 months ago.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, there were four proposals with which we \nended the negotiations. Those four proposals were adopted, and eight \nothers were added during that negotiation.\n  I commend again the leader. I commend Senators Specter and Leahy for \ntheir efforts, and I look forward to this bill passing the Senate and \nbeing adopted by the House and going to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Class \nAction Fairness Act of 2005.\n  Before he leaves the floor, I thank the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd, for his comments and for his leadership in this area. He has been \nsteadfast. He has been involved in the process of moving this bill \nforward. A process which involves some give and take and some \ncompromise.\n  Surprise, surprise. That is the legislative process. This is not a \nperfect bill, as he noted. It is not one that I particularly like. I \nwould like to make it a lot stronger, but it is a major step forward.\n  I thank Senator Dodd, and other Senators. Senator Carper has been \ninvolved in that process, and colleagues on this side of the aisle.\n  I am pleased that the first substantive bill of the year is one that \ntruly has a chance to make a huge difference in this country, and it is \na bipartisan effort. It is one that I predict, when we go through the \namendment process and get to the end, will have a large vote in \nsupport. I will not be surprised if it gets 70 votes. I hope for that. \nThat would be a positive step.\n  If we can hold the line on amendments that may be offered--some that \nI would be attracted to, some that Senators such as Senator Dodd would \nbe attracted to--but we worked out an agreement. We should brush back \nthose amendments, discourage a whole raft of amendments being \ncontemplated, and complete our work. The House has indicated they will \naccept this product--the compromise we came up with. When was the last \ntime you heard of that even being possible?\n  But they have reaffirmed just in the last few days that, yes, if we \ncan complete it the way it is presently structured, they will take it \nup, pass our bill, and send it to the President. That would be a good \nway to start this year.\n  I thank colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the work that has \nbeen done.\n  Senator Hatch is here managing the legislation. He has worked on this \nlong and hard, including last year when we had an opportunity that \nslipped away from us for a variety of reasons. It was tough last year \nto get much of anything done with all of us preoccupied with the \nPresidential campaign and our Senate campaigns and the House races. \nThere is no use going back and rehashing why we didn't get it \ncompleted. We didn't get the job done. But we can do it now.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for the work he has done on this bill over the \nyears, and Senator Specter for getting it out of the Judiciary \nCommittee in good order. I thank Senator Grassley for his usual dogged \ndetermination to not give up on an issue, and he continues to press not \nonly this but the bankruptcy reform issues.\n  I am thankful for the way we are starting off this year. I thank the \nleadership for working out an agreement to\n\n[[Page S1081]]\n\nbring this bill to the floor. We could very well have had a filibuster. \nBut Senator Frist, working with Senator Reid, has indicated we are not \ngoing to get into that morass. We are going to step up to this issue, \nwe are going to address it and debate it, and we are going to get \nresults. I think that is good.\n  I believe the American people want us to complete action on this \nlegislation and pass the bipartisan compromise this week, if at all \npossible.\n  There is no reason for this to be dragged out over a long period of \ntime. We know there are a few amendments that are going to be offered. \nWe will debate them. Let us vote and get to the conclusion of this \nprocess in the Senate, and send it to the House so they can take it up.\n  Why do we need this bill?\n  Some people would say we have the greatest judicial and jurisprudence \nsystem in the world. Things are working fine. Let us just leave it \nalone.\n  I don't believe things are exactly working just fine. Every system \nover a period of time needs some adjustment, and if abuses begin to \noccur, we must step up and stop them.\n\n  Over the past decade, we have seen a dramatic rise in the number of \ninterstate class actions being filed in State courts, particularly in \nwhat are called magnet jurisdictions. I regret to say, and acknowledge, \nmy State is one of the worst abusers. To the credit of our State \nlegislature and our Governor, Haley Barbour, last year in Mississippi \nwe passed tort reform legislation. We have gone from being the center \nof jackpot justice to being a State that has been praised by legal \njournals and the Wall Street Journal as having stepped up to the issue \nand dealt with it in a responsible way. They now describe my State in \nthis way: Mississippi, open for business.\n  Prior to tort reform though, businesses, industry, manufacturers, \ndrugstores, etc. would not come to Mississippi to do business. They \nwere not coming to my State, one of the poorest States in the Nation, \nbecause of the abuses that have been occurring in the legal system.\n  But now, we have done our part in Mississippi. We still need to do \nmore, but this is a Federal interstate problem and we in Congress are \ngoing to have to help address it.\n  Courts where the class action mechanism is routinely and egregiously \nabused have been proliferating. In many instances we know the \nplaintiffs get little or nothing, and the lawyers have gotten massive \nfees. I can cite example after example in my State where awards have \nbeen de minimus or nothing. Jefferson County, MS, in my State is one of \nthe worst, most abused magnet jurisdictions in the country. Far too \noften innocent local business men and women are joined as defendants in \ncontroversies to which they were merely innocent bystanders, all \nbecause plaintiffs' lawyers wanted to file the case in Jefferson County \nfor the purpose of getting a bigger fee. Often, the cases have no other \nrelationship to that county or to my State other than this is a good \nplace to go. This is unconscionable. We have an obligation to our \nconstituents to put a stop to it.\n  Before going any further, it is important we take note of the title \nof this legislation: Class Action Fairness Act. This is not just some \nrandom title that Senator Grassley or others came up with. The whole \npoint of the bill is to make the class action mechanism fair for all \ninvolved.\n  Some of my colleagues will argue today, I am sure, that the system is \nalready fair. I ask, Is it fair for the plaintiffs in a class action \nsuit to receive nothing, literally nothing, when the lawyers \nrepresenting them receive $19 million? The citation is Shields et al. \nv. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. et al.\n  That is an actual case. Is it fair for the claims of residents of \nMississippi, Washington, or Maine to be decided according to Illinois \nState law? Of course not. These are just two of the many reasons we \nneed class action fairness, and we need it now.\n  Our Nation's judicial system was designed to be the fairest in the \nworld for all litigation, and we have gotten away from that. These \nabuses have called into question the very fairness of our whole system. \nIt is imperative we act to close these loopholes that have allowed this \nprocess to fail in the way that it has.\n  Before I talk about the specifics of what this bill does, let me take \na minute to emphasize a few things the bill does not do. We will hear \nthese allegations over the next few days, I am sure. This bill is not a \ntort reform bill, it is a court reform bill. This bill does not alter \nin any way substantive law. There may be some here who would want to \ndebate that. However, I made that point at a meeting earlier today and \nI have gone back and checked it with experts. That is an accurate \nstatement.\n  Contrary to the scare tactics of the plaintiffs' lawyers, this bill \ndoes not affect an individual's right to seek redress or damages \nthrough the court, and it does not in any way limit damages, either \npunitive or compensatory.\n\n  What does it do? First, it expands the jurisdiction of Federal courts \nover large interstate class actions. Clearly, that is a Federal \njurisdictional issue and one we have a right and a real need to get \ninto.\n  Let's be clear. We are only talking about those cases in which the \naggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, in which there are \nat least 100 plaintiffs, and in which any plaintiff is a citizen of a \ndifferent State from any defendant. This makes basic sense. Where you \nhave more than 100 class members and where parties to the litigation \nare from different States, the Federal courts should have jurisdiction. \nThis provides fundamental fairness for all involved. The Framers of our \nConstitution were concerned about ensuring fairness in cases like this, \nworried that State courts could be biased in favor of a home State \nparty versus another party who was a resident of a different State. \nThat is the very reason for a Federal diversity jurisdiction.\n  It only makes sense that we close the loopholes that a growing number \nare abusing and exploiting with the result of creating a system that is \nhaving a huge impact in terms of dollar amounts and business and \neconomic development.\n  It is also important to note that this bill does not apply to every \nclass action, only those meeting certain criteria. It is not going to \nresult in our Federal courts being overwhelmed by a large number of \nclass actions. We will hear that accusation this week. And it will not \nmove all class actions to Federal court. In fact, it leaves in State \ncourts a significant number of class actions. It reserves for State \ncourts those cases in which all plaintiffs and defendants are residents \nof the same State. It reserves for State court those class actions with \nless than 100 plaintiffs. Likewise, class actions involving an amount \nin controversy of less than $5 million would remain in the State court \nas would class actions in which a State government entity is the \nprimary defendant.\n  As a part of the compromise worked out with Senator Feinstein last \nyear, class actions that are brought against a company in its home \nState and in which two-thirds or more of the class members are also \nresidents of that State would remain in State court.\n  Finally, State courts would retain jurisdiction over class actions \ninvolving local controversies where at least two-thirds of the class \nmembers and one real defendant are residents of the State where the \naction is brought. This bill reserves these cases for State court \nbecause it is the right thing to do.\n  There are other provisions of importance in this bill, including a \nconsumer class action bill of rights. As many know, part of this \nsection represents a compromise worked out by Senators Schumer, Dodd, \nand Landrieu last year. Notably, it places limitations on contingency \nawards for attorneys in coupon settlement cases. By basing these \ncontingency fees on the value of the coupons that are actually \nredeemed, or the amount of time expended by the attorney, it provides \nfor a far greater protection for plaintiff class members. This \nprovision takes a big step toward addressing the grossly inequitable \nfee awards to attorneys when class members end up with a coupon.\n  Additionally, by requiring the judge to make a written finding that \nthe benefits to class members substantially outweigh the monetary loss \nfrom a settlement, the bill provides an added layer of protection for \nclass members who will suffer a net monetary loss as a result of \npayment of attorney's fees.\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\n  Do not get me wrong. I went to law school. I practiced law for a \nwhile. Yes, I was on the defense side of the ledger most of the time. \nBut I have to admit reluctantly that my brother-in-law--I am really not \nrelated to him by blood; he married my wife's sister--is one of the, \nshall we say more famous lawyers in this country, Richard Scruggs. He \nhas brought a lot of lawsuits I don't like. On occasion he actually \nmakes a point with some of those lawsuits. I don't want to put him out \nof business, but I want some reasonable restraint on how these class \naction suits have been abused. He has not been one of the ones who \nactually wound up having abused lawsuits in the courts, as he winds up \ngetting settlements most of the time.\n  I understand both sides of this equation. I certainly do not want to \ntake away people's right to sue--individuals or even class actions, \nwhen they are really a class. That is not what has been happening. \nThere has been an effort to dredge up clients, and it has led to the \nnext area I will talk about, mass actions.\n  There is language in this bill dealing with mass actions. I \nunderstand there may be an effort later today or this week to change \nthis section with an amendment that I understand may be offered. But it \nis vital that we retain the mass action section of the bill without an \namendment so that we don't open the door for lawyers to make an end run \naround what we are trying to do with class actions in this bill.\n  The mass action section was specifically included to prevent \nplaintiffs' lawyers from making this end run. It will ensure that class \naction-like cases are covered by the bill's jurisdictional provisions \neven if the cases are not pleaded as class actions.\n\n  The amendment that we are hearing may be offered later today is a \nlittle sleight of hand. This is a case where you argue that you're only \nchanging one word but, in reality, you fundamentally alter what happens \nwith regard to these mass actions. There are a few States, such as my \nState--which do not provide a class action device. In those States, \nplaintiffs' lawyers often bring together hundreds, sometimes thousands \nof plaintiffs to try their claims jointly without having to meet the \nclass action requirements, and often the claims of the multiple \nplaintiffs have little to do with each other. There was an instance in \nmy State where you had more plaintiffs in one of these mass actions \nthan you had people in the county, more than the residents in the \ncounty. Under the mass action provision, defendants will be able to \nremove these mass actions to Federal court under the same circumstances \nin which they will be able to remove class actions. However, a Federal \ncourt would only exercise jurisdiction over those claims meeting the \n$75,000 minimum threshold. To be clear, in order for a Federal court to \ntake jurisdiction over a mass action, under this bill there must be \nmore than 100 plaintiffs, minimal diversity must exist, and the total \namount in controversy must exceed $5 million. In other words, the same \nsafeguards that apply to removal of class actions would apply to mass \nactions.\n  Mass actions cannot be removed to Federal court if they fall into one \nof four categories: One, if all the claims arise out of an event or \noccurrence that happened in the State where the action was filed and \nthat resulted in injuries only in that State or contiguous States. That \nmakes sense. The second exception would be, if it is the defendants who \nseek to have the claims joined for trial; third, if the claims are \nasserted on behalf of the general public pursuant to a State statute; \nand, lastly, if the claims have been consolidated or coordinated for \npretrial purposes only.\n  Some of my colleagues will oppose this mass actions provision and \nwill want to gut it by making an effort to confuse mass actions with \nmass torts. I realize we are kind of getting into a legalese \ndiscussion, but words make a difference when you are considering a bill \nsuch as this. I am very concerned that the real motive is to render \nthis provision meaningless, thereby creating a loophole for the trial \nlawyers to basically get a class action by another name.\n  Mass torts and mass actions are not the same. The phrase ``mass \ntorts'' refers to a situation in which many persons are injured by the \nsame underlying cause, such as a single explosion, a series of events, \nor exposure to a particular product. In contrast, the phrase ``mass \naction'' refers to a specific type of lawsuit in which a large number \nof plaintiffs seek to have all their claims adjudicated in one combined \ntrial. Mass actions are basically disguised class actions.\n  If we enact the amendment that we are hearing may be offered to alter \nthe mass action section, if we do not keep the mass action section \nintact, we will be knowingly creating a loophole that would undermine \nour whole effort in getting some responsible reform.\n  I also understand there is another amendment that will be offered, \nand it has been referred to as the choice of law amendment. That has a \ngood sound, choice of law. To me, that is another word for shopping \naround to find the best forum, once again, with no relation to where \nthe incident occurred or where the plaintiffs live, or the defendants, \nor anything.\n  I have spoken to several of my colleagues about this amendment in the \nlast week or two, and some of them have even said to me: Don't you \nthink we should include this amendment? My answer is no. This is a bad \namendment. In my opinion, it is a poison pill. If we accept this choice \nof law amendment, basically the plaintiffs' lawyers can go to Federal \ncourt and say: OK, it is in Federal court, but we want to look at \nthis State law, that State law, or another State law, depending on \nwhich one suits our particular cause the best. If this amendment is \noffered and passes, we would certainly have to go to conference then \nwith the House. It would delay our efforts to get a final bill. And if \nwe could not come up with a solution in conference that did not include \nthis amendment, we would not get a bill.\n\n  So the phrase ``choice of law'' does sound nice, but the amendment \nactually would alter very fundamental legal principles. It would \nrequire Federal courts to apply one State's laws when adjudicating a \nnationwide class action. Here is what that means. If a nationwide class \naction is brought against a Mississippi company, the judge would be \nforced, under this amendment, to choose one State's law to apply to the \nwhole country. The Mississippi company, which typically conducts \nbusiness in Mississippi in compliance with Mississippi law and Federal \nlaw, would not necessarily have the protection of Mississippi law. Even \nthough the Mississippi law, with which the company complied, differed \nfrom, for example, Nebraska law, the judge could potentially choose to \napply Nebraska law.\n  So believe me, the proponents of this amendment know exactly what \nthey are doing. If it were adopted, it would perpetuate the forum \nshopping that has been going on in recent years that has led to one of \nmany areas of abuse.\n  Let me conclude because I know others want to speak. We want to get \nthe process started. It is a compromise bill. It is not perfect. There \nwill be different points of view. I have worked in this area for many \nyears. I have heard all the arguments. I have heard those arguments on \nthe floor of the Senate, in committee rooms, and at the family dinner \ntable.\n  I want people to be able to get justice and redress. But I do not see \nhow anybody can argue that there has not been abuse in the area of \nclass actions and in mass actions. It has certainly been abusive in my \nown State. What disgusts me the most is the lawyers it has made \nsuperwealthy while the claimants got almost nothing. We can do better. \nThis legislation will lead to a better solution.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to those of you who are following \nthe Senate in action, welcome to our first substantive bill. That is \nright, this is the first substantive bill that we are considering. Some \nmight conclude, if it is the first, it must be a very high priority.\n  Does it have to do with health care in America, the increasing costs \nof health care for families and businesses and individuals? No.\n  Does it have to do with education in America, how to improve our \nschools so we can compete in the 21st century? No.\n\n[[Page S1083]]\n\n  It must be the Federal Transportation bill then. We know we need \nthat. We are 2 years late in passing that bill, and we need the money \nspent in America to build our infrastructure. Is this the Federal \nTransportation bill? No.\n  No, it does not have anything to do with health care or education or \ntransportation, despite the fact that every Senator in this Chamber, \nwhen they go back to their States and meet with their people, hears \nabout those issues.\n  Senator, what are you going to do about the cost of health insurance? \nIt is killing my business. Senator, what are you going to do about the \nPresident's No Child Left Behind, an unfunded Federal mandate? We are \nhaving trouble with our school districts back in Illinois and Utah and \nother places. What are you going to do about that? Senator, when are \nyou going to pass the Federal Transportation bill? We need to improve \nour highways in Illinois.\n  Those are the comments we hear. But, no, when it comes to the very \nfirst bill, the highest priority of the Republican leadership in this \nCongress, we are going to deal with what they have characterized as a \nlitigation crisis.\n  Richard Milhous Nixon, former President of the United States, wrote a \nfamous book during his public career entitled: ``My Six Crises.'' Well, \nif you pay close attention to the Bush administration, you will find \nthat they are way beyond six crises. They have told us we had a \nnational security crisis that required the invasion of Iraq; an \neconomic crisis which required tax cuts for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica; a vacancy crisis in the Federal courts, despite the fact that \nthis Senate had approved 204 of the President's 214 judges he sent to \nus. We were told we had a moral crisis requiring constitutional \namendments. And just last week, the President has told us we have a \nSocial Security crisis.\n  It is hard to keep up with this White House and all their crises. And \nhere today, we are told we have a litigation crisis and a sense of \nurgency to deal with this bill. Yet the facts do not back it up.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which is a \npart of the Federal judiciary, tort actions in Federal district courts \nfrom 2002 to 2003 dropped by 28 percent.\n  Over the last 5 years, Federal civil filings have not only decreased \nby 8 percent, the percentage of civil filings that are personal injury \ncases has declined to a mere 18.2 percent of the total docket.\n  The same thing is happening at the State level. So the statistics \ntell us we are not seeing an onslaught of more and more cases. Just the \nopposite is true; that is, in cases filed by individuals.\n  The study also took a look to find out what American businesses were \ndoing--American businesses suing other businesses. It turns out \nAmerican businesses were 3 to 5 times more likely to file lawsuits than \nindividuals.\n  For example, in Mississippi, the State of the Senator previously \naddressing the Chamber and one of the States often criticized by tort \nreform advocates, Public Citizen found that businesses were more than \nfive times more likely to file suits than individuals. In that State, \nthere were 45,891 business lawsuits filed compared to 7,959 lawsuits by \nindividuals. You sure wouldn't know it listening to the comments on the \nfloor about a litigation crisis.\n  Along comes the self-styled group called the American Tort Reform \nAssociation. I think if you lift the lid on the American Tort Reform \nAssociation, you will find a lot of the big business interests in \nAmerica. They have come forward and decided that they are going to call \ncertain areas of America judicial hellholes. For example, their 2004 \nreport labeled the entire State of West Virginia as the No. 4 judicial \nhellhole in America. Why? The report states that in one county, Roane \nCounty, WV, which in its first 150 years never had a class action \nlawsuit, actually had two class action lawsuits filed in a year and a \nhalf--two in a year and a half, the No. 4 judicial hellhole in America.\n  Here is another exaggeration by the same group: the No. 6 judicial \nhellhole in America, Orleans Parish, LA. According to the report from \nthe American Tort Reform Association, a strong proponent of this bill, \nthis county earned the title because ``plaintiffs attorneys are turning \nmold into gold'' by representing a class of government attorneys \nworking in buildings containing toxic mold which caused health \nproblems. How many class action lawsuits were filed in Orleans Parish \nto make them a judicial hellhole? One.\n  The Senator from Mississippi spoke a few minutes earlier about abuses \nin his own State. Take a look at what happened in the State of \nMississippi. In 2002 and 2003, this same American Tort Reform \nAssociation listed Mississippi, its 22nd judicial district, as a \njudicial hellhole. In 2004, it didn't make the list. Why? Because the \nState actually received five pages of praise from the same group for \nchanging its State's laws to deal with class action lawsuits. This \nMississippi judicial hellhole became an object of praise and admiration \nwhen they fixed their own problem at the State level.\n  I can't avoid the topic of judicial hellholes without speaking for a \nmoment about Madison County, IL. The President was so upset about \nMadison County, IL, that he flew to Collinsville a couple weeks ago to \ncriticize their court system. Let's take a look at Madison County in \nterms of real numbers.\n  In 2004, Madison County ranked No. 1 by the American Tort Reform \nAssociation as the worst judicial hellhole in America. So what do we \nfind about the class action lawsuits that were filed in Madison County? \nOf the class action lawsuits filed in 2002, four were certified to go \nforward. All the rest of them languished and did not. Four cases in \n2002 went forward. But surely if they are a judicial hellhole, it got \nworse. But it didn't. In 2003, only one class action lawsuit was \ncertified. One. What happened in 2004? Not a single class action \nlawsuit has been certified. So when you hear these exaggerations on the \nfloor about judicial hellholes and all of these class action lawsuits, \nit turns out that the No. 1 example of a judicial hellhole--Madison \nCounty, IL--had no class action lawsuits that were certified in 2004.\n  We know what this is all about. We should get down to the basics. Why \nis the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spending over $1 billion to lobby us to \npass this bill? This is the largest amount of money ever recorded for \nlobbying activities and the first time that lobbying spending has \npassed the $1 billion mark. Why is it so important? According to \nSenator Lott and others, it is just a simple thing. We are going to \ntake class action lawsuits out of State courts and put them in Federal \ncourts. What is the matter with that? Federal courts are supposed to \nrepresent the Nation. These class action lawsuits have plaintiffs from \nall over the country. It seems reasonable.\n  If that is all there is to it, why would these business interests \nspend such an inordinately large sum of money to lobby us to pass it? \nBecause they know, as we know who have practiced law, that Federal \ncourts are unfriendly to class actions. Federal courts are less likely, \nby their own rulings, to certify a class. In other words, a class of \nplaintiffs files a lawsuit in Federal court, it is less likely it will \ngo forward. That is what this is all about. It isn't about class action \nfairness; this is the class action moratorium act.\n  Also, Federal law favors less liability in case after case. Federal \nlaw discourages Federal judges from providing remedies under State \nlaws. So the business interests that want to move these cases from \nState court to Federal court understand what it is all about. Fewer \ncases will survive. Those that do will pay less. That is what their \ngoal is. That is why they have spent this enormous amount of money \nlobbying Congress.\n  Listen to what the business interests say about the Class Action \nFairness Act before us:\n\n       It would simply allow Federal courts to more easily hear \n     large national class action lawsuits affecting consumers all \n     over the country.\n\n  How harmless. Yet they spent $1 billion lobbying to pass this bill as \nthe first bill of this Congress--before health care, before education, \nbefore the Federal transportation bill. They know, as we do, that class \naction lawsuits in Federal court are much less likely to survive.\n  Let me give an example, because the problem with talking about class \nactions is most people listening say: What in the world is he talking \nabout?\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\nIs this a class in school or class of people? Who are you referring to? \nLet me give a concrete example.\n  Charles and Jenny Will live in Granite City, IL, which happens to be \nin Madison County. They are an older couple. They live in a small blue \nand white wood-frame house. Their main source of income is Social \nSecurity. They are nice people. I am proud to have them as my \nconstituents. On their walls hang pictures of their kids and the Last \nSupper.\n  Mr. Will has 3 years of Active-Duty service in the U.S. Navy and a \nsign in his front yard that he proudly put there saying ``support our \ntroops.'' He is 71 years old. He is on oxygen, but he moves around \npretty well. He has had some major heart problems, including triple \nbypass in 1989, and problems with his leg where the doctors had to \nremove a vein for surgery.\n  Mr. Will is taking nitro tablets and about 15 different medications \ndaily, two of which are insulin. He was, unfortunately, diagnosed with \ndiabetes 20 years ago, and he has very few complications--thank \ngoodness--but it seems to have affected his vision, which is not very \ngood.\n  Mr. Will was prescribed the drug Rezulin by his doctor. He remembers \nit because the drug was real expensive. He told the doctor he couldn't \nafford it, so his doctor gave Mr. Will a bunch of samples to take home. \nRezulin, a drug prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, became \navailable in the U.S. in 1997. Warner-Lambert marketed this drug as \n``safe as a placebo''--in other words, as safe as a sugar pill.\n  Three years after Rezulin came to market, the FDA asked Warner-\nLambert to voluntarily remove the drug from the market as they started \nnoting too high an incidence of liver failure and deadly side effects. \nMr. Will was subsequently taken off Rezulin and prescribed a safer \ntreatment.\n  A class action lawsuit was filed in Illinois to protect people living \nthere like Mr. Will. The case alleged that Warner-Lambert violated the \nNew Jersey consumer fraud statute by pricing the drug much more in \nexcess of the price that the drug would have been but for Warner-\nLambert's concealment of the drug's deadly side effects.\n  This theory is supported by the major insurance companies.\n  Last year, the case was certified by the State court as a class \naction. But it was turned down in Federal Court. That is the problem we \nare running into.\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment I am going to offer. I think I \nwill wait until after lunch to do that. The Senator from Texas is here \nand wishes to speak. We have about 20 minutes remaining.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will speak generally about the issue of class action \nreform contained in S. 5, because I believe the American civil justice \nsystem is, in many ways, at a crossroads. We have an opportunity to \nchoose between taking a path toward greater freedom and responsibility, \nor heading down a path that encourages lawsuit abuse and cripples our \nability to compete in a global economy. Now is the time, I believe--\nactually it is past time--to enact the reforms necessary to ensure \nAmerica's competitiveness in the 21st century.\n  I am struck, as I listen to the critics of this bill, many of whom \nare the same people who complain about the fact that American jobs are \nbeing sent offshore to places like India, China, and elsewhere, when \none of the very causes of the damage to America's global \ncompetitiveness is our civil justice system.\n  I think people of good faith and good will agree that the goal of our \ncivil justice system ought to be getting people who are truly injured \nas a result of the fault of another fair compensation. But I think \nalso, being objective about this issue and some of the examples of \nabuses that we have seen, we know too often that this goal is not being \nmet in the current environment. We see lawsuit abuse particularly in \nthe class action area and also in the asbestos area. This abuse is \nhaving a damaging impact on our economy. In the asbestos area, we see \npeople who are sick are getting pennies on the dollar in compensation \nbecause people who are not sick are getting ahead of them in line, \nresulting in bankruptcies which have destroyed jobs and pensions for \nAmerican workers.\n  So it is unthinkable to me that anyone could stand here on the Senate \nfloor and claim there is nothing wrong. That seems to be a common theme \nthese days, whether we are talking about Social Security or lawsuit \nreform, or a variety of subjects. But the truth is that the facts \nclearly indicate otherwise.\n  As the continued spread of democracy and capitalism take root in \ncountries throughout the world, and as modern travel and information \ntechnology bring our world closer together, there is no question that \nthe health of America's economy is influenced by the free flow of goods \nand services in international markets.\n  It is a simple fact of life: We live in a global marketplace, where \nwe do not just compete with businesses across the street, but with ones \non the other side of the world. Our economic strength and ability to \ncompete now depends on our willingness to confront the burdens that \nprevent growth, discourage innovation, and ultimately cost Americans \ntheir jobs.\n  It is unthinkable to me that anyone can claim a system that \ncompensates people who truly are injured as a result of the fault of \nanother so poorly, but makes a handful of lawyers rich, doesn't need to \nbe fixed. But the system--particularly in the class action area--is \nfraught with abuse. I will not detail all of those abuses, since they \nhave been addressed earlier. But one of the most classic cases is the \ncoupon settlement. It reminds me of an old country and western song, \nwhere the lawyers get the goldmine and the consumers get the shaft.\n  We have all seen the numbers relating to the cost of our broken civil \njustice system. According to one estimate, the cost of the tort system \nin 2003 totaled more than $245 billion, or 2.2 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. That amounts to a tort tax on every American citizen \nof approximately $845 a year.\n  The percentage of our economy that is devoted to tort law and \nresolution of claims through our tort system is far greater than any \nother industrialized country. In Britain, for example, the entire tort \nsystem--attorneys' fees, settlement costs, jury awards, and \nadministrative costs--costs less as a percentage of GDP than America's \nplaintiffs' lawyers gross for themselves alone.\n  This level of stress on the economy and on our civil justice system \nitself is unacceptable. But it hasn't always been that way. Class \nactions, prior to significant rule changes in the 1960s and 1970s were \nnot, as they are today, largely a sport for a handful of aggressive \npersonal injury lawyers to pursue abusive litigation and junk lawsuits. \nTake, for example, the change in 1966, from a system where class \nmembers were required to ``opt in'' to a system, where now they are \nrequired to ``opt out.'' By 1971, four times as many class actions were \nbeing filed than had been in 1966. In other words, from 1966 to 1971, \nwe saw four times the number of class actions brought.\n  Since that time, recoveries have skyrocketed. This chart behind me \nreflects the growth I mentioned a moment ago. You can see that from \n1973 to 1975 there were relatively few class action lawsuits and \nrelatively modest recoveries. But they have obviously ballooned and \nappear to be getting bigger year by year.\n  The problems we increasingly experience with abusive class action \nlawsuits call for a significant overhaul of our civil justice system \nand particularly our rules providing for the resolution of mass tort \nlitigation.\n  I must tell you that the bill we have before us today is clearly a \nmodest reform. It amounts to an improvement over the status quo, but it \ndoesn't begin to approach the comprehensive solution America needs.\n  As it stands, S. 5 provides two primary improvements: It allows \nremoval of a greater number of class action lawsuits from State court \nto Federal court, and it requires judges to carefully review all coupon \nsettlements and limit attorneys' fees paid in those settlements to the \nvalue actually received by class members.\n  These two reforms--as modest as they are--are important and will \ncertainly offer fair but desperately needed\n\n[[Page S1085]]\n\nrelief for State courts which are experiencing firsthand the explosion \nof class action litigation. It will also provide for greater fairness \nfor defendants who are currently being dragged into ``magnet \njurisdictions,'' and it will provide greater fairness for class members \nwho are oftentimes receiving pennies on the dollar, while class counsel \nget rich.\n  Yet, as much of an improvement as this bill is, it falls short of the \nideal. To be effective and fair, I believe class actions and other mass \ntort litigation require three things: A level playing field; \ntransparency, so consumers can have complete, fair, and accurate \ninformation; and a clear relationship between class members and their \nlawyers.\n  First, a level playing field depends on a fair class certification \nprocess. As the current occupant of the chair knows, almost all class \nactions settle if certified. The main event in class action lawsuits is \nthe certification process because ultimately, once certified, most \ndefendants feel as if they have no choice but to settle because even a \nsmall risk of an adverse judgment, given the large number of class \nmembers, can lead to a ruinous result. They are forced to try to settle \nthe case on the best terms they can.\n  Where there is no right to an immediate interlocutory appeal of class \ncertification and stay on discovery, class certification can cause \nsettlements that far exceed the case's value on the merits because of \nthe extortionate effect of the certification process and the threat it \nbrings to the very livelihood, not to mention the financial life, of \nthe defendant involved.\n  States, such as my home State of Texas, have also embraced limits on \nappeal bonds. Too often in large class action lawsuits, the judgment \ncan be so large that the defendant cannot, in effect, buy an appeal \nbond with which to appeal the case and correct an erroneous ruling \nbelow. So the defendant is forced to settle because they cannot afford \nto appeal--again, not based on the merits, but based on the way class \naction lawsuits are structured, without a right to interlocutory \nappeal.\n  The second step toward an effective system, I believe, is information \nflow. Class actions require that adequate information be available both \nfor the sake of the process itself and for policymakers, like us, to \nanalyze. It is hard for us to do our job when it comes to class action \nreform or civil justice reform when some of the information--much of \nthe information--is simply hidden from public view. Class members \nshould be fully advised of all aspects of their case, and we should \nrequire that certain relevant information about all class action \nsettlements be collected and published centrally for examination and \nreview by analysts and policymakers.\n  Just as in Government, when it comes to class actions, people deserve \nto know what is going on, particularly if it is their case.\n  The final step, and the most important one to me, is maintaining the \nproper relationship between the class members and their attorney. As \nthe occupant of the chair, the Presiding Officer, knows, this is a \nparticularly tough issue when it comes to class counsel who may have \none real client, the class representative, with whom they deal but, in \nreality, class counsel calls the shots and runs the case. Class members \nmay not even know they are involved in a lawsuit until they receive a \nnotice of settlement and perhaps, as we heard, a coupon worth pennies \non the dollar. The opportunity for abuse of that important fiduciary \nrelationship between the lawyer and the client is very important to \naddress.\n  I believe one solution would be to allow members of the class to opt \nin instead of opting out because, indeed, in a country that says we do \nnot promote litigation, although we certainly give fair access to \ncourts, it just does not make much sense to me to say to the consumers: \nYou can be a plaintiff in a lawsuit, you can actually be a party to a \nlawsuit and not even know about it until the lawsuit is over, which is \nwhat happens today.\n  Consumers should not have to learn that they are members of a class \naction lawsuit by receiving a check for $2.38 in the mail and then find \nout in the morning paper that the lawyers who purported to represent \nthem just collected $5 million. The cases and examples go on and on.\n  It should also go without saying that the attorneys should be paid at \na level commensurate with the work before them, not based on strictly a \ncontingency fee which may, indeed, allow huge financial rewards for \nrelatively modest work actually being done.\n\n  I hope those listening, if there are any listening to my comments, \nunderstand my concerns that this modest legislation does not go far \nenough to remove the scandal of litigation abuse that too often plagues \nour civil justice system and the American economy. I hope they \nunderstand my reservations do not indicate I am not for this bill \nbecause, indeed, I am. I believe S. 5 is an important first step in \nreform and an important step in the right direction.\n  In conclusion, because I know there are others who want to speak, \nthere will be attempts to offer amendments to this bill. I know Senator \nDurbin, but for the loss of his voice, would have been the first to \noffer his amendment. I am told Senator Kennedy will be here shortly to \ndo the same, but as everyone knows who has followed this bill--\ncertainly Senator Carper who has been an advocate for class action \nreform for some time, knows--the compromise reflected by S. 5 is a very \nfragile one, and it essentially depends on no amendments being made to \nthe bill or agreed to the bill. If that happens, it is likely the bill \nwill go promptly to the House where they will pass it, and it will go \nto the President's desk, and we will have an early victory for the \nAmerican people in this important area. But there are a number of \namendments that will be offered which, in essence, are poison pills, \nthat if agreed to will completely destroy any opportunity we have for \nthis modest reform.\n  I have my own amendments that I filed, if others are offered and \nagreed to, which I believe are important to move the bill in the \ndirection where I think it ought to go. But the truth is, I am \nrefraining from urging those amendments at this time because I think \nthis fragile compromise, as modest as it is, does represent real reform \nin moving the bill in the right direction.\n  Here again, as the Washington Post editorial on August 27, 2001, \npoints out:\n\n       No portion of the American civil justice system is more of \n     a mess than the world of class action. None is in more \n     desperate need of policymakers' attention.\n\n  That was in 2001, and certainly the situation has not changed today.\n  I am baffled by those who want to whistle past the graveyard and act \nas if there is nothing wrong and that everything is just hunky-dory \nwhen it comes to class action reform. I believe the American people \nexpect that the civil justice system will operate in their best \ninterest, not in the best interest of a handful of lawyers.\n  I am confident the damage that is being done to American \ncompetitiveness is killing jobs that would be created in the United \nStates but for the fact that people do not want to subject themselves \nto an out-of-control class action system. So, instead, jobs are being \ncreated in other countries across the world where they do not have \nthose same concerns.\n  This is clearly an area that cries out for reform. It is one that is \nlong past due.\n  I congratulate Senator Carper and others on that side of the aisle \nwho have worked so carefully to try to craft this fragile compromise. \nBut I want my colleagues to understand--and I think they all do; I \nthink we all do--that any amendments to this bill will doom it. So I \nurge all of my colleagues to vote against any and all amendments; \nindeed, even ones that I may like but which I know will have the \nultimate effect of killing the bill. I think it is better to save those \nfor another day and another time rather than have the prospect of this \nbill going down in flames.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I understand that under the previous \norder, the Senate will stand in recess at 12:30 p.m. for our weekly \ncaucus luncheons. I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding that \nunanimous consent agreement, to proceed for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before Senator Cornyn leaves the floor, I\n\n[[Page S1086]]\n\nthank him for his kind words, and I am pleased that we are at the point \nwhere we are on this legislation this week. I look forward to both \nsides exercising constraint--we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of \nthe good--and pass the good legislation that has been introduced and \ndebated this week, with the understanding the House will accept it and \nthe President will sign it into law.\n  We heard a fair amount already about the ills of class action \nlawsuits. Class action lawsuits, in and of themselves, are not a bad \nthing. Class action lawsuits give little people who are harmed, in some \ncases by companies, the opportunity--maybe not harmed in a way that the \nconsumers, the little people, lose their eye, arm, leg, or life, but \nthey suffer some kind of harm.\n  The idea behind class action lawsuits is to say when little people \nare harmed by big companies or others that those people can band \ntogether and present their grievances to an appropriate court, State or \nFederal, and for the people who are harmed to be made whole.\n  At the same time, it is important that when the plaintiffs are \nbringing a class action lawsuit against a defendant from another State, \nthat the case be heard in a court where both sides can get a fair \nshake, the plaintiffs as well as the defendant.\n  If we go back over a couple hundred centuries in this country, we \nended up with a law that the Congress passed that said if we have a \ndefendant from one State and plaintiffs from another State, it is not \nfair to the defendant to have the case necessarily heard in the home of \nthe plaintiffs. Someone may have dragged the defendant in across the \nState lines and put them in a courthouse or courtroom where there is a \nbias toward the local plaintiffs who brought the case against the \ndefendant from another State, and in an effort to try to make sure that \nwe are fair to both parties, those who are bringing the accusations and \nthose who are defending against them, we have the Federal courts which \nwere established in many cases to resolve those kinds of issues.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen an abuse of some class action lawsuits in \nrecent years which led the Congress to begin debating this issue and \nconsidering legislation to address these abuses starting in, I want to \nsay 1997, 7 years ago. The original problem that was discovered or was \npointed out is this: There seems to be a growing prevalence of \nplaintiffs' attorneys who are forum shopping in State or local courts \nwhere the plaintiff class may have an inordinate advantage against the \ndefendant. I will not go into the examples today, but there are any \nnumber of instances where one can see forum shopping has gone on, a \nState or a county courthouse has certified a class, agreed to hear a \ncase, and it sets up a situation where the defendant company or the \ndefendant knows they are going to have a hard time getting a fair shake \nin that courthouse. As a result, the defendant will agree to a \nsettlement with the plaintiffs' attorneys. The settlement may richly \nreward the plaintiffs' attorneys for bringing the case, the defendant \nmay cut their losses, but the folks on whose behalf the litigation was \nbrought in the first place, those who allegedly are harmed, in many \ninstances get little or nothing for their harm. That is not a fair \nsituation. It is not fair to the little people on whose behalf the case \nhas been brought. It is arguably not fair to the defendant because they \nare in a courtroom where they do not have a fair chance to defend \nthemselves. It can be fixed, and it ought to be fixed.\n  The legislation before us today will not end the practice of class \naction lawsuits being litigated and decided in State courts. I believe \nthe majority of class action lawsuits, even if this legislation is \npassed, which I am encouraged that it will, will still continue to be \nheld in State courts, and they should be. We will have the opportunity \nto explain why that is true later on.\n  Before my 5 minutes expires, I conclude with this: There are any \nnumber of people on both sides of the aisle who would like to offer \namendments to this bill. We have been working for 7 years to try to \npass something that the House, the Senate, and the President will agree \nto. The time has come. To the extent that we make a change, whether it \nis in a Republican amendment or a Democratic amendment that might be \noffered, if we make a change, we invite the other side to retaliate and \nto offer their amendments and perhaps to adopt their amendments. For \nthose of us who want to see this bill passed, I believe this \nlegislation is about the fairest balance we are going to get, and I \nwould encourage us to support it. We should consider and debate the \namendments but in the end turn those amendments down.\n  I look forward to debating each of those amendments, and I hope in \nthe end we can accomplish three things with this legislation: No. 1, \nmake sure that where small people are harmed in a modest way, they have \nthe opportunity to be made whole; No. 2, make sure that the defendants \nwho are pulled into court on these class action lawsuits have a \nreasonable chance of getting a fair shake; and lastly, I am not \ninterested in overburdening Federal judges. I think most of this \nlitigation should remain in State court. I believe the compromise we \nhave struck will do that. Those are our three goals, and I look forward \nto the debate that is going to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1086-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it had been announced earlier that the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, would be offering an amendment on \nclass action, so we will await his arrival. In the interim, I will \nyield to my distinguished colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, who has \nsome comments and who will be managing the bill this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary state of affairs?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 5 is before the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Have no amendments been presented?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not yet.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts if he \nis prepared to submit an amendment. If he is, I would be happy to yield \nto him instead of making my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am going to send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. President, it is wrong to include civil rights in wage-and-hour \ncases in this bill. Families across the country are struggling to make \nends meet. They work hard, play by the rules, and expect fair treatment \nin return, but they often don't get it.\n  Unfair discrimination can lead to the loss of a job or the denial of \na job. It can keep them from having health insurance or obtaining \ndecent housing. It can deprive their children of a good education. We \ncan't turn a blind eye to that enormous problem. Those who engage in \nillegal discrimination must be held accountable.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment--to protect working families \nand victims of discrimination. Hard-working Americans deserve a fair \nday in court. Class actions protect us all by preventing systematic \ndiscrimination.\n  Attorneys general from 15 States--California, Illinois, Iowa, \nKentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New \nMexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont, and West Virginia--oppose \nthe inclusion of civil rights in wage-and-hour cases in the bill. The \nproblems that supporters of the bill say they want to fix don't even \nrise in civil rights and labor cases. No one has cited any civil rights \nor labor cases as an example of abuses in class action cases under the \ncurrent law.\n  During the discussion of this bill in the Judiciary Committee and on \nthe floor last year and during the committee's discussion last week, no \none identified any need to fix civil rights or labor class actions. \n``If it ain't broke, Congress shouldn't try to fix it.''\n  There is no good reason to include these cases in this bill, but \nthere is an\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\nexcellent reason not to include them. This bill will harm victims of \ncivil rights and labor law abuses by delaying their cases and making it \nmuch more difficult and much more expensive for them to obtain the \njustice they deserve. It may even discourage many from seeking any \nrelief at all.\n  That is not what this bill was meant to do. We were told this bill \nwas about cases in which individuals from across the country receive \nrelief in State courts for relatively minor violations--sometimes \ngetting just a coupon or a few dollars in a case they didn't even know \nabout while a few elite attorneys receive more megadollar fees. Civil \nrights and wage-and-hour class action suits are not about minor \nviolations. They are about serious, sometimes devastating harm to \npeople who have been treated unfairly and are seeking their day in \ncourt; people such as Mary Singleton, a long-term employee at a \nscientific laboratory in California who joined a gender discrimination \nclass action after her employer refused to give her and other female \nemployees equal pay for equal work. Ms. Singleton and her coworkers \nfiled their case in State court because State law provided greater \nprotection against gender discrimination and retaliation and because \nthe Federal court rules would have placed additional limits on \ndiscovery.\n\n  This bill would also harm people such as Georgie Hartwig who spent 6 \nyears working at a national discount retailer in Colville, WA. For \nyears, Ms. Hartwig and her fellow workers were forced to work off the \nclock, skipping breaks and lunch, but not being paid for their time. \nNow she is fighting, along with 40,000 coworkers, to get the wages they \nhave earned. This bill was not supposed to make it harder for people \nsuch as Ms. Hartwig to get justice.\n  We were also told this bill would not shift cases to Federal courts \nunless they truly involve national issues, while State cases would \nremain in State court. The bill's actual effects are quite different. \nIt does not just affect cases where the events affect people in \nmultiple States; under this bill, a corporate defendant with \nheadquarters outside the State can move State class action cases, \nincluding civil rights cases and worker right cases, into Federal \ncourt, even if all the underlying facts in the case happened in a \nsingle State. Think about that. If 100 workers in Alabama sue their \nemployer under Alabama law for job discrimination that occurred in \nAlabama, this bill says the employer can drag their case into Federal \ncourt if the employer happens to be incorporated in Delaware. That \nmakes no sense.\n  The bill would also apply to cases that seek justice for other \nstrictly local events such as environmental damage. That is not what \nthis amendment is about. This problem, which is affecting us now in \nMassachusetts, illustrates the fact that this bill is not just about \ntruly national cases, as supporters keep insisting.\n  A case now pending in a Massachusetts State court illustrates how the \nbill deprives local citizens of access to their own State courts when \nthey become innocent victims of widespread pollution occurring in their \nhometowns.\n  In April 2003 an oil barge ran aground on Buzzard's Bay off the coast \nof New Bedford, MA, spilling 98,000 gallons of oil into the bay and \npolluting almost 90 miles of beaches and sensitive tidal marshes in the \narea. Homeowners filed a class action suit in State court asking for \ncompensation for the damage to their property. One of the defendants, \nBouchard Transportation Company, has already been convicted of criminal \nnegligence in causing the spill. The defendant companies are from out \nof State. Even though the case occurred entirely under Massachusetts \nlaws, if the current bill, the proposed bill, had been in effect when \nthe case was filed, this case could be removed to Federal court even \nthough all the victims are full-time Massachusetts residents and \nseeking relief in Massachusetts courts under Massachusetts laws.\n  Because this bill is not retroactive, the case will not be affected \nby this bill, but with the passage of this act, similar future cases, \nproperly brought in the courts of the State where the harm occurs, can \nbe removed to the Federal courts. As a result, the victims will often \nbe confronted by class action certification procedures more onerous \nthan those in their State courts. They will face delays from congested \nFederal dockets. They will have to travel greater distances from their \nhomes to the courthouse. The procedural changes in this bill seem \nabstract, but they will have a devastating consequence for real people.\n\n  First and foremost, it reduces each State's power to protect its own \ncitizens and enforce its own laws. Moving these cases to Federal court \nwill often end them for all practical purposes. Federal courts may \ndecide they do not meet the Federal rules for class certification. Even \nif the cases are not dismissed, plaintiffs forced into Federal court on \nState law claims have the decks stacked against them in Federal court \nbecause Federal courts take the narrowest possible view in interpreting \nState laws. The First and Seventh Circuits ruled in interpreting State \nlaws Federal courts must take the view that narrows liability. State \njudges should be the ones who interpret State laws, not Federal ``big \nbrother.''\n  Often State laws have greater protections than Federal laws. That is \nthe genius of our Federal system. Many States have stronger minimum \nwage laws and greater overtime protections than Federal law. Fourteen \nStates and the District of Columbia have a higher minimum wage than the \nFederal standard. Twenty states have overtime laws that give workers \ngreater protection than the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Over 20 \nStates have child labor laws that are more protective than Federal \nchild labor laws.\n  At a time when the administration is bent on undermining overtime at \nthe Federal level, State law protections are more important than ever.\n  States are also pioneers in protecting civil rights. Many States, \nsuch as California, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, \nWashington, and West Virginia, have greater protections for persons \nwith disabilities than the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act. \nStates are also in the forefront of protecting against discrimination \nbased on family status or citizenship.\n  A majority of States prohibits genetic discrimination in the \nworkplace, a new and troubling form of discrimination where the Federal \nGovernment has been too slow to respond. Our proposal, to prohibit \ngenetic discrimination under Federal law, passed 95-0 in the Senate, \nbut it stalled in the House. When States act ahead of the Federal \nGovernment to provide greater rights for their citizens, State courts \nshould be allowed to interpret their own laws. State courts, not \nFederal courts, have the expertise in exerting the will of the State \nlegislature and they should have the right to do so.\n  We all know what is going on. We should call this bill the ``Class \nAction Hypocrisy Act of 2005.'' Our colleagues love to proclaim States \nrights when Congress tries to expand the rights of law in all 50 \nStates, but they do not hesitate to override States rights to help \ntheir business friends. This bill is a windfall for guilty corporate \noffenders. It even allows repeat offenders to drag State cases into \nFederal court and allows them to spend months litigating whether the \ncase belongs there. If the Federal court decides that the case does not \nfit the narrow rules set by the bill and should be sent back to State \ncourt, that will cause another delay because the employer can appeal \nthe decision. Delay is a serious problem today in many Federal trial \ncourts across the country.\n\n  Paul Jones, an employee of Goodyear Tire Company in Ohio, found that \nout the hard way. He and other workers in their fifties filed an age \ndiscrimination case in the State court in Akron. All they wanted was to \nbe judged by their ability, not their age. His attorney said, We file \nour class action lawsuits in the Ohio State court system because it is \nour experience these cases move much more rapidly in the State court \nthan they would if filed in the Federal court system. The difference in \nthe amount of time it takes to adjudicate a State court age \ndiscrimination case compared to a Federal court case may be as much as \n2 years. No wonder the corporate defendants are salivating over this \nopportunity to escape the liability for their wrongs.\n  Paul Jones had a State law claim in State court, but his employer \ntried to have it dismissed based on Federal court rulings that certain \ntypes of arguments in age discriminations were invalid. The State court \nrejected that argument. It held that Mr. Jones could\n\n[[Page S1088]]\n\nproceed with his claim based on the disparate impact analysis, \nsomething Ohio's Federal courts did not allow. But a Federal court \nwould have been much more likely to go along with the idea because \nFederal courts read the State law narrowly.\n  The delay from moving State cases to Federal court would be \nparticularly harmful for low-wage workers who have no resources to fall \nback on when litigation expenses start to mount.\n  A letter by David Luna, Flora Gonzales, and dozens of coworkers who \nwere housekeepers, cooks, and waiters at two luxury hotels in Los \nAngeles, makes the point. Their heavy workloads forced them to work \nthrough their meals and breaks.\n  They write:\n\n       [A]s cooks we . . . struggle to meet the hotel's 30 minute \n     room service guarantee, yet we work through our own 30 minute \n     meal breaks on an almost daily basis.\n\n  These workers are working to recover wages they own, but the \ncorporate defendants have been trying to slow down the case by removing \nit to Federal court. The harm of such delays is very real to these \nworkers, as they so poignantly described:\n\n       For some, delays in getting your day in court may be only \n     an inconvenience. But we are modestly paid workers with \n     physically demanding jobs. For us, delays mean that we must \n     continue to work without breaks, our work days are harder \n     than they should be, and we must wait longer to be paid the \n     extra wages we have earned.\n\n  If this bill passes, big corporations will have free rein to use \nprocedural maneuvers to delay these cases and deny these workers their \nday in court. Why should we make it harder for those workers to get \ntheir claims decided?\n  Abuses by large companies are widespread. Right now, class action \ncases are proceeding in State courts in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and \nCalifornia for hundreds of thousands of low-wage workers who were \nrequired by Wal-Mart to work extra hours ``off the clock'' without \nbeing paid for their extra time. It is wrong for Congress to side with \nthe big guy.\n  These men and women deserve to recover their lost wages to pay their \nrent, pay their medical bills, and put food on the table. The longer \nthey wait for justice, the heavier the burden on these workers and \ntheir families. And the Senate is about to tell them to take a hike? It \nis outrageous.\n  Supporters of the bill talk a lot about fairness. We hear that word \nagain and again. It has even been put into the title of the class \naction bill. Labeling it ``fair'' does not make it fair.\n  Fair does not mean punishing those who are mistreated on the job. \nFairness does not mean making it harder for honest working men and \nwomen to obtain justice when they have been cheated out of their wages. \nIt does not mean denying victims of discrimination their day in court \nunder the laws of their State.\n  It is wrong for Congress to side with corporate abusers and tell the \nvictims of discrimination and unfair practices they cannot count on \ntheir own State courts to give them the justice they deserve. But that \nis what this bill is all about. At the very least, we should exclude \ncivil rights and labor cases from its harsh provisions. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment to \nprotect these basic civil rights of hard-working Americans in \ncommunities across the country.\n  Mr. President, I received many letters from working Americans and \nvictims of discrimination who support this amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have some of these letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senators: We are writing to share our concerns about \n     the Class Action Fairness Act, which would force workers with \n     claims under state wage and hour laws to bring their suits in \n     federal courts. Based on our own experience in trying to \n     enforce state law labor protections in a class action \n     lawsuit, we urge you to work to exclude wage and hour class \n     action cases from this bill.\n       We work at the Century Plaza and the St. Regis Hotels, two \n     luxury hotels in Los Angeles, California. We are \n     housekeepers, cooks, room service waiters, bartenders, \n     servers, mini bar restockers, valets, or work at other hourly \n     jobs. We are employed by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, \n     Inc., which manages and operates these hotels.\n       Under California law, employees must be allowed two paid \n     ten minute rest breaks and one half-hour unpaid meal break \n     every shift. If employees cannot take their break, they are \n     supposed to be paid an extra hour's wages.\n       At the Century Plaza and the St. Regis, workers are \n     routinely unable to take meal and rest breaks either because \n     no one is scheduled to relieve us or because our workload is \n     so heavy that we cannot take the time off. We believe that \n     Starwood has sought to boost profits by increasing our \n     workloads and by reducing staff, which means we cannot stop \n     working long enough to take our breaks.\n       For example, cooks in the Century Plaza room service \n     department struggle to meet the hotel's 30 minute room \n     service guarantee, yet we work through our own 30 minute meal \n     breaks on an almost daily basis. Housekeepers at both hotels \n     face quotas of up to 15 luxury rooms per day. Each room must \n     be spotlessly cleaned and restocked, with towels and linens \n     changed, carpeting vacuumed, and bathrooms left sparkling. We \n     spend our entire shifts rushing to meet the hotel's high \n     standards and often cannot rest until the end of our shifts. \n     A Los Angeles Times article concerning the inability of \n     housekeepers to take their breaks is attached for your \n     reference.\n       Last fall, we filed a class action in California superior \n     court seeking to enforce the state's laws regarding meal and \n     rest breaks. By now, we expected to have completed initial \n     hearings and be well on our way to preparing for our trial. \n     But because our employer has moved our case to federal court \n     and is trying to have it dismissed, we have been forced to \n     endure delays.\n       For some, delays in getting your day in court may only be \n     an inconvenience. But we are modestly paid workers with \n     physically demanding jobs. For us, delays mean that we must \n     continue to work without breaks, our work days are harder \n     than they should be, and we must wait longer to be paid the \n     extra wages we have earned. As our situation shows, delays \n     are a significant burden to those seeking basic rights and a \n     fair day's wage for a fair day of work. We urge you to work \n     to keep state wage and hour class action cases in state \n     court, where they belong.\n           Sincerely,\n     (Signed by 85 employees)\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Mary F.

Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing because I understand \n     that Congress is considering legislation which might place \n     certain limitations on class action lawsuits and require that \n     many class actions be filed in federal court. As a woman who \n     was the lead plaintiff and class representative in a gender \n     discrimination lawsuit against a major employer in state \n     court, I am concerned that such legislation will limit the \n     ability of victims of discrimination and civil rights \n     violations to adequately redress their grievances. I urge you \n     to do what you can to preserve the rights of state citizens \n     to pursue class action cases in their own state.\n       As a long term career employee of a large scientific \n     research laboratory in California, I tried for many years to \n     convince management to evaluate its compensation and \n     promotional practices and take steps to correct long-standing \n     and widespread disparities in salaries and promotions between \n     men and women at the institution. When these efforts \n     ultimately proved to be unsuccessful, five colleagues and I \n     reluctantly decided that the only way that the civil rights \n     of women at the organization would ever be addressed was \n     through litigation. We retained counsel and filed a class \n     action in state court, alleging violations of anti-\n     discrimination law on behalf of ourselves and approximately \n     3,000 female co-workers.\n       My understanding from our attorneys was that we could have \n     filed our case in federal or state court, since both have \n     laws against employment discrimination. After considering the \n     options, we decided to file in state court because we felt \n     that it would provide a better opportunity to fairly and \n     fully present our case. Among other things, because of the \n     size and nature of the organization, we knew our employer \n     would try to make the case very complicated, and that a \n     considerable amount of ``discovery'' would be necessary, \n     including a number of depositions. Our understanding was that \n     the state court procedures would offer more flexibility in \n     this regard, allowing our attorneys a fair opportunity to \n     obtain the information necessary to present our case on \n     behalf of the class.\n       In addition, we wanted to include claims based upon state \n     laws because, in some respects, they provide stronger \n     protection against discrimination and retaliation. Although \n     we knew that we could include state law claims in a federal \n     court lawsuit, our understanding is that federal courts may \n     not be as familiar with state laws and may not be willing to \n     interpret state law as opposed to rigidly apply past \n     interpretations.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                 Mary F. Singleton\n\n[[Page S1089]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                  Law Office of John C. Davis,\n\n                           Tallahassee, Florida, January 14, 2005.\n     Re: Proposed Legislation Federalizing Class Actions\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am a lawyer working in the Florida \n     panhandle doing employment and civil rights cases. I am class \n     counsel along with Wes Pittman of Panama City in a certified \n     class action against the Florida Department of Corrections \n     brought by a class of hard working women who are health care \n     providers and non-security personnel in the corrections \n     systems. They daily serve the citizens of Florida by \n     providing health care and other essential services to \n     inmates. As a condition of their employment they have been \n     subjected to unrelenting sexual harassment by certain male \n     inmates. The Department has known of this for years and can \n     stop the harassment, but has ignored and belittled their \n     plight.\n       The Circuit Court in Washington County, Florida, certified \n     this case as a class action and the Florida First District \n     Court of Appeal affirmed that certification because they saw \n     the injustice suffered daily by these courageous women. The \n     case is reported at Rudolph v. Department of Corrections, \n     2002 WL 32182165, aff'd, 855 So.2d 59 (F1a. 1st DCA 2003). \n     The lower court's opinion, which is published on Westlaw, \n     describes in detail the facts of the case.\n       This case cried out for class action treatment because that \n     is the only way to effect the kinds of change that will get \n     the attention of the Department of Corrections. Individual \n     cases rarely if ever effect change beyond the circumstances \n     of the individual bringing the case. They are usually settled \n     confidentially.\n       We filed this case is state court, however, because it \n     would have had little chance in the federal court. The \n     federal courts in Florida would not certify the case because \n     of what can only be viewed as a profound hostility to these \n     kinds of cases by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     Thus, absent a state court class action, there is simply no \n     way that all of the individuals affected by the Department's \n     practices would ever get relief.\n       Permitting employers to remove class actions like this to \n     the federal courts will effectively deny any opportunity for \n     the kind of systemic relief that results in real change. The \n     irony that the interests driving this ill-conceived \n     legislation are usually states' rights proponents shouldn't \n     be lost on anyone. State courts are as well suited, if not \n     better suited, to adjudicate these controversies.\n       This legislation will not promote justice and will upset \n     the federal-state balance. If the legislation cannot be \n     defeated in its entirely at the very least an exception to it \n     should be made for civil rights and employment litigation. I \n     strongly urge you to do all you can to defeat the legislation \n     and continue to fight for the rights of working Americans.\n       Please do not hesitate to call me if I can do anything to \n     help.\n           Sincerely,\n     John C. Davis.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                State of New York,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                Albany, New York, February 7, 2005\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid, Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader and Mr. Minority Leader: On behalf \n     of the Attorneys General of California, Illinois, Iowa, \n     Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New \n     Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont, and \n     West Virginia, we are writing in opposition to S. 5, the so-\n     called ``Class Action Fairness Act,'' which will be debated \n     today and is scheduled to be voted on this week. Despite \n     improvements over similar legislation considered in prior \n     years, we believe S. 5 still unduly limits the right of \n     individuals to seek redress for corporate wrongdoing in their \n     state courts. We therefore strongly recommend that this \n     legislation not be enacted in its present form.\n       As you know, under S. 5, almost all class actions brought \n     by private individuals in state court based on state law \n     claims would be removed to federal court, and, as explained \n     below, many of these cases may not be able to continue as \n     class actions. We are concerned with such a limitation on the \n     availability of the class action device because, particularly \n     in these times of tightening state budgets, class actions \n     provide an important ``private attorney general'' supplement \n     to the efforts of state Attorneys General to prosecute \n     violations of state consumer protection, civil rights, labor, \n     public health and environmental laws.\n       We recognize that some class action lawsuits in both state \n     and federal courts have resulted in only minimal benefits to \n     class members, despite the award of substantial attorneys' \n     fees. While we support targeted effort to prevent such abuses \n     and preserve the integrity of the class action mechanism, we \n     believe S. 5 goes too far. By fundamentally altering the \n     basic principles of federalism, S. 5, if enacted in its \n     present form, would result in far greater harm than good. It \n     therefore is not surprising that organizations such as AARP, \n     AFL-CIO, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, \n     Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP and Public \n     Citizen all oppose this legislation in its present form.\n     1. Class Actions Should Not Be ``Federalized''\n       S. 5 would vastly expand federal diversity jurisdiction, \n     and thereby would result in most class actions being filed in \n     or removed to federal court. This transfer of jurisdiction in \n     cases raising questions of state law will inappropriately \n     usurp the primary role of state courts in developing their \n     own state tort and contract laws, and will impair their \n     ability to establish consistent interpretations of those \n     laws. There is no compelling need or empirical support for \n     such a sweeping change in our long-established system for \n     adjudicating state law issues. In fact, by transferring most \n     state court class actions to an already overburdened federal \n     court system, this bill will delay (if not deny) justice to \n     substantial numbers of injured citizens. Moreover, S. 5 is \n     fundamentally flawed because under this legislation, most \n     class actions brought against a defendant who is not a \n     ``citizen'' of the state will be removed to federal court, no \n     matter how substantial a presence the defendant has in the \n     state or how much harm the defendant has caused in the state.\n     2. Clarification Is Needed That S. 5 Does Not Apply to State \n         Attorney General Actions\n       State Attorneys General frequently investigate and bring \n     actions against defendants who have caused harm to our \n     citizens, usually pursuant to the Attorney General's parens \n     patriae authority under our respective state consumer \n     protection and antitrust statutes. In some instances, such \n     actions have been brought with the Attorney General acting as \n     the class representative for the consumers of the state. We \n     are concerned that certain provisions of S. 5 might be \n     misinterpreted to impede the ability of the Attorneys General \n     to bring such actions, thereby interfering with one means of \n     protecting our citizens from unlawful activity and its \n     resulting harm. That Attorney General enforcement actions \n     should proceed unimpeded is important to all our \n     constituents, but most significantly to our senior citizens \n     living on fixed incomes and the working poor. S. 5 therefore \n     should be amended to clarify that it does not apply to \n     actions brought by any State Attorney General on behalf of \n     his or her respective state or its citizens. We understand \n     that Senator Pryor will be offering an amendment on this \n     issue, and we urge that it be adopted.\n     3. Many Multi-State Class Actions Cannot Be Brought in \n         Federal Court\n       Another significant problem with S. 5 is that many federal \n     courts have refused to certify multi-state class actions \n     because the court would be required to apply the laws of \n     different jurisdictions to different plaintiffs--even if the \n     laws of those jurisdictions are very similar. Thus, cases \n     commenced as state class actions and then removed to federal \n     court may not be able to be continued as class actions in \n     federal court.\n       In theory, injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a \n     separate class action lawsuit in federal court, but that \n     defeats one of the main purposes of class actions, which is \n     to conserve judicial resources. Moreover, while the \n     population of some states may be large enough to warrant a \n     separate class action involving only residents of those \n     states, it is very unlikely that similar lawsuits will be \n     brought on behalf of the residents of many smaller states. \n     This problem should be addressed by allowing federal courts \n     to certify nationwide class actions to the full extent of \n     their constitutional power--either by applying one State's \n     law with sufficient ties to the underlying claims in the \n     case, or by ensuring that a Federal judge does not deny \n     certification on the sole ground that the laws of more \n     than one State would apply to the action. We understand \n     that Senator Jeff Bingaman will be proposing an amendment \n     to address this problem, and that amendment should be \n     adopted.\n     4. Civil Rights and Labor Cases Should Be Exempted\n       Proponents of S. 5 point to allegedly ``collusive'' \n     consumer class action settlements in which plaintiffs' \n     attorneys received substantial fee awards, while the class \n     members merely received ``coupons'' towards the purchase of \n     other goods sold by defendants. Accordingly, this ``reform'' \n     should apply only to consumer class actions. Class action \n     treatment provides a particularly important mechanism for \n     adjudicating the claims of low-wage workers and victims of \n     discrimination, and there is no apparent need to place \n     limitations on these types of actions. Senator Kennedy \n     reportedly will offer an amendment on this issue, which also \n     should be adopted.\n     5. The Notification Provisions Are Misguided\n       S. 5 requires that Federal and State regulators, and in \n     many cases State Attorneys General, be notified of proposed \n     class action settlements, and be provided with copies of the \n     complaint, class notice, proposed settlement and other \n     materials. Apparently this provision is intended to protect \n     against ``collusive'' settlements between defendants and \n     plaintiffs' counsel, but those materials would be unlikely to \n     reveal evidence of collusion, and thus would provide little \n     or no basis for objecting to the settlement. Without clear \n     authority in the legislation to more closely examine \n     defendants on issues bearing on the fairness of the proposed \n     settlement (particularly out-of-State defendants over whom \n     subpoena authority may in some circumstances\n\n[[Page S1090]]\n\n     be limited), the notification provision lacks meaning. Class \n     members could be misled into believing that their interests \n     are being protected by their government representatives, \n     simply because the notice was sent to the Attorney General of \n     the United States, State Attorneys General and other Federal \n     and State regulators.\n       Equal access to the American system of justice is a \n     foundation of our democracy. S. 5 would effect a sweeping \n     reordering of our Nation's system of justice that will \n     disenfranchise individual citizens from obtaining redress for \n     harm, and thereby impede efforts against egregious corporate \n     wrongdoing. Although we fully support the goal of preventing \n     abusive class action settlements, and would be willing to \n     provide assistance in your effort to implement necessary \n     reforms, we are likewise committed to maintaining our Federal \n     system of justice and safeguarding the interests of the \n     public. For these reasons, we oppose S. 5 in its present \n     form.\n           Sincerely,\n       Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General of the State of New York.\n       Bill Lockyer, Attorney General of the State of California.\n       Tom Miller, Attorney General of the State of Iowa.\n       G.

Mr. President, I would like to anticipate some of the \narguments that may be made by those who question whether cases based on \ntruly local events would really be affected by the class action bill. \nSome have claimed that the bill will bring only national multi-State \ncases into Federal court, where they belong. They say it doesn't affect \npurely State cases, because it keeps class actions in State court if \nplaintiffs live in the same State as the defendant.\n  But in reality, the bill will move many State law cases to Federal \ncourt even if the people bringing the suit all live in the same State, \nand were hurt by a company doing business in that State. This is \nbecause the bill lets a case stay in State court only if the defendant \nis a ``citizen'' of the same State as the plaintiffs who brought the \ncase, and companies are citizens of the State where they were \nincorporated, regardless of where they do business. As a result, \nplaintiffs who live in one State who file a case against a company with \nmany offices in that State, would not be able to keep their case in \nState court if the company is incorporated somewhere else.\n  To show the scale of this problem, let's look at the figures. More \nthan 308,000 companies are incorporated in Delaware, including 60 \npercent of Fortune 500 firms and 50 percent of the corporations listed \non the New York Stock Exchange. Most of these companies also do \nbusiness in many other States. But plaintiffs in those other States \nwill not be able to file State cases against these companies without \nbeing dragged into Federal court. That violates the principle of simple \nfairness.\n  The bill lets corporations stay in State court when it's to their \nadvantage. Businesses will still have their day in State court. But \ncorporate employees whose civil or labor rights have been violated will \nbe denied the same access.\n  Some have suggested that my amendment is not necessary because \nFederal courts have traditionally been protectors of civil rights.\n  It is true that our Federal courts perform the important job of \nprotecting rights under Federal law and the U.S. Constitution. And my \namendment will still allow those claims to be heard in Federal court. \nBut in cases involving State civil rights or wage and hour laws, State \ncourts should make these decisions. When States step ahead of the \nFederal government to give their citizens greater protection than \nFederal law--as several States have done in the area of genetic \ndiscrimination of discrimination based on marital status--State, not \nFederal courts, should interpret those laws. That is what my amendment \nwould ensure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened carefully to my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts, and I do think he has a few things wrong. \nFor instance, if the vast majority of the people bringing the suit are \nMassachusetts citizens, under this bill they have a right to bring it \nin State court, if they want to, although most civil rights cases are \nbrought in Federal court because these are 14th amendment cases.\n  I remember years ago arguing on this floor on these issues, and, of \ncourse, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and others wanted \nthese cases brought to the Federal courts because they were so afraid \nsome of the State courts would not do justice in civil rights cases. \nThey were right. They wanted them in Federal court. I do not blame \nthem.\n  The Federal courts are made up of judges who are nominated and \nconfirmed for life. Because of that, they should not have any political \nforces that would take them away from doing justice. In all honesty, \nnothing in this bill would stop Massachusetts classes made up wholly of \nMassachusetts citizens or even a majority of Massachusetts citizens \nfrom bringing these cases in State court, if they want.\n  One reason the Federal courts are so clogged is because of a wide \nvariety of cases that are now being brought in Federal court, partly \ncaused by people on both sides of the aisle. But there is no question \nFederal courts are not only good courts, by and large they are \nbasically fair courts. And by and large they are basically very \nsophisticated courts. And by and large they apply, in these particular \ncases, the laws of the States in which the suits are brought--I might \nadd, unless there are reasons from the Federal standpoint in applying \notherwise.\n  Now, there is nothing in this bill that stops legitimate cases from \nproceeding. There is nothing in this bill that takes consumer rights \naway. There is nothing in this bill that will not give consumers or \nthose who are injured a day in court. There is a lot in this bill to \nprevent some of the phony approaches that are taken by some in the \nlegal profession who should be ashamed of themselves. This bill \ncorrects those kinds of injustices, those kinds of excesses, those \nkinds of problems.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this carve-out amendment offered \nby my distinguished friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  This amendment excludes from the bill's existing jurisdictional \nprovisions those class actions involving civil rights violations and \nclass actions involving wage-hour disputes. But before I address the \nimprudence of carving out these types of cases, I would like to make it \nperfectly clear, as I think I have up to now, that S. 5 in no way \nimpairs the substantive rights of litigants to bring, among other \nclaims, civil rights and wage-hour claims. Some opponents of this bill \nseem ready to conveniently gloss over this critical fact in their \nefforts to pass bad information about what this bill does.\n  S. 5 is procedural in nature and simply moves larger interstate class \nactions to the appropriate forum where they belong in the first place: \nin Federal court. These class actions often involve the most money, \nparties from different States, and issues that transcend State lines. \nYet by the same token, the bill preserves States rights to adjudicate \ntruly local disputes on behalf of their citizens.\n\n  Now, those are facts. This bill does not take any rights away from \nanybody. But what we are trying to do is stop the forum shopping; in \nother words, finding jurisdictions that will render outrageous verdicts \nthat basically benefit the attorneys, the lawyers, not the people for \nwhom they are suing.\n  Well, let me say, first, an affirmative exclusion of civil rights \ncases from Federal jurisdiction runs counter to the bedrock principles \nof encouraging our Federal courts to adjudicate civil rights disputes. \nI remember, in days gone by, there was a demand that these cases be in \nFederal court because they are courts of primary jurisdiction under the \nConstitution and because, as a general rule, more justice was done.\n\n[[Page S1091]]\n\n  I think this principle speaks for itself when you look at the \nplethora of Federal civil rights statutes extending protections against \nemployment, housing, race, and gender discrimination. That is just to \nname a few. Indeed, the Federal courts' involvement with civil rights \nis so pervasive that Federal courts routinely hear claims brought under \nState civil rights laws. This is not unusual.\n  The Federal judiciary's extensive involvement in civil rights matters \nhas also led to favorable results for civil rights litigants. Honest \nlitigants are not going to lose in Federal court. It is just that \nsimple. And they are probably more greatly protected because there is \nnaturally less politics in Federal court.\n  Federal courts have a long record of certifying discrimination class \nactions and approving generous settlements in most of these cases.\n  Take, for instance, the recent Home Depot gender discrimination \nsettlement which paid class members somewhere in the neighborhood of \n$65 million or the $192 million Coca-Cola race discrimination \nsettlement in which each class member was guaranteed a recovery of at \nleast $38,000 in cold hard cash. And, of course, there is the recent \nFederal court certification of the largest civil rights class action in \nU.S. history involving 1.6 million former and current female employees \nof Wal-Mart.\n  These are successful, proven results that belie any claim that \nFederal courts are somehow hostile to civil rights actions. In fact, it \nis laughable to now say that we have to have these in State courts when \nall these years we have been working hard to get these cases to Federal \ncourt so they would be adjudicated more fairly.\n  Some of those who support a civil rights carve-out also contend the \nFederal courts are overworked and incapable of handling such matters, \nthat the State courts are better equipped. Give me a break. We have \nheard this concern raised repeatedly from opponents of this bill who \napparently believe that if they say it enough times, the proposition \nmay somehow turn out to be true and, at the very least, to minimize the \nsignificant deficiencies in our State courts. These critics claim that \nit takes 5 years to get a class action to trial in Federal courts. But \ndo they have the raw data to back these claims? Of course, they don't.\n  In reality, the median time for final disposition of a civil claim \nfiled in Federal court is 9.3 months, and the median time to trial in a \ncivil matter in Federal court is 22.5 months. Moreover, what some of \nthe critics hide is the fact that the State courts have experienced a \nmuch more rapid growth in civil filings than have the Federal courts. \nCivil filings in State trial courts of general jurisdiction have \nincreased 21 percent since 1984, and there are delays in many State \ncourts on civil actions that are longer than they are in Federal court.\n  As for filings in some of the more notable magnet State court \njurisdictions, let's look at some of the figures. Just look at this \nchart. The number of class actions filed in State courts have \nskyrocketed in State courts under current law. Take Palm Beach County, \nFL. It has gone up 35 percent between 1998 and 2000. In Jefferson \nCounty, TX, a notorious jackpot jurisdiction, it has gone up 82 \npercent. In Madison County, IL, another notorious jackpot \njurisdiction--in other words, a jurisdiction where defendants don't \nhave a chance because of politics and moneys donated to judges from the \ntrial lawyers in that particular jurisdiction, primarily--over 5,000 \npercent between 1998 and 2003. Why? Because it is a county that is out \nof whack. If the plaintiffs' attorneys can get cases in Madison County, \nthey are going to get big verdicts, outrageous verdicts for people who \naren't even sick, people who don't even have problems in some cases.\n  The overall increase in State courts is 1,315 percent. So don't use \nthat argument. If you add the fact that State courts are almost always \ncourts of general jurisdiction where they hear matters ranging from \ntraffic violations to domestic disputes, I think you get a pretty clear \npicture of what our State courts are faced with in terms of workload.\n  As a final point, I would like to note that the Judiciary Committee \nsoundly defeated this very amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts during markup last Congress. We reported the bill in a \nbipartisan 13-to-5 vote in this Congress. The committee voted against \nthe civil rights carve-out on a solid bipartisan basis and understood \nthe inherent problems with this amendment. This amendment lost footing \nin committee and should not gain traction here.\n  The second carve-out excludes wage and hour or timesharing claims \nfrom the bill. These are actions brought by employees against their \nemployers for violating wage and hour restrictions imposed under \napplicable labor laws. While these actions are certainly important for \nworking Americans, there is no principled basis to exclude them from \nthis bill, not one principled reason.\n\n  Again, let me be clear about S. 5. This bill in no way affects the \nsubstantive rights of these workers to seek redress for these wage and \nhour claims. In other words, employees who bring wage and hour claims \nagainst their employers will still have the exact same rights they do \nnow if this bill is enacted. The only way the bill could possibly \naffect these cases is by moving them to Federal court. But what the \nproponents of this amendment overlook is that if a wage and hour case \nmeets the interstate criteria of the bill, then there is absolutely no \nreason to exclude them from Federal court. It makes no difference if \nthe case involves a defective product, a false advertising claim, or a \nbreach of warranty. If the class action lawsuit involves parties from \ndifferent States and involves a large amount in controversy, regardless \nof whether the claims are predicated on State law, then the case should \nbe heard in Federal court. This is why we have diversity jurisdiction \nin the first place, and it is certainly what the Founding Fathers had \nin mind when they drafted our Constitution.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. It establishes \nbad policy and is nothing more than yet another attempt to weaken the \nbill. This amendment, including all other carve-outs, for that matter, \nalso flies in the face of the bipartisan compromise that is now \nembodied in S. 5. I intend to honor this compromise and encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Let me just say, it is unseemly to claim that the Federal courts are \nnot as good as the State courts. And it is even worse to claim that the \nFederal courts should not have jurisdiction in these matters. The fact \nis, we have provided through the Feinstein amendment language that \npermits certain cases to be in State courts. But when they get to the \nsize of the 100 or more in a class and over $5 million, these cases \nhave to be brought in Federal court. And the reason is because of these \njackpot jurisdictions that I have been pointing out that really do not \ndo justice and are not fair.\n  Earlier, the distinguished Senator from Illinois was talking about \nhow few cases are filed in Madison County, IL. What he doesn't tell you \nis that the minute the lawyers start talking about a class action and \nthey send a demand letter, the companies know they are dead if the case \nis brought in Madison County, IL. No matter how right they may be, they \nare dead because the judges in that particular jurisdiction are in the \npockets of the local lawyers with whom the out-of-State lawyers who \nhave these class actions align themselves in order to go in there and \nget these outrageous verdicts that would not be obtained in any fair \ncourt of law.\n  So what do the companies do? They have no choice. They will settle \nfor what they estimate the defense costs to be because why should they \ntake a chance on jackpot justice? And it then becomes, in the eyes of \nmany, a broken system of extortion, extortion by attorneys, extortion \nby the judges over companies that probably have little or nothing to do \nwith Madison County, IL, but because of the current system, wind up \nthere, either getting staggered with unjust judgments or doing what \nprudence tells them they have to do, and that is paying whatever they \nestimate the defense costs to be to get rid of the lawyers. It comes as \nclose to legal extortion as anything I have seen.\n\n  That is what we are trying to solve here. It doesn't take away \nanybody's rights. It just means they will have to prove their case in \nFederal courts. And Federal courts are very competent courts. Judges \nare appointed for life. They are less political, although every\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\nonce in a while you see some politicization of Federal court, but \nnothing like these jackpot justice jurisdictions that are constantly \nused by some of these unscrupulous lawyers to get outrageous verdicts \nso they can collect great big fees.\n  Yesterday, we talked about coupon settlements--the lawyers get huge \nfees and the person winds up with a $5 coupon that is meaningless. That \ndoesn't mean that some of these cases are not valid, but they could \njust as easily be won in Federal court, if they are valid, as they can \nin State courts, but not as easily as in these jackpot justice \njurisdictions where justice is denied. We can throw around big \ncorporations all we want, but businesses in this country are not all \nbig and, even if they are, they deserve to be treated justly.\n  That is what our court system should be doing. It should not \ndiscriminate against them because they are large corporations. If they \nare fair and right, they should be treated just as fairly and rightly \nas anybody else.\n  We have come close on this bill now a number of times, very close. In \nNovember of 2003, we struck a deal that gave the Class Action Fairness \nAct the requisite number of votes to pass even if the bill was \nfilibustered. We got the votes, guaranteed up to 62. It was a \nbipartisan compromise that allowed us to reach this commonsense \nagreement. Believe me, this compromise does not satisfy everybody or, \nfor that matter, doesn't satisfy anybody.\n  The fact is, it is what it is--a bipartisan compromise. If I would be \npermitted to write the bill the way I think it should be done, I think \nit would be perfect, and others in this body would feel the same way. \nBut we have worked out this bipartisan compromise and we need to stick \nwith it.\n  Senator Cornyn explained this morning why he believes the bill should \ngo further in correcting abuses in the current system, and he explained \nhow he would fix some of these problems legally. He is not wrong, by \nthe way. He also said he would not advance these amendments at this \ntime because he understands the complex dynamics in arriving at the \ncompromise bill. We have been at this for the last 6 years. That is how \nlong we have tried to get this bill through. This bill is not perfect, \nby any stretch of the imagination. No bill is around here, because we \nhave to work with 535 Members of Congress. Depending on your \nperspective, this bill either gave away too much or not enough.\n  The fact is, this bill is just about right and it is time to get it \ndone. We know we should get it done. A supermajority of those in this \nbody should get it done. But nearly a year and a half after we struck a \ndeal to get it done, a series of amendments are still being offered \nthat would scuttle this bill and, unfortunately, the amendment by the \nSenator from Massachusetts happens to be one of them. Let us get down \nto the brass tacks. It is rug-cutting time. If any amendments upset the \nessential compromises that have been negotiated over a long period of \ntime, this bill will not become law. The purpose of these amendments is \nnot to improve the bill but to destroy it. The House of Representatives \nwill not agree--they have made it super clear--to a bill that includes \namendments that gut this bill's modest and reasonable reforms. I have \nto say I don't blame them. They have seen this process for the last 6 \nyears. The American people have waited for this reform for far too \nlong. I should remind my colleagues that if we fail our constituents at \nthis time, the memory of the American people is a long one.\n  I will speak today about a number of amendments that will likely be \noffered. In my opinion, and in the opinion of those most familiar with \nthe bill, these amendments are poison pills, and everybody knows it. \nThese amendments were not part of our discussions with Senators \nSchumer, Dodd, and Landrieu that resulted in the current bipartisan \nlegislation. I don't mean to limit it to them. There were a whole raft \nof Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  I will repeat that for emphasis. We had a deal. None of these \namendments were part of this deal. What happened to the days when a \ndeal was a deal? These amendments are quite literally being offered at \nthe eleventh hour and I think for a purpose other than to improve the \nbill.\n  Let's be honest about it. Consumers, plaintiffs, and others who have \nrights are not going to be foreclosed from vindicating their right in a \ncourt of law. It is just that they are not going to be able to take \nthese cases--and certainly outrageous cases--to these jackpot justice \njurisdictions where justice is denied any longer--except under some \nloophole exceptions in this bill. But the vast majority of the problems \nshould be solved by this bill. There are a lot of people out there who \nhave been very badly mistreated because of the current broken tort \nprocess, who are praying we will be able to get this bill through.\n  Let me make this clear. If we add one of these amendments, I think \nthe bill is dead again, even though it has had 62 prime sponsors--\npeople who will automatically vote for this bill and who understand the \ngame here is to get a bill out that will do some justice in this \ncountry and stop some of the jackpot justice that has been going on.\n  I don't mean to denigrate anybody's amendment, but let's be fair and \nmake it clear that this bill does not take away rights. This bill \nenhances rights for both sides, and not just for plaintiffs but also \nfor defendants. So fairness in the tort system will be brought back to \nthe forefront. In the case of civil rights and wage-and-hour disputes, \nlook, for years we have argued they should be in Federal court. Now, \nall of a sudden, they don't want them in Federal court. All you can do \nis surmise: why is that? I think everybody knows why.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure for me to hear \nSenator Hatch discuss legal issues. He has had great experience with \nthem over the years, in the long time he has served on the Judiciary \nCommittee and as a lawyer in his own right. I think he summed up the \nsituation we are in and I thank him for doing so.\n  Actually, I believe that those who are seeking class action reform \nhave been very generous in reaching out to people who had some doubts \nto try to gain their votes in support, to make sure no one is hurt in \nany unfair way through the passing of this legislation. We are now at a \npoint where the time has come for us to pass class action reform.\n  I do not believe, and have never believed, we should be in the \nbusiness of eliminating class actions. They are not a bad thing in \nthemselves. Class actions, in fact, serve an important purpose. In many \ninstances, they are the only viable form of relief, where an individual \nhas claims that are so small it would not be economically feasible for \nan attorney to take an individual's case; but maybe thousands of people \nhave been unfairly treated in the same manner and an attorney can bring \none case and everybody can be compensated and the system can work very \neffectively. That is the whole theory behind class actions. It has \nalways been a good process under certain circumstances, but we have \nalways known it could also be abused. For the most part, I think \nFederal courts have done a good job handling those cases. Many State \ncourts have done a good job of handling those cases, but is now a \npattern by which some attorneys have learned to pick and choose States, \neven counties, where there may be only one judge, and they know how \nthat judge thinks about these cases, and they file the class action \nlawsuit there. The fact is that most nationwide class actions can be \nfiled anyplace in America--it makes sense that lawyers, therefore, \nchose to find the most favorable forum they can find in the entire \nUnited States. That is selective choice of forum. There are other \nproblems that arise with class actions, problems which have been around \nfor a long time. We have come to understand them and we need to do \nsomething about it. We can do something about it. It is the right thing \nto do. It will improve our system of justice.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act does not close doors to class action \nplaintiffs; rather it opens doors to fairness in this entire process. I \nagree with those who have said that the bill does not go far enough. I \nthink there are going to be many opportunities for clever attorneys to \ndraft complaints and conduct their litigation in a way that would avoid \nbeing covered by this\n\n[[Page S1093]]\n\nact, when in fact they ought to be covered by this act. Senator Cornyn \nhas made a number of those suggestions, and I have made some of those \nsuggestions. But the perfect, as they say, can be the enemy of the \ngood.\n  An agreement has been reached that people feel comfortable with. I \nhave been prepared not to offer a lot of amendments so we can get this \nbill to final passage and quick approval and end the years and years \nand years of debate on this matter that we know we ought to deal with.\n  As you look about and review what you hear and see who is making \ncomments on it, some of the things your read on the issue appeal to \nyou. Let me tell you about a Washington Post editorial I read a few \nyears ago that summed it up the class action issue quite well. \nPolitically, the Washington Post is a Democratic paper, a liberal \nnewspaper. But their editorial writers made some very important points \nthat I agree with. They said this:\n\n       Congress' first priority in the world of civil lawsuits \n     should be to change the rules of class actions.\n\n  In other words, of all of the problems we have in litigation, the one \nthis Congress ought to deal with first is class action lawsuits.\n\n       When working properly, class actions are an important \n     component of the American legal system, one that allows \n     efficient court consideration of numerous identical claims \n     against the same defendant.\n       In practice, no component of the legal system is more prone \n     to abuse.\n\n  Their analysis is that there is no component of the American legal \nsystem more prone to abuse than class actions.\n\n       For unlike normal lawyers who are retained by people who \n     actually feel wronged, class counsel, having alleged that a \n     product deficiency caused some small monetary damage to some \n     discernible group of people, largely appoint themselves.\n\n  In other words, a lot of people have difficulties, and the class \naction lawyer may discover what he thinks is a wrong. Then he appoints \nhimself to be the righter of that wrong. Then he goes out and \nidentifies a class. He does not talk to the individual clients, as \nlawyers do in a normal situation; he appoints himself to take on these \ncases.\n\n       The clients may not even be dissatisfied with the goods and \n     services they bought.\n\n  They may not be unhappy at all.\n\n       But unless they opt out of a class whose existence they may \n     be unaware, they become plaintiffs anyway.\n\n  I heard a Senator recently say he was involved in a class action, and \nthe person who was being sued was a friend, and he did not even know he \nwas involved.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Class actions present almost infinite venue shopping.\n\n  Infinite venue shopping, that is what I was saying. We have had \nlawsuits filed in Alabama. We have seen identical lawsuits filed in \nMississippi. We have seen them filed in Madison County, IL. Why? \nBecause a plaintiff in a large action that involves people throughout \nthe United States under current law can choose their place to file the \nlawsuit. When they get an appeal, it goes to the State of Illinois, \nMississippi, or Alabama's appellate courts, their supreme court, for \nfinal review. That is a legitimate concern and a matter that impacts \npeople throughout the United States.\n\n       National class actions can be filed just about anywhere, \n     and they are disproportionately brought in a handful of State \n     courts whose judges get elected with lawyers' money.\n\n  This is the Washington Post I am quoting. It is the same thing \nSenator Hatch indicated earlier. It is the reality, unfortunately.\n\n       These judges effectively become regulators of the products \n     and services produced elsewhere--\n\n  Not even in their county or State--\n\n     and sold throughout the Nation. And when cases are settled, \n     the clients get token payments while the lawyers get enormous \n     fees.\n\n  I am continuing to quote from the Washington Post:\n\n     This is not justice. It is an extortion racket that only \n     Congress can fix.\n\n  That is, unfortunately, the sad truth too often.\n  Some years later now, Senator Frist has made this Class Action \nFairness Act his first civil lawsuit priority. I know there are some \nwho see this bill as a moving train and they would like to add this or \nthat provision as a caboose to that train, but I hope we will exercise \nrestraint and pass a clean bill without amendments.\n  I know some have legitimate concerns and others want to put on poison \npills. They want to adopt amendments that will cause so much \ncontroversy that it can end up killing the entire bill. In my view, \nanything that does not make this bill stronger is a poison pill. We do \nnot need to, and must not, weaken this bill in any way. I have seen \nvery few amendments that are being offered that will make it stronger.\n  I believe in America's legal system. The Senator from Florida, the \nPresiding Officer, believes in our legal system. He believes in the \nright of people to sue in court and have redress for all and has given \na lot of his professional life to that cause. But for the most part, we \ndo have outstanding judges on Federal and State benches. They manage \ntheir dockets well and rule justly. There are some problems, however, \nthat Congress must resolve. The class action problem is certainly one \nof them.\n\n  To the extent possible, I believe that the courts have reached a \nlimit on what they can do through judicial interpretations to resolve \nthe issue. There was a time when ``drive-by'' class action \ncertifications were par for the course, and class actions were \ncertified without notice being given to the defendant even. Those \ntimes, have been eliminated for the most part by judicial ruling, in \npart, I believe, because of the Supreme Court decision in the Amchem \ncase where the Court made clear that even in conditional \ncertifications, rigorous analysis is required to certify a class and \nmust be conducted.\n  This ruling had far-reaching implications and limited the ability of \nplaintiff lawyers and the defendant companies to engage in collusion to \nthe detriment of whom? The class. Don't you think in these odd cases \nwhere the lawyer does not even know the members of the class he \nrepresents that ethical concerns are implicated? The situation simply \nis this: You sue a big company, you allege lots of problems, you talk \nwith their lawyers, and a wink and a nod occurs and you say: We will \ngive coupons to the people I am alleging to be victims, but you have to \ncompensate me as a lawyer for all this time I have spent in it; how \nabout $10 million?\n  The defendants go back and say: If we pay the lawyer $10 million and \nwe pay the coupons to these people--most of them will never use them--\nthis will get us out of the lawsuit. Yes, it is too much money to pay \nthe lawyer, but we will get it over with. Let's do it.\n  Who is looking out for the class members, the people in whose name \nthe lawsuit was brought? The answer is no one.\n  These problems, unfortunately, are not currently subject to being \nsettled by the courts or handled by the courts. I believe this \nlegislation will take a strong step toward fixing that kind of problem.\n  There are some who will argue that reform is not needed and this \nlegislation is even unfair. Let me ask this: Is it fair to be a member \nof a lawsuit of which you are unaware and do not even know you are a \nparty to it? Is it fair to receive a coupon settlement that basically \nrequires you to do business with a company that presumably cheated you \nin the first place? Is it fair to lose money even though you prevail in \nthe underlying lawsuit? And there have been instances--cases such as \nthe infamous Bank of Boston case--where plaintiffs, not even knowing \nthey are a member of the lawsuit, have had their bank accounts debited \nto pay for their portion of the attorney's fees--sometimes their \nportion of the attorney's fees is much more than the small coupon or \nmonetary amount they received as part of the settlement. That is simply \nnot right.\n  These questions of fairness represent the current status of many \nclass action lawsuits. In my view, there is nothing fair about the \nanswers we just mentioned. When we approved modifications to rule 23 \nnot too long ago, one of the primary goals was to ``assure adequate \nrepresentation of class members who have not participated in shaping \nthe settlement.'' After all, if the settlement is going to bind the \nclass member, it would seem they should not only be adequately \nrepresented, but they\n\n[[Page S1094]]\n\nwould be aware of the terms of that settlement and the compromises that \nwere involved in making the settlement. We can achieve fairness and \nseveral other logical goals such as that with this Class Action \nFairness Act.\n  That class actions are beneficial is not in doubt. They serve to the \nbenefit of America by limiting the number of times you have to try the \nsame issues in separate places, in differ courts with different judges.\n  They serve the interests of consistency and finality by avoiding \ninconsistent outcomes in separate trials where the cases revolve around \nidentical claims. They are to serve the interests of the class members, \nhowever, but that is, in fact, not the outcome of too many of these \ncases and therefore we need to reform this system.\n  So what we would strive to do with this legislation is to make the \nplaintiffs the real beneficiaries of such a lawsuit. It will provide \nprotections to class members, such as limiting the ability to award \ncoupon settlements and preventing class members from being harmed \ntwice, once by the defendant company, and the second time by class \naction settlement.\n  I believe we can make some great progress with this legislation if we \nkeep it clean. I hope we can exercise restraint and that we can do just \nthat.\n  Some have said Federal Government has no business with these \nlawsuits. As a person who does believe that States have constitutional \nrights and they have presumptions that cause us in Congress to be \nreluctant to violate either explicit constitutional requirements or to \nviolate maybe presumptions or indications or contemplations of the \nConstitution, I am extremely cautious about expanding federal \njurisdiction in Constitutionally questionable ways. But I do not \nbelieve this bill expands federal jurisdiction in any way that is \nConstitutionally questionable. I would like to read what the \nConstitution says about diversity and where a case of this kind should \nbe tried. Article III, section 2 of the Constitution, talks about the \npower of Federal courts and what their jurisdiction is. This is the \npower given to Federal courts by the U.S. Constitution at the beginning \nof our Republic. It states: ``The judicial Power shall extend to all \nCases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution''--disputes \nof the Constitution--``the Laws of the United States . . .''--involving \nlaws that we passed explicitly in Congress to Controversies to which \nthe United States shall be a party; to Controversies between two or \nmore States; between a State and Citizens of another State; between \nCitizens of different States . . .''\n\n  So our Founding Fathers thought seriously about this and stated in \nthe Constitution that if there is a lawsuit filed between people from \ndifferent States, there needs to be a neutral forum in which to try the \ncase. If there is a person from Alabama and a person from Massachusetts \nsuing one another, the person from Massachusetts might not feel \ncomfortable being tried in Alabama, and the person from Alabama might \nnot feel comfortable being tried in Massachusetts. That is what they \nput it in there for.\n  The home State plaintiff would always want to choose a more favorable \nforum. Perhaps he would choose his own State, would he not? That is \nwhat our Founding Fathers were concerned about.\n  In football, we call it ``home cooking.'' The Founders sought to \nprevent ``home cooking'' of lawsuits by putting Federal jurisdictional \nrules into the Constitution for these kinds of cases. Cases involving \ncitizens of different States were intended from the beginning to be \ntried in Federal court where judges are not elected but serve lifetime \nappointments and are answerable to the U.S. Supreme Court, not to any \none State court. That is the theory and it is important.\n  There are counties in Alabama where I personally know all the judges. \nI go to church with some of them. So if I am going to sue somebody, I \nam likely to choose a place where I would have the man who is in my \nchurch supper club try my case. Well, maybe they will strike him for \ncause, but what about his brother, who could also be a judge? My friend \nwho is a judge might say to his brother: Jeff is a good boy, make sure \nyou give him a fair trial. Whether we like it or not, these kinds of \nthings are reality, and that is what the Founders had in mind when they \nwrote the Constitution. That is why when there is a group of plaintiffs \nbeing represented by a lawyer that may not even know their names, this \nlawyer is going to look around and try to file the case where he thinks \nhe can have the best chance of success.\n\n  As a matter of fact, I do not even dispute him or her making that \nchoice. That is what lawyers are paid to do, to find the best place to \nfile the lawsuit.\n  That is taught in law school. They ask, well, where do you want to \nfile a lawsuit?\n  Well, I think it would be better to file in Federal court.\n  Then one is taught to study the case and justify filing it in Federal \ncourt. Or maybe a lawyer thinks it is better for his client to file it \nin State court. Lawyers are taught they should file the case where it \nis best for their client. I do not blame the lawyers. They are using \nthe law as we have now configured it.\n  I say it is our responsibility to look at the judicial system. If we \nlove it and care about it, respect it, and want it to be better, we \nwill continue to look at the legal system, and if the legal system has \na problem, it is our duty to examine how to fix it.\n  We have spent years now determining how to fix class action problems. \nWe have a bipartisan coalition in this Senate that has come together \nand is prepared to support this legislation. I say let us do it. Let us \nobserve how the system is working. From that observation, we can \nrealize that it can be made better. Let us step up to the plate and fix \nit.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senator from Utah. It is a pleasure to work \nwith him, Senator Grassley, and Senator Specter, who have all worked so \nhard on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I notice the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin is in the Chamber, but I would like to make a few more \nremarks if he does not feel too badly about it.\n  I support this bill. I have been working on it for 6 years. It is a \ngrand compromise. We have Democrats and Republicans. It is bipartisan. \nIt is not perfect, but it is as good as we can do and it will do an \nawful lot of good.\n  The evidence is clear and undeniable; the well-documented abuse of \nthe class action litigation device too often ends up victimizing \nplaintiffs, the very people that class actions are supposed to benefit.\n  These abuses cheat millions of consumers who unwittingly have their \nlegal rights adjudicated in local courts thousands of miles away. They \ndeny the due process rights of defendants who are relentlessly hauled \ninto a handful of small county courts where the playing field is \nunfairly tilted in favor of the personal injury bar, the plaintiffs' \nbar.\n  If that were not enough, class action abuses are eroding public \nconfidence in our civil justice system. When abuses do occur in the \nclass action system, the public can ultimately pay dearly through \nspiraling prices, lost jobs, and even bankrupt companies.\n  I have been listening to arguments from the other side, but to give \nthe class action problem some perspective, I want to consider just the \neffect of this litigation in one locale, Madison County, IL. There we \nfind a case study in rampant misconduct within the class action system, \nits corrupting effect on the courts, and the desperate need for reform.\n  This small county in the southwestern part of that State provides all \nthe evidence necessary to convince anyone that the legal system is \ncurrently being exploited by shameless and self-seeking plaintiffs' \nlawyers. Madison County, IL is a rural county. I imagine it is the type \nof county where maybe Abraham Lincoln first got his start as a young \nlawyer and an advocate for justice.\n  In some notes perhaps taken in preparation for a law lecture around \n1850, Lincoln set the ideal for his profession, a profession practiced \nby many in this Chamber, including myself.\n  No. 1, ``Discourage litigation . . . Point out how . . . the nominal \nwinner is often a real loser--in fees, expenses, and waste of time.''\n  No. 2, ``Never stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found \nthan one who does this. Who can be more\n\n[[Page S1095]]\n\nnearly a fiend than he who habitually overhauls the register of deeds \nin search of defective titles, whereon to stir up strife, and put money \nin his pocket? A moral tone ought to be infused into the profession \nwhich should drive such men out of it.''\n  And No. 3, ``An exorbitant fee should never be claimed.''\n  These words were uttered during a time when being a lawyer \nautomatically carried with it a title of honor, integrity, and trust.\n  Unfortunately, Lincoln's words no longer carry much meaning for some \nof the lawyers who have descended on Madison County. In the land of \nLincoln, the rule of law has too often been corrupted almost beyond \nrecognition by self-interested plaintiffs' lawyers and seemingly pliant \npublic officials. Some unscrupulous personal injury attorneys go forum \nshopping to find friendly jurisdictions. Certainly Madison County, IL \nis one of them.\n  Then some judges in those jurisdictions, some of whom are compromised \nby campaign contributions from the very same law firms arguing in their \ncourtrooms, sometimes certify these cases with the proverbial rubber \nstamp, even though they are not worthy of being certified.\n  Finally, sympathetic local juries trying out-of-State corporations \nhave sometimes bestowed unjustified and sometimes outrageous awards. \nThis pattern of behavior is not only an affront to the due process \nrights of defendants, but it breeds disrespect for the rule of law \nitself.\n  I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, `Well, \nthese are big corporations.' First, they aren't all big corporations, \nand second, even if they were, they still deserve fair treatment, due \nprocess, and an impartial justice system.\n  And make no mistake about it. These suits are not free. We all pay \nfor them. The American consumer pays for the costs of these class \nactions.\n  The courthouse in Madison County, IL is what scholars now describe as \na magnet court. Always on the lookout to find suitable venues for \nenriching themselves, entrepreneurial plaintiffs' attorneys--many of \nwhom practice in the field of personal injury--are sucked into its \norbit. The numbers alone tell the story. Over the last 5 years the \nnumber of class actions filed in the county has increased by 5,000 \npercent.\n  Let me repeat that so that astronomical figure can sink in. A 5,000-\npercent increase. It almost defies logic that so many national class \nactions are being brought in this small rural county.\n  In 1998, there were only two class actions filed in this county. In \n2000, that number rose to 39. In 2001, there were 43 new class actions. \nOne year later, the bridges leading to the riches of Madison County \nwere clogged with carpetbagging lawyers as word hit the street that the \nlocal court there was giving away money as though it was Christmas \nmorning. Enterprising plaintiffs' lawyers looking to make a quick buck \nknew Madison County was the place for business.\n  In 2004, 77 class action suits were filed. In 2003, there were \nanother 106. Between 1998 and 2003, the number of class actions in the \ncounty rose from 2 to 106 per year. In the last 4 years, the lawyers \nwho flocked to Madison County succeeded in having the following cases \ncertified.\n  All Sprint customers in the entire Nation who have ever been \ndisconnected on a cell phone call. That is a class action in Madison \nCounty.\n  Every Roto-Rooter customer in the country whose drains might have \nbeen repaired by a nonlicensed plumber.\n  All consumers who purchased limited edition Barbie dolls that were \nlater allegedly offered for a lower price elsewhere.\n  These are just three examples of the abuses that are going on.\n  I know my friend from Illinois, the minority whip, Senator Durbin, is \nunderstandably protective about the state of affairs in Madison County. \nHe points out that while many class actions are filed in Madison \nCounty, few are certified. It does not take a lot of cases like the \nones I talked about to create an environment that encourages cases that \nare marginal at best. Through their increased filings, class action \nattorneys tell us a great deal of what we need to know about Madison \nCounty. That many of these cases are settled upon filing or even before \nthey are filed tells us a lot. A demand letter from a class action \nattorney with a Madison County address is a dreaded piece of \ncorrespondence for any company or any defendant. If these types of \ncases were not such a drain on our economy, it would almost be easy to \nlaugh at some of these cases.\n  We question the efficiency and fairness of a small county courthouse \nin Illinois adjudicating cases against national companies involving \nvarious State and Federal regulations and involving millions, if not \nbillions, of dollars in settlements where neither the majority of \nplaintiffs nor the defendants are typically residents of the county. \nThese locally elected judges, with the close assistance of interested \nplaintiffs' attorneys, in effect set policy for the entire Nation, \ndefying the principles of self-government on which our Federal system \nis based.\n  This situation is a colossal mess, and a few plaintiffs' lawyers are \nexploiting it to the hilt, and giving all of us who love the practice \nof law a bad name.\n  The same five firms appeared as counsel in 45 of all cases filed \nbetween 1999 and 2000. Of the 66 firms appearing in these cases, 56 of \nthem--85 percent--had office addresses outside of Madison County.\n  In this small county, with a population of only 259,000, there are \nsomehow more mesothelioma claims from asbestos exposure than in all of \nNew York City with its population of better than 8 million. One nine-\nmember firm with an office in Madison County claims to handle more \nmesothelioma cases than any firm in the country.\n  Who benefits from all of this litigation? One Madison County judge \napproved a $350 million settlement against AT and Lucent for \nallegedly billing customers who leased telephones at an unfair rate. \nWhat did the lawyers get? Forty-four lawyers from four firms will split \n$80 million for legal fees and $4 million for expenses. And the \ncustomers? They actually lost money. After their legal fees, the \naverage class member got hit for $6.49.\n  Think about that.\n  Lincoln's principles are a distant memory in Madison County. The \nWashington Post succinctly described the situation. ``Having invented a \nclient, the lawyers also get to choose a court. Under the current \nabsurd rules, national class actions can be filed in just about any \ncourt in the country.''\n  And those lawyers often pick Madison County. They are picking it \nbecause it is what some call a magic jurisdiction.\n  Let me refer to this chart, called ``Magic Jurisdictions.'' This is \nDickie Scruggs, one of the best plaintiffs' lawyers in the country, a \nman I have great respect for. But in a luncheon talk on the asbestos \nsituation at a panel discussion at the Prudential Securities Financial \nResearch and Regulatory Conference on May 9, 2002, he had this to say. \nThis is Dickie Scruggs. You can believe him. This man understands the \nlitigation field. He is a billionaire from practicing law. He said:\n\n       What I call the ``Magic Jurisdictions'' is where the \n     judiciary is elected with verdict money. The trial lawyers \n     have established relationships with the judges that are \n     elected. They are State court judges. They are populists. \n     They have large populations of voters who are in on the deal. \n     They are getting their piece, in many cases. And so it's a \n     political force in their jurisdiction and it's almost \n     impossible to get a fair trial if you are a defendant in some \n     of these places. The plaintiff lawyer walks in there and \n     writes the number on the blackboard, and the first juror \n     meets the last one coming out the door with that amount of \n     money. The cases are not won in the courtroom. They're won \n     on the back roads long before the case goes to trial. Any \n     lawyer fresh out of law school can walk in there and win \n     the case, so it doesn't matter what the evidence or the \n     law is.\n\n  That is one of the leading plaintiffs' lawyers in the country. He was \nhonest enough to call it the way it is in Madison County. Madison \nCounty is not the only jackpot jurisdiction, but I am concentrating on \nit since the distinguished Senator from Illinois has focused his \nremarks on our criticism of this jurisdiction.\n  Dickie Scruggs is a fine lawyer. I have said that. I worked with him \non the tobacco settlement. He and Mississippi Attorney General Mike \nMoore did a good job for their clients and the American public. I am \nvery familiar with what they did. I am familiar with the Castano Group \nas well, which\n\n[[Page S1096]]\n\nrisked millions of dollars to bring the tobacco suits. They had an \nentire multifloor building filled with documents they accumulated at \nthe cost of millions of dollars to make their case in the tobacco \nsuits.\n  Dickie Scruggs is a fine lawyer. So is Mike Moore. So are the Castano \nGroup lawyers.\n  Having said that, there is a reason the Super Bowl is held at a \nneutral site. It is clear that Madison County is not a neutral site. \nWhen it comes to class action defendants trying a class action case in \nMadison County, it is like shooting fish in a barrel.\n  Dickie Scruggs is simply too good of a lawyer to need any unfair \nadvantage and that goes for the vast majority of plaintiffs' attorneys \nin our country. But there are a minority of lawyers who are causing the \nvast majority of our problems.\n  What makes for a magical jurisdiction? In a magic jurisdiction, the \nsupposedly objective judges and jury, all stand to gain from a \nsettlement. Madison County, as the Chicago Tribune notes, is a jackpot \njurisdiction where local newspapers ``sport advertisements looking for \nthe local plaintiff that can provide a convenient excuse to file.''\n  Some have concluded that this choice of venue might have something to \ndo with the fact that in recent years the elected judges of the circuit \ncourt of Madison County have received at least three-quarters of their \ncampaign funding from the lawyers who appear before them in these class \naction suits. In a simpler time, the State court would only certify a \nclass if there was a substantial local connection. Some of the judges \nin Madison County have created an environment where a lifelong resident \nof Washington State, who worked in Washington, was allegedly exposed to \nasbestos in Washington, never received medical treatment in Illinois, \nand had no witnesses in Illinois to testify in his behalf, actually \nthought it was worth a shot to bring suit in a strange town halfway \nacross the country. What was his connection to Madison County? He \nvacationed in Illinois for 10 days with his family nearly 50 years ago.\n  In this case, the court did the right thing and refused to certify \nthis man's claim. But that a lawyer would even consider bringing it \nshows how far gone Madison County is. So far, the Illinois Supreme \nCourt has taken the extraordinary step of rebuking it. As legal ethics \nprofessor Susan Koniak of Boston University School of Law explains:\n\n       Madison County judges are infamous for approving anything \n     put before them, however unfair to the class or suggestive of \n     collusion that is.\n\n  This is not justice. This is a travesty. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \none of this Nation's great newspapers, has followed this epidemic of \nlitigation closely. They describe the run on the Madison County \ncourthouse as resembling ``gleeful shoppers mobbing a going out of \nbusiness sale.''\n\n  Due process itself is corrupted by this circus. What is going on in \nMadison County too closely resembles legalized extortion in the eyes of \nmany observers. The deck is stacked against these companies hauled to \nIllinois to answer these charges. The cases are sometimes heard on an \nexpedited basis. Under these pressures they are typically given an \noffer they cannot refuse. Once the class is certified, they feel \ncompelled to settle, regardless of the merits of the case. The risk of \nloss is simply too high. They do not even have to wait until the class \nis certified. They know that in most cases the class will be certified \nby the judges of Madison County. A simple demand causes many companies \nto say, `let's buy out of this for the lowest price we can, even though \nwe do not owe them a dime. We will just settle for the attorney's \nfees.' These settlements are to the detriment of legitimate claims.\n  The class never has to be certified. No self-respecting lawyer will \nwant to try a case in a county where the deck is totally stacked \nagainst his client. And so they settle.\n  Let us be clear, these are not truly local disputes.\n  S. 5 does nothing to remove local disputes from local courts. The \nsuits we are talking about in Madison County and other jackpot \njurisdictions are on behalf of nationwide classes of clients against \ncorporations that do business in every State. Madison County is not \nchosen as the venue because of its quaint scenery. It is chosen because \ndefendants in these class actions often do not get a fair shake in \nMadison County.\n  This is not a triumph of federalism and local decisionmaking. It is \nthe evisceration of federalism and fairness. A bedrock principle of our \nfederal system is that states are largely free to regulate their own \nparticular affairs. To allow one State, in effect, to legislate for \nanother is to violate an important principle of self-government that \nthis country is built upon. Madison County has been flooded with class \naction claims and now the Nation is drowning in them. This is a classic \ncase for Federal intervention. In fact, this is a case study for the \ntype of intervention in Federal affairs the Constitution was meant to \nallow.\n  What happens in Madison County affects the whole country. The \noverwhelming majority of class actions filed in Madison County are \nnationwide lawsuits in which 99 percent of the class members live \noutside the county. As a result, decisions reached in Madison County \ncourts affect consumers all over the country and the county's elected \njudges effectively set national policies on important commercial \nissues.\n  There is a place for personal injury law in the American justice \nsystem. I understand that. I am an attorney. I have tried many cases. I \nknow that there is a legitimate and honest place for personal injury \nsuits in our civil justice system. Americans have a sacred right to \ntake their case to court when they are harmed by a person or product. \nYet this right is seriously undermined by a seriously compromised class \naction regime. To help rescue it, we need to enact this reform. Today's \nlawyers do not take cases that come to them. They invent cases. They \nbehave more like entrepreneurs than counsel, trying to find an issue \nand income stream before they find a plaintiff. They act like \nbusinessmen--the CEOs of Trial Lawyers, Incorporated.\n  The problem is that their business plan makes hash out of our system \nof impartial justice. It simply defies belief that county courts are \nthe proper venue for multijurisdictional litigation. Some of the \nplaintiffs' bar have put a ``pay the lawyer first'' business model in \nmotion in Madison County. First, find sympathetic judges. Then bankroll \ntheir campaigns. And to seal the deal, move the case through the system \nso fast that the defendants do not always get a fair opportunity to \nfully investigate the claim. Justice does demand fairness, but our \nsystem of decentralized class action litigation is fundamentally unfair \nto defendants, plaintiffs, and the average American who ends up footing \nthe bill for the unjustified billion-dollar settlements.\n  If this were a board game, it would be ``Class Action Monopoly.'' \nStart at `Go', and come up with an idea for a lawsuit. Find a named \nplaintiff to pay off. Make allegations, no proof needed. Get out of \nrule 23, the Federal rule 23, free. Convince your magnet State court \njudge to certify the ``class.'' File copycat lawsuits in State courts \nall over the country. Sue as many companies in as many States possible \neven if they have no connection to the State.\n  Who gets the money? In the Columbia House case, $5 million for \nlawyers, discount coupons for plaintiffs. In the Blockbuster case, \n$9.25 million for lawyers, free movie coupons for plaintiffs. In the \nBank of Boston case, $8.5 million for lawyers; some claimants even had \nto pay themselves.\n  But ``What happens to me?'' Your employer takes a hit, maybe lays you \noff. Your health and car insurance premiums go up. And we are all \nfamiliar with that. The lawyers win, you lose. This game gets pretty \nold, pretty quick. But this is this jackpot monopoly system we have in \nMadison County, and a whole bunch of jackpot jurisdictions in this \ncountry.\n  Now, the Class Action Fairness Act is an important but modest reform. \nIt does not deprive substantive legal rights to any American. All it \ndoes is make it easier to put these national cases where they belong, \nand that is in our Federal courts.\n  According to one study, 98 of the 113 class actions filed in Madison \nCounty from 1998 to early 2002 could have been moved to Federal court \nunder this legislation. Justice demands that we act. We cannot play \naround with this any more. Those who are injured will get\n\n[[Page S1097]]\n\ntheir day in court, but it will be Federal court, with sophisticated \njudges who are appointed for life, who have no reason to be unfair. By \nvoting for S. 5, we will help make sure they get it in a court where \njustice can be dispensed.\n  I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the Class Action Fairness Act, S. 5. \nNotwithstanding its title, I do not think this bill is fair. I do not \nthink it is fair to citizens who are injured by corporate wrongdoers \nand are entitled to prompt and fair resolution of their claims in a \ncourt of law. I do not think it is fair to our State courts, which are \ntreated by this bill as if they cannot be trusted to issue fair \njudgments in cases brought before them. And I do not think it is fair \nto State legislatures, which are entitled to have the laws that they \npass to protect their citizens interpreted and applied by their own \ncourts. This bill is not only misnamed, it is bad policy, and I do \nthink it should be defeated.\n  Make no mistake, by loosening the requirements for Federal diversity \njurisdiction over class actions, S. 5 will result in nearly all class \nactions being removed to Federal court. This is a radical change in our \nFederal system of justice. We have 50 States in this country, each with \nits own laws and courts. State courts are an integral part of our \nsystem of justice. They have worked well for our entire history. It is \nhard to imagine why this Senate, which includes many professed \ndefenders of federalism and the prerogatives of State courts and State \nlawmakers, would support such a wholesale stripping of jurisdiction \nfrom the States over class actions. By removing these actions from \nState court, Congress would shift adjudication away from State \nlawmakers and State judges towards Federal judges, who are often not as \nfamiliar with the nuances of State law. In my opinion, the need for \nsuch a radical step has not been demonstrated.\n  Actually, the leaders of the Federal and State judiciary agree. I \ndon't know if it has taken a position on this particular bill, but the \nJudicial Conference of the United States has opposed legislation like \nS. 5 that would remove most class actions from State to Federal court. \nFederal judges don't particularly like diversity jurisdiction cases. \nThey certainly are not in favor of legislation that would bring many \nmore large, complicated civil cases brought under State law to their \ncourts. And the Board of Directors of the Conference of State Chief \nCourt Justices expresses quite well the concerns of State judges about \nthis bill. Its letter states:\n\n       Absent hard evidence of the inability of the state judicial \n     systems to hear and fairly decide class actions brought in \n     state courts, we do not believe such a procedure [transfer of \n     class actions to federal court] is warranted. . . . Our \n     position is not new and it is consistent with the position of \n     our counterparts in the federal judicial system.\n\n  Class actions are an extremely important tool in our system of \njustice. They allow plaintiffs with very small claims to band together \nto seek redress. Lawsuits are expensive. Without the opportunity to \npursue a class action, an individual plaintiff often simply cannot \nafford his or her day in court. But through a class action, justice can \nbe done and compensation for real injuries can be obtained.\n  Yes, I do agree, there are abuses in some class action suits. Some of \nthe most disturbing have to do with class action settlements that offer \nonly discount coupons to the members of the class and a big payoff to \nthe plaintiffs' lawyers. I am pleased that the issue of discount \ncoupons is addressed in the bill, because the bill we considered in \nOctober 2003 did nothing about that problem. The bill now requires that \ncontingency fees in coupon settlements will be based on coupons \nredeemed, not coupons issued. Attorney's fees will also be determined \nby reasonable time spent on a case and will be subject to court \napproval. The bill also allows a court to require that a portion of \nunclaimed coupons be given to one or more charitable organizations \nagreed to by the parties. I do agree, these are all good changes, but \nthey do not change my view that the bill, as a whole, unfairly \ninterferes with the States' administration of justice.\n  I appreciate that the supporters of S. 5 modified the new diversity \njurisdiction rules for class actions in an effort to allow plaintiffs \nin State class actions more opportunities to remain in State court. \nUnder the new bill, a district court must decline jurisdiction if two-\nthirds of the plaintiffs and the primary defendants are from the State \nwhere the action was filed, and there is at least one defendant who is \na citizen of that State from whom significant relief is sought and \nwhose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted \nby the proposed class. In addition, the principal injuries resulting \nfrom the alleged conduct of each defendant must have occurred in the \nState in which the action was originally filed.\n\n  These criteria are an improvement on the underlying bill. But the \njurisdictional requirements for class actions to remain in State courts \nare still too burdensome. Under the new language, for example, a class \naction brought by Wisconsin citizens against a Delaware-based company \nfor selling a bad insurance policy would probably be removed to Federal \ncourt even if Wisconsin-based agents were involved in selling the \npolicies.\n  In addition, the new bill provides that district courts can only \ndecline jurisdiction if during the 3-year period preceding the filing \nof the action no other similar class action has been filed against any \nof the defendants even if the case is filed on behalf of other \nplaintiffs. Thus, the filing of a class action in one State court may \nlead to the successful removal of a similar case filed in another State \non behalf of plaintiffs in that State. If a defendant is engaging in \nconduct in number of different States that violates the separate laws \nof those States, why shouldn't that defendant be held accountable in \ndifferent State courts under different state laws? Do we really need \nthe Federal courts to get involved in these State law cases?\n  The bottom line is that this bill still sends the majority of class \nactions to Federal court. The proponents of this bill have chosen a \nremedy that goes far beyond the alleged problem.\n  Furthermore, under S. 5, many cases that are not class actions at all \nare included in the definition of ``mass action,'' a new term coined by \nthis bill. S. 5 simply requires that the plaintiffs be seeking damages \nof more than $75,000 for the case to be considered a mass action and, \ntherefore, removable to Federal court. This provision unfairly limits \nState court authority to manage its docket and to consolidate claims in \norder to more efficiently dispense justice.\n  A particularly troubling result of this bill will be an increase in \nthe workload of the Federal courts. We all know these courts are \nalready overloaded. In the 2004 Year End Report on the Federal \nJudiciary, for example, Chief Justice Rehnquist reported that the \ncurrent budget crisis in the Federal judiciary has forced courts to \nimpose hiring freezes, furloughs, and reductions in force. He noted \nthat there is a dire need for additional federal judgeships to deal \nwith the Federal courts' ever-increasing caseload. The Congress has led \nthe way in bringing more and more litigation to the Federal courts, \nparticularly criminal cases. Criminal cases, of course, take precedence \nin the Federal courts because of the Speedy Trial Act. So if you look \nat this bill in the context, the net result of removing virtually all \nclass actions, civil cases, of course, to Federal court will be to \ndelay those cases.\n  There is an old saying with which everyone is familiar: ``justice \ndelayed is justice denied.'' I hope my colleagues will think about that \naphorism before voting for this bill. Let's think about the real world \nof Federal court litigation and the very real possibility that long \nprocedural delays in overloaded Federal courts will mean that \nlegitimate claims may never be heard. My colleagues who support this \nbill tend to dismiss these arguments. They say that the Federal courts \nwill offer adequate redress for legitimate claims, that they will \nfaithfully apply State laws. I certainly hope they are right because \nthis bill seems to be headed for enactment. But if they are wrong, \ncitizens and consumers will be the ones who suffer.\n  One little-noticed aspect of this bill illustrates the possibilities \nfor delay\n\n[[Page S1098]]\n\nthat the bill provides, even to defendants who are not entitled to have \na case removed to Federal court under the bill's relaxed diversity \njurisdiction standards.\n  Under current law, if a Federal court decides that a removed case \nshould be remanded, or returned, to State court, that decision is \ngenerally not appealable. It would be different under this bill, if it \nbecomes law. This bill allows defendants to immediately appeal a \ndecision by a Federal district court that a case does not qualify for \nremoval to Federal court and should be remanded to State court.\n  Fortunately, the revised bill now requires such appeals to be decided \npromptly. It does not, however, do anything about the fact that the \nlower court may take months or even years to make a decision on the \nmotion to remand. That means that a plaintiff class that is entitled, \neven under this bill, to have a case heard by a State court may still \nhave to endure years of delay while its remand motion is pending in the \nFederal district court. Where is the ``fairness'' in that? I plan to \noffer an amendment to address that problem, and I certainly hope the \nbill's sponsors and supporters will give it serious consideration.\n  When I offered this amendment in the Judiciary Committee, I learned \nthat a number of the supporters of the bill recognize the importance of \nthe issue that my amendment raises. The chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee indicated that he would take a serious look at it and see if \nthere is an accommodation that can be reached. So I did not seek a vote \nin committee on the amendment. I stand ready to negotiate on this issue \nand I hope there will be a serious effort here to reach agreement.\n  We have heard a lot of talk on this floor about the need to pass this \nbill without amendment--without any amendment at all--to protect some \nkind of ``delicate balance'' with the House and with the corporate \nsupporters of the bill like the Chamber of Commerce. I ask my \ncolleagues who support this bill, why would you not support a \nreasonable amendment that will make this bill fairer to plaintiffs who \nbring cases that under the bill's own terms should remain in State \ncourt? Please don't let this so-called delicate balance override your \nduty as legislators to do what is right.\n  It is important to remember that this debate is not about resolving \nquestions of Federal law in the Federal courts. Federal question of \njurisdiction already exists for that. Any case involving a Federal \nstatute can be removed to Federal court under current law. This bill \ntakes cases that are brought in State court solely under State laws \npassed by State legislatures and throws them into Federal court. This \nbill is about making it more time-consuming and more costly for \ncitizens of a State to get the redress that their elected \nrepresentatives have decided they are entitled to if the laws of their \nState are violated.\n  Diversity jurisdiction in cases between citizens of different States \nhas been with us for our entire history as a nation. Article III, \nsection 2 of the Constitution provides: ``The judicial Power shall \nextend . . . to Controversies between Citizens of different States.'' \nThis is the constitutional basis for giving the Federal courts \ndiversity jurisdiction over cases that involved only questions of State \nlaw.\n  The very first Judiciary Act, passed in 1789, gave the Federal courts \njurisdiction over civil suits between citizens of different States \nwhere over $500 was at issue. In 1806, in the case of Strawbridge v. \nCurtiss, the Supreme Court held that this act required complete \ndiversity between the parties. In all other instances, the Court said, \na case based on State law should be heard by the State courts. So this \nbill before us changes a nearly 200-year-old practice in this country \nof preserving the Federal courts for cases involving Federal law or \nwhere no defendant is from the State of any plaintiff in a case \ninvolving only State law.\n  Why is such a drastic step necessary? Why do we need to prevent State \ncourts from interpreting and applying their own State laws in cases of \nany size or significance? One frequent argument is that businesses \ncannot get a fair day in court because of renegade State court judges. \nYet, there really is no evidence to back up these claims. Of the 3,141 \ncounties, parishes, and boroughs in the State court systems of the \nUnited States, the so-called American Tort Reform Association could \nonly identify nine jurisdictions that they consider ``unfair'' to \ndefendants. Four other jurisdictions were declared as ``dishonorable \nmentions.'' But, the association only provided data on two of these \njurisdictions--Madison County, IL, which the Senator from Utah was \ntalking about, and St. Clair County, IL. The Senator from Utah cited \nstatistics of increases in class action filings up through 2003. Yet in \nMadison County, the villain in the story told by the Senator from Utah, \nthe number of class action filings has decreased by 30 percent between \n2003 and 2004. So defendants have decided that State judges are unfair \nin two jurisdictions out of 3,000, but how does this constitute a \ncrisis? The answer is simple there isn't one.\n\n  Another argument we hear is that the trial lawyers are extracting \nhuge and unjustified settlements in State courts, which has become a \ndrag on the economy. We also hear that plaintiffs' lawyers are taking \nthe lion's share of judgments or settlements to the detriment of \nconsumers. But a recent empirical study contradicts these arguments. \nTheodore Eisenberg of Cornell Law School and Geoffrey Miller of NYU Law \nSchool recently published the first empirical study of class action \nsettlements. Their conclusions, which are based on data from 1993-2002, \nmay surprise some of the supporters of this bill.\n  First, the study found that attorneys' fees in class action \nsettlements are significantly below the standard 33 percent contingency \nfee charged in personal injury cases. The average class action \nattorney's fee is actually 21.9 percent. In addition, the attorneys' \nfees awarded in class action settlements in Federal court are actually \nhigher than in State court settlements. Attorney fees as a percent of \nclass recovery were found to be between 1 and 6 percentage points \nhigher in Federal court class actions than in State court class \nactions.\n  A final finding of the study is that there has been no appreciable \nincrease in either the amount of settlements or the amount of \nattorneys' fees awarded in class actions over the past 10 years. The \nstudy, therefore, indicates that there is no crisis here, no explosion \nof huge judgments, no huge fleecing of consumers by their lawyers. This \nbill is a solution in search of a problem. It is a great piece of \nlegislation for wrongdoers who would like to put off their day of \nreckoning by moving cases to courts that are less convenient, slower, \nand more expensive for those who have been wronged. It is a bad bill \nfor consumers, for State legislatures, and for State courts.\n  This bill seems not to be about class action abuses, but about \ngetting cases into Federal court where it takes longer and is more \nexpensive for plaintiffs to get a judgment. The cumulative effect of \nthis bill is to severely limit State court authority and ultimately \nlimit victims' access to prompt justice. Despite improvements made \nsince the last time the Senate considered this bill, the bill will \nstill place significant barriers for consumers who want to have their \ncases heard in State court. Remand orders are still appealable, and the \nmass tort definition does not protect State courts' authority to \nconsolidate cases and manage their dockets more efficiently. All the \nelements outlined in the bill before us will result in the erosion of \nState court authority and the delay of justice for our citizens. \nTherefore, I cannot support this unfair ``Class Action Fairness Act'' \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Class Action \nFairness Act of 2005. This legislation addresses the continuing \nproblems in class action litigation, particularly unfair and abusive \nsettlements that shortchange consumers across America.\n  The time for this bill has come. We have worked very closely on a \nbipartisan basis with Senator Grassley, Senator Carper, and Senator \nHatch for several Congresses and, more recently with Senators \nFeinstein, Dodd, Schumer, and Landrieu. Without this close cooperation \nand tremendous effort, we would not be on the verge of passing class \naction reform. Finally, Senators Frist and Reid deserve praise for \ncrafting a fair process for the consideration of this legislation.\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\n  Class action cases are an important part of our justice system \nbecause they enable people who have been harmed in similar ways to \npursue claims collectively that would otherwise be too expensive to \nbring individually. When these cases proceed as intended, injured \nparties are able to successfully pursue lawsuits in cases involving \ndefective products or employment discrimination, or other wrongs, and \nrecover fair damages.\n  Unfortunately, the system does not always work as it should. In fact, \nconsumers are frequently getting the short end of the stick in class \naction cases, recovering only coupons or pocket change while their \nlawyers reap millions. Too often, the class action system is being \ntaken advantage of to the detriment of consumers and others who have \nbeen harmed. The Washington Post put it clearly:\n\n       No portion of the American civil justice system is more of \n     a mess than the world of class actions.\n\n  Our bill addresses the problem in a few straightforward ways. First, \nthe bill helps consumers by guaranteeing that they receive a better \nunderstanding of their rights and responsibilities in a class action \nlawsuit. Our bill includes a class action consumer bill of rights to \nlimit coupon cases and other unfair settlements.\n  Second, this bill provides that state attorneys general are notified \nof proposed class action settlements. This encourages a neutral third \nparty to weigh in on whether a settlement is fair for the plaintiffs \nand to alert the court if they do not believe that it is.\n  Finally, we allow some class action lawsuits to be removed to Federal \ncourt. As we all know, some are concerned about this provision. Yet, \nmoving some class action cases to Federal court is only common sense. \nWhen a problem affects people in many States or involves a national \nproblem, it is only fitting that the case be heard in Federal court.\n  We took special care during the course of our negotiations to ensure \nthat the appropriate courts heard the right cases. This bill has never \nbeen an effort to either stop class action cases or send them all to \nthe Federal courts. Rather, those cases that primarily involve people \nfrom only one State will remain in that State's court. These changes \nwill ensure that class action cases are handled efficiently and in the \nappropriate venues and that no case that has merit will be turned away.\n  Stories of nightmare class action settlements that affect consumers \naround the country are all too frequent. For example, a suit against \nBlockbuster video in Texas yielded dollar off coupons for future video \nrentals for the plaintiffs while their attorneys collected $9.25 \nmillion. In California State court, a class of 40 million consumers \nreceived $13 rebates on their next purchase of a computer or monitor--\nin other words they had to purchase hundreds of dollars more of the \ndefendants' product to redeem the coupons. In essence, the plaintiffs \nreceived nothing, while their attorneys took almost $6 million in legal \nfees. We could list many more examples of abuses in State court, but \nlet me discuss just one more case that is almost too strange to \nbelieve.\n  I am speaking about the notorious Bank of Boston class action suit \nand the outrageous case of Martha Preston from Baraboo, WI. She was an \nunnamed class member of a lawsuit in Alabama State court against her \nmortgage company that ended in a settlement. The settlement was a bad \njoke. She received $4 and change in the lawsuit, while her attorneys \npocketed $8 million.\n  Yet the huge sums that her attorneys received were not the worst of \nthe story. Soon after receiving her $4, Ms. Preston discovered that her \nlawyers took $80, twenty times her recovery, from her escrow account to \nhelp pay their fees. Naturally shocked, she and the other plaintiffs \nsued the lawyers who quickly turned around and sued her in Alabama, a \nState she had never visited, for $25 million. Not only was she $75 \npoorer for her class action experience, but she also had to defend \nherself against a $25 million suit by the very people who took \nadvantage of her in the first place.\n  The class action process is clearly in serious need of reform. \nComprehensive studies support this position. For example, a study on \nthe class action problem by the Manhattan Institute finds that class \naction cases are being brought disproportionately in a few State courts \nso that the plaintiffs' lawyers may take advantage of those specific \ncourts that have relaxed class action rules.\n  A RAND study offered three primary explanations for why national \nclass action cases should be in Federal court. ``First, Federal judges \nscrutinize class action allegations more strictly than State judges . . \n. Second, State judges may not have adequate resources to oversee and \nmanage class actions with a national scope. Finally, if a single judge \nis to be charged with deciding what law will apply in a multistate \nclass action, it is more appropriate that this take place in Federal \ncourt than in State court.\n  Our bill attempts to follow these recommendations and ensure that \ncases with a national scope are heard in Federal court. All the while, \ncases that are primarily of a single state interest remain in State \ncourt under our bill. Let me emphasize the limited scope of this \nlegislation. We do not close the courthouse door to any class action. \nWe do not deny reasonable fees for class lawyers. We do not cause undue \ndelays for these cases. And we do not mandate that every class action \nbe brought in Federal court. Instead, we simply promote closer and \nfairer scrutiny of class actions and class settlements.\n  Right now, people across the country can be dragged into lawsuits \nunaware of their rights and unarmed on the legal battlefield. What our \nbill does is give back to regular people their rights and \nrepresentation. This measure may not stop all abuses, but it moves us \nforward. It will help ensure that unsuspecting people like Martha \nPreston don't get ripped off.\n  Mr. President, we believe this is a moderate approach to correct the \nworst abuses, while preserving the benefits of class actions. The bill \nrepresents a finely crafted compromise. We believe it will make a \ndifference. We urge its passage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was on the floor of the Senate earlier \npreparing to offer an amendment, and I lost my voice. There was \ncheering in the galleries, but I have decided to soldier on and try to \npresent this amendment again. I will try to abbreviate any remarks to \nspare the audience from what may be a painful process for them.\n  We are considering the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. I have \nlistened to some of the speeches on the Senate floor. Senator Lott of \nMississippi said: Do not be confused. This is not tort reform, this is \ncourt reform. I thought that was an interesting comment because there \nhas been some concern over whether this class action change would \naffect a body of lawsuits known as mass torts--in other words, the \ntypes of class actions that relate to physical injuries that are common \nto mass tort cases.\n  Section 4(a) of S. 5 talks about ``mass actions,'' a different term \naltogether. It requires mass actions be treated the same as class \nactions under the bill. The big question is whether that kind of \nlawsuit will be taken out of a State court and put into a Federal \ncourt. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, Federal courts are not \nfriendly to class actions. They are very strict in those that they \nwould consider, and then they are very limited in their scope of \nliabilities. The business interests that are pushing for this change in \nthe law know that if they can get these lawsuits into a Federal court, \nthey are less likely to be found liable. That is what this whole debate \nis all about.\n  I have tried to take a close look at the mass actions section of this \nclass action bill and ask how it would apply to a mass tort situation. \nMass torts are large-scale personal injury cases resulting from \naccidents, environmental disasters, or dangerous drugs that are widely \nsold. The asbestos exposure situation we will be considering this year \nis another example of a mass tort.\n  These personal injury claims are usually based on State laws, and \nalmost\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\nevery State has established rules of procedure allowing their State \ncourts to customize the needs of their litigants in these complex \ncases. I am afraid if S. 5 becomes law, the so-called mass action \nprovision will preempt all of these State procedures and take them out \nof State courts.\n  The supporters of the bill claim that mass actions are not the same \nas mass torts and that they have no desire to affect mass tort cases. I \nknow that is their position, but it is not what their bill says. If the \ngoal is to federalize all State personal injury cases, supporters \nshould be open about it and say it publicly.\n  I am sure the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Tort Reform \nAssociation, all the business and insurance groups that support this \nbill would like to see all cases sent to Federal court. I knew from my \nyears in practice in downstate Illinois, that Federal courts were more \nconservative than State courts.\n  But even these groups do not believe they can be that lucky with this \nbill. Instead, they came to us and said: No, our bill is very narrow, \nit only deals with class actions and not all cases. When I take a look \nat section 4, though, I am concerned about it. It sounds an awful lot \nlike mass torts. Here is how they describe it. Section 4(A) defines it:\n\n     . . . any civil action . . . in which monetary relief claims \n     of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on \n     the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common \n     questions of law or fact . . .\n\n  I am sure for anyone who has been patient enough to follow this \ndebate this is a little confusing, so let me try by an example to give \nan idea of what is at stake in changing this law.\n  Everybody in America knows that in late September 2004, Merck & Co., \na pharmaceutical giant, pulled its blockbuster pain medication Vioxx \noff the market. The largest prescription drug recall in history \noccurred as a result of a new study that showed that Vioxx doubled the \nrisk of heart attack and stroke in some patients. With annual sales of \n$2.5 billion, Vioxx was one of the most successful new drugs ever. It \nwas one of a new class of drugs called COX-2 inhibitors.\n  Some 20 million Americans took Vioxx in the 5\\1/2\\ years it was sold, \nbut we don't know how many thousands had heart attacks and strokes that \ncould have been attributed to this drug.\n  Since the discovery of the dangers of Vioxx, hundreds of cases from \nall over the country have been filed against Merck, and we can \nanticipate thousands more.\n  I would say as a former trial lawyer who served as both defense \ncounsel in some cases and plaintiff's counsel in others, this is a \npretty serious situation for Merck, and they know it. They have \nconceded the fact that the drug was dangerous. They took it off the \nmarket. Having taken it off the market, it is understandable that some \nwho were injured are going to seek just compensation.\n  Let us look at a few cases. Let us take the case of Janet Huggins, \nwhich is just one of hundreds of similar cases working their way \nthrough the court system today.\n  Mrs. Huggins of Tennessee was a 39-year-old woman who died of a \nsudden heart attack after taking Vioxx. She was the mother of a 9-year-\nold son. When she was diagnosed with the early onset of rheumatoid \narthritis, Vioxx was prescribed. She had no former cardiac problems or \nfamily history. According to her medical records, Mrs. Huggins was in, \notherwise, excellent health.\n  But on September 25, 2004, she died of a sudden heart attack--less \nthan a month after she started taking Vioxx. She was buried on the very \nday in September that Merck took Vioxx off the market.\n  On October 28, 2004, her husband Monty filed a claim against Merck in \nthe Superior Court of New Jersey, Atlantic City Division. Why New \nJersey? This couple is from Tennessee. Because that is the State where \nMerck is headquartered.\n  In an interview on ``60 Minutes,'' Mr. Huggins said: ``I believe my \nwife would be here'' if Merck had decided to take Vioxx off the market \njust 1 month earlier.\n  Then there was Richard ``Dickie'' Irvin of Florida, who was a 53-\nyear-old former football coach, and president of the athletic booster \nassociation.\n  He had received his college football scholarship and was inducted \ninto the school's football hall of fame. He went on to play in the \nCanadian League Football until suffering a career-ending injury.\n  In addition to coaching, he worked at a family-owned seafood shop \nwhere he was constantly moving crates of seafood. He rarely went to see \na doctor and had no major medical problems.\n  In April 2001, Mr. Irvin was prescribed Vioxx for his football knee \ninjury from years ago. Approximately 23 days after he began taking \nVioxx, Mr. Irvin died from a sudden, unexpected heart attack. An \nautopsy revealed that his heart attack was caused by a sudden blood \nclot. This is the exact type of injury that has been associated with \nVioxx use.\n  Mr. Irvin and his wife of 31 years had four children and three \ngrandchildren.\n  John Newton of Texas, father of two, took Vioxx for osteoarthritis. \nOn April 1, 2003, without warning, he began coughing violently and \nwithin minutes was coughing up blood. Before emergency medical services \ncould be called, he collapsed in the arms of his 17-year-old son and \ndied.\n  It was later determined that Mr. Newton died of a blood clot in his \nlung. He had no prior history of blood clots, or pulmonary disease. The \ncases go on and on in State after State.\n  Some of these cases such as the one brought by Mrs. Huggins' family \nhave already been filed against Merck. Others are in the works.\n  But if the victims of Vioxx file suit in New Jersey, because that is \nwhere Merck is headquartered, their cases are automatically sent to the \nState's special mass torts court.\n  New Jersey is one of those States where the legislature established \nspecialized courts to handle certain types of cases. The courts in New \nJersey have the authority to combine cases. They can consolidate cases. \nThat seems reasonable, when you consider all of the people who will be \nsuing Merck in New Jersey, where they are headquartered, from all over \nthe United States with similar situations as the ones I just described.\n\n  What is so outrageous about having a lot of State-based personal \ninjury claims filed separately which are then consolidated as the New \nJersey courts can do by their own motion?\n  But under the mass action language of S. 5, their case and all other \nsimilar Vioxx cases will be taken out of the New Jersey special court \nand removed to a Federal court to be treated like a class action.\n  Why? If you take a look at the language in S. 5, the fact pattern \nfits nicely under the definition of a ``mass action'' to remove the \ncase to Federal court, while at the same time none of the exemptions \napply to keep Vioxx cases in State court.\n  So understand, for those who are arguing that this law we are \nconsidering is simply a case of changing jurisdictions in courts and \nstopping righteous lawyers from filing class action lawsuits, that it \nis much more.\n  For Merck, this law is the answer to a prayer. They will take their \ncase out of the State court into a Federal court as a class action, \nwhich is less likely to certify the class even though the series of \nmass tort cases were not even filed as a class action.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment. My amendment would make two \nsmall, narrow, and common sense changes.\n  First, it would allow State courts to continue to consolidate these \nindividual personal injury cases on their own motion without losing \njurisdiction to a federal court under S. 5.\n  Second, it would also allow courts that consolidate cases not just \nfor pretrial but all the way through trial or settlement to retain \ntheir jurisdiction and not lose it to a Federal court.\n  My amendment provides parity in the litigation process because one of \nthe exceptions to the mass action definition in S. 5 already provides \nfor defendants to consolidate cases without losing jurisdiction to a \nFederal court. I think it is important for the court--in addition to \nthe defendant--to have this right as well.\n  I also think it is important for courts to be able to schedule their \nown calendar of cases without having to worry whether they would lose \njurisdiction over their consolidated cases at certain\n\n[[Page S1101]]\n\nphases of litigation. They should not be limited ``solely'' to the \npretrial proceedings.\n  These two small changes will ensure that mass tort cases involving \npersonal injury claims that are not intended to be affected by S. 5 can \ncontinue to remain in State courts throughout the duration of the \nproceeding. The supporters of this bill claim that is their intent, and \nI want to make sure the language in S. 5 reflects this purpose.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 3\n\n  (Purpose: To preserve State court procedures for handling mass \nactions)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 20, before the semicolon at the end of line 23, \n     insert ``or by the court sua sponte''.\n       On page 21, line 5, strike ``solely''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n44 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate is debating a \nclass action lawsuit bill. This afternoon in Detroit, President Bush \nsaid:\n\n       Congress needs to pass meaningful class action and asbestos \n     legal reform this year.\n\n  My response is, before we pass something, we better understand how it \nwill affect the rights and the lives of everyday, average Americans.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before the Senate will unfairly tip the \nscales of justice against average citizens. It will give big businesses \neven more power to avoid responsibility for their actions and it will \ndelay justice for many victims who deserve justice.\n  We do not have to look very far to see why average citizens need \naccess to courts. Look at this morning's newspaper from Seattle, WA. It \nreports that the Federal Government indicted the W.R. Grace Company for \nknowingly sickening workers and residents of Libby, MT, where hundreds \nof people have died from asbestos exposure. The indictment charges that \nthe company officials knew of the dangers to workers in the community \nand created a conspiracy to hide those dangers.\n  I hope these indictments will bring a small measure of justice to the \nthousands of people who have suffered in Libby and around the country. \nThese people worked hard. They provided for their families. But the \ncompany they worked for knowingly poisoned them and then covered it up.\n  The Federal Government is finally going after the company and the \nexecutives who made the decisions that put workers and the entire \ncommunity at risk.\n  Here is the story from today's Seattle P-I:\n\n       Grace indicted in asbestos deaths. Mine Company and seven \n     executives face criminal charges.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be \nprinted in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the story of what happened in Libby, MT, \nis heartbreaking.\n  Years ago, when I first heard what happened there, I began a campaign \nto ban asbestos and to protect its victims. In June of 2002, I \ntestified at a hearing about Libby before the Senate Subcommittee on \nSuperfund, Toxics, Risk, and Waste Management. The people of Libby, MT, \nhave been waiting for this day for a very long time.\n  This indictment tells companies that they are responsible for their \ndecisions and that human lives are more important than profits. The \nindictment sends a message that if you are putting workers and \nconsumers at risk, if you try to hide the dangers, you will be \nprosecuted because at the end of the day, this is not about profits, it \nis about people.\n  It is about people such as Gayla Benefield, whom I met last summer. \nGayla's father worked at W.R. Grace's vermiculite mine and mill in \nLibby, MT, from 1954 to 1973. Her father died of asbestosis in 1974. \nGayla's mother never worked in that mine, but she was exposed to \nasbestos fibers on her husband's work clothes. Gayla's mother died of \nasbestosis in 1996. Gayla herself was exposed to asbestos fibers. Why? \nBecause she hugged her dad when he came home from work. And then, in \nDecember of 2001, Gayla and her husband David both were diagnosed with \nlung abnormalities.\n  In all, about 37 people in Gayla's family have signs of asbestos \ndisease, and only three ever worked in that mine.\n  Now, as my colleagues know, for the past 4 years, I have been \nspeaking about the dangers of asbestos and the need to ban it in this \ncountry. I have stood up for victims and their families. I have \nintroduced legislation to protect workers, educate the public, and \nimprove research and treatment.\n  Last year, when Congress considered an inadequate trust fund bill, I \nstood up for the asbestos victims and voted against it. We still have a \nlot of work to do to take care of the current victims and to prevent \nfuture deaths. That is one of the reasons I am so personally concerned \nabout the class action bill that is now before the Senate.\n  The bill allows companies to move class action lawsuits from State \njurisdiction to Federal jurisdiction. That could delay justice for \nyears. In many cases, victims have already been waiting a long time for \ntheir day in court. If their cases are moved to Federal court, they \nwill essentially have to start all over at the bottom of the pile. That \nis because Federal courts already have a massive backlog of cases. It \nis one of the reasons the Federal bench opposes this bill.\n\n  If class action lawsuits are dumped on to our Federal courts, they \nwill fall to the bottom of the list of priorities. Even if they work \ntheir way up to the top of the docket after many years, they will not \nbe resolved quickly because they are such complicated cases.\n  The bill that is before the Senate now could add years to the amount \nof time it takes to resolve a case. Unfortunately, asbestos victims do \nnot have time on their side. Once a person is diagnosed with \nmesothelioma, they usually have only about 6 to 18 months to live. So \nif companies know, they can just play legal games, they can just wait \nit out, just move the case and hold things up until the victim dies. If \nthat happens, there is no justice.\n  For someone with the death sentence of an asbestos disease, justice \ndelayed is justice denied. That is why Congress should reject this \nclass action bill.\n  There are other ways this bill could deny justice. Companies could \njust wait until a victim's medical bills or lost wages are so high that \nthe victim is forced into an unfair settlement. Once again, that is \nbecause this bill tips the scales of justice against average Americans.\n  I have focused on asbestos victims, but this class action bill would \naffect many more types of victims. Anyone with a class action lawsuit \ncould find themselves pushed into Federal court at the bottom of the \nlist. Congress should not delay and deny justice for victims.\n  As for asbestos victims, we still have a lot of work to do. Each year \nin this country 10,000 Americans die from asbestos disease--10,000 \nAmericans. The first thing we need to do is ban the production and \nimportation of asbestos in the United States. Do you know that each \nyear in this country we put asbestos into 3,000 consumer products, \nproducts that you buy at the store regularly? Hair dryers, floor tile, \nand automobile brakes--we put asbestos in them in this country today. \nIf we know this is deadly, we should stop putting it in consumer \nproducts in America.\n  Again, later this year, I am going to reintroduce my Ban Asbestos in \nAmerica Act. The first year I introduced it, we only had four \ncosponsors. Last session, we had 14. We also made progress, including \nmy ban in the asbestos liability legislation that was considered by the \nJudiciary Committee. My ban is also included in Senator Specter's most \nrecent version of that bill.\n  But we also need to help victims by investing in mesothelioma \nresearch\n\n[[Page S1102]]\n\nand treatment. And we need to boost awareness of how consumers--that is \nall of us--and workers can protect themselves.\n  Today, up to 35 million homes, businesses, and schools have the \ndeadly Zonolite insulation in their attics. People need to know about \nthe danger so they can protect themselves, so they do not go up in \ntheir attic and do their work unknowingly exposing themselves to \nasbestos.\n  Many employees are still in danger--from construction workers to auto \nmechanics. And let's not forget that many asbestos victims were exposed \nto asbestos when they served our country in the military. About 32 \npercent of asbestos victims happen to be Navy veterans. Many of them \nworked in the Bremerton Shipyard in my home State of Washington.\n  The dangers of asbestos are not just limited to Libby, MT, or to \nmilitary communities; they are everywhere. This Congress needs to \naddress them the right way. Congress should make sure asbestos victims \ncan get the justice they deserve. That is why I will vote against this \nclass action bill. And that is why I am going to continue to fight to \nban asbestos and to help the victims in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Feb. 8, 2005]\n\n              W.R. Grace Indicted in Libby Asbestos Deaths\n\n\n        Mine company and seven executives face criminal charges\n\n                         (By Andrew Schneider)\n\n       Missoula, Mont.--W.R. Grace & Co. and seven of its current \n     or former executives have been indicted on federal charges \n     that they knowingly put their workers and the public in \n     danger through exposure to vermiculite ore contaminated with \n     asbestos from the company's mine in from Libby, Mont.\n       Hundreds of miners, their family members and townsfolk have \n     died and at least 1,200 have been sickened from exposure to \n     the asbestos-containing ore. The health effects also threaten \n     workers, their families and residents everywhere the ore was \n     shipped, including Seattle, and people living in millions of \n     homes nationwide where it was used as insulation.\n       Yesterday, on the steps of the county courthouse here, U.S. \n     Attorney Bill Mercer announced the 10-count indictment, \n     alleging conspiracy, knowing endangerment, obstruction of \n     justice and wire fraud.\n       ``A human and environmental tragedy has occurred,'' he \n     said. ``This prosecution seeks to hold Grace and its \n     executives responsible.''\n       ``This is one of the most significant criminal indictments \n     for environmental crime in our history,'' said Lori Hanson, \n     special agent in charge of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency's environmental crime section in Denver.\n       In a statement released for Grace by a public-relations \n     firm, the company ``categorically denies any criminal \n     wrongdoing.''\n       Grace criticized the government for releasing the \n     indictment before providing a copy to the company. ``We are \n     surprised by the government's methods and disappointed by its \n     determination to bring these allegations. .  .  . We look \n     forward to setting the record straight.''\n       Federal environmental officials began examining the hazards \n     in Libby after Nov. 19, 1999, when the Seattle Post-\n     Intelligencer began publishing a series of stories about what \n     the government has called ``the nation's biggest \n     environmental disaster.'' Within three days of the P-I's \n     first report, an EPA emergency team arrived in the tiny \n     northwestern Montana town.\n       Present at the announcement yesterday were Libby victims \n     Lester and Norita Skramstad and Gayla Benefield.\n       Lester Skramstad has asbestosis, as does his wife, Norita, \n     and two of their children. He spoke softly but forcefully, \n     struggling for breath to launch his words into the wind on a \n     blustery winter afternoon. ``I've waited a long time for \n     this,'' he said. ``It's a great day to be alive.''\n       If found guilty, the individual defendants face from five \n     to 15 years in prison on each count, which for some of the \n     executives could be as much as 70 years.\n       Grace could be fined up to twice the profits from its \n     alleged criminal acts or twice the losses suffered by \n     victims. According to the indictments, Grace made more than \n     $140 million in after-tax profits from the Libby mine, which \n     would mean a fine of up to $280 million. Alternatively, the \n     court could fine the company twice what it computes the loss \n     to be from more than a thousand Libby victims. In addition, \n     the court could order restitution for the victims.\n       ``This criminal indictment is intended to send a clear \n     message: We will pursue corporations and senior managers who \n     knowingly disregard environmental laws and jeopardize the \n     health and welfare of workers and the public,'' said Thomas \n     Skinner, EPA's acting assistant administrator for \n     enforcement, yesterday.\n       The executives charged are Alan Stringer, formerly general \n     manager of the Libby mine and Grace's representative during \n     the government's Superfund cleanup; Henry Eschenbach, \n     formerly director of health, safety and toxicology in Grace's \n     industrial chemical group; Jack Wolter, formerly Grace vice \n     president and general manager of its construction products \n     division; Bill McCaig, also formerly general manager of the \n     mine; Robert Bettacchi, formerly president of the \n     construction products division and senior vice president of \n     Grace; O. Mario Favorito, former Grace general counsel; and \n     Robert Walsh, formerly a Grace senior vice president.\n       The 49-page indictment accuses Grace of knowingly releasing \n     asbestos into the air, placing miners, their families and \n     townspeople at risk, and of defrauding the government by \n     obstructing the efforts of various agencies including the \n     EPA, increasing profits and avoiding liability for damages by \n     doing so.\n\n\n                          P-I's Investigation\n\n       Tens of thousands of pages of internal Grace documents and \n     court papers were the basis of scores of stories in the P-1 \n     on Libby and the deadly ore that Grace shipped throughout the \n     world. Those documents show years of extensive communication \n     among Grace's top health, marketing and legal managers and \n     mine officials in Libby about concealing the danger of \n     asbestos in the ore and consumer products that were made from \n     it.\n       They discussed methods to keep federal investigators from \n     studying the health of the miners, the potential harm to \n     Grace sales if asbestos warnings were posted on its products, \n     and the effort to mask the hazard of working with the \n     contaminated ore.\n       ``The prosecution cannot eliminate the death and disease in \n     Libby,'' said John Heberling, a lawyer with McGarvey, \n     Heberling, Sullivan and McGarvey. ``But there is comfort in \n     the hope that criminal convictions will say to corporate \n     America . . . managers will be held criminally accountable if \n     they lie and deny and watch workers die.''\n       For years, the Kalispell, Mont., firm has been fighting for \n     damages from Grace on behalf of the families of the dead and \n     the dying from Libby.\n\n\n                         Mine's huge production\n\n       Opened in 1913, the mine is six miles from Libby. Grace \n     bought it in 1963 and closed it in 1990. In its heyday, the \n     mine produced 80 percent of the world's vermiculite. The \n     company still operates smaller vermiculite mines in South \n     Carolina.\n       Vermiculite, a mineral similar to mica, expands when heated \n     into featherweight pieces that have been used commercially \n     for decades in attic and wall insulation, wallboard, \n     fireproofing, and plant nursery and forestry products. It was \n     also used in scores of consumer products, such as lawn and \n     garden supplies and cat litter.\n       Exposure to the tremolite asbestos fibers, which \n     contaminate the vermiculite ore, has caused hundreds of cases \n     of asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma in Libby and an \n     untold number at hundreds of other sites across North America \n     where the ore was processed.\n       Criminal investigators and lawyers from the EPA, the \n     Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Attorney's offices in \n     Montana often put in 12- to 15-hour days while preparing the \n     case.\n       Investigators and lawyers from the Justice Department and \n     the EPA's headquarters also assisted. The haste was required \n     because prosecutors were up against a five-year statute of \n     limitation, based on the arrival of the first federal team in \n     Libby after the P-1 stories. They gained a three-month \n     extension of that limitation.\n\n\n                            A troubled past\n\n       The EPA said that over the years it had filed several \n     complaints against Grace over the company's environmental \n     practices. The only previous criminal charge against the \n     Columbia, Md.-based corporation was in the mid-'80s. Grace \n     was indicted on two counts of lying to the agency about the \n     quantity of hazardous material used in its packaging plant in \n     Woburn, Mass. In 1988, the company pleaded guilty to one \n     count and was fined $10,000, the maximum at that time. The \n     charges were brought after Grace and another company were \n     sued after being accused of illegally dumping toxic \n     chemicals, contaminating two wells and, some believe, \n     resulting in the deaths of five children from leukemia. Grace \n     paid the families $8 million to settle the suits. The book \n     and movie ``A Civil Action'' were based on the Woburn case.\n       Grace, which produces construction materials, building \n     materials and packaging, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy \n     protection in 2001 because of the ``sharply increasing number \n     of asbestos claims,'' Paul Norris, Grace's chairman and CEO, \n     said at the time.\n       May 2002, the Justice Department intervened in Grace's \n     bankruptcy, the first time it had entered such a case, \n     alleging that before Grace filed for Chapter 11, it concealed \n     money in new companies it bought. Justice Department lawyers \n     said Grace's action was a ``fraudulent transfer'' of money to \n     protect itself from civil suits.\n       In November of that year, just before the trial was to \n     begin, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the \n     companies returned almost $1 billion to the bankruptcy judges \n     holding Grace's assets. Grace is far from out of business. \n     Norris said the company has annual sales of about $2 billion, \n     more than 6,000\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\n     employees and operations in nearly 40 countries.\n       Mercer refused comment on whether there would be more \n     indictments from other locations where Grace had operations. \n     Hanson said she had been discussing the investigation with \n     her counterparts in EPA regions throughout the country.\n       Libby victim Benefield said yesterday that as she watched \n     the announcement of the indictments, her thoughts were with \n     her parents, Perley and Margaret Vatland, both of whom died \n     of asbestosis. She wore on her coat a costume-jewelry pin her \n     mother, who sold Avon products, bought from Avon for herself.\n       ``Somewhere today they're smiling,'' she said, fingering \n     the pin. ``I just know it.''\n\n\n                                 online\n\n       Read Uncivil Action, the P-O's award-winning coverage of \n     the deadly legacy of asbestos mining, beginning with a \n     November 1999 story about hundreds dead or dying in Libby, \n     Mont.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are in our second day of debate on \nthe important Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. Because of my \nresponsibilities as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I have \nnot had a chance to participate in the debate of a bill that I have \nbeen the sponsor of going back to the 105th Congress. It is a pleasure \nfor me to participate and anticipate the passage of this legislation.\n  It is about time that the Senate gets this bill done and gets it to \nthe President. Of course, I am very pleased that Majority Leader Frist \nsees this as an important enough issue to move so early in the 109th \nCongress. I also thank Chairman Specter, as new chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, for getting this class action bill through \ncommittee so very quickly. I hope we can move expeditiously with few or \nno amendments, pass this bill, and have the President sign it, which we \nare sure he will.\n  My colleagues will recall that in the 108th Congress, Senator Frist \nbrought the class action fairness bill to the floor in October 2003, \nbut we were not able to proceed to the bill. We lost the vote on \ncloture on the motion to proceed by just a one-vote margin; in other \nwords, 50 votes as opposed to the 60-vote supermajority that cloture \ntakes.\n  After that vote, I worked with Senator Hatch, who was then chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, and our lead Democratic cosponsors, \nSenators Kohl and Carper, to modify the bill to address concerns that \nwere raised by three Senators and maybe others, but I remember \nspecifically Senators Dodd, Landrieu, and Schumer. Then we reintroduced \nthe Class Action Fairness Act in February 2004 as a new bill with a new \nnumber, S. 2062. It contained the compromise language that we worked \nout with Senators Dodd, Landrieu, and Schumer. Senator Frist then \nattempted to bring up the bill last July. Unfortunately, we were once \nagain denied the ability to close debate on the bill, and we lost, \nagain, a cloture vote. This was because Senators wanted to offer \nnongermane amendments--amendments, as you know, Mr. President, that \nhave absolutely nothing to do with the subject matter of the underlying \nbill. This was particularly disappointing to me after all of the hard \nwork we had done to reach an acceptable compromise with several \nDemocrats. We could have passed the bill in the 108th Congress, but raw \npolitics got in the way.\n\n  Now is the time to get this bill done. We have reintroduced the \nlanguage contained in last year's bill, a compromise worked out with \nSenators Dodd, Landrieu, and Schumer. That is what is now before us in \nS. 5, the very same bill. We made no changes to last year's bipartisan \ncompromise. So I hope we can stop having politics interfere with this \nbill and pass what is a relatively modest bill that will help reform a \nclass action regime that has gotten to be very bad, which ends up most \nof the time serving no one except the lawyers who bring these class \naction suits.\n  I would like to give some background on the need for this very \nimportant legislation. Everyone has heard about the abuses going on \nwith the current class action system. These problems undermine the \nrights of both plaintiffs and defendants. Class members often do not \nunderstand what their rights are in a class action suit, while the \nclass action lawyers drive the lawsuits and the settlements. Class \nmembers cannot understand what the court and the settlement notices say \nbecause they are in very small type and written in hard-to-understand \nlegalese. So class members often do not understand their rights and \nthey don't understand the consequences of their actions with respect to \nthe class action lawsuit in which they are invited to participate.\n  Moreover, many class action settlements only benefit the lawyers, \nwith little or nothing going to the class members. We are all familiar \nwith the class action settlements where the plaintiffs got coupons of \nlittle value, or maybe no value, and the lawyers got all of the money \navailable in the settlement agreement. So what is the point of bringing \na lawsuit? I thought it was to find redress for the plaintiffs and not \nto benefit the lawyers who bring the case. But that is what happens \nmany times now in these class action lawsuits. The lawyers drive those \ncases, not the individuals who allegedly have been injured. The lawyers \nare the ones who get the millions and millions of dollars in fees while \nthe people who allegedly have been injured get worthless coupons.\n  In addition, the current class action rules are such that the \nmajority of large nationwide class actions are allowed to proceed to \nState court when they are clearly the kinds of cases that should be \ndecided in Federal Court. The U.S. Constitution provides that cases \ninvolving citizens of two different States and an amount of controversy \nof $75,000 can be heard in Federal Court. However, the law has been \ninterpreted in such a way that class action lawsuits; that is, cases \ninvolving large sums of money, citizens of many different States, and \nissues of national concern, have been restricted to State courts even \nthough they have national consequences. Crafty lawyers game the system. \nCrafty lawyers file these large class actions in certain courts. They \nare shopping for magnet State courts, and they are able to keep them \nthere.\n\n  For example, in Madison County, IL, the most notorious class action \nmagnet State court, which has been called a ``judicial hellhole,'' \nclass action filings have jumped from 77 in 2002 to 106 in 2003. I \nunderstand that Madison County has had an increase of over 5,000 \npercent in the number of class action filings since 1998. That surely \nsays something. Clearly, the judges there are playing somewhat fast and \nloose with the class action rules when they are deciding whether to \ncertify a class action lawsuit. So unscrupulous lawyers are gaming the \npresent rules to steer their class action cases to these certain \npreferred State courts, such as Madison County, IL, where judges are \nquick to certify classes, quick to approve settlements, with little \nregard to the class members' interests or the parties' due process \nrights. Of course, that is the reason for this legislation. We need to \ndo something about this kind of abuse of the judicial process.\n  Class action lawsuits at least should have the opportunity to be \nheard in Federal court because usually they are the cases that involve \nthe most amount of money, citizens from all across the country, and \nissues of nationwide concern. Why should a State county court be \ndeciding these kinds of class action cases that impact people all \nacross the country? Of course, that just doesn't make sense to me; \nhence, the authorship of this legislation. I hope it doesn't make sense \nto at least a majority of my colleagues.\n  Both the House and Senate held numerous hearings on this legislation \nand on other kinds of class action abuse. We heard about class lawyers \nmanipulating case pleadings to avoid removal of a class action lawsuit \nto Federal court, where it should be, claiming that their clients \nsuffered under $75,000 in damages in order to avoid the Federal \njurisdictional amount threshold.\n  We heard about class lawyers crafting lawsuits in such a way to \ndefeat the complete diversity requirement by ensuring that at least one \nnamed class member was from the same State as one of the defendants \neven if every other class member was from one of the other 49 States.\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\n  We heard about attorneys who filed the same class action lawsuit in \ndozens of State courts all across the country in a race to see which \njudge would certify the fastest and the broadest of class.\n  We heard about class action lawyers entering into collusive \nsettlements with defendant attorneys which were not in the best \ninterest of class members.\n  These are only a few of the gamesmanship tactics lawyers like to \nutilize to bring down the entire class action legal system. The bottom \nline is that many of these class actions are just plain frivolous \nlawsuits that are cooked up by the lawyers to make a quick buck, with \nlittle or no benefit to the class members who the lawyers are supposed \nto be representing.\n  Out-of-control frivolous filings are a real drag on the economy. Many \na good business is being hurt by this frivolous litigation cost. \nUnfortunately, the current class action rules are contributing to the \ncost of business all across America, and it particularly hits small \nbusiness because it is the small business that gets caught up in the \nclass action web without the resources to fight.\n  Too many frivolous lawsuits are being filed. Too many good companies \nand consumers are having to pay for this lawyer greed. Make no mistake \nabout it, there is a real impact on the bottom line for many of these \ncompanies and, to some extent, on the economy as a whole. They have to \neat this increased litigation cost or else it is farmed out to \nconsumers, such as you and me, and this is all in the form of higher \nprices for goods and services we buy.\n  This is unacceptable, and we need to do something about this. We need \nto restore some commonsense reform to our legal system. We need to \nrestore common sense to the class action system. We should pass this \nbill.\n  I now wish to say something about class action lawsuits. They can be \na very good tool for many plaintiffs with the same claims to band \ntogether to seek redress from a company that has wronged them. I am not \nagainst the use of class action lawsuits, and neither are other \nsupporters of this bill. We are not here to put a stop to the class \naction tool.\n  I certainly know my friend and original cosponsor of this bill, \nSenator Kohl, feels the same as I do. People who have been injured \nshould be able to sue companies that do not follow the law. Our problem \nis many class actions are not proceeding in the way they were \noriginally intended.\n  Our problem is many of these lawsuits are not fair and violate the \ndue process rights of both plaintiffs as well as defendants.\n  Our problem is many times these lawsuits are not helping the class \nmembers at all. They are an effective tool for lawyers to make a big, \neasy buck.\n  Our problem is these kinds of suits should have an opportunity to be \nheard in Federal court, not stuck in a magnet court in a county that \nhas no connection whatsoever to the case. That is why Senator Kohl and \nI joined forces several Congresses ago--this is the fifth Congress this \nbill has been around for us to try to do something about this \nsituation. That is a period of 8 years past and 10 years including this \nCongress--to do something about the problems we were seeing and about \nthe runaway abuses.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act will address some of the more egregious \nproblems with the class action system while preserving class action \nlawsuits as a very important tool which brings representation to the \nunrepresented.\n  Let me underscore for my colleagues that S. 5 is a very delicate \ncompromise. As my colleagues already know, this bill has gone through \nmany changes to accommodate Democratic Senators, much to the \nfrustration of some of my Republican colleagues who think we have gone \ntoo far.\n  I worked in good faith with these colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to bring people together and to address valid concerns to \nincrease support for this bill, most importantly to, hopefully, have 60 \nvotes on board, the supermajority it takes to bring a halt to debate, \nto get to finality, to get this bill passed, to get it to the House \nwhere we are told it will pass if we do not change it, and go to the \nPresident very quickly.\n  I did not think then that we needed to make any changes to the class \naction bill that was originally introduced several Congresses ago, but \nas compromise is often necessary in this process if I wanted to move \nthe class action bill forward, I did my best to listen to the issues \nraised and to make modifications to the bill where there was room for \nthat compromise.\n\n  Nevertheless, with all the compromises we cut, S. 5 still retains the \ngoal we set out to achieve: to fix some of the most egregious problems \nwe are seeing in the class action system and to provide a more \nlegitimate forum for nationwide class action lawsuits.\n  The deal that was struck is a very carefully crafted compromise that \ndoes not need to be modified any further. So I am asking my colleagues \nto withhold the offering of amendments to avoid disrupting the balance \nwe have achieved.\n  My colleagues should not be fooled. The amendments that are going to \nbe offered are an attempt to weaken or gut the bill. Some amendments \nmay sound reasonable, but they pose a problem in the other body. Other \namendments may sound good, but they do not have anything to do with \nclass action reform. Other amendments are, plain and simple, poison \npills.\n  We have worked far too long and we have worked far too hard to have \nthis bill come down because folks are misled into supporting an \namendment that in reality perpetuates the problem and preserves the \nstatus quo.\n  We have worked far too long and too hard to have this bill delayed \nand complicated with amendments that the House will never accept.\n  We have also worked far too long and far too hard to have this bill \nbogged down by amendments that are not critical to the core purpose of \nthe legislation.\n  So then let's get this bill past the finish line, not create more \nhurdles and obstacles. I ask my colleagues to vote against the \namendments and keep the bill clean. How often do we in this body, the \nSenate of the United States, have the respect the House is giving us by \nsaying if this bill is not changed any more, they will buy it the way \nit is? That happens once in a decade. We ought to take advantage of it.\n  I would like to highlight, before I sit down, some of the changes we \nmade to the bill to increase support for this bill since Senator Kohl \nand I introduced the first Class Action Fairness Act in the 105th \nCongress, now 8 years ago.\n  The bill, as was originally introduced, did several things. It \nrequired that notice of proposed settlements in all class actions, as \nwell as all class notices, be in clear, easily understood English and \ninclude all material settlements, including amounts and sources of \nattorney's fees. Since plaintiffs give up their right to sue, they need \nto understand the ramifications of their actions and should not have to \nhire another attorney to find out what these notices mean.\n  Then our bill required that State attorneys general or other \nresponsible State government officials be notified of any proposed \nclass settlement that would affect the residents of their States. We \nincluded this provision to help protect class members because such \nnotice would provide State officials with an opportunity to object if \nthe settlement terms are unfair to their citizens.\n  Our bill also required that courts closely scrutinize class action \nsettlements where the plaintiffs only receive coupons or noncash awards \nwhile the lawyers get the bulk of the money.\n  It required the Judicial Conference to report back to the Congress on \nthe best practices in class action cases and how to best ensure \nfairness of these class action settlements.\n  Finally, the bill allowed more class action lawsuits to be removed \nfrom State court to Federal court. The bill eliminated the complete \ndiversity rule for class action cases but left in State courts those \nclass actions with fewer than 100 plaintiffs, class actions that \ninvolve less than $5 million, and class actions in which a State \ngovernment entity is the primary defendant.\n  Our bill still does many of these things, but we have made a number \nof modifications to get this bipartisan support.\n  In the Judiciary Committee in the 108th Congress, we incorporated \nSenator Feinstein's amendment which would leave in State court class \naction\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\ncases brought against a company in its home State where at least two-\nthirds or more of the class members are also residents of that State.\n  We also incorporated changes to address issues raised by Senator \nSpecter relative to how mass actions would be treated under this bill. \nIn our negotiations and outside the committee with Senators Schumer, \nDodd, and Landrieu, we made numerous changes, so I will only mention a \nfew of the more important compromises we reached.\n  For example, we made changes to the coupon settlement provisions in \nthe bill providing that attorney's fees must be based either on the \nvalue of the coupons actually redeemed by class members or the hours \nactually billed in prosecuting the case. We deleted for these Senators \nthe bounties provision because of a concern that it would harm civil \nrights plaintiffs.\n  We deleted provisions in the bill that dealt with specific notice \nrequirements because the Judicial Conference had already approved \nsimilar notice arrangements to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  To address questions about the merry-go-round issue, we eliminated a \nprovision dealing with the dismissal of cases that fail to meet rule 23 \nrequirements so that existing law applies.\n  We deleted a provision allowing plaintiff class action members to \nremove class actions to Federal court because of gaming concerns. We \nplaced reasonable time limits on the appellate review of remand orders \nin the bill. We clarified that citizenship of proposed class members is \nto be determined on the date the plaintiff filed the original complaint \nor when plaintiffs amend the complaint.\n  We made further modifications to the Feinstein compromise already \nreferred to and to the mass action language Senator Specter was \nconcerned about. We clarified that nothing in the bill restricts the \nauthority of the Judicial Conference to promulgate rules with respect \nto class actions.\n  Finally, we drafted a new what is called local class action \nexception, which would allow class members to remain in State court if, \none, more than two-thirds of the class members are citizens of this \nforum State; two, there is at least one in-State defendant from whom \nsignificant relief is sought by members of the class and whose conduct \nforms a significant basis for the plaintiffs' claims; three, the \nprincipal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or related \nconduct of each defendant were incurred in the State where the action \nwas originally filed; and, four and lastly, no other class action \nasserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the \ndefendants on behalf of the same or other persons has been filed during \nthe preceding 3 years.\n  We did all of this to ensure that truly local class action cases, \nsuch as a plant explosion or some other localized event, would be able \nto stay in State court. So we have made significant concessions to get \nour Democratic colleagues on board this Class Action Fairness Act. Of \ncourse, some of my Republican colleagues feel we have made too many \ncompromises. But these folks on the other side of the aisle have been \ntelling us that they are ready to support the bill and get it passed, \nso the time has come that hopefully no more politics are played, that \nwe get down to business and we get this bill done. It is time to make \nreal progress on a class of lawsuits that has become burdensome for \nbusiness, not beneficial to the plaintiffs, and enriching of attorneys.\n\n  If we do that--and we do that when we pass this bill--again I want to \nremind my colleagues that we have crafted a carefully balanced bill \nthat consists of a number of compromises and some would say too many \ncompromises. I think we have done a pretty good job of addressing \nlegitimate concerns with the bill and I am hopeful we will not see a \nlot of amendments to disrupt this compromise. I am hopeful my \ncolleagues will join me and vote against all killer amendments that gut \nor weaken the bill. I am hopeful my colleagues will join me and vote \nagainst poison-pill amendments that the House will never accept.\n  All of these amendments need to be defeated because we should send a \nclean bill to the House. All of our hard work on forging a bipartisan \ncompromise bill should not go down the drain.\n  The bottom line is this class action reform is badly needed. Both \nplaintiffs and defendants alike are calling for change. The Class \nAction Fairness Act will help curb the many problems that have plagued \nthe class action system. S. 5 will increase class members' protection \nand ensure the approval of fair settlements. It will allow nationwide \nclass actions to be heard in a proper forum, the Federal courts, but \nkeep primarily State class actions where they belong, in State court. \nIt will preserve the process but put a stop to the more egregious \nabuses. It will also put a stop to the frivolous lawsuits that are a \ndrag on the economy.\n  Now that we have worked together on a very delicate compromise, we \nshould be able to get this bipartisan bill done without changes.\n  I see another person who has worked very hard on this bill has come \nto the Chamber and that is Senator Carper of Delaware. There is no \nperson who has been more determined to get this bill passed and get it \npassed in a bipartisan way, and I appreciate very much the cooperation \nhe has given us over the last year but, more importantly, in a time \nwhen I have been involved with a lot of issues other than class action, \nhe has kept me focused on this bill that I want to get passed, and he \nhas helped me get the job done. I thank Senator Carper as well as other \nDemocrats who have helped in this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before Senator Grassley leaves the floor, \nI simply want to say how much I have enjoyed and appreciated the \nopportunity to work with him on this issue. If we go back 7 years when \nthis idea first took legislative form and look at the changes that have \noccurred over each of the last three or four Congresses, they have been \ndramatic.\n  My goal, and I believe it is a goal many of us share who support the \nlegislation, is to make sure that when what I term little people are \nharmed by the actions of big companies or small companies, those little \npeople have a chance to aggregate together and be made whole. I think \nwe agree on that principle.\n  We want to make sure the companies that do something that is wrong or \nthat are contemplating an action or behavior that is inappropriate or \nwrong, that they know if they get caught, they will pay a price, and \nclass actions can help catch them at that and make sure they are put on \nnotice. I think that is a principle on which we all agree.\n  A third principle is to make sure the defendant companies, if they \nare called on the carpet, can go to a court where they have a fair \nchance of defending themselves and presenting their case.\n  The last one is to try to do all of this in the context of not \nneedlessly overburdening the Federal judiciary.\n  It is tough to balance all of those different principles, but I think \non the legislation the Senator has authored and that some of us have \nbeen privileged to work with the Senator to help shape, we have come \nclose to realizing those principles.\n  I wanted to say a special thanks to the Senator for his willingness \nto work with people on both sides of the aisle, to hear us out, to hear \nour ideas, and be willing to accept a number of the ideas we have put \nforward. My hope is at the end of this week we will have passed that \nlegislation. It is a delicate compromise and balance and, God willing, \nour friends in the House of Representatives will accept that and the \nPresident will sign it into law.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my colleague from Delaware, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak for as much time as I consume in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\n                              The Tax Code\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, something is happening in our Tax Code \nthat very few people understand, and I wanted to call it to their \nattention.\n  There is something going on called repatriation, which is a $2 word \nthat probably people won't understand. But I want to explain it.\n  Repatriation is a process by which U.S. companies that have moved \nsome operations overseas, begun to manufacture and sell products \noverseas and made income overseas, are able to bring their profits back \ninto this country.\n  When an American corporation makes a profit as a result of selling \noverseas, or producing overseas--we have something in this country \ncalled deferral in our tax law. It says you can defer paying taxes on \nyour foreign profits as long as you don't bring them back into this \ncountry. But when you bring them back--which is called repatriation--\nthen you must pay taxes like everybody else does.\n  Let's take Huffy bicycle company, for example. The Huffy bicycle \ncompany made bicycles for almost 100 years in this country. They sold \nthem in Wal-Mart, Sears, and Kmart. Huffy then shut down their plants \nin the United States, and got rid of their workers. Today Huffy \nbicycles are still sold in the United States but they are made in China \nfor roughly 30 cents or 40 cents an hour labor by people who work 7 \ndays a week, 10 to 12 hours a day. The company decided they should \nactually manufacture their bicycles in China and presumably make more \nmoney.\n  What happens to that income? We have a perverse and insidious \nprovision in our tax law that says, shut your manufacturing plant, move \nthose jobs overseas, and we will give you a deal. You don't have to pay \ntaxes on the profits that you once made in the United States when you \nmade that bicycle or the Radio Flyer little red wagon, which is now \nmade in China, or the Newton cookies, but now earn on the same products \nmade overseas until you bring those profits back to the United States. \nOnly then do you have to pay taxes. That is the deal.\n\n  Whenever companies defer their tax obligation, they understand that \nwhen they repatriate the income to the U.S., they are going to have to \npay taxes. But they got a special deal, as is always the case, it \nseems.\n  Last year a bill was passed with a tiny, little provision which was \nvery controversial. I opposed the provision, but it got passed. The \nspecial deal is that the repatriation of income back into this country \nnow by companies that earned that income overseas--in some cases by \nmoving their American jobs overseas--now get to pay taxes at the 5\\1/4\\ \npercent tax rate.\n  What prompts me to come to the floor to talk about this, despite the \nfact I opposed this last year, was a New York Times article that says, \n``Hitting the Tax Break Jackpot.''\n  Let me quote a part of it.\n\n       When Congress passed a one-time tax break on foreign \n     profits last fall, lawmakers said their main purpose was to \n     encourage American companies to build new operations and hire \n     more workers here at home. But as corporations are gearing up \n     to bring tens of billions of dollars back to the United \n     States this year, adding jobs is far from their highest \n     priority. Indeed, some companies say they might end up \n     cutting their workforces here in the U.S.\n       Hewlett-Packard, which has accumulated $14 billion in \n     profits and lobbied intensely for the tax break, announced \n     January 10 that it would continue to reduce its workforce \n     this year. That would come on top of more than 25,000 jobs \n     eliminated during the previous 3 years.\n\n  We have a provision in tax law now that says to these companies that \nhave earned this money overseas, you deferred taxes on them previously, \nnow you are going to bring them back. We encouraged them to bring them \nback. And, by the way, while all the other American people are working \nand paying income taxes--and, yes, those at the bottom of the ladder \nwho pay income taxes pay the lowest rate of 10 percent but it is 10 \npercent, 15 percent, up to 35 percent, despite the fact everybody else \nis going to pay a higher rate of taxes--you repatriate those profits, \nand we will allow you to pay an income tax rate of 5\\1/4\\ percent.\n  There was a Governor of Texas named Ma Ferguson. Ma Ferguson became \nGovernor of Texas, I believe, when her husband died. As Governor of \nTexas, Ma Ferguson got involved in a very controversial issue dealing \nwith some sort of initiative in Texas about English only. She held a \npress conference. She held up a Bible. She said: If English is good \nenough for Jesus, it is good enough for Texas.\n  She didn't quite understand, I guess.\n  But the good enough concept is something we all talk about here. If \nthe 5\\1/4\\ percent income tax rate is good enough for the biggest \ncorporations in this country that have moved jobs overseas, and now \nbring profits back and get to pay 5\\1/4\\ percent, why is it not good \nenough for the Olsens, Johnsons, and the Larsens? Those are names from \nmy hometown. Why is it not good enough for the people living down the \nstreet, or up the block, or on the farm who may pay multiples of this \ntax rate?\n  Let me show a chart. These companies aren't doing anything wrong. \nThese companies are simply going to benefit handsomely from what this \nCongress did for them--to say to them: By the way, we will give you a \nvery special deal. This is Exxon Mobil, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Pepsi-\nCola, and so on--unpatriated foreign earnings totaling tens of billions \nof dollars. And they get to pay income taxes at 5\\1/4\\ percent. That \nsounds like a sales tax, doesn't it? That sounds like a sales tax and \nnot an income tax. But do average folks get to pay an income tax at \n5\\1/4\\? No. Nobody else does.\n  It kind of reminds me Tom Paxton's old song. He seemed to be able to \nsay it in kind of a simple way. He got all excited--this folksinger--\nwhen the Congress gave a big, old loan to Chrysler Corporation. So he \nwrote a song saying, ``I'm Changing My Name to Chrysler.''\n\n       Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight, and the dollar \n     is in sorry shape tonight, what a dollar used to get us now \n     won't get a head of lettuce. No the economic forecast isn't \n     bright.\n\n  He says:\n\n       I'm changing my name to Chrysler. I am going down to \n     Washington, DC, I will tell some power broker, ``What you did \n     for Iacocca would be perfectly acceptable to me.''\n\n  Maybe he would want to write a couple more verses. Maybe he would \nlike to pay income taxes at 5\\1/4\\ percent. Maybe every citizen of my \nhome State of North Dakota would like to be able to pay a 5\\1/4\\ \npercent income tax rate.\n  If it is good enough for Exxon Mobil, why isn't it good enough for my \ncitizens, or good enough for all the citizens of this country?\n  This was done last year with very little debate; just stuck in a big \nold bill and says it is going to create jobs. Let us give a special \ndeal to some big old economic interests. Nobody will care and nobody \nwill know.\n  Now we see the result--hitting the tax break jackpot. Those who are \ngoing to get the biggest benefits as a result of the generosity which I \nthink has probably not ever been given before. All of these companies \nexpected that the profits they earned overseas would be taxed at the \nregular tax rate when they brought the profits back. That is what they \nwere told. That is what the deal was. That is what the deferral was in \nthe Tax Code.\n  Guess what. They got a big old fat tax break unlike any that is given \nto any other American citizen. They get to pay 5.25 percent.\n\n  By the way, they boast that they would be creating jobs and that now \nappears not to be true. Some of the same companies that moved their \nAmerican jobs overseas to boost foreign profits now get a special deal \nback home to pay lower taxes than virtually any other American citizen.\n  Congress ought to hang its head and maybe Tom Paxton ought to write \nanother song: If it is good enough for Hewlett-Packard and good enough \nfor Exxon Mobil, it ought to be good enough for constituents who live \nup the block and down the street and on the farm in this country.\n  Enough about that. These things happen behind closed doors with \nlittle debate and great complexity and people do not understand. \nSomehow at the end of the day it is always kind of the cake and crumbs \napproach to public policy: The big interests get the cake; the little \nfolks get the crumbs and hope everyone is happy and nobody debates too \nmuch about it.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  There is a lot of this influence in the Social Security debate. I \nwill talk for a moment about that. I also will talk about the budget \nthat was offered yesterday. The Social Security debate is\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\nan example of this strange approach to public policy.\n  Social Security was created in 1935. The first monthly benefit was \npaid in 1940. Social Security has lifted tens of millions of senior \ncitizens out of poverty. Fifty percent of America's elderly were living \nin poverty when Social Security was enacted. Today it is less than 10 \npercent.\n  The fact is, Social Security works. It has been a Godsend for a lot \nof people who reach retirement age. Social Security is the one \ndependable source of income they know will be there. It is the social \ninsurance that they have paid for over all the years when they worked. \nSocial Security includes not only old-age retirement benefits but also \nprovides disability and survivor benefits. It is the one piece of that \nsocial insurance that workers knew would be there, and it has always \nbeen there.\n  Now, in 1983, a commission said, when the baby boomers retire, they \nwill hit the retirement rolls like a tidal wave.\n  After the Second World War, the soldiers came home. We have all seen \nthe pictures. We beat back the oppression of Hitler and Nazism. What a \nwonderful time. There was a great outpouring of romance and affection \nwhen the soldiers got home. We had the biggest baby crop in the history \nof the world. We had a lot of babies. Those GIs came home; they had \nfamilies; they raised families; they built schools; they created jobs; \nthey went to college on the GI bill. They built this country.\n  There comes a time, then, when the baby boomers will retire and we \nhave a strain on the Social Security system. So we decided to save for \nthat. This year, for example, we collected Social Security taxes from \nworker paychecks--$151 billion more than needed to pay out current \nSocial Security benefits. We are doing that every year. This will help \ngrow Social Security trust assets to over $5 trillion by 2018.\n  The President said the other night something that is not right or not \naccurate. He said, in the year 2018, the Social Security system will be \npaying out more than it takes in. That is just flat wrong. Our \ncolleague, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, once said everyone is entitled to \ntheir own opinion but not everyone is entitled to their own set of \nfacts.\n  In the year 2018, the Social Security system will be taking in taxes \nfrom paychecks as well as a substantial amount of interest that will \nexist on the Treasury bonds that have been accruing over these many \nyears in the Social Security trust. This interest, along with the tax \ncollected from paychecks, will far exceed that which is necessary to be \npaid out. It is the year 2042 or 2052, according to either the Social \nSecurity actuaries or the Congressional Budget Office, where we hit the \npoint we can no longer pay full benefits. It is not bankrupt at that \npoint, but unless we make some adjustment, we cannot pay full benefits.\n\n  The President's proposal for private accounts, however, anticipates a \nlevel of investment return on private accounts that, if realized, means \nthe economic growth in the country would put Social Security in a \nposition where it would not have a problem at all for the long term. \nWith that kind of economic growth as projected by the President, there \nwill be no problem in Social Security. It will meet its obligations \nover the long term.\n  But we have a circumstance now where the President and Administration \nofficial say Social Security is in crisis, it is bankrupt, it is flat \nbust, depending on whom you listen to. The purpose of using that \nlanguage is to convince people there is a very serious problem here. \nThere may need to be some adjustments because people are living longer, \nbetter, and healthier lives. But there is not a crisis that justifies \ntaking the Social Security system apart, which is what the President \nproposes to do.\n  He proposes several things, none of which he talks about but all of \nwhich are part of his plan: First, borrow a great deal of money, from \n$1 to $3 trillion. Second, change the indexing in Social Security and \ncut benefits. Under his plan, you are borrowing money, cutting \nbenefits, investing the borrowed money in the stock market, and hoping \nin the end it comes out all right.\n  All the indications I have seen, whether from the Congressional \nBudget Office or the Brookings Institution or others, say that workers \nwill come out further behind, not ahead, as a result of this plan.\n  The question, What should we do, is answered, we preserve, protect, \nand strengthen Social Security. This program works. It is probably true \nthat almost none of those who are proposing these changes--borrowing \nmoney and putting it in private accounts and taking the Social Security \nsystem apart--will ever have to worry about Social Security. Almost all \nof them will have sufficient assets to not be too worried about Social \nSecurity for themselves. But there are a lot of people in this country \nwho do worry about Social Security. It has always been there and can \nalways be there as part of the social insurance that represents the \nfoundation of retirement security.\n  Retirement security has two parts. One part is the guaranteed \ninsurance on which we pay premiums in the form of taxes every month \nfrom our paychecks. That is always there. The second part in retirement \nsecurity is private investments, 401(k)s, IRAs, and others. I support \nthat. I believe we ought to do even more to incentivize private \ninvestments. But we should do that without taking apart the Social \nSecurity Program.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Now, finally, I mention the budget. The budget offered yesterday is a \nbudget that has a great many controversial issues. All Members would \nagree we have the largest deficits in the history of this country. This \ncountry is way off track in fiscal policy. It needs to be put on track. \nIt is not just fiscal policy. Fiscal and trade policy, between them, \ncontributed somewhere between $1 to $1.2 trillion in debt just in the \nlast year. That is unsustainable. You cannot continue to do that.\n  The trade deficit we will know on Thursday of this week, but the \ntrade deficit is somewhere around $600 to $700 billion--just in the \npast year. The fiscal policy budget deficit is somewhere around $560 \nbillion. This country cannot continue it do this. It is off track.\n  We have to put it on track.\n  The budget that was offered yesterday claims that we will have a \nbudget deficit this year of roughly $427 billion. The fact is that \nfigure takes the Social Security tax money we are supposed to be \nputting into Social Security and uses it to make the deficit look \nsmaller. The real budget deficit for the current year is expected to be \nabout $587 billion, and although that is the real deficit, that does \nnot include the costs of Iraq, Afghanistan, and prosecuting the war \nbecause the President does not include that in the budget. Why? Because \nhe says we do not know what it will cost despite the fact we have known \nfor a long while it is costing at least $5 billion a month. He is now \nsaying, I want you to approve an extra $80 billion in emergency \nfunding. So we have roughly a $580 billion out-of-balance budget that \ndoes not even include the extra money that is necessary that the \nPresident knows he will ask Congress to spend on Iraq and Afghanistan \nand the military budget.\n  You could get a much better grip on what all this costs by taking a \nlook at the numbers in his proposed budget dealing with gross debt. He \nis proposing about a $677 billion increase in gross federal debt next \nyear versus this year. So that is the real measure of how much we are \nspending that we do not have--a $677 billion increase in gross debt.\n  Now, we know we have to tighten our belt. There are some things in \nthe budget I agree with, some I do not. I do not agree that, for \nexample, we ought to shut down Amtrak except for the east coast. That \nis what the President wants to do. I do not support that. I think rail \npassenger service strengthens this country and it is good for this \ncountry.\n  I do not agree that we should cut back on Indian tribal colleges. It \nis the one step up and out of poverty and toward hope and opportunity \nthat has been remarkably successful. I could go through a list of \nthings where I might disagree.\n  On the spending side, I do not agree with the President that we ought \nto begin building earth-penetrating, bunker-busting, designer nuclear \nweapons. What on Earth is that about? Spending money to build more \nnuclear weapons? Bunker busters? I do not understand that. Not only is \nit the wrong\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\nmessage for the world, it is spending money we do not have on things we \ndo not need.\n  Let me give you an example of a little program in this budget that we \nhave spent almost $200 million on over the years. It is Television \nMarti. It is this country deciding to send television signals to the \nCuban people to tell them how good things are outside of Cuba. Well, I \nvisited Cuba. The Cuban people know how good things are outside of \nCuba. That is why they try to escape Cuba.\n  It is interesting, we spend all this money on Television Marti to \nbroadcast into Cuba. We do it through Aerostat balloons, and now we do \nit with a sophisticated C-130 airplane, which is very expensive. And \nguess what. No Cubans see the television broadcasts. Oh, we broadcast. \nWe have expensive studios and expensive people, and we have balloons, \nand we have airplanes, and we broadcast these television signals to the \nCuban people. And the President wants to double the money for it, \ndespite the fact that all those signals are jammed and the people do \nnot see the broadcasts. I do not understand that.\n  What on Earth could they be thinking about? They are going to double \nfunding for the broadcasting signals into Cuba that are jammed and that \nthe Cuban people cannot see. In fact, one of the reasons he wants to \ndouble funding is he wants to buy another airplane for this program. So \nyou talk about waste, it is unbelievable.\n  I think the most important point to make about the budget, however, \nis it is time for Republicans and Democrats, for the President and the \nCongress, to level with the American people. We have a fiscal policy \nthat is reckless, is way out of control and is completely \nunsustainable. You cannot spend $677 billion that you do not have--not \nnext year, not last year, not the year after next. You cannot have a \ntrade deficit that is wildly out of balance. And you cannot have a Tax \nCode that incentivizes shutting down American factories and sending \nAmerican jobs overseas. You cannot keep doing these things.\n  There are some who take a look at this place, and they see a bunch of \nwindbags in blue suits, I suppose. They think we just talk, and \noccasionally, when the lights go out, we pass something like a 5.25 \npercent special tax break for the biggest economic interests.\n  The American people deserve for us to be serious about fiscal policy, \nabout trade policy and about tax policy, and for us to begin to put \ntogether a plan to put this country back on track. It is not all the \nfault of one side or the other. But if both sides do not pull in the \nright direction, this country cannot provide economic health and \nopportunity and growth in the future.\n\n  What is happening in this country no one on this floor recognizes \nbecause no one in the Senate has lost a job because of outsourcing; no \none here has lost a job because their plant was closed.\n  Let me again say, as I conclude, the people who worked for Huffy \nBicycles know what that is like. The people who worked for Schwinn \nBicycles know what that is like. The people who worked for Fig Newton \nknow what that is like. The people who worked for Levi Strauss know \nwhat that is like. The people who made T-shirts and shorts for Fruit of \nthe Loom know exactly what that is like. They all lost their jobs \nbecause they cannot compete with people who are willing to work for 30 \ncents an hour overseas. The employers have found a billion people on \nthis Earth who are willing to do it. And they will not only work for 30 \ncents an hour, you can put them in factories and dump sewage and dump \nchemicals into the air and water. You can work them 7 days a week, and \nif they decide to create a union, you can fire all of them, just like \nthat.\n  If this country does not get serious about stemming the outmigration \nof jobs and about stemming the hemorrhaging of red ink in international \ntrade in our trade deficit and dealing with our fiscal policy and \nbudget deficit, our economic future is not going to be a bright future.\n  We have far too much promise as a country to let this happen to us. \nWe need leadership, yes, from the White House, and from Congress, to \ndeal with serious things in a serious way. I hope that happens soon. I \nwant to be a part of a group that is bipartisan that says let's put \nthis country back on track. But I see precious little evidence of \nbipartisanship these days. The minute you stand and talk about the \nfacts, all of a sudden you are being excessively partisan, and the \nWhite House comes after you; to wit, the story yesterday about the RNC \nand what they have decided to do with respect to Senator Reid.\n  Well, there is a lot at stake in this Congress and this President \ngetting it right for a change: on budgets, on trade, on taxes. And I, \nfor one, hope we can begin a serious discussion about serious issues in \nthe days ahead and give people some hope that their future will be a \nbrighter and better future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Class Action \nFairness Act. It is the pending business before the body today. I want \nto spend a few minutes talking about this bill and talking about it in \nthe context of some of the issues that the prior speaker has spoken \nabout, the Senator from North Dakota, whom I have worked with on a \nnumber of issues over time. We agree on some issues; we disagree on \nsome. We hopefully are going to be able to work together on a number of \nthese issues.\n  I view this bill as a chance for us to grow the economy, as a chance \nfor us to do something to create jobs and opportunities. We may \ndisagree on what are the various issues and what we need to do to \ncreate those jobs, to address issues for people who have lost work in a \ncertain area, and to create them in another area. But what we are \ndealing with in this class action reform bill, this Class Action \nFairness Act--I serve on the Judiciary Committee; we passed this bill \nout on a bipartisan vote in the Judiciary Committee--is to try to deal \nwith the legal system that is putting too much burden on business so \nthat it cannot create jobs here, and so then those jobs and economic \nopportunities go somewhere else.\n  It was a bipartisan vote coming through the Judiciary Committee. If \nyou look at the membership on that committee, you can see these are \ndedicated people from both sides of the aisle. But they look at this \nissue, and they say, here is a chance for us to reform a system, create \ngrowth and opportunity, create fairness within the country, within the \nsystem.\n  That is the overall way we ought to be going. That is what we ought \nto be doing. That is why this is one of the lead substantive bills \ncoming from the Senate right now. That is why we are hopeful of keeping \nit amendment free, so we can get it through the House, passed, and on \nto the President, so the American people can see some product, and they \ncan see us dealing with a problem that they believe is there: too much \nlitigation, litigation where it is not fair, litigation in ways that \ntend to help lawyers more than helping people--lawyers are people, but \ntending to help the lawyers who are bringing the case more than the \npeople who are supposed to be attracted and dealt with in the case and \nin the class.\n  The prior speaker spoke about a number of different problems we have. \nThe budget deficit, clearly that is an issue. Clearly that is a problem \nfor the country. Clearly, that is something the President puts down a \nmark to try to correct. I think the President is right on moving to cut \nthe deficit in half in 5 years. I think we need to go further and \nbalance in 7 years.\n  Now, you say, well, wait a minute, how are you going to do that? We \nhave done it before. We do it the same way the next time that we did it \nthe last time; that is, you get the economy growing and sustain that \ngrowth in the economy. It kicks off a lot of receipts that way. Right \nnow the economy is growing. It has started to move again. We have had \nsome lethargic times, but it is growing, it is moving, it is creating \njobs, and that creates receipts at the Government level--Federal, \nState, and local. That is starting to happen.\n  The second piece of that equation is you have to restrain your growth \nof Federal spending. As your receipts go up, you cannot spend it at the \nsame rate. You have to spend it at a slower rate. That is what the \nPresident is trying to do with this budget. He is saying, OK, if we can \nget this type of growth, we will have a slower rate of\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\ngrowth in the spending areas. You have to spend it in more prioritized \nareas.\n  Clearly, the war on terrorism, homeland defense, key areas, and \nseveral others the President has identified, that is how we are going \nto get at the deficit. I don't agree with the whole budget document put \nforward. I do agree with the structure of the plan, that we get the \ndeficit cut in half in five and, as I say, I believe we need to get it \nbalanced in seven, so we can hand it over to the next generation in a \nbalanced situation.\n  One plug I want to put in is, a number of us put forward a bill \npreviously to create an overall commission within the Federal \nGovernment to identify programs that maybe have accomplished their \npurposes and we need to go on and do something differently and zero out \nprograms and to identify those that have accomplished their mission or \nare wasteful Government spending and propose to the Congress to zero \nthem out, and then the commission give the Congress one vote on a whole \npackage of bills. Maybe it is 53 total programs that need to be, maybe \nit is 253 that need to be eliminated. Give the Congress one vote to \neliminate all of them, keep them all, unamendable, and by that means \nthen us starting to cut at some of the wasteful spending, which we do, \nwhich takes place.\n  We used this sort of structured program to get at our military bases \nwhere we had too many bases around the country, and we used this to get \nfewer bases and to get those bases the needed resources to serve our \ntroops. I want to use the same model throughout the Federal Government. \nThat is the way we can get at the budget.\n  The previous speaker also spoke about Social Security. One of the \nproblems he identified and that has been spoken about is that we run a \nsurplus in Social Security and then that is spent in Government and \nthen you borrow against the Federal Government for that. One of the \nbeauties of creating personal accounts in Social Security is the \nGovernment can't spend that money. That is then the money of the \nindividual, and there is actually something there, instead of this \nGovernment borrowing on one hand off of the Social Security account and \non another hand. So that when we get to about 2013, we are no longer \nrunning a surplus in Social Security, we are running a deficit. And \nthen the Government has to borrow in other places to pay Social \nSecurity.\n  That is not a good situation. That is an untenable situation. That is \nnot the sort of country or structure we want to turn over to our kids. \nThat is why this need to look at personal accounts, so that the money \nis not spent, the money is safe. We get a higher rate of return. We get \na rate of return on these funds.\n  But our business at hand today is on the Class Action Fairness Act. \nThis bill needs to pass. I believe it will pass. I believe it will pass \nwith a substantial bipartisan vote. And the reason it will pass is we \nneed this to reform this portion of our legal system.\n  Class action lawsuits allow plaintiffs whose injuries might not be \nworth enough to justify bringing individual suits to combine their \nclaims into one lawsuit against a common defendant. That is the nature \nof a class action. It is to try to create a more efficient and \nequitable distribution. Class actions are a valuable part of the legal \nsystem. However, some trial lawyers have found a weakness in the \ncurrent system and developed a class action practice devoted to finding \nopportunities to, in some cases, extract payments from American \nbusinesses.\n\n  Currently in diversity cases, where plaintiffs reside in different \nStates, trial lawyers can forum shop. That means they can go to a place \nwhere they think they will get a better jury, they think they will get \nbetter treatment rather than fair treatment, or a setting where the \nparties actually reside. Once a class action is certified, they can \nforce businesses into paying expensive settlements, so it becomes an \nextractive process that way.\n  Due to this abuse in the system, injured plaintiffs are not getting \nthe recourse they are supposed to get through class actions. It is \ndocumented that the legal system returns less than 50 cents on the \ndollar to the people it is established to help and only 22 cents to \ncompensate for economic losses. Although injured plaintiffs are \nreceiving little of value in class action settlements, unfortunately, \nwe are seeing in too many cases trial lawyers obtaining large \nwindfalls.\n  I will give a couple of examples. One well-known example is the 2001 \ncase against Blockbuster. Customers alleged they were charged excessive \nlate fees for video rentals and received $1 coupons for the next trip \nto the video store, while their attorneys received over $9 million. \nThat is a lot of videos.\n  Similarly, in Shields v. Bridgestone/Firestone, a 2003 suit was filed \nfor customers who had Firestone tires that were among those the \nGovernment investigated or recalled but who did not suffer any personal \ninjury or property damage. After a Federal appeals court rejected class \ncertification, they rejected certifying that this was a class, both \nsides negotiated a settlement which has received preliminary approval \nof a Texas State court. Under the agreement, the company is to redesign \ncertain tires, a move already under way, irrespective of the lawsuit, \nand to develop a 3-year consumer education and awareness campaign. But \nthe members of the class, the actual members of the class, the \nplaintiffs, received nothing. However, if the court gives final \napproval, the lawyers will get $19 million.\n  Over the past decade, class action lawsuits have grown by over 1,000 \npercent nationwide, spurring a mass of these kinds of hasty, unjust \nsettlements. This is because even if the class certification ruling is \nunmerited or even unconstitutional, it often cannot be appealed until \nafter an expensive trial on the merits of the case. Facing the cost of \nlitigation often forces defendants to settle out of court with sizable \npayments, even when the defendant will likely prevail under the law. \nThese settlements have come to be known as a form of traditional \nblackmail and are problematic to all Americans because they make trial \nlawyers rich while imposing increased costs on the economy, causing \nlower wages and higher prices for consumers. They also create an \nenvironment of unpredictable litigation costs and serve to chill the \ninvestment, entrepreneurship, and the capital needed for job creation. \nIn short, class action abuse shortchanges true victims while severely \ndamaging the economic engines in this country.\n  That is not to say all class actions are wrong, and this bill doesn't \nimpact legitimate class actions. It basically deals with the issue of \nforum shopping. Class actions are still going to be brought. They still \nwill be brought. They still need to be brought in this country. But you \ntake away this issue, particularly this issue on forum shopping.\n  In response to the growing crisis in class actions, Senator Grassley \nhas authored the Class Action Fairness Act. It is a moderate, \nbipartisan approach that addresses the most serious of the class action \nabuses by allowing more large interstate class actions to be heard in \nFederal courts and by implementing a consumer class action bill of \nrights that protects consumers from some of the most egregious abuses \nin class action practice today.\n  The bill is the result of a bipartisan compromise reached with \nSenators Dodd, Landrieu, and Schumer in the last session of Congress \nthat narrowed the group of cases that would be removable to Federal \ncourt and added a Democratic provision put forward by the Democratic \nMembers to build attorney's fees in coupon settlement cases. It is \nimportant to remember that this bill is merely court procedure reform \nthat will go a long way to end abusive forum shopping.\n  S. 5 does not alter substantive law at all or otherwise affect any \ninjured individual's right to seek redress or to obtain damages. It \ndoes not limit damages, including punitive damages. It does not limit \nthose. It does not impose stricter pleading requirements. Rather, the \nFederal courts will continue to apply the appropriate State or States' \nlaws in adjudicating a class action suit.\n  Some of the critics of this legislation have stated that S. 5 will \nmove all class actions to the Federal courts, which will become \nclogged, resulting in a windfall for corporate defendants. The facts do \nnot support this allegation.\n  First, while S. 5 does expand Federal court jurisdiction over class \naction, the bill is drafted to ensure that truly local disputes will \ncontinue to be litigated in State court. Most notably, the bill will\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\nleave in State court class actions in which the plaintiffs and \ndefendants are all residents of the same State, class actions with \nfewer than 100 plaintiffs, class actions that involve less than $5 \nmillion, shareholder class actions alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, \nany class action in which a State government entity is a primary \ndefendant, and any class actions brought against a company in its home \nState in which two-thirds or more of the class members are also \nresidents of that State.\n  Secondly, the average State court judge is assigned three times as \nmany cases as his or her Federal counterparts. State court judges are \nassigned, on average, about 1,500 new cases each year. For example, in \nCalifornia, the average judge was assigned 1,501 cases in 2001. In \nFlorida, the average was 2,210. In New Jersey, the average was 2,620. \nIn Texas, it was a little over 1,600 cases. In contrast, each Federal \ncourt judge was assigned an average of 518 new cases during the 12-\nmonth period ending September 30, 2002.\n  The exponential growth of State court class action filings over the \nlast decade has added to the workload problem of State court judges \nwho, in many cases, unlike their Federal counterparts, do not have a \nnumber of law clerks, magistrate judges, or special masters to help \nwith particularly time-consuming tasks involving supervising complex \ncases. Since many State courts or tribunals of general jurisdiction \nhear all sorts of cases, from traffic violations, to divorces, to \nfelonies, judges who are distracted by class actions do not have enough \ntime to focus on providing basic legal services for the community that \nthey serve.\n  Finally, recent surveys have shown that the majority of class actions \nin many jurisdictions would remain in State court under this bill. As \nfar as those cases that could be heard in Federal court under S. 5, \nmany of them involve copycat class actions filed in different \njurisdictions, which Federal judges can consolidate under one judge. \nTherefore, moving more class actions to Federal court would actually \nreduce the burden for everyone.\n  Ultimately, this bill will allow claims with merit to go forward \nwhile preventing judicial blackmail. That has become, unfortunately, \nsomething involved in our judiciary today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote a clean class action bill out of the \nSenate, to vote against any amendments that would dilute the bill and \nstop us from moving this reform forward, and that would help in job \ncreation in the United States. This is a small measure. I think we \nshould do more, but it is an appropriate measure. It moves us in the \nright direction. It helps in the creation of jobs in the United States \nand in litigation reform, which we desperately need in this country.\n  These sort of bipartisan, modest steps, while they won't have perhaps \nas big a positive impact as we would like them to have, will have a \npositive impact on the judicial system and in helping us to reform \nthat. That is something we need to do. We need to move forward on the \nbudget deficit, we need to move forward to make sure we have a true \ntrust fund in Social Security, and we need to move forward in \nlitigation reform. All these are positive steps for our future. I hope \nwe can continue, as with this bill, to work it forward on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the recent historic \nelections in Iraq--elections that had been anticipated by an anxious \nglobal community for some time.\n  This election is the story of true patriots who knew the odds and \ndecided to beat them. This is the story of the millions of Iraqis who \ndefied the threats and the intimidation of `` terrorists to cast their \nvotes for a brighter future in Iraq.\n  News reports are flush with first-hand accounts from observers. The \nreports paint a picture of a people acting on their innate desire to be \nfree.\n  One such account details the determination of Samir Hassan, who at 32 \nlost his leg in a car bomb blast last October. Hassan said, ``I would \nhave crawled here if I had to. I don't want terrorists to kill other \nIraqis like they tried to kill me. Today I am voting for peace.''\n  The act of voting by ordinary Iraqis in the face of extreme danger \nconfirms President Bush's belief that people around the globe, when \ngiven a chance, will choose liberty and democracy over enslavement and \ntyranny. Human beings crave freedom at their core.\n  Early estimates by Iraq's Independent Electoral Commission show that \nabout 8 million of the nearly 14 million registered voters cast their \nballot on Sunday--a turnout almost equal to the number of Americans who \nvoted last November without the threat of snipers or suicide bombers.\n  In the words of Arkan Mahmoud Jawad, who came to vote with his mother \nand younger brother, ``This is the salvation for the Iraqis. I hate the \nterrorists, and now, I am fighting them by my vote.''\n  These are people who were beaten down by the brutal regime of Saddam \nHussein. That is exactly why they want to reclaim their country through \nthese elections. They know what the cost of failure would be.\n  And they know all too well that tyranny breeds isolation. Any dissent \nfrom Saddam Hussein's regime could result in torture or death. \nNeighbors couldn't trust neighbors. Families were torn apart. All this \nleaves scars on a nation that may take generations to heal.\n  I believe that voting is the first act of building a community as \nwell as building a country. With the election we saw a peaceful \nmajority reclaiming their birthright. We saw people gaining courage \nfrom realizing that they were not alone--that their friends and \nneighbors and relatives were going to vote--and that they could vote \ntoo. Together they are building their future.\n\n  Here is one description of how voting progressed:\n\n       The first Iraqis on the streets seemed tense as well, not \n     smiling and not waving back. But as the day unfolded, and \n     more and more voters took to the streets, a momentum seemed \n     to gather, and by mid-morning Karada's main street was jammed \n     with people who had voted and people on their way to vote. \n     Some Iraqis, walking out of the polling places, used their \n     cellphones to call friends and urge them to come. Some banged \n     on their neighbors' doors and dragged them out of bed. Old \n     men rolled up in wheelchairs. Women came in groups, lining up \n     in their long, black, head-to-toe abayas. The outpouring, \n     which filled Karada's streets with Shiites, Christians and \n     even some Sunnis, surprised the Iraqis themselves. When Ehab \n     Al Bahir, a captain in the Iraqi Army, arrived at Marjayoon \n     Primary School, he braced himself for insurgent attacks. The \n     mortar shells arrived, as he anticipated, but so did the \n     Iraqi voters, which he did not.\n\n  Voting was an act of defiance against the terrorists and an \naffirmation that Iraqis control their own destiny through self-\ngovernment. The people of Iraq realize that a stable, successful,\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\ndemocratic Iraq can only come about if average Iraqis are willing to \nsacrifice to build it.\n  On Sunday, they rose to the occasion. Some lost their lives, but \ntheir lives were not lost in vain. I am convinced that a country by the \nIraqi people and for the Iraqi people will be built on the foundation \nlaid down by the voters on Sunday. And having sacrificed to gain a \ndemocratic Iraq, they won't let it go easily.\n  Baghdad's mayor was overwhelmed by the turnout of voters at city hall \nwhere thousands were celebrating and holding up their purple ink-\nstained fingers with pride. The mayor said, ``I cannot describe what I \nam seeing. It is incredible. This is a vote for the future, for the \nchildren, for the rule of law, for humanity, for love.'' It is truly a \nnew beginning for Iraq.\n  The election in Iraq clearly demonstrates that Iraqi people are like \npeople everywhere. They desire to create a future in an environment \nthat is safe and allows them to reach their full potential as human \nbeings, whatever that potential may be. The election did not occur in a \nvacuum. It is the latest and most dramatic example of Iraqis taking \ncontrol of their country's destiny.\n  In less than a year, the Iraqi Regular Army and Intervention Forces \nhave grown from one operational battalion to 21 battalions, with six \nmore scheduled to become operational over the next month.\n  Last month, the Iraqi National Guard was incorporated into the Army, \nmaking a total of 68 Iraqi battalions conducting operations.\n  Today, the Iraqi Police Service has over 55,000 trained and equipped \npolice officers, more than double the amount of just 6 months ago. More \nthan 38,000 additional police are on duty and scheduled for training.\n\n  As of last month, more than 108,000 local Iraqis had been hired to \nwork on U.S.-funded reconstruction projects, using as many local \nsubcontractors as possible.\n  Yes, things are, indeed looking up for Iraq and the Iraqi people. But \nthere is still hard work ahead. It is a difficult process to transform \na society that has never known democracy. One hopeful sign occurred \nearlier this week when influential figures from the Sunni community \nsignaled their willingness to engage the new Iraqi government and play \na role in drafting the constitution. Thirteen parties, including a \nrepresentative of the powerful Association of Muslim Scholars and other \nparties that boycotted the vote, agreed Thursday to take part in the \ndrafting of the constitution, which will be the transitional \nparliament's main task. The leading Shiite candidate to be Iraq's new \nPrime Minister welcomed these overtures and said he was willing to \n``offer the maximum'' to involve Sunni Arabs in the new government.\n  Yes, change takes time, and only time will tell if the Iraqi election \nwill go down as one of the most important dates in modern history. I'm \ninclined to believe it will. But between now and when the history books \nare written it was enough, for me, to stand in awe of the courage of a \nfree people half a world away.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1111-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On September 24, 2004, a young man was attacked outside of a club in \nDavis, CA. The attack on the victim was apparently due to a case of \nmistaken identity. The victim in the case resembled a gay man known by \nthe assailant, and the attack was motivated by the attacker's belief \nthat the victim was gay. During the attack, the victim suffered a \nbroken nose and was knocked unconscious by his assailant. The attacker \nrepeatedly yelled slurs regarding the victim's sexual orientation \nduring the assault.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1111-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DEAN MEINEN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

He is leaving my office to go work \nwith Strategic Marketing Innovations, which represents science and \ntechnology firms throughout the country.\n  I know first hand that Dean has done a great deal to enhance \nopportunity and prosperity all across South Dakota. He is an \nextraordinarily talented person with a great deal of energy and \nambition. Dean is not only a great friend, but a well-respected staffer \nthroughout the U.S. Senate. He has earned the respect and admiration of \nall those who have had the opportunity to work with him. His passion \nand love for his work have improved the lives of countless South \nDakotans. Dean's friendly demeanor and wealth of knowledge have helped \nhim develop close relationships with his colleagues and with community \nleaders throughout our State. His tireless effort to dig for details \nand explore all sides of particular issues reflects both his skill and \nhis dedication to his work.\n  I first met Dean when he was a fresh-faced young man that I hired for \nan entry-level mail processing job. I was impressed by his enthusiasm, \nhis belief in the good people of South Dakota, and his political \nabilities that were developed well beyond his years. A few years later, \nI asked him to run my 1994 reelection campaign. After the campaign was \nover, I hired him back to do legislative work in my congressional \noffice. For the past several years, he has served as my economic \ndevelopment director and has worked very hard to advance South Dakota's \nprosperity and to diversify our economy.\n  Dean's departure is a huge loss to South Dakota, and I personally \nknow that he struggled with the decision to leave my office. His kind \nof leadership and character is exactly what the economic development \ncommunity needs to evolve and succeed in the future. I wish but the \nbest for him on all his exciting new challenges and opportunities. It \nis with great honor that I share his impressive accomplishments with my \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1111-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1111-S1112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, each Congress I rise to honor February as \nBlack History Month. Each February since 1926, our Nation has \nrecognized the contributions of Black Americans to the history of our \nNation.\n  This is no accident; February is a significant month in Black \nAmerican history. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, President Abraham \nLincoln, and scholar and civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois were born in \nthe month of February. The 15th Amendment to the Constitution was \nratified 132 years ago this month, preventing race discrimination in \nthe right to vote. The National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People was founded in February in New York City. Last Tuesday, \nFebruary 1, was the 45th anniversary of the Greensboro Four's historic \nsit-in. And on February 25, 1870, this body welcomed its first black \nSenator, Hiram R. Revels of Mississippi.\n  In this important month I want to celebrate some of the contributions \nmade by Black Americans in my home State of Oregon. Since Marcus Lopez, \nwho sailed with Captain Robert Gray in 1788, became the first person of \nAfrican descent known to set foot in Oregon, a great many Black \nAmericans have helped shape the history of my State. Throughout this \nmonth, I will come to the floor to highlight some of their stories.\n  Beatrice Cannady moved to Oregon in 1910. Soon thereafter she married \nE.D. Cannady, who was the founder of the Advocate, Portland's only \nAfrican-American newspaper at the time. Beatrice Cannady quickly became \none of the most important civil rights activists in Oregon. Just 4 \nyears after her\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\narrival, she helped found Portland's chapter of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP. She \neventually became the chief editor of the Advocate, and often used the \nnewspaper as a pulpit from which to protest the State's discriminatory \npolicies.\n  In 1922, Beatrice Cannady became the first African-American woman to \nbe admitted to the Oregon Bar. She helped craft Oregon's first civil-\nrights legislation providing full access to public accommodations \nregardless of race or color. Although this legislation was ultimately \ndefeated, she was successful in leading a drive to repeal the ``Black \nLaws'' of Oregon which excluded African-Americans from residing in the \nState.\n  Through the NAACP, Beatrice Cannady was instrumental in ending school \nsegregation in Vernonia, OR and Longview, WA. She traveled throughout \nOregon to give lectures in schools about African-American history, and \nhosted parties in an attempt to alleviate tensions between white and \nblack members of communities. In 1932, she launched a campaign to \nrepresent Oregon's 5th Congressional District in Congress.\n  Although Beatrice Cannady moved away from Oregon in 1934, she will be \nremembered as one of Oregon's most influential civil rights pioneers.\n  She is only one example of the black men and women who changed the \ncourse of history in Oregon and in the United States. During the \nremainder of Black History Month, I will return to the floor to \ncelebrate more Oregonians like Beatrice Cannady, whose contributions, \nwhile great, have not yet received the attention they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1112-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REAUTHORIZATION OF THE SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 267, to \nreauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination \nAct of 2000. I cosponsored the original 2000 act because it stabilized \npayments to Montana's timber producing counties.\n  In 1905, the establishment of the national forests removed over 150 \nmillion acres in the Western States, including 16 million acres in \nMontana, from future private property ownership. To compensate the \nStates and counties for this loss of property tax revenue, Congress \npassed the Twenty-Five Percent Fund Act of 1908. The act provided that \n25 percent of receipts from each national forest would be paid to the \nState and county where the national forest is located for the benefit \nof public schools and public roads. Until the decline of the timber \nharvest program, the 1908 act provided enough funding to the States and \ncounties.\n  However, beginning in the 1990s both nationally and in Montana, the \ntimber harvest program declined over 85 percent and Federal payments to \nState and county governments declined just as significantly. The \nreasons for the declining timber harvest are many; appeals and \nlitigation by special interest groups, wildfires destroying valuable \ntimber, internal Forest Service redtape, and each of those issues needs \nto be addressed to ensure the Forest Service is meeting its obligation \nto restore healthy forests and the communities that depend on them. \nThis act is important because it doesn't punish schools and counties \nwhen timber harvests are uncertain.\n  In 2000, just like in 1908, Congress recognized these States and \ncounties needed stability in the 25-percent payments in order to plan \nyear to year and provide valuable services. Without the Secure Rural \nSchools Act, in 2004, Montana counties would have received only $6 \nmillion, rather than the $11.7 million provided under the 2000 act. The \neducation of nearly 100,000 Montana schoolchildren in 170 school \ndistricts in 34 counties is affected by these payments.\n  Another benefit of the act is the ``full payment'' option. Under this \noption, counties can reserve 15 to 20 percent of the payment for title \nII, Public Land Projects. These project funds are allocated by a 15-\nperson Resource Advisory Committee, RAC, comprised of tribal members, \nlocal elected officials, and Federal land user organizations.\n  Let me give you some examples of title II projects funded in Lincoln \nCounty, where the RAC allocated $1.6 million in project work that \nincluded improving soil and water quality at a ski area; restoration of \na mile of bull trout and west slope cutthroat stream habitat; and road \nmaintenance projects to improve water quality.\n  I have talked with county commissioners and other Montanans who are \nRAC members. The RACs have fostered a spirit of cooperation and focus \non what everyone has in common and encourage stewardship of our \nnational forests.\n  I can't think of anything better to celebrate the 100-year \nanniversary of our national forests than the reauthorization of the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1112-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1112-S1113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LARRY JANEZICH\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of Southwest Missouri State University. The university was \nfounded March 17, 1905, in Springfield as Missouri State Normal School, \nFourth District, and has ``Dared to Excel'' for the past 100 years.\n  The Southwest Missouri State University System, including its \ncampuses in West Plains and Mountain Grove, are celebrating their \ncentennial year from July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005.\n  The ``Dare to Excel'' theme is most appropriate for this university \nthat has never rested on its laurels. To quote SMS President John H. \nKaiser, ``Over the first 100 years of its existence, the institution \nhas changed dramatically. But one thing has remained the same: SMS has \nopened the door of opportunity for young people from Springfield, the \nregion, the state, the nation and now, world. The Centennial year will \nbe one of celebration, but it also will be one of reflection and re-\ndedication to that noble purpose. The result will be the new long-range \nplan, Daring to Excel, which will take the institution from 2005 to \n2010.''\n  Southwest Missouri State University has ``opened the door of \nopportunity'' for students the past century. Its faculty, staff, and \nstudents have distinguished themselves in academics, in research, in \npublic service, and in cocurricular activities. Offering more than 150 \nundergraduate and 43 graduate academic programs, SMS is committed to \nhelping students succeed in their own lives and as active citizens.\n  During its 100 years, the university has had four names--Missouri \nState Normal School, Fourth District; Southwest Missouri State Teachers \nCollege; Southwest Missouri State College; and Southwest Missouri State \nUniversity--changed each time to more accurately reflect what the \ninstitution has become.\n  There have been significant changes at the institution over the past \n100 years. Since its founding, it has seen its student population grow \nfrom 173 to over 20,000. The full-time faculty has increased from 8 to \n718, and the academic programs have grown from one to nearly 200. In \n1006 there was one building, but now there are 61.\n  Since 1995, Southwest Missouri State University has been further \ndistinguished by its statewide public affairs mission and has had a \nprofound effect on Springfield, southwest Missouri, the entire State, \nthe Nation, and the world. It has contributed to the economic \ndevelopment of the region and the State, impacting the area economy by \nnearly $2 million per day.\n  It is fitting that March 17, 2005, be proclaimed ``Southwest Missouri \nState University Founders Day,'' with sincere appreciation and \nappropriate celebration of the significant contributions the \ninstitution has made to the citizens of Missouri and the nation over \nthe past 100 years.\n  Southwest Missouri State University was founded March 17, 1905, in \nSpringfield as Missouri State Normal School, Fourth District, and has \n``Dared to Excel'' for the past 100 years.

He \nwas elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1996, 1998, \n2000 and 2002. Term limits is the reason he isn't running again \nhowever, he isn't about to sit still and do nothing. The governor \nrecently appointed him to the State Board of Veterans Affairs. As a \nmember of Veterans Affairs his goal is to create a veterans cemetery in \nEl Paso County.\n  Mr. Sinclair has lived in Colorado Springs, CO, for 30 years. He and \nhis family moved there upon retiring from the United States Air Force \nas a colonel. He is a command pilot and a combat veteran of three \nwars--World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Bill and his wife, Barbara have \ntwo children where they attended Colorado Springs schools and Colorado \nuniversities.

Mr. President, I am pleased to take this \nopportunity to commend a longtime friend and adviser who has spent his \ncareer in service to Vermont and American agriculture, Harold J. \nHowrigan of Fairfield, VT.\n  Harold has served the dairy industry long and well, bringing his \nfarmer's ingenuity, common sense and perseverance to his efforts. He \nhas served on the St. Albans Co-operative Board of Directors since 1981 \nand at the upcoming 2005 Annual Meeting he will be stepping down to \nenjoy time with his family on their home farm in Fairfield.\n  Harold, his wife Anne and their sons operate two farms comprised of \nover 500 head of cattle, some 1,800 acres of cropland and forest, \nincluding a significant maple sugaring operation. Harold and Anne have \nopened their home and the farm to many dairy industry leaders, \ninternational dignitaries, government officials, co-op customers and, I \ndaresay, even a campaign commercial or two along the way. Anyone who \nhas had the good fortune to visit the Howrigans enjoys the beautiful \nviews and witnesses the hard work and pride that Harold and his family \ntake in the stewardship of their farming operations.\n  As much as he loves that line of Fairfield hills, Harold has spent \nconsiderable time away from his farming operation serving his community \nand\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\nVermont agriculture. Locally, Harold is active in the St. Patrick's \nChurch and the Franklin County Maple Producers Co-op. On the State \nlevel, he has served as president of the Green Mountain Dairy Farmers \nFederation of Cooperatives and as a director with both the Vermont \nMaple Sugar Makers Association and the Vermont Dairy Promotion Council.\n  Regionally, Harold was the chairperson of the Vermont Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact Commission. In fact, Harold's tireless efforts \nwere a key force in the establishment and successful implementation of \nthe Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The long-standing relationship \nbetween Harold and the Cooperative with the Vermont Congressional \nDelegation was critical in the passage of the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact at the national level which provided stability to dairy \nfarmer income without adverse effects on consumers. He has also served \nas Chair of the Council of Northeast Farmer Cooperatives.\n  In addition to championing the Compact, Harold has been active in \nother national dairy industry organizations serving the interests of \ndairy farmers beyond Vermont on the U.S. Dairy Export Council, and the \nNational Milk Producers Federation. As Chair of the National Dairy \nPromotion and Research Board, he was awarded the Richard E. Ling Award \nfor the distinguished service in January of 2001.\n  The St. Albans Cooperative Creamery was most fortunate to benefit \nfrom Harold's leadership over his years as Director beginning in 1981, \nand as board president since 1988. In his 24 years with the \nCooperative, Harold has seen the Cooperative increase in yearly milk \nvolume to over a billion pounds, build a partnership with Ben & Jerry's \nice cream, expand its territory into New York State, acquire the \nIndependent Dairymen's Association and develop a strategic relationship \nwith Dairy Farmers of America and Dairy Marketing Services.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Harold has remained among my \nmost trusted advisers on farm policy. I know that I can always count on \nhim to provide the unvarnished truth, based on experience forged on a \nVermont dairy farm with its tradition of hard work, common sense, \nsimplicity, love of family and service to community, state and country. \nI join countless Vermonters and Americans as we all thank Harold for \nhis years of service and consider myself fortunate to call him my \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1114-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1114-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1114-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1114-S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-606.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 308. A bill to require that Homeland Security grants related to \nterrorism preparedness and prevention be awarded based strictly on an \nassessment of risk, threat, and vulnerabilities; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a matter of \ngreat significance to our State and to many States across the country: \nprotecting our homeland from another terrorist attack.\n  Everyone is aware of how difficult the fight is against terrorism, \nwherever it takes place in the world, and the number of casualties we \nhave experienced in Iraq, that manifests itself in Afghanistan and \ndifferent countries. But one place we ought to be looking at in terms \nof protecting ourselves from terror is in the United States. We should \nnot be skimping on the costs or resources available for Homeland \nSecurity. My colleague Senator Corzine and I today are introducing a \nbill to ensure that Federal Homeland Security funds get sent where they \nare needed most.\n  On September 11, 2001, 700 of the people who lost their lives were \nfrom New Jersey. On that terrible day, people of north Jersey could see \nthe smoke rising from the World Trade Center. From my own home, I look \ndirectly at the World Trade Center. In my pre-Senate day, I was \ncommissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and had \noffices in the Trade Center and know what the hustle and bustle of life \nwas there. Thousands and thousands of people were working in those two \nbuildings, destroyed by a terrorist that went beyond the wildest \nimagination.\n  The New York-New Jersey region bore the brunt of those attacks on \nSeptember 11. It continues to be the most at-risk area. We are not the \nonly ones at risk. States such as Virginia, with their military \ninstallation, their ports, are also to be included, and a place of some \nthreat, New Mexico, with Los Alamos, and Florida with its ports, and \nTexas with their ports. All of these States have to be on the alert all \nthe time and need funds with which to protect themselves. So I hope we \ncan all agree that homeland security funding ought to be targeted to \nthose parts of the country most at risk of another terrorist attack.\n\n  Now, the 9/11 Commission agrees with this approach. They said:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly--\n\n  ``Strictly''--\n\n     on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n  They further say:\n\n       [F]ederal homeland security assistance should not remain a \n     program for general revenue sharing.\n\n  I think we are all agreed they did a splendid job. This was a focal \npoint for them. The 9/11 Commission reported homeland security money is \ntoo important to be caught up in porkbarrel politics. Unfortunately, \nour current homeland security funding is not based on risks and \nthreats.\n  Under current law, 40 percent of all State homeland security grants, \nover $1 billion each year, are given out as revenue sharing. The system \nresults in preposterous funding allocations.\n  For example, this year, New Jersey's homeland security grant was cut, \nreduced by 34 percent. I remind those who are listening, New Jersey \nlost 700 of its citizens. Our funding was cut despite the fact that we \nin New Jersey were under a code orange alert from August 1 to just \nafter the election because of unspecified threats against the \nPrudential Building in Newark. The Prudential Building is a center of \nmajor financial activity and was highlighted as one of five locations \nthat ought to be especially guarded. Yet the city of Newark saw its \nfunding cut by 17 percent. Another high-risk urban area, Jersey City--\nwhich is directly across from where the Trade Centers were in New York, \nand where so much of the rescue activity was directed, with police from \nthat area, emergency response people--Jersey City saw its funding cut \n60 percent. That does not make sense.\n  The FBI has identified a 2-mile strip between the Port of Newark and \nNewark-Liberty International Airport as the most at-risk area in the \nentire country for a terrorist attack--a 2-mile stretch, highly \nvisible. If you fly into Newark-Liberty Airport, you see the bustling \nport that we have there and the activity that goes on. It is an area, \ncertainly, that would represent, in the FBI's view, one of the most \nappealing targets for terror. Yet the area's homeland security funding \nwas cut. It defies sense.\n  The system is broken. That is why my colleague, Senator Corzine, and \nI are introducing the Risk-Based Homeland Security Funding Act, to \nrequire that homeland security grants are allocated solely based on \nrisk and threat to the area.\n  Our bill would take the 9/11 Commission's recommendations and turn \nthem into law.\n  President Bush understands that risk and vulnerability must be the \nprincipal yardsticks for distributing homeland security funds. In the \nfiscal year 2006 budget just released, President Bush stated that \nhomeland security funds need to be allocated on risks, threats, and \nvulnerabilities.\n  So I hope our colleagues will support the bill Senator Corzine and I \nare introducing today. Our bill will set the gold standard for \ndetermining whether homeland security grants are being properly \nallocated. I ask my colleagues to think of this as a national interest, \nto make sure that none of the areas of high vulnerability are open to \nattack any more than we can possibly do to prevent it because any \nattack in these areas will have a ripple effect throughout the country. \nAgain, these places are an invitation to the terrorists. As much as we \nhate them, we know these people are not fools. We know they plan these \nthings. We know they look for the most vulnerable targets. And we \nshould not permit those targets to go without the protection they fully \ndeserve.\n  So I hope our colleagues will support this bill. It would turn the 9/\n11 Commission's recommendations into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of our bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 308\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Risk-Based Homeland Security \n     Funding Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress agrees with the recommendation on page 396 of the \n     Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks \n     Upon the United States (commonly known as the ``9/11 \n     Report''), which includes the following:\n     ``Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. . . . [F]ederal \n     homeland security assistance should not remain a program for \n     general revenue sharing. It should supplement state and local \n     resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit \n     additional support. Congress should not use this money as a \n     pork barrel.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. RISK-BASED HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Criteria for Awarding Homeland Security Grants.--Except \n     for grants awarded under any of the programs listed under \n     section 4(b), all homeland security grants related to \n     terrorism prevention and terrorism preparedness shall be \n     awarded based strictly on an assessment of risk, threat, and \n     vulnerabilities, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security.\n       (b) Limitation.--Except for grants awarded under any of the \n     programs listed under section 4(b), none of the funds \n     appropriated for Homeland Security grants may be used for \n     general revenue sharing.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1014(c)(3) of the USA \n     PATRIOT ACT (42 U.S.C. 3714(c)(3)) is repealed.\n\n     SEC. 4. PRESERVATION OF PRE-9/11 GRANT PROGRAMS FOR TRADITION \n                   FIRST RESPONDER MISSIONS .\n\n       (a) Savings Provision.--This Act shall not be construed to \n     affect any authority to award grants under a Federal grant \n     program listed under subsection (b), which existed on \n     September 10, 2001, to enhance traditional missions of State \n     and local law enforcement, firefighters, ports, emergency \n     medical services, or public health missions.\n       (b) Programs Excluded.--The programs referred to in \n     subsection (a) are the following:\n       (1) The Firefighter Assistance Program authorized under \n     section 33 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of \n     1974 (15 U.S.C. 2229).\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\n       (2) The Emergency Management Performance Grant Program and \n     the Urban Search and Rescue Grant Program authorized under--\n       (A) title VI of the Robert T.

Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Lautenberg, in both support and the introduction of the Risk-\nBased Homeland Security Funding Act. I think this is simply urgent. It \nis fundamental to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, as \nSenator Lautenberg mentioned.\n  Quoting language that was in that Commission report:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n  Quoting further:\n\n       [F]ederal homeland security assistance should not remain a \n     program for general revenue sharing.\n\n  In fact, I believe we should relabel the bill. I had a little \nargument with my colleague from New Jersey. I think we ought to call it \nthe Common Sense Homeland Security Act. It is only common sense. I \nthink there is a consensus among all those who seriously contemplate \nthis issue that we need to be smart and strategic about how we allocate \nour limited homeland security resources.\n  This is not a local issue, although people will often argue that we \nare trying to speak only from parochial interests. I think you have to \nthink about this as protecting America where we are most vulnerable. It \nis a national issue.\n  Our economic assets are at stake. In New Jersey, that 2-mile stretch \nSenator Lautenberg spoke about in his comments has the Port of Newark, \nwhich is really what is often labeled the Port of New York. Mr. \nPresident, 80 percent of all of the incoming cargo containers that come \ninto that east coast port are in Newark and Elizabeth. So you hear \nabout the Port of New York and New Jersey. It is really the Port of New \nJersey and Elizabeth. And that is in that 2-mile stretch.\n  Then on the other end of that 2-mile stretch is Liberty International \nor Newark Airport, which is, depending on which year and the number of \nflight landings, the third or fourth busiest airport in America--the \nbusiest airport in the metropolitan region of New York and New Jersey.\n  In between, there are rail lines, chemical plants, oil refineries, \nall the economic assets that are important to the economic distribution \nof assets across the east coast.\n  It is incredible, as Senator Lautenberg talked about, that this \nparticular area is seeing these cuts. Newark is getting cut 17 percent \nfrom 2004 to 2005, and, unbelievably, Jersey City is getting cut 64 \npercent, from $17 million down to about $6 million in homeland \nsecurity, State, and local grants. It is very hard to justify. You look \nat your constituents and say we are talking about the threat-based \nallocation of risk, and we see these kinds of cuts given the kind of \nserious concerns that we have.\n  It is a national issue, it is not just a New Jersey issue because if \nthat airport and that port come down, it has a major long-term impact \non the economy of the Nation. It is important. I note, as Senator \nLautenberg did, the Senator from Virginia has ports that have a major \nimpact on more than just Virginia's economic well-being. The airports \nhave more than just an economic impact on the individual State. We have \nto think about what the ripple impact is as we go forward. So we have \nto prioritize.\n  I am pleased the President cited almost the same language in his \nbudget yesterday. Concentrating Federal funds for State and local \nhomeland security assistance programs on the highest threats and \nvulnerabilities and needs is the Presidential goal. We need to \ntranslate that into specific legislative authority so we do not come up \nwith formulas that are revenue sharing based.\n\n  Forty percent of the funds currently allocated are based on just \nequal allocation to the States. Nice idea, but we ought to do that in \nother areas, not with regard to homeland security where we ought to \ndeal with the national economy, the national strategic interests of the \ncountry. So I hope we can take this act, this commonsensical approach, \nand implement it.\n  By the way, I also wonder why we are cutting 30 percent to our State \nand local communities. The first responders are the first line of \ndefense in protecting the American people and in responding to these \nattacks. We certainly saw that in the 9/11 case.\n  I hope we can have a strong debate in Congress about how we are \nallocating within the expenditures we have with regard to homeland \nsecurity. In my view, there is too much ignoring of the reality of the \nneed to fund our local responders, making sure their communications \nequipment can talk to each other, making sure they have the kinds of \nequipment that would be able to respond, as was so heroically done by \nthe people who responded to the 9/11 tragedy.\n  All this has to be put in the context of real-life experiences, \nthough. And Senator Lautenberg talked about that. Seven hundred people \nin our community died. This is a hot issue in the State of New Jersey \nbecause it impacted families, and it still is very much a live part of \ntheir community. People want to see action. They want to see changes as \nwe go forward. And they want to see us be particularly focused on those \nplaces where there are risks.\n  It is hard for New Jerseyans to understand when you put the city of \nNewark on the highest alert, singled out, along with New York City and \nWashington, DC, one day, and then get your homeland security funds cut \nby 20 percent or so 6 months later when the allocation comes out \naccording to a formula, as apposed to thinking about where risks are. \nIt is hard for the people not only in Newark, but we have Hamilton, NJ, \nwhich had a post office that was the site where all the anthrax letters \nwere sent out. We had to shut it down. We spent $60 million cleaning up \nthat post office, just like we had to clean up the Hart Building here \nin Washington.\n  And people say, I do not really understand why we are not concerned \nabout what is going on with regard to risk in New Jersey when we have \nthese kinds of practical realities: 700 of our citizens, orange alerts \nfor Newark, Hamilton post office, and I could go on and on. There are a \nnumber of instances--Atlantic City, where the way the formula works is, \nif you are not a town of 225,000 people, you do not get considered for \nthese grants. We have about 40,000 people in Atlantic City, but that \ndoes not take into account the people who come and visit there, which \nis about 100,000 on average a day; and then all the people who work \nthere, which is about another 40,000. So you are getting up toward \nthose numbers. And on peak days it can be 300,000 people. It is the \nsecond highest concentration of casinos in the country.\n  I think we need to bring common sense to where we are focusing \nhomeland security dollars. I think that is what this act is about. I am \nthrilled that we have Michael Chertoff who is stepping in as the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. I do not think there \nis a smarter guy, a more objective, intellectually honest individual. I \nthink he will push forward with commonsense approaches to allocation \nand recommendations.\n  Finally, this bill does not cover other programs. It does not include \nthe COPS Program, fire grants, other things where you need to be \nreflective of the needs of general revenue sharing approaches. This is \ndealing with homeland security the same way we deal\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\nwith national security. There we identify what we think the threats are \nand apply the resources to match those needs.\n  We need to bring common sense to this. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this legislation. It is very straightforward and a simple \nreflection of the 9/11 Commission Report, a reflection of the words the \nPresident put in his budget report. I think it is appropriate as to how \nwe should move forward with regard to funding for homeland security \nallocations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeMINT (for himself, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 309. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the disposition of unused health benefits in cafeteria plans and \nflexible spending arrangements; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill that would \nupdate flexible spending arrangements, known as FSAs, to allow up to \n$500 of unused health benefits to be carried forward to next year's FSA \nor transferred to a health savings account.\n  Flexible spending arrangements allow employees to set aside money in \nan employer-established benefit plan that can be used on a tax-free \nbasis to meet their out-of-pocket health care expenses during the year. \nHowever, under current law, any money remaining in the FSA at the end \nof the year must be returned to the employer.\n  Nearly 37 million private sector employees have access to an FSA. \nHowever, only 18 percent of eligible employees take advantage of the \npretax health care spending provided by flexible spending arrangements. \nMany employees cite the fear of forfeiting unused funds as the primary \nreason why they elect not to participate in an FSA.\n  This use-it-or-lose-it rule does more, though, than discourage \nwidespread participation. It can also lead to perverse incentives such \nas encouraging people to spend money on health care products and \nservices that they do not necessarily need. In other words, at the end \nof the year, if there is money left in the account, the employee's \nincentive is to go out and get an extra pair of sunglasses or whatever \nit is and spend that money, and that in turn drives up demand and the \nprice of health care for everybody.\n  The bill I am introducing today provides greater flexibility and \nconsumer choice. The bill would allow up to $500 of unused funds at the \nend of the year to be carried forward in that flexible spending \narrangement for use in the next year, or that employee could begin a \nnew HSA, a health savings account, and put up to $500 into that health \nsavings account.\n  I believe this bill will encourage greater participation in flexible \nspending arrangements and, to a lesser extent, participation in health \nsavings account benefit plans. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimates that approximately 76 percent of current FSA participants \nwill take advantage of the rollover option each year.\n  Through this legislation, we can expand access to health care for \nmillions of Americans by making it easier for them to save for their \nhealth care costs. This bill would also reduce end-of-the-year excess \nspending and overuse of health care services, allowing FSA participants \nto benefit from the prudent use of their health care resources.\n  I am grateful to Senators Salazar and Ensign who have joined me as \noriginal cosponsors of this bill. They understand that reducing health \ncosts and increasing access to health care are worthy goals that we \nshould all support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 309\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit States the option to provide medicaid coverage for low-income \nindividuals infected with HIV; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early \nTreatment for HIV Act, ETHA, of 2005. Senator Clinton joins me in \nintroducing this bill, and I want to thank her for her steadfast \nsupport for people living with HIV. HIV knows no party affiliation, and \nI am pleased to say that ETHA cosponsors sit on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Simply stated, ETHA gives States the opportunity to extend Medicaid \ncoverage to low-income, HIV-positive individuals before they develop \nfull-blown AIDS. Today, the unfortunate reality is that most patients \nmust become disabled before they can qualify for Medicaid coverage. \nNearly 50 percent of people living with AIDS who know their status lack \nongoing access to treatment. In my home State of Oregon, there are \napproximately 4,500 persons living with HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that \napproximately 40 percent of these Oregonians are not receiving care for \ntheir HIV disease. Not being in care puts these people's own health at \nrisk, and also makes them more infectious. We can do better, and we \nshould do everything possible to ensure that all people living with HIV \ncan get early, effective medical care.\n  Oregon's Ryan White funded AIDS Drug Assistance Program is nearing \nmaximum enrollment and may need to wait list eligible clients in the \nnear future. The fact of the matter is that safety net programs all \nover the country are running out of money, and are generally unable to \ncover all of the people who need assistance paying for their medical \ncare. As other programs are failing, ETHA gives States another way to \nreach out to low-income, HIV-positive individuals.\n  With approximately 150 newly detected HIV infections in Oregon \nannually, my state desperately needs to provide early treatment to \nthese individuals. It has been shown that current HIV treatments are \nvery successful in delaying the progression from HIV infection to AIDS, \nand help improve the health and quality of life for millions of people \nliving with the disease.\n  Studies conducted by Pricewaterhouse Cooper have found that providing \nearly intervention care significantly delays the progression of HIV and \nis highly cost-effective. ETHA reduces by 60 percent the death rate of\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\npersons living with HIV who received coverage under Medicaid. Disease \nprogression is significantly slowed and health outcomes improved. \nMedicaid offsets alone reduce gross Medicaid costs by approximately 70 \npercent due to the prevention of avoidable high cost medical \ninterventions. Research determined that over 5 years the true cost of \nETHA is $55.2 million. Over 10 years, ETHA saves $31.7 million. It \nshows that preventing the health of people living with HIV, preventing \nopportunistic infections, and slowing the progression to AIDS, will \nsave taxpayers dollars. Ultimately, its clear that in implementing \nETHA, the United States will take an important step toward ensuring \nthat all Americans living with HIV can get the medical care they need \nto stay healthy and productive for as long as possible.\n  Importantly, ETHA also offers States an enhanced Federal Medicaid \nmatch, which means more money for States that invest in treatments for \nHIV. This provision models the successful Breast and Cervical Cancer \nTreatment and Prevention Act of 2000, which allows States to provide \nearly Medicaid intervention to women with breast and cervical cancer. \nEven in these difficult times, 45 States are now offering early \nMedicaid coverage to women with breast and cervical cancer. We can \nbuild upon this success by passing ETHA and extending similar early \nintervention treatments to people with HIV.\n  HIV/AIDS touches the lives of millions of people living in every \nState in the Union. Some get the proper medications, but too many do \nnot. This is literally a life and death issue, and ETHA can help many \nmore Americans enjoy long, healthy lives.\n  I want to thank Senators Clinton, Collins, Bingaman, Coleman, \nCantwell, Snowe, Corzine, Feinstein, Murray, Wyden, DeWine, Bayh, Reed, \nKerry, Dayton, Schumer, Lincoln, Lieberman, Mikulski, Nelson, Stabenow, \nJohnson, Sarbanes, Leahy, Kennedy, Feingold and Lautenberg for joining \nus as cosponsors of ETHA. I also wish to thank all of the organizations \naround the country that have expressed support for this bill. I have \nreceived numerous support letters from those organizations, and I ask \nunanimous consent that those letters be printed in the Record. In \nparticular, I want to thank the Human Rights Campaign, The AIDS \nInstitute, ADAP Working Group and the Treatment Access Expansion \nProject, for helping bring so much attention to ETHA. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will join us in supporting this critical, life-saving \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  AIDS Action,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the AIDS Action Council \n     board of directors and our diverse, nationwide membership of \n     community-based service providers and public health \n     departments working with people living with or affected by \n     HIV, I would like to thank you for introducing the Early \n     Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA) with Senator Clinton and offer \n     my strong support for this important piece of legislation.\n       As you know, ETHA is a means to eliminate barriers to early \n     drug therapy and comprehensive care for people living with \n     HIV. This important legislation would give States the option \n     of allowing HIV positive people with low incomes to qualify \n     for Medicaid coverage earlier in the course of their \n     infection, permitting them to receive greater benefits from \n     anti-retroviral therapy.\n       Access to pharmaceuticals and quality health services is \n     vital for people living with HIV. Advancements in treatment \n     and the development of anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy have \n     enabled HIV positive individuals to lead longer and healthier \n     lives. However, ARV therapy is often prohibitively expensive, \n     costing approximately $10,000 to $12,000 annually, making it \n     virtually impossible for low-income people, who are often \n     uninsured or underinsured, to access these life-prolonging \n     medications.\n       Current Federal treatment guidelines recommend the \n     initiation of ARV therapy early in the course of HIV \n     infection. With early initiation, the efficacy of ARV therapy \n     increases, boosting the effectiveness of other available HIV \n     drugs and staving off disability. Initiated early on, ARV \n     therapy ultimately saves costs associated with delayed \n     medical treatment. Unfortunately, many uninsured and \n     underinsured people living with HIV cannot afford ARV therapy \n     on their own. Further, Americans living with HIV do not \n     qualify for Medicaid until they have received an AIDS \n     diagnosis and are sick enough to meet Medicaid's categorical \n     requirements for disability--a point at which it is too late \n     for ARV treatment to be optimally effective. These barriers \n     to early treatment must be eliminated so that low income \n     people living with HIV can access the health care they need.\n       During this time of shrinking Federal budgets and economic \n     downsizing, savings in Federal HIV programs, whether in \n     mandatory or discretionary spending, are beneficial to all \n     parties involved. By allowing HIV positive individuals to \n     qualify for Medicaid earlier in the course of HIV infection, \n     ETHA will create significant savings for the Federal \n     Government in overall health care funding.\n       AIDS Action looks forward to working with you on passage of \n     this bill. Together we can ensure that people living with HIV \n     have access to the treatments and health services they need \n     to stay healthy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marsha A. Martin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           The AIDS Institute,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2005.\n     Re the early treatment for HIV Act (ETHA).\n\n     Senator Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The AIDS Institute applauds you for \n     your continued leadership and commitment to those people \n     living with HIV/AIDS in our country who are in need of \n     lifesaving healthcare and treatment. While the HIV/AIDS \n     epidemic in sub-Sahara Africa and other parts of the world \n     often overshadow the epidemic in the United States, we must \n     not forget about the approximately 900,000 people living in \n     the U.S. who have HIV or AIDS.\n       Those infected with HIV are more likely to be low-income, \n     and it disproportionately impacts certain populations, \n     particularly minorities. In fact, the AIDS case rate per \n     100,000 population for African Americans was 9.5 times that \n     of whites in 2003.\n       According to a recent Institute of Medicine report titled, \n     ``Public Financing and Delivery of HIV/AIDS Care: Securing \n     the Legacy of the Ryan White CARE Act'', 233,000 of the \n     463,070 people living with HIV in the U.S. who need \n     antiretroviral treatment do not have ongoing access to this \n     treatment. This does not include an additional 82,000 people \n     who are infected but unaware of their HIV status and are in \n     need of antiretrovira1 medications.\n       One reason why there are so many people lacking treatment \n     is that under current law, Medicaid, which is the single \n     largest public payer of HIV/AIDS care in the U.S., only \n     covers those with full blown AIDS, not those with HIV.\n       The Early Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA), being re-introduced \n     in this Congress under your leadership and Sen. Hillary \n     Clinton, would correct an archaic mindset in the delivery of \n     public health care. No longer would a Medicaid eligible \n     person with HIV have to become disabled with AIDS to receive \n     access to Medicaid provided care and treatment. Providing \n     coverage to those with HIV can prevent them from developing \n     AIDS, and allow them to live a productive life with their \n     family and be a healthy contributing member of society.\n       ETHA would provide States the option of amending their \n     Medicaid eligibility requirements to include uninsured and \n     under-insured, pre-disabled poor and low-income people living \n     with HIV. No State has to participate if they choose not to.\n       As all States have participated in the Breast and Cervical \n     Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act, on which ETHA is \n     modeled, we believe all States will opt to choose this \n     approach in treating those with HIV. States will opt into \n     this benefit not only because it is the medically and \n     ethically right thing to do, but it is cost effective, as \n     well.\n       A recent study prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers found \n     that if ETHA was enacted, over 10 years:\n       --the death rate for persons living with HIV on Medicaid \n     would be reduced by 50 percent;\n       --there would be 35,000 more individuals having CD4 levels \n     above 500 under ETHA versus the existing Medicaid system; and\n       --result in a savings of $31.7 million.\n       The AIDS Institute thanks you for your bipartisan \n     leadership by introducing ``The Early Treatment for HIV Act \n     of 2006''. It is the type of Medicaid reform that is \n     critically needed to update the program to keep current with \n     the Federal Government's guidelines for treating people with \n     HIV.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues as \n     it moves to enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Dr. A. Gene Copello,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 2, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     404 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The American Academy of HIV Medicine is \n     an independent organization of HIV Specialists and others \n     dedicated to promoting excellence in HIV/AIDS care. As the \n     largest independent organization of HIV frontline providers, \n     our 2,000 members provide direct care to more than 340,000 \n     HIV patients--more than two thirds of the patients in active \n     treatment for HIV disease.\n       The Academy, particularly those HIV Specialists in the \n     state of Oregon, would like to thank and commend you for co-\n     sponsoring the Early Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA).\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\n       ETHA addresses a cruel irony in the current Medicaid \n     system--that under current Medicaid rules people must become \n     disabled by AIDS before they can receive access to Medicaid \n     provided care and treatment that could have prevented them \n     from becoming so ill in the first place. ETHA would bring \n     Medicaid eligibility rules in line with the clinical standard \n     of care for treating HIV disease. ETHA helps address the fact \n     that increasingly, in many parts of the country, there are \n     growing waiting lists for access to life-saving medications \n     and limited to no access to comprehensive health care. \n     Particularly in Oregon, we have been witness to difficulties \n     in access to care for some of our patients, having endured a \n     severe strain on our AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) for \n     quite some time.\n       The Academy believes this legislation would allow HIV \n     positive individuals access to the medical care that we \n     recognize as vital towards postponing or avoiding the onset \n     of AIDS and towards enormously increase the quality of life \n     for people living with HIV disease.\n       As a provider at a public health clinic (the Multnomah \n     County Health Department HIV clinic), I see patients from a 6 \n     county area, with a growing number of uninsured. The \n     difficulties in obtaining medication coverage have been \n     growing monthly, and have become a major part of the 'medical \n     care' we provide. A more equitable system of coverage and \n     medication access would help tremendously, and allow us to \n     focus on what we are trained to do. Thank you for your \n     efforts in this area.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael S. MacVeigh.\n     James E. McDonald.\n     Joan Reeder.\n     Maria Kosmetatos.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Cascade AIDS Project,\n\n                                   Portland, OR, February 1, 2005.\n     Senator Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: As you know, Cascade AIDS Project is \n     the largest AIDS service organization in Oregon. For two \n     decades we have served and advocated for people living with \n     and at risk for HIV/AIDS. We strongly urge you to support the \n     Early Treatment of HIV Act.\n       The Early Treatment for HIV Act will allow low-income \n     individuals living with HIV to qualify for Medicaid coverage \n     earlier in the course of their disease instead of waiting \n     until they are disabled by full-blown AIDS.\n       Healthcare advocates have long been arguing that to treat \n     an individual's illness at its earlier stages costs less than \n     waiting until the individual is significantly disabled by \n     further progression of the illness.\n       There are many Americans--those in the low income bracket \n     and in underserved communities--who do not have access to \n     drug treatment regimens because they have not progressed to \n     fullblown AIDS. The ACT would make access to those drugs \n     possible.\n       Medicaid is a lifeline to HIV care for roughly half of \n     those living with AIDS, and 90% of all children living with \n     AIDS. All Medicaid programs cover some prescription drugs, \n     but with the improved drug therapy of today, it is crucial \n     that individuals infected with HIV receive access to these \n     drugs as soon as their conditions call for it.\n       Passage of the Early Treatment for HIV Act will save \n     countless lives and must be viewed as a priority. We know \n     that passage of the Act is the right thing to do.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Thomas Bruner,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                     TII-CANN,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Subject: ETHA (The Early Treatment for HIV Act)\n\n       Dear Senator Smith: I wanted to express our appreciation \n     and support for your introduction of ETHA in the 109th U.S. \n     Congress together with Senator Clinton and the other original \n     co-sponsors.\n       Having been working since day one on the ETHA process and \n     having closely studied the potentially lifesaving--and cost \n     savings--potentials of this bill we feel it's particularly \n     crucial that this important legislation be passed into law as \n     soon as possible.\n       The across the board potential cost savings inherent in \n     providing early access to HIV treatment over 10 years are a \n     compelling fiscally responsible story and of course treating \n     sick Americans as soon as possible is simply the correct \n     moral and ethical course of action for the world's most \n     powerful country. The value of increasing life span and \n     quality of life to tens of thousands of affected individuals, \n     and their families, has a tremendous value to society at \n     large, as well.\n       Once again we extend our thanks to you and Senator Clinton \n     for your leadership and we look forward to helping this \n     Important private and PublIc health legislation to work its \n     way through our congressional process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William E. Arnold,\n     CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Project Inform,\n\n                              San Francisco, CA, February 2, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am writing to thank you and Senator \n     Clinton for introducing the Early Treatment for HIV Act. \n     Project Inform, a national HIV/AIDS treatment information and \n     advocacy organization serving 80,000 people nationwide, \n     strongly supports this legislation.\n       This bill would allow, states to extend Medicaid coverage \n     to pre-disabled people living with IV. It represents a \n     breakthrough in assuring early access to care for thousands \n     of low-income people living with HIV. Current HIV treatments \n     are successfully delaying the progression from HIV infection \n     to AIDS, thus improving the health and quality of life for \n     many people living with the disease. However, without access \n     to early intervention health care and treatment, these \n     advances remain out of reach for many non-disabled, low-\n     income people with HIV.\n       Project Inform is acutely aware of the need for early \n     access to lifesaving medications and healthcare for people \n     living with HIV/AIDS. Discretionary programs such as the AIDS \n     Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) are simply unable to meet the \n     growing need. If ETHA is passed and implemented by the \n     states, a great burden will be lifted off these safety net \n     programs and people living with the disease will be able to \n     get the care and treatment needed to live longer, more \n     productive lives.\n       A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that if \n     ETHA is passed and implemented by the states, the death rate \n     of people living with HIV on Medicaid would be cut in half \n     over a ten-year period. It also revealed that over a ten-year \n     period, ETHA would save money in the Medicaid program. It is \n     a humane and cost-effective bill and I thank you again for \n     your leadership in introducing it. Please let me know how \n     Project Inform can help make it become law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ryan Clary,\n     Senior Policy Advocate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Partnership Project,\n\n                                   Portland, OR, February 1, 2005.\n     Hon.

Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the National Alliance of \n     State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD), I am writing \n     to offer our support for the ``Early Treatment for HIV Act.'' \n     NASTAD represents the nation's chief state and territorial \n     health agency staff who are responsible for HIV/AIDS \n     prevention, care and treatment programs funded by state and \n     federal governments. This legislation would give states an \n     important option in providing care and treatment services to \n     low-income Americans living with HIV.\n       The Early Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA) would allow states \n     to expand their Medicaid programs to cover HIV positive \n     individuals, before they become disabled, without having to \n     receive a waiver. NASTAD believes this legislation would \n     allow HIV positive individuals to access the medical care \n     that is widely recommended, can postpone or avoid the onset \n     of AIDS, and can enormously increase the quality of life for \n     people living with HIV.\n       State AIDS directors continue to develop innovative and \n     cost-effective HIV/AIDS programs in the face of devastating \n     state budget cuts and federal contributions that fail to keep \n     up with need. ETHA provides a solution to states by \n     increasing health care access for those living with HIV/AIDS. \n     ETHA will also save states money in the long-run by treating \n     HIV positive individuals earlier in the disease's progression \n     and providing states with a federal match for the millions of \n     dollars they are presently spending on HIV/AIDS care.\n\n[[Page S1122]]\n\n       Thank you very much for your continued commitment to \n     persons living with HIV/AIDS.

Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the AIDS Action Council \n     board of directors and our diverse, nationwide membership of \n     community-based service providers and public health \n     departments working with people living with or affected by \n     HIV, I would like to thank you for introducing the Early \n     Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA) with Senator Clinton and offer \n     my strong support for this important piece of legislation.\n       As you know, ETHA is a means to eliminate barriers to early \n     drug therapy and comprehensive care for people living with \n     HIV. This important legislation would give states the option \n     of allowing HIV positive people with low incomes to qualify \n     for Medicaid coverage earlier in the course of their \n     infection, permitting them to receive greater benefits from \n     anti-retroviral therapy.\n       Access to pharmaceuticals and quality health services is \n     vital for people living with HIV. Advancements in treatment \n     and the development of anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy have \n     enabled HIV positive individuals to lead longer and healthier \n     lives. However, ARV therapy is often prohibitively expensive, \n     costing approximately $10,000 to $12,000 annually, making it \n     virtually impossible for low-income people, who are often \n     uninsured or underinsured, to access these life-prolonging \n     medications.\n       Current federal treatment guidelines recommend the \n     initiation of ARV therapy early in the course of HIV \n     infection. With early initiation, the efficacy of ARV therapy \n     increases, boosting the effectiveness of other available HIV \n     drugs and staving off disability. Initiated early on, ARV \n     therapy ultimately saves costs associated with delayed \n     medical treatment. Unfortunately, many uninsured and \n     underinsured people living with HIV cannot afford ARV therapy \n     on their own. Further, Americans living with HIV do not \n     qualify for Medicaid until they have received an AIDS \n     diagnosis and are sick enough to meet Medicaid's categorical \n     requirements for disability--a point at which it is too late \n     for ARV treatment to be optimally effective. These barriers \n     to early treatment must be eliminated so that low income \n     people living with HIV can access the health care they need.\n       During this time of shrinking federal budgets and economic \n     downsizing, savings in federal HIV programs, whether in \n     mandatory or discretionary spending, are beneficial to all \n     parties involved. By allowing HIV positive individuals to \n     qualify for Medicaid earlier in the course of HIV infection, \n     ETHA will create significant savings for the federal \n     government in overall health care funding.\n       AIDS Action looks forward to working with you on passage of \n     this bill. Together we can ensure that people living with HIV \n     have access to the treatments and health services they need \n     to stay healthy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Marsha A.

A bill to implement the recommendations of the Federal \nCommunications Commission report to the Congress regarding low-power FM \nservice; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Local \nCommunity Radio Act of 2005. This bill would allow the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC) to license Low Power FM stations on \nthird adjacent channels to full power stations without limitations and \neliminate the requirement that the FCC perform further testing on the \neconomic impact of Low Power FM radio. Additionally, the bill seeks to \nprotect stations that provide radio reading services, which some have \nsuggested are more susceptible to interference then other stations \nbecause they are carried on a subcarrier frequency. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Senators Leahy and Cantwell who are co-\nsponsors of the bill. I thank them for their support. A similar bill \nwas introduced in the 108th Congress and passed out of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  In January 2000, the FCC launched Low Power FM radio service to \n``enhance locally focused community-oriented radio broadcasting.'' Low \nPower FM stations are just that--low power radio stations on the FM \nband that generally reach an audience within a 3.5 mile radius of the \nstation's transmitter. In rural areas, this signal may not reach many \npeople, but it provides rural citizens with another media outlet--\nanother voice in the market. In urban areas, this signal may reach \nhundreds of thousands of people and provide not just local content, but \nvery specific neighborhood news and information.\n  Localism is increasingly important in today's changing media \nlandscape. Rampant ownership consolidation has taken place in the radio \nindustry since passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Since \nthat time, many Americans have complained that the large media \nconglomerates fail to serve local communities' interests and seem to \nuse their local station license as a conduit to air national \nprogramming. Low Power FM was introduced, in part, to respond to such \ncomplaints.\n  Between May 1999 and May 2000, the Commission received over 3,400 \napplications for Low Power FM stations from non-commercial educational \nentities and community organizations. However, before the Commission \ncould act on many of the applications for this new community service, \nbroadcasters frightened legislators into halting the full \nimplementation of Low Power FM. Broadcasters masqueraded their true \nconcerns about competition from a real local radio broadcaster in \nthinly veiled claims of interference.\n  Due to the broadcasters' subterfuge, Congress added language to a \n2000 appropriations bill requiring the FCC to hire an independent \nengineering firm to further study broadcasters' claims of interference. \nI am not happy to report that after spending almost two years and over \n2 million dollars, the independent study revealed what the FCC and \ncommunity groups had said all along: LPFM will do no harm to other \nbroadcasters. Perhaps, we should send a bill to the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters.\n  That brings us to the future of Low Power FM. The FCC, as required by \nthe appropriations language, reported the study's findings to Congress \nlast February and recommended full implementation of Low Power FM. This \nbill simply follows the FCC's recommendation: begin licensing Low Power \nFM stations on third adjacent channels to full power stations without \nlimitations. Additionally, the bill seeks to protect full power \nstations that provide radio reading services. It is estimated that \nabout 1.1 million people in the U.S. are blind, and it is important to \nensure this helpful radio reading service remains interference free.\n  The enactment of this bill will immediately make available a number \nof Low Power FM frequencies. By some estimates, Congress' legislation \ndelaying the full implementation, which mostly affected metropolitan \nareas, led to the elimination of half the Low Power FM applications \nfiled during 2000.\n  For example, Congress' action eliminated the LPFM slot in Fresno \napplied for by El Comite de los Pobres. The group had hoped to address \nthe dearth of local programming for the Latino community by airing \nbilingual coverage of local issues. New Orleans' Music Business \nInstitute's application was eliminated as well. The Music Business \nInstitute teaches young people how to get into the music business. The \nInstitute had planned to use the station to help start the musical \ncareers of local artists, and to educate listeners about the city's \njazz and blues musical heritage.\n  There are some wonderful LPFM stations that are up and running. A \nrecent article published in The Nation called these stations, ``beacons \nof grassroots democracy.'' The article discussed WRFR in Rockland, \nMaine: ``Shunning the canned programming approach of Rockland's two \nClear Channel stations, WRFR offers an array of local talent, tastes \nand interests, and was recently named Maine station of the year by a \nstate music association. Although country music, a Maine favorite, is \nheavily represented, hardly any WRFR deejay restricts himself to a \nsingle era, genre or Top-40 play list.''\n  In 2000, the Southern Development Foundation established a Low Power \nFM station in Opelousas, Louisiana, which sponsors agriculture \nprograms, leases land to farmers, raises money for scholarships for \nneedy kids and helps citizens learn to read. The station director told \na local community newsletter: ``You've got local radio stations that \nare owned by larger companies. There should be some programming \nconcerning the music that is from here, and the people from here. But \nthere's not.''\n  I ask the broadcasters to come clean and join us in promoting LPFM. \nMore good radio brings about more radio listening--and that's good for \nall broadcasters. Therefore, in the interests of would-be new \nbroadcasters, existing broadcasters, but most of all, the listening \npublic, I urge the enactment of the Local Community Radio Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 312\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Community Radio Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 led \n     to increased ownership consolidation in the radio industry.\n       (2) At a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation, on June 4, 2003, all 5 members \n     of the Federal Communications Commission testified that there \n     has been, in at least some local radio markets, too much \n     consolidation.\n       (3) A commitment to localism--local operations, local \n     research, local management, locally-originated programming, \n     local artists, and local news and events--would bolster radio \n     listening.\n       (4) Local communities have sought to launch radio stations \n     to meet their local needs. However, due to the scarce amount \n     of spectrum available and the high cost of buying and running \n     a large station, many local communities are unable to \n     establish a radio station.\n       (5) In 2003, the average cost to acquire a commercial radio \n     station was more than $2,500,000.\n       (6) In January, 2000, the Federal Communications Commission \n     authorized a new, affordable community radio service called \n     ``low-power FM'' or ``LPFM'' to ``enhance locally focused \n     community-oriented radio broadcasting''.\n       (7) Through the creation of LPFM, the Commission sought to \n     ``create opportunities for new voices on the air waves and to \n     allow local groups, including schools, churches, and other \n     community-based organizations, to provide programming \n     responsive to local community needs and interests''.\n       (8) The Commission made clear that the creation of LPFM \n     would not compromise the integrity of the FM radio band by \n     stating, ``We are committed to creating a low-power FM radio \n     service only if it does not cause unacceptable interference \n     to existing radio service.''.\n       (9) Currently, FM translator stations can operate on the \n     second and third-adjacent channels to full power radio \n     stations, up to an effective radiated power of 250 watts, \n     pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\n     Regulations, using the very same transmitters that LPFM \n     stations will use. The FCC based its LPFM rules on the actual \n     performance of these translators that already operate without \n     undue interference to FM stations. The actual interference \n     record of these translators is far more useful than any \n     results that further testing could yield.\n       (10) Small rural broadcasters were particularly concerned \n     about a lengthy and costly interference complaint process. \n     Therefore, in September, 2000, the Commission created a \n     simple process to address interference complaints regarding \n     LPFM stations on an expedited basis.\n       (11) In December, 2000, Congress delayed the full \n     implementation of LPFM until an independent engineering study \n     was completed and reviewed. This delay was due to some \n     broadcasters' concerns that LPFM service would cause \n     interference in the FM band.\n       (12) The delay prevented millions of Americans from having \n     a locally operated, community based radio station in their \n     neighborhood.\n       (13) Approximately 300 LPFM stations were allowed to \n     proceed despite the congressional action. These stations are \n     currently on the air and are run by local government \n     agencies, groups promoting arts and education to immigrant \n     and indigenous peoples, artists, schools, religious \n     organizations, environmental groups, organizations promoting \n     literacy, and many other civically-oriented organizations.\n       (14) After 2 years and the expenditure of $2,193,343 in \n     taxpayer dollars to conduct this study, the broadcasters' \n     concerns were demonstrated to be unsubstantiated.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPEAL OF PRIOR LAW.\n\n       Section 632 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and \n     State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-553; 114 Stat. 2762A-111), is \n     repealed.\n\n     SEC. 4. MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its \n     rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation \n     requirements between--\n       (1) low-power FM stations; and\n       (2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and \n     FM booster stations.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROTECTION OF RADIO READING SERVICES.\n\n       The Federal Communications Commission shall retain its \n     rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for \n     full-power non-commercial FM stations that broadcast radio \n     reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential \n     low-power FM station interference.\n\n     SEC. 6. ENSURING AVAILABILITY OF SPECTRUM FOR LPFM STATIONS.\n\n       The Federal Communications Commission when licensing FM \n     translator stations shall ensure--\n       (1) licenses are available to both FM translator stations \n     and low-power FM stations; and\n       (2) that such decisions are made based on the needs of the \n     local community.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joining with \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy, as a cosponsor of the Local Community Radio Act of 2005. This \nlegislation is similar to the version of S. 2505, the Low Power Radio \nAct of 2004 that was introduced last Congress.\n  This bill removes once and for all the barriers keeping low power FM \nservice from flourishing in communities of all sizes across the \ncountry, while protecting important radio reading services. Under the \nexisting law, my State has only a handful of low power FM stations. If \nthis bill becomes law, the Federal Communication Commission will be \nable to move forward and license additional low power FM stations to \nserve communities all across the State of Washington such as Bainbridge \nIsland, Vashon Island and Auburn.\n  Let me review the history of this issue for the Senate. The \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 removed completely the ownership caps \nrestricting the number of stations that any one company can own \nnationwide. The Act has led to an unprecedented level of consolidation \nand mergers in the U.S. radio industry. Additionally, within a local \nmarket, the rules allows ownership of up to eight radio stations, on a \nsliding scale, depending on total number of stations in the market.\n  Five years ago, the FCC adopted rules creating a new, low power FM \nradio service in response to public concerns that the increased \nconsolidation of radio ownership weakened the local character of radio.\n  Low power FM stations serve the public interest by providing \nsignificantly greater opportunities for citizen involvement in \nbroadcasting in communities across the country. Eligible licensees are \nnon-profit, government or educational institutions, public safety or \ntransportations services. No existing broadcasting licensee or media \nentity can have an ownership interest or any program or operating \nagreement with any low power FM stations.\n  In many media markets, the number of independent local voices has \ndropped significantly, replaced by giant corporations replicating \nformats and programming from across the country. Voice-tracking, a \npractice in which a DJ either pre-records part of a program for a local \nstation or for a station out of the immediate market, is not a \nsubstitute for true localism.\n  With fewer independent outlets available for artists to get airplay \nfor a given genre of music, particularly for newer acts, there is a \nperception in some quarters of the music industry that you need to \nresort to the reprehensible practices such as payola in order to be \nheard by the public.\n  During its proceeding on low power FM, the FCC conducted tests on the \neffects of these low power stations on full power FM broadcasts for \nvarious types of radio receivers. The FCC engineering reports concluded \nthat low power FM signals would not cause interference with the signals \nto full power FM stations within their service areas. Based on the \nresults of interference testing, LPFM stations were not required to \nprotect stations three channels away from inference as is required for \nfull power stations. These rules allowed radio frequencies for LPFM \nstations to become available in larger media markets where under the \nold rules of third adjacent channel separation, there was no space \navailable for them on the crowded radio dial.\n  While the public reaction to low power FM was positive, the reaction \nof FM broadcasters, both commercial and non-commercial, was negative. \nCongress was convinced to add a rider to the 2001 Commerce, Justice, \nState appropriations law that effectively undid the provisions in the \nFCC rules, and once again required third adjacent channel separation. \nCongress also required the FCC to perform a study examining the impact \non interference on the third adjacent channel.\n  Over two million dollars later, the results of the study validated \nthe FCC's original analysis. Last year, I joined the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, in \nsponsoring a bill that would have accepted the results of this latest \nengineering study to undo the 2001 appropriations rider. It also \naddressed specific concerns about protecting stations providing reading \nservices over the radio frequencies to assist the blind. Under the \nSenator from Arizona's (Mr. McCain) leadership, the Commerce Committee \nreported the low power FM bill out favorably with an amendment, but it \ndid not come to a vote on the floor.\n  The time has come to move ahead with this proposal. The U.S. radio \nindustry has experienced an unprecedented wave of consolidation and \nmergers since passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The \nconsolidation trend has raised barriers of both size and cost for new \nbroadcasters. The legislation we introduce today allows new entrants \ninto broadcasting activities and new voices on our public airwaves. I \nhope the Commerce Committee will again act quickly on this legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senators McCain \nand Cantwell in introducing important legislation to increase the \nnumber of frequencies available for low power radio stations in \nAmerica. Low power stations serve their communities with broadcasting \nthat reflects local needs and local preferences. In this way, low power \nFM offers a valuable counterpoint to nationwide media consolidation. As \nNational Public Radio reported this morning, low power FM has a large \nfollowing of listeners tired of hearing the same programming across the \ncountry. For this reason, I have been a strong supporter of low power \nFM for many years now. In fact, I recently urged FCC Chairman Powell to \nexpedite licensing for new low power stations.\n  Unfortunately, for many years now the number of low power FM stations \nthe FCC could license has been limited by unrealistic and unnecessary \nrules requiring these small stations to find available frequencies far \nfrom any full power broadcaster. Interference must be avoided if we are \nto make use of the\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\nairwaves. The current rules, however, go beyond what is necessary to \nprotect full power stations from interference and, instead, protect \nthem from competition. This bill will reduce the unnecessary \nrestrictions on low power FM stations.\n  Of course, the need for low power FM radio must be balanced against \nother important uses of nearby frequencies. I have worked hard to \nprotect reading services for the blind, and this bill protects those \nservices by retaining the third-adjacent rule where such services would \nbe affected. In addition, this bill protects commercial broadcasters of \nall sizes from actual interference by leaving intact the FCC's \nexpedited interference claim review procedures.\n  I look forward to working with all the parties involved to strengthen \nlocal broadcasting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Biden, Mr. Levin, Ms. Collins, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 313. A bill to improve authorities to address urgent \nnonproliferation crises and United States nonproliferation operations; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to again introduce a bill that will \nstrengthen U.S. nonproliferation efforts. It is supported by the \nAdministration and several of my colleagues. This bill represents the \nfourth installment of Nunn-Lugar legislation that I have offered since \n1991.\n  In that year, Sam Nunn and I authored the Nunn-Lugar Act, which \nestablished the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. That program has \nprovided U.S. funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union \nsafeguard and dismantle their enormous stockpiles of nuclear, chemical \nand biological weapons, means of delivery and related materials. In \n1997, Senator Nunn and I were joined by Senator Domenici in introducing \nthe Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, which expanded \nNunn-Lugar authorities in the former Soviet Union and provided WMD \nexpertise to first responders in American cities. In 2003, Congress \nadopted the Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act, which authorized the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram to operate outside the former Soviet Union to address \nproliferation threats. The bill that I am introducing today would \nstrengthen the Nunn-Lugar program and provide it with greater \nflexibility to address emerging threats.\n  To date, the Nunn-Lugar program has deactivated or destroyed: 6,564 \nnuclear warheads; 568 ICBMs; 477 ICBM silos; 17 ICBM mobile missile \nlaunchers; 142 bombers; 761 nuclear air-to-surface missiles; 420 \nsubmarine missile launchers; 543 submarine launched missiles; 28 \nnuclear submarines; and 194 nuclear test tunnels.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program also facilitated the removal of all nuclear \nweapons from Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. After the fall of the \nSoviet Union, these three nations emerged as the third, fourth, and \neighth largest nuclear powers in the world. Today, all three are \nnuclear weapons free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn-\nLugar program. In addition, Nunn-Lugar is the primary tool through \nwhich the United States is working with Russian authorities to \nidentify, safeguard and destroy Russia's massive chemical and \nbiological warfare capacity.\n  These successes were never a foregone conclusion. Today, even after \nmore than 12 years, creativity and constant vigilance are required to \nensure that the Nunn-Lugar program is not encumbered by bureaucratic \nobstacles or undercut by political disagreements.\n  During Secretary Rice's confirmation hearing with the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee on January 18, 2005, I asked Dr. Rice if she and \nthe Administration supported this legislation, to which she responded \n``Yes we do.'' Secretary Rice and President Bush have long argued that \nthere needs to be maximum flexibility granted to the Administration to \nexecute a global, focused and timely effort to fight proliferation. In \nview of the Administration's strong support for this bill, I look \nforward to working with the Armed Services Committee to enact it.\n  I have devoted much time and effort to overseeing and accelerating \nthe Nunn-Lugar program. Uncounted individuals of great dedication \nserving on the ground in the former Soviet Union and in our government \nhave made this program work. Nevertheless, from the beginning, we have \nencountered resistance to the Nunn-Lugar concept in both the United \nStates and Russia. In our own country, opposition often has been \nmotivated by false perceptions that Nunn-Lugar money is foreign \nassistance or by beliefs that Defense Department funds should only be \nspent on troops, weapons, or other war-fighting capabilities. Until \nrecently, we also faced a general disinterest in non-proliferation that \nmade gaining support for Nunn-Lugar funding and activities an annual \nstruggle.\n  The attacks of September 11 changed the political discourse on this \nsubject. We have turned a corner--the public, the media, and political \ncandidates are paying more attention now. In a remarkable moment in the \nfirst presidential debate last year, both President Bush and his \nopponent agreed that the number one national security threat facing the \nUnited States was the prospect that weapons of mass destruction would \nfall into the hands of terrorists.\n  While the Administration has noted its support for this bill, the 9/\n11 Commission also weighed in last year with another important \nendorsement of the Nunn-Lugar program, saying that ``Preventing the \nproliferation of [weapons of mass destruction] warrants a maximum \neffort--by strengthening counter-proliferation efforts, expanding the \nProliferation Security Initiative, and supporting the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program.'' The Report went on to say that ``Nunn-Lugar \n. . . is now in need of expansion, improvement and resources.''\n  My bill would underscore the bipartisan consensus on Nunn-Lugar by \nstreamlining and accelerating Nunn-Lugar implementation. It would grant \nmore flexibility to the President and the Secretary of Defense to \nundertake proliferation projects outside the former Soviet Union. It \nalso would eliminate Congressionally-imposed conditions on Nunn-Lugar \nassistance that in the past have forced the suspension of time-\nsensitive nonproliferation projects. The purpose of the bill is to \nreduce bureaucratic red tape and friction within our government that \nhinder effective responses to nonproliferation opportunities and \nemergencies.\n  For example, recently Albania appealed for help in destroying 16 tons \nof chemical agent left over from the Cold War. Last August, I visited \nthis remote storage facility. Nunn-Lugar officials are working closely \nwith Albanian leaders to destroy this dangerous stockpile. But this \nexperience also is illustrative of the need to reduce bureaucratic \ndelays. The package of documents related to the mission took some 11 \nweeks to be finalized and readied for President Bush. From beginning to \nend, the bureaucratic process to authorize dismantlement of chemical \nweapons in Albania took more than three months. Fortunately, the \nsituation in Albania was not a crisis, but we may not be able to afford \nthese timelines in future nonproliferation emergencies.\n  As I said when I introduced this legislation during our November \nsession last year, I wanted to have the benefit of the Administration's \nviews and my colleagues' input. Since then, I am pleased that Senators \nDomenici, Hagel, Reed, Biden, Levin, Collins, McCain and Obama have all \nsigned on as co-sponsors. The Administration has now stated that they \nsupport this bill. I look forward to working in Congress to enact it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 314. A bill to protect consumers, creditors, workers, pensioners, \nshareholders, and small businesses, by reforming the rules governing \nvenue in bankruptcy cases to combat forum shopping by corporate \ndebtors; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fairness in \nBankruptcy Litigation Act of 2005.\n  This legislation will provide much-needed protection--for consumers, \ncreditors, workers, pensioners, shareholders, and small businesses--by \nreforming the rules governing venue in bankruptcy cases to combat forum \nshopping.\n  Quite simply, my bill will prevent corporate debtors from moving \ntheir\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\nbankruptcy cases thousands of miles away from the communities and their \nworkers who have the most at stake. And it will prevent bankrupt \ncorporations from effectively selecting the judge in their own cases--\nbecause picking the judge isn't far off from picking the verdict.\n  This Act is a positive step for fairness, responsibility, and \njustice. It implements a major recommendation from the October 1997 \nNational Bankruptcy Review Commission report, and earned the support of \nprominent bankruptcy law professors and practitioners nationwide. The \nbill is also supported by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott (R) and \nformer Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger (D); Brady C. \nWilliamson, who served as chairman of the National Bankruptcy Review \nCommission; and major national bankruptcy organizations like the \nNational Association of Credit Management and the Commercial Law League \nof America.\n  With the introduction of this Act, this body will now have an \nopportunity to consider this growing crisis, which effects so many \nconsumers and workers, just as we are about to examine the issue of \ncomprehensive bankruptcy reform.\n  Sadly, our current bankruptcy venue law has become a target for \nenormous abuse. It's a problem that is well documented by academics, \nmost recently in a comprehensive book published just last week by UCLA \nLaw Professor Lynn M. LoPucki, as well as by Harvard Law Professor \nElizabeth Warren, who served as the reporter for the National \nBankruptcy Review Commission, and Professor Jay L. Westbrook of the \nUniversity of Texas Law School.\n  I have personal experience with the worst kind of forum shopping. \nDuring my service to the State of Texas as Attorney General, I argued \nthat the Enron Federal bankruptcy court proceedings should be litigated \nin Houston. That seemed like the common sense argument, of course--\nafter all, Houston was where the majority of employees and others who \nwere victimized by that corporate scandal called home.\n  Yet that's not where the case ended up. Instead, Enron was able to \nexploit a key loophole in bankruptcy law to maneuver their proceedings \nas far away from Houston as possible. They ended up in their desired \nforum in New York. See In re Enron Corp., 274 B.R. 327 (S.D.N.Y. Bankr. \n2002).\n  Enron used the place of incorporation of one of its small \nsubsidiaries in order to file a bankruptcy claim in New York, and then \nused that smaller claim as the basis for shifting all of its much \nlarger bankruptcy proceedings into that same court. The company had \n7,500 employees in the Houston headquarters, but they filed for \nbankruptcy in New York, where Enron had only 57 employees.\n  This kind of blatant forum shopping makes a mockery of our laws. The \ncommon-sense legislation that I've introduced today will combat such \negregious forum shopping by requiring that corporate debtors file where \ntheir principal place of business or principal assets are located, \nrather than their state of incorporation, and forbidding parent \ncompanies from manipulating the venue by filing first through a \nsubsidiary.\n  Bankruptcy venue abuse is not just bad for our legal system; it hurts \nAmerica's consumers, creditors, workers, pensioners, shareholders, and \nsmall businesses. Under current law, corporate debtors effectively get \nto pick the court in which they will file for bankruptcy. As a result, \ncreditors can be forced to litigate far away from the real-world \nlocation, where costs and inconveniences associated with travel are \nprohibitive.\n  This troubling loophole also serves to unfairly enable corporate \ndebtors to evade their financial commitments. It badly disables \nconsumers, creditors, workers, pensioners, shareholders, and small \nbusinesses from pursuing and receiving reasonable compensation from \nbankruptcy proceedings.\n  Current law allows debtors to forum shop and thereby to pick \njurisdictions likely to rule in their favor. If debtors get to pick the \njurisdiction, then bankruptcy judges have a disturbing incentive to \ncompete with other bankruptcy courts for major bankruptcy cases, by \ntilting their rulings in favor of corporate debtors and their \nattorneys.\n  The examples are numerous. Here are three of the most prominent \nincidents: Polaroid. In October 2001, Boston-based Polaroid filed for \nbankruptcy in Delaware, listing assets at $1.9 billion. Polaroid's top \nexecutives claimed that the company was a ``melting ice cube,'' and \narranged a hasty sale for $465 million to a single bidder. The court \nrefused to hear testimony as to the true value of the company and \nclosed the sale in only 70 days. The top executives went to work for \nthe new buyer and received millions of dollars in stock. Meanwhile, \ndisabled employees had their health-care coverage canceled. The so-\ncalled ``melting ice cube'' became profitable the day after the sale \nbecame final.\n  K-Mart. In January 2002, failed top executives delivered Michigan-\nbased K-Mart to the bankruptcy court in Chicago, which reportedly had \nbeen actively soliciting large corporate debtors to file there. With a \nworkforce of 225,000, K-Mart had more employees than any company that \nhad ever filed bankrupt nationwide. The Chicago judge let the failed \nexecutives take tens of millions of dollars in bonuses, perks, and loan \nforgiveness. Bankruptcy lawyers also profited, pocketing nearly $140 \nmillion in legal fees. But some 43,000 creditors received only about \nten cents on the dollar.\n  Worldcom. Worldcom perpetrated one of the biggest accounting frauds \nin history, inflating its income by $9 billion. Although based in \nMississippi, Worldcom followed Enron into the New York bankruptcy \ncourt, where its managers received the same lenient treatment. No \ntrustee was appointed; indeed, five months after the case was filed, \nthe directors in office when the fraud occurred still constituted a \nmajority of the board. They chose their own successors. A Top Worldcom \nexecutive used money taken from the company to build an exempt Texas \nhomestead, and Worldcom took no action. That executive then used the \nhomestead to buy his way out of his problems with the SEC. Meanwhile, \ncreditors--mostly bondholders--lost $20 billion.\n  This is not the first time we have addressed this important issue. \nThe House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law \nheld a hearing on July 21, 2004, entitled ``Administration of Large \nBusiness Bankruptcy Reorganizations: Has Competition for Big Cases \nCorrupted the Bankruptcy System?,'' and Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) \nhas previously led efforts to champion bankruptcy venue reform in the \nHouse. During the 107th Congress, Senator Durbin introduced S. 2798, \nthe Employee Abuse Prevention Act of 2002, joined by Senators Kennedy, \nKerry, Leahy, and Rockefeller, while Congressman William D. Delahunt \n(D-MA) introduced the same bill in the House; section 205 of that \nlegislation would have reformed bankruptcy venue law.\n  I believe we must take steps to respond to this important problem. \nThe American people deserve better from our legal system. All \nbankruptcy cases deserve to be handled fairly and justly, and no \ncorporate debtor should be allowed to escape responsibility by fleeing \nto another venue. It is high time that we take up this much-needed \nreform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Attorney General of Texas,\n\n                                     Austin, TX, February 2, 2005.\n     Re Fairness in Bankruptcy Litigation Act of 2005.\n\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I support your important initiative to \n     prohibit opportunistic forum shopping by corporate debtors.\n       As you know firsthand from your tenure as Attorney General \n     of Texas during the State's involvement in the Enron \n     bankruptcy proceedings, such unsavory court-shopping truly \n     harms innumerable parties--large and small alike. Far too \n     often, corporate debtors file for bankruptcy in a far-flung \n     district solely because of their incorporation in the state \n     where that district is located.\n       Your proposal to amend 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1408--the aptly named \n     Fairness in Bankruptcy Litigation Act--would prevent this \n     unseemly practice. As you know, bankruptcy forum shopping can \n     adversely impact not just states and state agencies, but \n     countless consumers, creditors, employees, pensioners, \n     stockholders, and small businesses that are regularly \n     thwarted from protecting their interests simply because the \n     debtor filed in a distant forum.\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\n       The venue stratagems used by large law firms to maximize \n     their professional fees, render far-away courts inaccessible \n     to scores of unsecured creditors, and select compliant, \n     debtor-friendly judges undermine the credibility of our \n     nation's bankruptcy system. Indeed, after two years of public \n     hearings, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission \n     recommended that Congress overhaul the law to prevent forum \n     shopping by large Chapter 11 debtors and their affiliates. I \n     strongly support their recommendation and applaud you for \n     bringing this urgent matter to the attention of the United \n     State Senate.\n       Abusive forum shopping by corporate debtors harms Americans \n     from all walks of life.

While forum shopping and court \n     competition are having a direct, adverse effect on the \n     governance and reorganization of large, public companies, \n     investors are feeling that effect in their returns; employees \n     and unions in the abrogation of collectively bargained \n     contracts and economic security; competitors in the loss of a \n     level playing field; consumers and creditors in the loss of \n     basic rights; and Attorneys General in the loss of power to \n     be heard and to protect the rights of constituents and state \n     public policy.\n       For the past decade, most bankrupt large public companies \n     have ``forum shopped'' their cases to the bankauptcy courts \n     in Wilmington, Delaware and New York City. For a time, that \n     was generally thought to be advantageous. But events in Enron \n     and other cases have shown otherwise. The shopping benefited \n     bankruptcy professionals who worked in those cases by \n     enabling them to charge higher fees and by freeing them from \n     some restrictions on conflicts of interest. The shopping also \n     benefited executives of some of those companies by allowing \n     them to hang onto their jobs longer and in some cases even be \n     paid large ``retention bonuses.''\n       But the effect of forum shopping on the companies--and \n     hence on the shareholders and bondholders who invested in \n     them--has been decidedly negative. According to major studies \n     and the empirical research of experts like Professor Lynn \n     LoPucki of UCLA law school, companies reorganized in the \n     Delaware and New York courts in the early and mid-1990s \n     failed at a rate more than double the rate for companies \n     reorganized in other courts. As other courts copied Delaware \n     in an effort to staunch their outflow of cases, the failure \n     rates for those courts' reorganizations skyrocketed to match \n     Delaware's rates. To confirm a plan, the Bankruptcy Code \n     requires that the court find that ``confirmation . . . is not \n     likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for \n     further financial reorganization of the debtor.'' But of the \n     43 largest public companies reorganized in U.S. Bankruptcy \n     Courts from 1997 through 2000--the most recent period for \n     which failure rates can be calculated--21 (49%) were back in \n     bankruptcy within five years. Historically, the failure rates \n     for big reorganization in non-competing courts have been \n     below 10%.\n       Legislative action can address this problem in a common \n     sense, fair, simple and direct way, by requiring bankrupt \n     companies file in their local bankruptcy courts. By local \n     courts, I mean the courts in the cities where the companies \n     have their headquarters or their principal operations. This \n     will free judges from the pressures to compete with other \n     courts for cases, and enable them to return to the crucial \n     function for which they were appointed: to protect \n     shareholders, creditors, employees, suppliers, customers and \n     the companies themselves during the brief but often frantic \n     period between the failure of one corporate regime and its \n     replacement with another. It will also ensure that these \n     judges and courts hear from everyone affected and entitled to \n     be heard--not only those who can afford to travel or appear \n     in ``foreign'' courts, especially the public's lawyers, the \n     Attorneys General. It is not a panacea for economic \n     insecurity, and it changes no legal rights or duties or law. \n     But it will cure a major inequity and a loophole utilized \n     primarily to ``game'' the system. Enactment of this bill, or \n     a similar legislative amendment, will enable us to say: ``We \n     had a problem, and now we have fixed it.''\n     Scott Harshbarger.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Commercial Law League\n\n\n                                      of America ',\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: The Commercial Law League of America \n     (``CLLA''), founded in 1895, is the Nation's oldest \n     organization of attorneys and other experts in credit and \n     finance actively engaged in the field of commercial law, \n     bankruptcy and reorganization. Its membership exceeds 3,500 \n     individuals. The CLLA has long been associated with the \n     representation of creditor interests, while at the same time \n     seeking fair, equitable and efficient administration of \n     bankruptcy cases for all parties in interest.\n       The Bankruptcy Section of the CLLA is made up of \n     approximately 1,100 bankruptcy lawyers and bankruptcy judges \n     from virtually every State in the United States. Its members \n     include practitioners with both small and large practices, \n     who represent divergent interests in bankruptcy cases. The \n     CLLA has testified on numerous occasions before Congress as \n     experts in the bankruptcy and reorganization fields.\n       A principal concern of the CLLA is the need for an \n     amendment requiring that the domicile and residence for venue \n     of corporate debtors be conclusively presumed to be the \n     location of the debtor's principal place of business without \n     regard to the debtor's state of incorporation. Such a change \n     would benefit creditors and prevent an unacceptable degree of \n     forum shopping by debtors who are in search of a venue that \n     will be friendly to their needs. More important, however, \n     requiring that a corporate bankruptcy take place locally \n     ensures that the distinct needs of the community are not \n     overlooked.\n       Allowing the practice of forum shopping by debtors \n     undermines the bankruptcy process and creates unwarranted \n     competition among the courts. Before filing, the debtor is \n     able to determine which courts have taken friendly views of \n     the debtor's particular needs and select such a court with \n     the intent of creating a disadvantage for creditors. Indeed, \n     some corporate debtors have even commenced bankruptcy cases \n     in preferred venues by strategically creating or using \n     otherwise healthy subsidiaries to create a basis for filing \n     in the intended court. Current law as written fosters these \n     abuses.\n       The CLLA strongly supports passage of the Fairness in \n     Bankruptcy Litigation Act of 2005 (the ``Act'') since the \n     proposed legislation addresses these abuses. The Act will \n     help to eliminate the forum shopping that skews the \n     bankruptcy process and will foster greater local control over \n     important business and community decisions. Although the Act \n     may require some technical modifications to achieve and \n     address the legislation's purported goals, its overall \n     provisions and goals are well grounded and supported by the \n     abuses taking place within the bankruptcy system.\n       Much has been said among members of Congress that \n     bankruptcy reform is necessary to prevent what it perceives \n     as abuse of the bankruptcy process. A venue provision that \n     requires corporate bankruptcies to be filed at the principal \n     place of business furthers that goal and for all these \n     reasons we encourage the passage of the Act at the earliest \n     opportunity.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Mary K. Whitmer,\n       President.\n     Jay L. Welford,\n       Co-Chair, National Governmental Affairs Committee.\n     Peter C. Califano,\n       Chair, Legislative Committee, Bankruptcy Section.\n     Alan I. Nahmias,\n       Chair, Bankruptcy Section.\n     Judith Greenstone Miller,\n       Co-Chair, National Governmental Affairs Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                                 January 31, 2005.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     617 Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: Since its inception, the central \n     promise of the Federal bankruptcy system is that all \n     creditors--large and small--have equal access to participate \n     in the judicially-supervised liquidation or reorganization of \n     the debtor. No bankruptcy will be run to benefit one group of \n     creditors over another, or to permit the debtor to escape \n     from close scrutiny after its financial collapse.\n       Unfortunately, that promise has been significantly eroded. \n     Mega-companies and their counsel shop for courts that will \n     render decisions that may favor the debtor, the attorneys or \n     a small group of powerful creditors. These parties often file \n     the bankruptcy petitions in locations far distant from most \n     of the company's business and from most of its creditors, \n     including its workers, retirees and local trade creditors who \n     have made their own investments in the company.\n       Forum shopping creates an advantage for the insiders, while \n     making it virtually impossible for small creditors to \n     participate in the bankruptcy process. Employees, pensioners, \n     trade creditors and others have claims that are important to \n     them, but that are not large enough to justify millions of \n     dollars in lawyers' fees or trips to distant locations. As a \n     result, many of these smaller parties are shut out of the \n     system. They literally cannot get to the courthouse.\n       Bankruptcy courts around the country are capable of \n     handling the cases that come their way--large or small. The \n     judges are smart and thoughtful, and the court personnel are \n     dedicated and hard-working. No\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\n     single court in this country, regardless of its experience, \n     should have an exclusive lock on dealing with big cases. No \n     court has special powers or unique skills to deal with the \n     questions of claims, property of the estate, financing, \n     fraud, attorneys' fees and so on--issues that can arise in \n     any case, regardless of size.\n       The current system of court shopping harms too many \n     parties. Closing a loophole in the bankruptcy laws that \n     permits this unseemly practice and forcing companies in \n     trouble to subject themselves to the scrutiny of their local \n     courts and local creditors is an important step toward \n     strengthening the credibility of the bankruptcy system. The \n     reform embodied in your proposal is real reform. If a company \n     prospers in part because it draws on the strength of the \n     community where it operates, that same community should be \n     able to participate fully in its financial reorganization.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Elizabeth Warren,\n     Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    School of Law,\n\n\n                            The University of Texas at Austin,\n\n                                  Austin, Texas, February 6, 2005.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: There is no single reform of our \n     Chapter 11 system that is as important as ensuring an end to \n     the forum shopping that has so distorted that system in \n     recent years. The present venue rules are so loosely \n     constructed that they permit any large public' company to \n     file a Chapter 11 pretty much wherever it likes. Naturally, \n     the management of companies in financial trouble and the \n     professionals that advise them take advantage of those rules \n     to choose the forum that will best serve their interests. \n     Often that means a Chapter 11 filing in a courthouse far away \n     from the company's home.\n       These rules permit the company's management to escape the \n     close scrutiny of intensely interested local media and to \n     avoid attendance at court hearings by employees, local \n     suppliers, and others vitally interested in the case and \n     knowledgeable about the company. They force smaller creditors \n     to file claims from afar, claims that are often the subject \n     of an arbitrary objection by the debtor that the distant \n     creditor cannot afford to litigate. Conversely, creditors who \n     received some payment before bankruptcy may be the subject of \n     long-distance preference attacks that they cannot properly \n     defend in a remote courthouse, especially if the amounts \n     involved, although substantial, are not enough to justify the \n     expense of a defense. Compounding the problem of expense is \n     the creditor's lack of knowledge of lawyers in the distant \n     forum and the risk, especially in Delaware, that in a big \n     case most experienced local lawyers will already be committed \n     to other clients. On top of these direct injuries to \n     creditors, in cases where a trustee in bankruptcy is \n     appointed, the administration of assets hundreds or thousands \n     of miles removed from the trustee's home cannot be done \n     efficiently and rarely can be done well.\n       These and other effects of forum shopping are inefficient \n     and prejudicial. In addition, the present system imposes \n     subtle pressures on bankruptcy judges and district judges, \n     who cannot be unaware that their decisions as to venue will \n     determine whether the community and the local bar will be \n     greatly enriched by the administration of large bankruptcy \n     cases. Despite the high degree of professionalism on our \n     federal bench, it is not reasonable to expect that these \n     pressures will have no effect.\n       Although I am expressing my own opinions and not speaking \n     for the University or the Law School, I write as someone who \n     has practiced, studied, taught, and written about bankruptcy \n     law for over thirty years.

This legislation will not only provide protection for \n     all parties to large, public company bankruptcies, it will \n     also protect honest bankruptcy judges from the pressures \n     arising from the necessity to compete for cases. My research \n     suggests that by ending the necessity for the courts to \n     compete for cases, this legislation will result in better \n     reorganizations, the preservation of jobs, and higher returns \n     to creditors and shareholders.\n       This is a difficult issue to present to the public, because \n     it is both obscure and complex. Please be assured that I and \n     many others appalled by the competition will do whatever we \n     can to assist you.\n           Yours truly,\n     Lyan M. LoPucki\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I am writing to you to support your \n     effort to pass a bill that would prevent corporations from \n     shopping for the most favorable venue. The current practice \n     has resulted in a ``race to the bottom'' as bankruptcy courts \n     work hard to lure corporate bankruptcies to their courts.\n       I was a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City \n     School of Law for almost 20 years. My own worst example is \n     the case of Birch Telecom, a Kansas City-based company that \n     filed in Delaware in 2002. After laying off a quarter of \n     their employees--citizens of Missouri, Kansas, and Texas--\n     Birch went into bankruptcy with a prepared plan (known as a \n     ``pre-pack'') that included significant compensation for the \n     very officers who had led the company into bankruptcy.\n       A bankruptcy judge from Texas, sitting by designation \n     (because of the volume of cases being filed in Delaware) had \n     the audacity to suggest that he might not approve the plan \n     because of the compensation package. Before his words were \n     out of his mouth, Birch Telecom's attorneys had appealed the \n     reference of the case to that judge. The case was withdrawn, \n     and a Delaware judge, who understood that the game is \n     appeasing the corporate debtors, approved the plan 13 days \n     later.\n       What possible chance do employees and local creditors have \n     when a distant bankruptcy judge will rubber-stamp the \n     company's every request, in a court too far away for them \n     even to appear?\n       Congress says that it is trying to stop bankruptcy abuse. \n     Venue shopping is the very worst example of bankruptcy abuse, \n     and it affects the lives of thousands of ordinary Americans--\n     employees and small businesses--every single day.\n       I wish you good luck in the passage of this important piece \n     of legislation.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                   Corinne Cooper,\n     Professor Emerita of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Creel & Moore, L.L.P.,\n\n\n                                     Attorneys and Counselors,\n\n                                     Dallas, TX, February 4, 2005.\n     Re proposed bankruptcy legislation/venue.\n\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: One of the issues being discussed in \n     connection with proposed bankruptcy legislation is in what \n     venue or venues is it most appropriate for business debtors \n     to initiate voluntary bankruptcy cases, where they conduct \n     their daily business or where they were incorporated.\n       Because a corporation (or any other type of business \n     organization) seeking bankruptcy relief should do so in a \n     forum that is convenient for itself, its management, its \n     employees and its creditors, Section 1408 of Title 28 of the \n     U.S. Code should be amended to prohibit the right of a debtor \n     corporation to file in the state of its incorporation unless \n     it either has its principal place of business or its \n     principal assets in that state.\n       The reason for requiring a debtor to seek relief in a \n     bankruptcy court nearest to its actual place of operation is \n     that, otherwise, the rights of the other parties are \n     significantly and adversely affected because of the distance, \n     delay and costs of dealing with a faraway court.\n       The practice that has developed over the years is that \n     corporations, for example those created under the laws of \n     Delaware, file in Delaware, far from their actual places of \n     business, Texas for example, thus causing their management, \n     employees and creditors to have the burden and expense of \n     travel, to hire distant counsel with whom they have had no \n     prior experience, or both, in order to protect their \n     interests. Many times, at least from a creditor/employee \n     perspective, the inconvenience and expense, when balanced \n     against the probability of an insignificant recovery on a \n     claim, is such that creditors/employees simply abandon their \n     claims, a result which is contrary to the spirit and intent \n     of the Bankruptcy Code.\n       As a bankruptcy practitioner for over 40 years and one who \n     is active in various bankruptcy organizations, I urge you and \n     your staff to consider the thoughts expressed in their \n     letter.\n       As the grandfather of Richie Anderson who served as an \n     intern on your staff last summer, I know, from his \n     experience, that you will listen to the opinions of your \n     constituents.\n           Yours very truly,\n     L.

John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator Cornyn:  I write in support of reform of the \n     Bankruptcy Code's current venue provisions.\n       I am twenty-three year bankruptcy practitioner and head of \n     the bankruptcy practice for our law firm, I additionally \n     serve as Vice President (Business Bankruptcy) of the \n     Bankruptcy Section of the State Bar of Texas and am national \n     co-chair of the Unsecured Trade Creditors' Committee of the \n     American Bankruptcy Institute. My practice, while focused in \n     Texas, brings me before courts throughout the country--\n     particularly those in Delaware and New York.\n       Practicing in Texas, I have personal experience with the \n     unfortunate practice of companies and their counsel shopping \n     for forums. Whether to escape the watchful eye of employees, \n     creditors or the press, numerous companies from around the \n     country have filed bankruptcy cases in the District of\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\n     Delaware or the Southern District of New York to obtain what \n     they believed would be either favorable treatment or a venue \n     for their bankruptcy cases which would in large measure \n     frustrate the rights and interests of their creditors and \n     employees. It is for these reasons, among others, that I \n     strongly support a modification of the Bankruptcy Venue \n     Statute and urge prompt action.\n       If I can be of any assistance to you, please do not \n     hesitate to call upon me.

John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: As a bankruptcy practitioner for some \n     25 years, I am writing to voice my support for an amendment \n     to the venue provisions of Section 1408 of Title 28, United \n     States Code. As has been well documented, the concept of \n     ``forum shopping'' by significant Chapter 11 Debtors \n     throughout the country has become an art form over the last \n     few years. Certain jurisdictions now actively campaign to \n     attract large, high-profile bankruptcy cases to their venue. \n     It goes without saying that bankruptcy judges must become \n     ``Debtor friendly'' in order to maintain the attractiveness \n     of these venue options. Accordingly, decisions relating to \n     the allowance of professional fees, conflicts and other \n     critical bankruptcy issues have become disparate throughout \n     the country.\n       An amendment to Section 1408, which limits the use of the \n     state of incorporation to those instances where the Debtors' \n     principal place of business or principal assets reside, will \n     promote uniformity as well as removing some of the perceived \n     inequities in the system. The public's perception of a fair \n     and uniform bankruptcy system is paramount.\n       Thank you for your interest in this legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Russell L. Munsch.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Fulbright & Jaworski, L.L.P.,\n\n                                 Houston, Texas, February 7, 2005.\n     Re bankruptcy venue reform.\n\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I write you to express my strong \n     support for bankruptcy venue reform. By way of introduction, \n     I have been a partner in the bankruptcy section of Fulbright \n     & Jaworski since June 1, 2004. Prior to that, I served as a \n     United States Bankruptcy Judge in Houston for almost 17 \n     years, resigning as Chief Judge a day before I joined \n     Fulbright.\n       Over the many years of my judicial career, I watched as \n     many cases which should have been filed in Texas instead \n     found their way to the dockets of courts in Delaware, New \n     York, or some other distant jurisdiction. This migration of \n     large cases is not unique to Texas and it represents a \n     fundamental flaw in the perceived and actual fairness of the \n     bankruptcy system. The ``little people'' (small creditors, \n     former employees, etc.) in a large bankruptcy case are at \n     once the most vulnerable economically and the parties least \n     capable of participating in a distant forum.\n       I firmly feel the integrity of today's bankruptcy system \n     requires that the rights of all involved be protected and \n     that fair access to court be ensured. Bankruptcy venue reform \n     would be a tremendous step toward rectifying these problems.\n       The opinions expressed in this letter are my own and not \n     those of Fulbright & Jaworski or its clients. I appreciate \n     your consideration of my concerns. If you should have any \n     questions or need additional information or assistance from \n     me, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     William Greendyke.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 31, 2005.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Credit Management (NACM), I am writing to express the \n     support of NACM National Board of Directors and the NACM \n     membership for the Venue in Bankruptcy Cases bill scheduled \n     to be introduced by Senator Cornyn. This important \n     legislation would provide enormous relief to the thousands of \n     business creditors, and most importantly to small business \n     creditors whose interests are routinely impaired by a \n     bankruptcy process that is long-overdue for change.\n       NACM is a 22,000-member trade association, representing the \n     interests of corporate (commercial) credit executives. NACM \n     was founded in 1896 and represents both American business \n     credit professionals in all 50 states as well as business \n     credit executives in more than 30 countries worldwide. NACM's \n     mission is to ensure the constant improvement and enhancement \n     of the business trade credit profession and process.\n       NACM's membership comprises all types of businesses: \n     manufacturers, wholesalers, service industries, and financial \n     institutions. NACM's members range in size from small \n     businesses to a majority of the Fortune 500. NACM members \n     make the daily decisions to extend unsecured, business and \n     trade credit from one company to another. NACM members--the \n     business credit executive--approve and provide billions of \n     dollars each day in business and trade credit, which fuels \n     this country's business economy.\n       This bill would provide much needed relief to businesses \n     and--perhaps even more importantly--to small businesses. This \n     bill would provide relief to the current practice of \n     requesting a transfer of venue, which is both expensive and \n     time consuming to both the debtor's estate and to creditors. \n     Additionally, this bill would address any abuse that \n     currently exists in the Code that encourages ``shopping'' \n     cases into a ``friendly forum''.\n       Our membership stands ready to provide whatever level of \n     support is needed to advance this important legislation. As \n     the national organization representing the decision makers \n     within the American economic model who drive commerce, we \n     hope you will ensure that Congressional leadership will take \n     action on this bill as expeditiously as possible.\n       We must provide immediate relief to the small business that \n     simply cannot afford to wait any longer for bankruptcy reform \n     from Congress.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our comments and please \n     let us know what we can do to assist you in advancing this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Robin Schausell, CAE,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 315. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat reimbursements for costs of using passenger automobiles for \ncharitable and other organizations are excluded from gross income, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation \ntoday that would increase the mileage reimbursement rate for \nvolunteers.\n  Under current law, when volunteers use their cars for charitable \npurposes, the volunteers may be reimbursed up to 14 cents per mile for \ntheir donated services without triggering a tax consequence for either \nthe organization or the volunteers. If the charitable organization \nreimburses any more than that, they are required to file an information \nreturn indicating the amount, and the volunteers must include the \namount over 14 cents per mile in their taxable income. By contrast, the \nmileage reimbursement level currently permitted for businesses is 40.5 \ncents per mile.\n  We are asking volunteers and volunteer organizations to bear a \ngreater burden of delivering essential services. But the 14 cents per \nmile limit is posing a very real hardship for charitable organizations \nand other nonprofit groups. I have heard from a number of people in \nWisconsin on the need to increase this reimbursement limit.\n  A representative of one organization, the Portage County Department \non Aging, explained just how important volunteer drivers are to their \nability to provide services to seniors in that county. The Department \non Aging reported that dozens of volunteer drivers delivered meals to \nhomes and transported people to medical appointments, meal sites, and \nother essential services.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the senior meals program is one of the \nmost vital services provided under the Older Americans Act, and \nensuring that meals can be delivered to seniors or that seniors can be \ntaken to meal sites is an essential part of that program. \nUnfortunately, Federal support for the senior nutrition programs has \nstagnated in recent years. This has increased pressure on local \nprograms to leverage more volunteer services to make up for lagging \nFederal support. The 14 cents per mile reimbursement limit, though, \nincreasingly poses a barrier to obtaining those contributions. Portage \nCounty reports that many of their volunteers cannot afford to offer \ntheir services under such a restriction. And if volunteers cannot be \nfound, their services will have to be replaced by contracting with a \nprovider, greatly increasing costs to the Department, costs that come \ndirectly out of the pot of funds available to pay for meals and other \nservices.\n  And the same is true for thousands of other non-profit and charitable \norganizations that provide essential services to communities across our \nNation.\n  By contrast, businesses do not face this restrictive mileage \nreimbursement limit. The comparable mileage rate for someone who works \nfor a business is currently 40.5  cents per mile. This disparity means \nthat a business hired to deliver the same meals delivered by\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\nvolunteers for Portage County may reimburse their employees over double \nthe amount permitted the volunteer without a tax consequence.\n\n  This doesn't make sense. The 14 cents per mile volunteer \nreimbursement limit is badly outdated. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, Congress first set a reimbursement rate of 12 cents \nper mile as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, and did not \nincrease it until 1997, when the level was raised slightly, to 14 cents \nper mile, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  The bill I am introducing today is identical to a measure I \nintroduced in the 107th Congress and the 108th Congress in nearly every \nrespect. It raises the limit on volunteer mileage reimbursement to the \nlevel permitted to businesses. It is essentially the same provision \npassed by the Senate as part of a tax bill in 1999, and it is \nessentially the same provision that passed the Senate as part of the \nCARE Act.\n  At the time of the 1999 tax bill, the Joint Committee on Taxation \n(JCT) estimated that the mileage reimbursement provision would result \nin the loss of $1 million over the five-year fiscal period from 1999 to \n2004. The revenue loss was so small that the JCT did not make the \nestimate on a year by year basis.\n  Though the revenue loss is small, it is vital that we do everything \nwe can to move toward a balanced budget, and to that end I have \nincluded a provision to fully offset the cost of the measure and make \nit deficit neutral. That provision increases the criminal monetary \npenalties for individuals and corporations convicted of tax fraud. The \nprovision passed the Senate in the 108th Congress as part of the JOBS \nbill, but was later dropped in conference and was not included in the \nfinal version of that bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It will help ensure \ncharitable organizations can continue to attract the volunteers that \nplay such a critical role in helping to deliver services and it will \nsimplify the tax code both for nonprofit groups and the volunteers \nthemselves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to limit authority to delay notice of search warrants; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will reintroduce in the Senate \nthe Reasonable Notice and Search Act. This bill is nearly identical to \na bill I introduced in the 108th Congress, S. 1701. It addresses \nSection 213 of the USA-PATRIOT Act, the provision of that important \nstatute passed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks that has caused perhaps \nthe most concern among Members of Congress and the public. Section 213, \nsometimes referred to as the ``delayed notice search provision'' or the \n``sneak and peek provision,'' authorizes the government in limited \ncircumstances to conduct a search without immediately serving a search \nwarrant on the owner or occupant of the premises that have been \nsearched.\n  Prior to the PATRIOT Act, secret searches for physical evidence were \nperformed in some jurisdictions under the authority of Court of Appeals \ndecisions, but the Supreme Court never definitively ruled whether they \nwere constitutional. Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act authorized delayed \nnotice warrants in any case in which an ``adverse result'' would occur \nif the warrant were served before the search was executed. Adverse \nresult was defined as including: 1. endangering the life or physical \nsafety of an individual; 2. flight from prosecution; 3. destruction of \nor tampering with evidence; 4. intimidation of potential witnesses; or \n5. otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying \na trial. This last catch-all category could apply in virtually any \ncriminal case. In addition, while some courts had required the service \nof the warrant within a specified period of time, the PATRIOT Act \nsimply required that the warrant specify that it would be served within \na ``reasonable'' period of time after the search.\n  It is interesting to note that this provision of the PATRIOT Act was \nnot limited to terrorism cases. In fact, before the PATRIOT Act passed, \nthe FBI already had the authority to conduct secret searches of foreign \nterrorists and spies with no notice at all under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. Furthermore, the PATRIOT Act ``sneak and \npeek'' authority was not made subject to the sunset provision that will \ncause many of the new surveillance provisions of the act to expire at \nthe end of this year unless Congress reenacts them. So Section 213 was \npretty clearly a provision that the Department of Justice wanted \nregardless of the terrorism threat after 9/11.\n  Perhaps that is why this provision has caused such controversy since \nit was passed. In 2003, by a wide bipartisan margin, the House passed \nan amendment to the Commerce-Justice-\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\nState appropriations bill offered by Representative Otter from Idaho, a \nRepublican, to stop funding for delayed notice searches authorized \nunder section 213. The size of the vote took the Department by \nsurprise, and it immediately set out to defend the provision \naggressively. Clearly, this is a power that the Department does not \nwant to lose.\n\n  I raised concerns about the sneak and peek provision when it was \nincluded in the PATRIOT Act. I did not, and still do not, believe there \nhad been adequate study and analysis of the justifications for these \nsearches and the potential safeguards that might be included. I did not \nargue then, however, and I am not arguing now that there should be no \ndelayed notice searches at all and that the provision should be \nrepealed. I simply believe that this provision should be modified to \nprotect against abuse. My bill will do four things to accomplish this.\n  First, my bill would narrow the circumstances in which a delayed \nnotice warrant can be granted to the following: potential loss of life, \nflight from prosecution, destruction or tampering with evidence, or \nintimidation of potential witnesses. The ``catch-all provision'' in \nsection 213, allowing a secret search when serving the warrant would \n``seriously jeopardize an investigation or unduly delay a trial'' can \ntoo easily be turned into permission to do these searches whenever the \ngovernment wants.\n  Second, I believe that any delayed notice warrant should provide for \na specific and limited time period within which notice must be given--7 \ndays. This is consistent with some of the pre-PATRIOT Act court \ndecisions and will help to bring this provision in closer accord with \nthe Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Under my bill, prosecutors \nwill be permitted to seek 7-day extensions if circumstances continue to \nwarrant that the subject not be made aware of the search. But the \ndefault should be a week, unless a court is convinced that more time \nshould be permitted.\n  Third, Section 213 should include a sunset provision so that it \nexpires along with the other expanded surveillance provisions in Title \nII of the PATRIOT Act, at the end of 2005. This will allow Congress to \ndetermine if the balance between civil liberties and law enforcement \nhas been correctly struck.\n  Finally, the bill requires a public report on the number of times \nthat section 213 is used, the number of times that extensions are \nsought beyond the 7-day notice period, and the type of crimes being \ninvestigated with this power. This information will help the public and \nCongress evaluate the need for this authority and determine whether it \nshould be retained or modified after the sunset.\n  These are reasonable and moderate changes to the law. They do not gut \nthe provision. Rather, they recognize the growing and legitimate \nconcern from across the political spectrum that this provision was \npassed in haste and presents the potential for abuse. They also send a \nmessage that Fourth Amendment rights have meaning and potential \nviolations of those rights should be minimized if at all possible. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 316\n\n  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \nUnited States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect privacy by limiting the access of the \nGovernment to library, bookseller, and other personal records for \nforeign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will reintroduce the Library, \nBookseller, and Personal Records Privacy Act. The bill is identical to \nthe bill I introduced in the 108th Congress, S. 1507.\n  This bill would amend Sections 215 and 505 of the USA-PATRIOT Act to \nprotect the privacy of law-abiding Americans. It would set reasonable \nlimits on the Federal Government's access to library, bookseller, \nmedical, and other sensitive, personal information under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (``FISA'') and related foreign \nintelligence authority.\n  I am pleased that several of my distinguished colleagues have joined \nme as original cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  Millions of Patriotic Americans love our country and support our \nmilitary men and women in their difficult missions abroad, but worry \nabout the fate of our Constitution here at home.\n  Much of our Nation's strength comes from our constitutional liberties \nand respect for the rule of law. That is what has kept us free for our \ntwo and a quarter century history. Our constitutional freedoms, our \nAmerican values, are what make our country worth fighting for as we \nstrive to win the war on terror.\n  Here at home, there is no question that the FBI needs ample resources \nand legal authority to prevent future acts of terrorism. But the \nPATRIOT Act went too far when it comes to the government's access to \npersonal information about law abiding Americans.\n  Even though in the end I opposed the PATRIOT Act, there were many \nprovisions that I did support. And even in those provisions I sought to \namend when the bill was debated, there was often some change that I \nsupported. For example, Congress was right to expand the category of \nbusiness records that the FBI could obtain pursuant to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. Prior to the PATRIOT Act, the FBI could \nseek a court order to obtain only travel records--such as airline, \nhotel, and car rental records--and records maintained by storage \nfacilities. The PATRIOT Act allows any business records to be \nsubpoenaed. I don't quibble with that change.\n  But what my colleagues and I do find problematic--and an increasing \nnumber of Americans who value their privacy and First Amendment rights \nagree with us--is that the current law allows the FBI broad, almost \nunfettered access to personal information\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\nabout law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism or \nspying.\n\n  Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act requires the FBI to show in an \napplication to the court that the documents are ``sought for'' an \ninternational terrorism or foreign intelligence investigation. There is \nno requirement that the FBI make a showing of individualized suspicion \nthat the documents relate to a suspected terrorist or spy.\n  In other words, under current law, the FBI could serve a subpoena on \na library for all the borrowing records of its patrons or on a \nbookseller for the purchasing records of its customers simply by \nasserting that they want the records for a terrorism investigation.\n  Since the passage of the PATRIOT Act, librarians and booksellers have \nbecome increasingly concerned by the potential for abuse of this law. I \nwas pleased to stand with the American Booksellers Association and the \nFree Expression Network over 2 years ago when we first started to raise \nthese concerns.\n  Librarians and booksellers are concerned that under the PATRIOT Act, \nthe FBI could seize records from libraries and booksellers in order to \nmonitor what books Americans have purchased or borrowed, or who has \nused a library's or bookstore's internet computer stations, even if \nthere is no evidence that the person is a terrorist or spy, or has any \nconnection to a terrorist or spy.\n  These concerns are so strong that some librarians across the country \nhave taken the unusual step of destroying records of patrons' book and \ncomputer use, as well as posting signs on computer stations warning \npatrons that whatever they read or access on the internet could be \nmonitored by the federal government.\n  As a librarian in California said, ``We felt strongly that this had \nto be done. . . . The government has never had this kind of power \nbefore. It feels like Big Brother.''\n  And as the executive director of the American Library Association \nsaid, ``This law is dangerous. . . . I read murder mysteries--does that \nmake me a murderer? I read spy stories--does that mean I'm a spy? \nThere's no clear link between a person's intellectual pursuits and \ntheir actions.''\n  The American people do not know how many or what kind of requests \nFederal agents have made for library records under the PATRIOT Act. The \nJustice Department refuses to release that information to the public.\n  But in a survey released by the University of Illinois at Urbana-\nChampaign, about 550 libraries around the Nation reported having \nreceived requests from Federal or local law enforcement during the past \nyear. About half of the libraries said they complied with the law \nenforcement request, and another half indicated that they had not.\n  Americans don't know much about these incidents, because the law also \ncontains a provision that prohibits anyone who receives a subpoena from \ndisclosing that fact to anyone.\n  In testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Attorney General \nAshcroft stated that as of September 18, 2003, the Department of \nJustice had never used Section 215. The Department has not made that \nclaim in public testimony since then, leading many to speculate that \nthe provision has now been used. Whether it has been used once, or \ndozens of times, the problem with the section remains--it is too broad \nand does not permit adequate judicial supervision. There is a potential \nfor overreaching that Congress must address.\n  David Schwartz, president of Harry W. Schwartz Bookshops, the oldest \nand largest independent bookseller in Milwaukee, summed up well the \nAmerican values at stake when he said: ``The FBI already has \nsignificant subpoena powers to obtain records. There is no need for the \ngovernment to invade a person's privacy in this way. This is a uniquely \nun-American tool, and it should be rejected. The books we read are a \nvery private part of our lives. People could stop buying books, and \nthey could be terrified into silence.''\n  I would not claim that we have reached the point where people in this \ncountry are afraid to buy books, but section 215 is a tool that is \nunnecessarily broad. And it raises the specter of indiscriminate \ngovernment snooping into the private lives of innocent citizens, which \nis an unnecessary distraction from the serious law enforcement work \nthat is needed to fight terrorism.\n  It is time to reconsider those provisions of the PATRIOT Act that are \nun-American and, frankly, unpatriotic.\n  But my concerns with the PATRIOT Act go beyond library and bookseller \nrecords. Under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the FBI could seek any \nrecords maintained by a business. These business records could contain \nsensitive, personal information--for example, medical records \nmaintained by a doctor or hospital or credit records maintained by a \ncredit agency. All the FBI would have to do is simply assert that the \nrecords are ``sought for'' its terrorism or foreign intelligence \ninvestigation.\n  Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act goes too far. Americans rightfully \nhave a reasonable expectation of privacy in their library, bookstore, \nmedical, financial, or other records containing personal information. \nPrudent safeguards are needed to protect these legitimate privacy \ninterests.\n  The Library, Bookseller, and Personal Records Privacy Act is a \nreasonable solution. It would restore a pre-PATRIOT Act requirement \nthat the FBI make a factual, individualized showing that the records \nsought pertain to a suspected terrorist or spy while leaving in place \nother PATRIOT Act expansions of this business records power.\n  My bill will not prevent the FBI from doing its job. It recognizes \nthat the post-September 11 world is a different world. There are \ncircumstances when the FBI should legitimately have access to library, \nbookseller, or other personal information.\n  I'd like to take a moment to explain how the safeguard in my bill \nwould be applied. Suppose the FBI is conducting an investigation of an \ninternational terrorist organization. It has information that suspected \nmembers of the group live in a particular neighborhood. The FBI would \nlike to obtain records from the library in the suspects' neighborhood. \nUnder current law, the FBI could decide to ask the library for all \nrecords concerning anyone who has ever borrowed a book or used a \ncomputer, and what books were borrowed, simply by asserting that the \ndocuments are sought for a terrorism investigation. But under my bill, \nthe FBI could not do so. The FBI would have to set forth specific and \narticulable facts giving reason to believe that the person to whom the \nrecords pertain is a suspected terrorist. The FBI could obtain only \nthose library records--such as borrowing records or computer sign-in \nlogs--that pertain to the suspected terrorists. The FBI could not \nobtain library records concerning individuals who are not suspected \nterrorists.\n  So, under my bill, the FBI can still obtain documents that it \nlegitimately needs, but my bill would also protect the privacy of law-\nabiding Americans. I might add that if, as the Justice Department says, \nthe FBI is using its PATRIOT Act powers in a responsible manner, does \nnot seek the records of law-abiding Americans, and only seeks the \nrecords of suspected terrorists or suspected spies, then there is no \nreason for the Department to object to my bill.\n  The second part of my bill would address privacy concerns with \nanother Federal law enforcement power expanded by the PATRIOT Act--the \nFBI's national security letter authority. The FBI does not need court \napproval to use this power.\n  My bill would amend section 505 of the PATRIOT Act. Part of this \nsection relates to the production of records maintained by electronic \ncommunications providers. Libraries or bookstores with internet access \nfor customers could be deemed ``electronic communication providers'' \nand therefore be subject to a request by the FBI under its NSL \nauthority.\n  As I mentioned earlier, some librarians are so concerned about the \npotential for abuse by the FBI that they have taken matters into their \nown hands before the FBI knocks on their door. Some librarians have \nbegun shredding on a daily basis sign-in logs and other documents \nrelating to the public's use of library computer terminals to access \nthe internet.\n  Again, safeguards are needed to ensure that any individual who \naccesses the internet at a library or bookstore does not automatically \ngive up all expectations of privacy. Like the section\n\n[[Page S1133]]\n\n215 fix I've discussed, my bill would require an individualized showing \nby the FBI of how the records of internet usage maintained by a library \nor bookseller pertain to a suspected terrorist or spy.\n  Yes, the American people want the FBI to be focused on preventing \nterrorism. And, yes, it may make sense to make some changes to the law \nto allow the FBI access to the information that it needs to prevent \nterrorism. But we do not need to change the values that constitute who \nwe are as a Nation in order to protect ourselves from terrorism. We can \nprotect both our Nation and our privacy and civil liberties.\n  An increasing number of Americans are beginning to understand that \nthe PATRIOT Act went too far. Four States and over 350 cities and \ncounties across the country have now passed resolutions expressing \nopposition to the PATRIOT Act. And it's not just the Berkeleys and \nMadisons of this Nation, but other States and communities with strong \nconservative and libertarian values, such as Alaska and cities in \nMontana, that have passed such resolutions.\n  I have many concerns with the PATRIOT Act. I am not seeking to repeal \nit, in whole or in part. In this bill, my colleagues and I are only \nseeking to modify two provisions that pose serious potential for abuse.\n  The privacy of law-abiding Americans is at stake, along with their \nconfidence in their government. Congress should act to protect our \nprivacy and reassure our citizens. The Library, Bookseller, and \nPersonal Records Privacy Act bill is a reasonable approach to do just \nthat. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 317\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clarify conditions for the interceptions of \ncomputer trespass communications under the USA-PATRIOT Act; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Computer \nTrespass Clarification Act of 2005, which would amend and clarify \nsection 217 of the USA-PATRIOT Act. This bill is virtually identical to \na bill I introduced in the 108th Congress, S. 2783.\n  Section 217 of the PATRIOT Act addresses the interception of computer \ntrespass communications. This bill would modify existing law to more \naccurately reflect the intent of the provision, and also protect \nagainst invasions of privacy.\n  Section 217 was designed to permit law enforcement to assist computer \nowners who are subject to denial of service attacks or other episodes \nof hacking. The original Department of Justice draft of the bill that \nlater became the PATRIOT Act included this provision. A section by \nsection analysis provided by the Department on September 19, 2001, \nstated the following: ``Current law may not allow victims of computer \ntrespassing to request law enforcement assistance in monitoring \nunauthorized attacks as they occur. Because service providers often \nlack the expertise, equipment, or financial resources required to \nmonitor attacks themselves as permitted under current law, they often \nhave no way to exercise their rights to protect themselves from \nunauthorized attackers. Moreover, such attackers can target critical \ninfrastructures and engage in cyberterrorism. To correct this problem, \nand help to protect national security, the proposed amendments to the \nwiretap statute would allow victims of computer attacks to authorize \npersons `acting under color of law' to monitor trespassers on their \ncomputer systems in a narrow class of cases.''\n  I strongly supported the goal of giving computer system owners the \nability to call in law enforcement to help defend themselves against \nhacking. Including such a provision in the PATRIOT Act made a lot of \nsense. Unfortunately, the drafters of the provision made it much \nbroader than necessary, and refused to amend it at the time we debated \nthe bill in 2001. As a result, the law now gives the government the \nauthority to intercept communications by people using computers owned \nby others as long as they have engaged in some unauthorized activity on \nthe computer, and the owner gives permission for the computer to be \nmonitored--all without judicial approval.\n  Only people who have a ``contractual relationship'' with the owner \nallowing the use of a computer are exempt from the definition of a \ncomputer trespasser under section 217 of the PATRIOT Act. Many people--\nfor example, college students, patrons of libraries, Internet cafes or \nairport business lounges, and guests at hotels--use computers owned by \nothers with permission, but without a contractual relationship. They \ncould end up being the subject of government snooping if the owner of \nthe computer gives permission to law enforcement.\n  My bill would clarify that a computer trespasser is not someone who \nhas permission to use a computer by the owner or operator of that \ncomputer. It would bring the existing computer trespass provision in \nline with the purpose of section 217 as expressed in the Department of \nJustice's initial explanation of the provision. Section 217 was \nintended to target only a narrow class of people: Unauthorized\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\ncyberhackers. It was not intended to give the government the \nopportunity to engage in widespread surveillance of computer users \nwithout a warrant.\n  I should note that there is no specific evidence that the provision \nis being abused. But, of course, unless criminal charges are brought \nagainst someone as a result of such surveillance, there would never be \nany notice at all that the surveillance has taken place. The computer \nowner authorizes the surveillance, and the FBI carries it out. There is \nno warrant, no court proceeding, no opportunity even for the subject of \nthe surveillance to challenge the assertion of the owner that some \nunauthorized use of the computer has occurred.\n  My bill would modify the computer trespass provision in the following \nways to protect against abuse, while still maintaining its usefulness \nin cases of denial of service attacks and other forms of hacking.\n  First, it would require that the owner or operator of the protected \ncomputer authorizing the interception has been subject to ``an ongoing \npattern of communications activity that threatens the integrity or \noperation of such computer.'' In other words, the owner has to be the \ntarget of some kind of hacking.\n  Second, the bill limits the length of warrantless surveillance to 96 \nhours. This is twice as long as is allowed for an emergency wiretap. \nWith four days of surveillance, it should not be difficult for the \ngovernment to gather sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to obtain a \nwarrant if continued surveillance is necessary.\n  Finally, the bill would require the Attorney General to annually \nreport on the use of Section 217 to the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees. Section 217 is one of the provisions that is subject to the \nsunset provision in the PATRIOT Act and will expire at the end of 2005. \nWe in the Congress need to do more oversight of the use of this and \nother provisions of PATRIOT Act in order to evaluate their \neffectiveness.\n  The computer trespass provision now in the law as a result of section \n217 of the PATRIOT Act leaves open the possibility for significant and \nunnecessary invasions of privacy. The reasonable and modest changes to \nthe provision contained in this bill preserve the usefulness of the \nprovision for investigations of cyberhacking, but reduce the \npossibility of government abuse. We must continually seek to balance \nthe need for effective tools to fight crime and terrorism against the \ncivil liberties of our citizens. The Computer Trespass Clarification \nAct strikes the right balance, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 318\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the \namount of minimum allotments under the Projects for Assistance in \nTransition from Homelessness program; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend Senator \nKennedy to introduce a bill that will raise the minimum grant amounts \ngiven to States and territories under the PATH program. The PATH \nprogram provides services through formula grants of at least $300,000 \nto each State, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and $50,000 to \neligible U.S. territories. Subject to available appropriations, this \nbill will raise the minimum allotments to $600,000 to each State and \n$100,000 to eligible US territories.\n  When the PATH program was established in fiscal year 1991 as a \nformula grant program, Congress appropriated $33 million. That amount \nhas steadily increased over the years with Congress appropriating $55 \nmillion this past year. However, despite these increases, States and \nterritories such as New Mexico that have rural and frontier \npopulations, have not received an increase in their PATH funds. Under \nthe formula, as it currently exists, many states and territories will \nnever receive an increase to their PATH program, even with increasing \ndemand and inflation. This problem is occurring in my home State of New \nMexico as well as twenty-five other States and territories throughout \nthe United States.\n  The PATH program is authorized under the Public Health Service Act \nand it funds community-based outreach, mental health, substance abuse, \ncase management and other support services, as well as a limited set of \nhousing services for people who are homeless and have serious mental \nillnesses. Program services are provided in a variety of different \nsettings, including clinic sites, shelter-based clinics, and mobile \nunits. In addition, the PATH program takes health care services to \nlocations where homeless individuals are found, such as streets, parks, \nand soup kitchens.\n  PATH services are a key element in the plan to end chronic \nhomelessness. Every night, an estimated 600,000 people are homeless in \nAmerica. Of these, about one-third are single adults with serious \nmental illnesses. I have worked closely with organizations in New \nMexico such as Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless and I have seen \nfirst hand the difficulties faced by the more than 15,000 homeless \npeople in New Mexico, 35 percent of who are chronically mentally ill or \nmentally incapacitated.\n  PATH is a proven program that has been very successful in moving \npeople out of homelessness. PATH has been reviewed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget and has scored significantly high marks in \nmeeting program goals and objectives. Unquestionably, homelessness is \nnot just an urban issue. Rural and frontier communities face unique \nchallenges in serving PATH eligible persons and the PATH program \nfunding mechanisms must account for these differences.\n  Thank you and I look forward to working with my colleague Senator \nKennedy on this important issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 319\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \npilot on compatible use buffers on real property bordering Fort Carson, \nColorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fort Carson \nConservation Act of 2005 and take a moment to explain why this \nlegislation is critical to our national security.\n  Since World War II, hundreds of thousands of soldiers at Fort Carson \nhave trained in relative isolation. With few current residents nearby, \nthe Army has been using Fort Carson's ranges for large-scale training \nexercises, weapons testing and live fire. This training often occurs at \nnight, a vital capability given the Army's preference to conduct \nmilitary operations in darkness.\n  The 140,000 acre Army installation and training facility was once \nmiles from Colorado Springs and Pueblo. As both cities grow closer to \nthe base's fence line, Fort Carson is facing constraints on its \ntraining flexibility, impacting military readiness. The issue of \ntraining at the post is particularly relevant considering nearly 15,000 \nsoldiers based at Fort Carson have been deployed or are currently \nemployed to Iraq.\n  The situation is not getting better. Over the last two decades, real \nestate and industrial development along Colorado's front range has \nexploded. Hundreds of thousands of people have moved to the Centennial \nState and settled along the 1-25 corridor. I remember the days when it \nwas possible to drive for miles along the eastern foothills of the \nRocky Mountains and encounter few if any residential areas. Today, \nthere seems to be development all along Colorado's front range.\n  Yet, military readiness at the post is not the only thing at risk. \nThe post's fragile prairie habitat is also in danger. Fort Carson has \nalways prided itself on its conservation of the public trust. Mountain \nPost has a special office just to ensure environmental compliance and \nprotect the post's biodiversity. The mountain plover, the black-tailed \nprairie dog, the Arkansas River feverfew, and the Pueblo goldenweed are \namong the many rare species protected at Fort Carson.\n  Over the last 3 years Fort Carson has partnered with the Nature \nConservancy on a unique plan to address the rising encroachment \nconcerns. This forward-thinking plan calls for the purchase of \nconservation easements of lands south and southeast of the base for a \nsmall number of willing sellers.\n  If implemented, I believe the plan will preserve the military utility \nof key Fort Carson training areas while conserving important short \ngrass prairie at a landscape scale, along with the ranching community \nthat sustains it. As much as 82,000 acres of uninhibited, precious \nprairie would be protected, including four globally rare plant species.\n  The Army fully supports this plan and has consistently described it \nas its number one priority under the service's Compatible Use Buffer \nprogram. This plan also enjoys widespread support from the local \ncommunity, including the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce. The \nColorado Department of Transportation, the Great Outdoors of Colorado, \nand the Nature Conservancy all support the plan as well.\n  I be1ieve we need to act now to protect unique training facilities \nlike those at Fort Carson before it is too late. This program makes \nsense for the soldiers training at Fort Carson who require an isolated \nenvironment to conduct their maneuvers. This program makes sense for \nthe environment.\n  This plan makes too much sense for Congress to pass up. That is why I \nam introducing the Fort Carson Conservation Act. I am pleased that \nCongressman Joel Hefley is introducing this landmark legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives today as well.\n  The Fort Carson Conservation Act of 2005 would require the Secretary \nof the Army to carry out a pilot project that creates a buffer zone out \nof the property bordering Fort Carson. The objective of this pilot \nwould be to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing \nconservation easements and leases to limit enroachment and preserve the \nenvironment.\n  Under the pilot project, the Secretary of the Army would enter into \nagreements with one or more willing sellers to purchase conservation \neasements. These agreements would be founded on the authority already \nprovided in section 2684a of title 10 of the United States Code. The \npilot project would expire when either the project is completed or \nwithin 5 years.\n  From my perspective, this pilot project is only the beginning. By \nworking closely with the Army and the other military services, the \nNature Conservancy has planted the seed for the expansion of this \nproject. I strongly support the Conservancy's effort and believe that \nkey military installations like Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, Fort \nHuachuca, Fort Stewart, and Eglin Air Force Base will soon be in a \nposition to benefit from this proactive conservation effort.\n  Mr. President, it is a little known secret that the Department of \nDefense is one of the best stewards of our environment. Almost 350 \nendangered and threatened species live on military bases across the \ncountry--that is more than are found on land managed by the National \nPark Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land \nManagement. In an era of rapid growth and urban development, military \ntraining areas have become, in many respects, the last refuge for many \nendangered species.\n  Creating natural buffer zones that protect fragile habitat and ensure \nour military readiness is a win-win proposal. It is the right thing to \ndo for the environment. It is the right thing to do for our Nation's \nArmed Forces. I urge my colleagues to support the Fort Carson \nConservation Act.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this important matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide more child support money to families \nleaving welfare, to simplify the rules governing the assignment and \ndistribution of child support collected by States on behalf of \nchildren, to improve the collection of child support, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Child \nSupport Distribution Act 2005, which Senator Snowe and I introduced \ntoday. I want to thank Senator Snowe for her hard work and dedication \nto this important issue and am proud to have worked with her for many \nyears on this legislation. And I'd like to thank Senators Rockefeller \nand Landrieu for their cosponsorship and support.\n  Senator Snowe and I have worked, both separately and in tandem, on \nissues related to child support for more than ten years. On many \noccasions, we've come close to seeing the positive changes contained in \nthis legislation enacted. In 2000, a House version of this bill passed \nby an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 405 to 18. In the 108th Congress, \nour legislation was included in the TANF Reauthorization bill that \npassed out of the Senate Finance Committee with bipartisan support. \nThis year, S. 6, which was introduced by Senator Santorum, and is \nsupported by Majority Leader Frist and Senators McConnell and \nHutchison, contains child support provisions that are almost based \nentirely on the legislation we're discussing today.\n  This legislation consistently receives bipartisan support because it \ntakes a common sense approach to child support. By passing through more \nchild support funds directly to low-income families, rather than \nsending it to the federal government, non-custodial parents are more \nlikely pay, and families see a huge benefit from the additional income.\n  Currently, approximately 60 percent of poor children who live with \ntheir mothers and whose fathers live outside the home do not receive \nchild support. Though there are a variety of reasons why non-custodial \nparents may not be paying support for then children, many don't pay \nbecause the system actually discourages them from doing so.\n  Under current law, $2.1 billion in child support is retained every \nyear by the State and Federal Governments as repayment for welfare \nbenefits--rather than delivered to the children to whom it is owed. \nFifty-six percent of that amount is for families who have left welfare. \nSince the money doesn't benefit their kids, fathers are discouraged \nfrom paying support. And mothers have no incentive to push for payment \nsince the support doesn't go to them.\n  The current rules withhold a key source of income for low-income \nfamilies that could help them maintain self-sufficiency. According to \nthe Center for Law and Social Policy, child support constitutes 16 \npercent of family income for low-income households that receive it. For \nfamilies who leave welfare, this number almost doubles. A Washington \nState study of families leaving welfare with regular child support \npayments found that these families found work faster and kept jobs \nlonger, compared to families without steady child support income.\n  It's time for Congress to change this system and encourage States to \ndistribute more child support to families. My home State of Wisconsin \nhas been a leader in this practice, which has benefited thousands of \nworking families. In 1997, I worked with my State to institute an \ninnovative program of passing through child support payments directly \nto families. An evaluation of the  Wisconsin program clearly shows that \nwhen child support payments are delivered to families, non-custodial \nparents are more apt to pay, and to pay more. In addition, Wisconsin \nhas found that, overall, this policy does not increase government \ncosts. That makes sense because ``passing through'' support payments to \nfamilies means they have more of their own resources, and are less apt \nto depend on public help to meet other needs such as food, \ntransportation or child care.\n\n  We now have a key opportunity to encourage all States to follow \nWisconsin's example. This legislation gives States options and strong \nincentives to send more child support directly to families who are \nworking their way off--or are already off--public assistance. Not only \nwill this create the right incentives for non-custodial parents to pay, \nbut it will also simplify the job for States, who currently face an \nadministrative nightmare in following the complicated rules of the \ncurrent system.\n  This legislation finally brings the Child Support Enforcement program \ninto the post-welfare reform era, shifting its focus from recovering \nwelfare costs to increasing child support to families so they can \nsustain work and maintain self-sufficiency. After all, it's only fair \nthat if we are asking parents to move off welfare, stay off welfare, \nand take financial responsibility for their families, then we in \nCongress must make sure that child support payments actually go to the \nfamilies to whom they are owed and who are working so hard to succeed.\n  It is time for Congress to make this change. It's time that we \nfinally make child support meaningful for families, and make sure that \nchildren get the support they need and deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 322. A bill to establish the Champlain Valley National Heritage \nPartnership in the States of Vermont and New York, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce the \nChamplain Valley National Heritage Act of 2005. I am joined by Senator \nLeahy and Senators Schumer and Clinton of New York. This bill will \nestablish a National Heritage Partnership within the Champlain Valley. \nPassage of this bill will culminate a process to enhance the incredible \ncultural resources of the Champlain Valley.\n  The Champlain Valley of Vermont and New York has one of the richest \nand most intact collections of historic resources in the United States. \nFort Ticonderoga still stands where it has for centuries, at the scene \nof numerous battles critical to the birth of our nation. Revolutionary \ngunboats have recently been found fully intact on the bottom of Lake \nChamplain. Our cemeteries are the permanent resting place for great \nexplorers, soldiers and sailors. The United States and Canada would not \nexist today but for events that occurred in this region.\n  We in Vermont and New York take great pride in our history. We \npreserve it, honor it and show it off to visitors from around the \nworld. These visitors\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\nare also very important to our economy. Tourism is among the most \nimportant industries in this region and has much potential for growth.\n  The Champlain Valley Heritage Partnership will bring together more \nthan one hundred local groups working to preserve and promote our \nheritage.\n  This project has taken many years for me to bring to the point of \nintroducing legislation. This has been time well spent working at the \ngrass-roots level to develop a framework to direct federal resources to \nwhere it will do the most good. I am confident that we have found the \nbest model. This will be a true partnership that supports each member \nbut does not impose any new federal requirements.\n  The Champlain Valley National Heritage Partnership will preserve our \nhistoric resources, interpret and teach about the events that shaped \nour nation and will be an engine for economic growth. I am hopeful that \nthis bill, which was passed unanimously by the Senate last year, will \nbecome law during this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 322\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 43\n\n       Whereas deadly asbestos fibers are invisible and cannot be \n     smelled or tasted;\n       Whereas when airborne fibers are inhaled or swallowed, the \n     damage is permanent and irreversible;\n       Whereas these fibers can cause mesothelioma, asbestosis, \n     lung cancer, and pleural diseases;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases can take 10 to 50 years \n     to present themselves;\n       Whereas the expected survival rate of those diagnosed with \n     mesothelioma is between 6 and 24 months;\n       Whereas little is known about late stage treatment and \n     there is no cure for asbestos-related diseases;\n       Whereas early detection of asbestos-related diseases would \n     give patients increased treatment options and often improve \n     their prognosis;\n       Whereas asbestos is a toxic and dangerous substance and \n     must be disposed of properly;\n       Whereas nearly half of the more than 1,000 screened \n     firefighters, police officers, rescue workers, and volunteers \n     who responded to the World Trade Center attacks on September \n     11, 2001, have new and persistent respiratory problems;\n       Whereas the industry groups with the highest incidence \n     rates of asbestos-related diseases, based on 2000 to 2002 \n     figures, were shipyard workers, vehicle body builders \n     (including rail vehicles), pipefitters, carpenters and \n     electricians, construction (including insulation work and \n     stripping), extraction, energy and water supply, and \n     manufacturing;\n       Whereas the United States imports more than 30,000,000 \n     pounds of asbestos used in products throughout the Nation;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases kill 10,000 people in the \n     United States each year, and the numbers are increasing;\n       Whereas asbestos exposure is responsible for 1 in every 125 \n     deaths of men over the age of 50;\n       Whereas safety and prevention will reduce asbestos exposure \n     and asbestos-related diseases;\n       Whereas asbestos has been the largest single cause of \n     occupational cancer;\n       Whereas asbestos is still a hazard for 1,300,000 workers in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas asbestos-related deaths have greatly increased in \n     the last 20 years and are expected to continue to increase;\n       Whereas 30 percent of all asbestos-related disease victims \n     were exposed to asbestos on naval ships and in shipyards;\n       Whereas asbestos was used in the construction of virtually \n     all office buildings, public schools, and homes built before \n     1975; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``National Asbestos \n     Awareness Day'' would raise public awareness about the \n     prevalence of asbestos-related diseases and the dangers of \n     asbestos exposure: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates the first day of April \n     2005 as ``National Asbestos Awareness Day''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution today to \ndesignate April 1 of this year as ``National Asbestos Awareness Day.''\n  I submitted this resolution toward the end of the last Congress and \nthe Senate did not have a chance to act on it. I submit it again today \nbecause strengthening public awareness about the danger of asbestos \nexposure could save thousands of lives.\n  Scientists have shown that inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause \nseveral serious diseases that might not show up for years after \nexposure. These diseases include lung cancer and asbestosis, the \nprogressive scarring of the lungs by asbestos fibers causing \nrespiratory distress, as well as malignant mesothelioma, a form of \ncancer for which asbestos exposure is the only known cause.\n  Over the next decade, more than 100,000 U.S. citizens will die of \nasbestos-related diseases. That is approximately 30 people per day--and \nit means one person will die in the time it takes us to act on this \nresolution.\n  Asbestos not only kills thousands of Americans every year. It also \ncauses pain and suffering, tears families apart, and adds to the costs \nof our health care system.\n  I have been touched by the stories of Americans affected by asbestos-\nrelated diseases.\n  Last fall, I received a phone call from my brother, Don, who told me \nthat a long-time family friend, Harold Hansen, had died from \nmesothelioma. Harold was a wonderful friend and family man. He hadn't \nworked directly with asbestos in his lifetime, but he had been \nunwittingly exposed--and that exposure took his life.\n  Alan Reinstein was diagnosed with mesothelioma on June 16, 2003, and \nsoon after underwent radical surgery to remove his entire lung, \npericardium, diaphragm, and other affected parts of his body. He \ncontinues to courageously fight this deadly illness, and each day he \nmust face the fear that the cancer might return.\n  Despite his illness, Alan is a lucky man because he has a loving \nwife, Linda, and family that give him strength. Linda Reinstein \ncouldn't sit by and watch her husband suffer, knowing that thousands of \nothers had also been afflicted. So she founded the Asbestos Disease \nAwareness Organization to educate the public and the medical community \nabout diseases caused by asbestos exposure.\n  I have received many letters from Nevadans who have family members \nwith asbestos-related diseases. Eleanor Shook, from my home town of \nSearchlight, NV, lost her husband Chuck to mesothelioma. He had been \nrepeatedly exposed to asbestos while at work. Two months after his \ndiagnosis, he passed away--no cure, no treatment, no reprieve. There is \na hole in that family where Chuck once stood.\n  I also received a letter from Jack Holmes a former school teacher \nfrom Las Vegas, who wrote: ``I am dying. I have malignant mesothelioma \n. . . I can expect extreme pain and suffering before I die.''\n  I also heard from Robert Wright of Henderson, NV, who was exposed to \nasbestos while serving in the United\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\nStates Navy. He now suffers from asbestosis.\n  These are just a few of the hundreds of citizens of Nevada that are \nsuffering with asbestos-related diseases. Every one of their stories is \na tragedy and every one of them could have been prevented with greater \nawareness and education.\n  Most Americans think asbestos was banned a long time ago. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. New asbestos is used every day to \ninsulate water pipes, as insulation, in making ceiling tiles and in \nmany other building materials. When the tiny particles are released, \nthey are invisible, and can't be smelled or tasted. Once inhaled, the \nparticles lodge themselves in the lining of the lungs and remain there, \ncausing irreversible damage for up to 50 years before disease sets in.\n  A single large dose of asbestos can fill your lungs with enough \nparticles to cause disease. Simply walking by a construction site where \nasbestos particles are at a heavy concentration could be enough to give \nyou a lethal dose.\n  Perhaps the most frightening thing about asbestos is that a person \ncan be exposed without knowing it. A New York City police officer told \nme he worked in an undercover sting as a construction worker. The goal \nof the sting was to catch individuals who would improperly dispose of \nasbestos that had been removed from buildings. He told of catching men \nwho tried to illegally dump asbestos in a school yard, where children \nwould have been exposed to its dangers for years to come.\n  This story underscores the importance of raising public awareness \nabout the dangers of asbestos exposure.\n  Better awareness and education can reduce exposure. For those who \nhave been exposed, early detection and screening can increase treatment \noptions and improve prognosis.\n  Asbestos kills--but asbestos education can save lives.\n  Just as victims and their families joined together to raise awareness \nof asbestos-related disease by forming the Asbestos Disease Awareness \nOrganization, the Senate can increase awareness of this silent killer \nby declaring April 1, 2005 as Asbestos Awareness Day. I hope all \nsenators will join me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1139-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1139-S1140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SENATE RESOLUTION 44--CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Coleman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 44\n\n       Whereas the first African Americans were brought forcibly \n     to these shores as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African Americans were enslaved in the United \n     States and subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, \n     segregation, and denial of basic, fundamental rights;\n       Whereas in spite of these injustices, African Americans \n     have made significant contributions to the economic, \n     educational, political, artistic, literary, scientific, and \n     technological advancement of the United States;\n       Whereas in the face of these injustices Americans of all \n     races distinguished themselves in their commitment to the \n     ideals on which the United States was founded, and fought for \n     the rights of African Americans;\n       Whereas the greatness of America is reflected in the \n     contributions of African Americans in all walks of life \n     throughout the history of the United States: in the writings \n     of W.E.B. DuBois, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, and Alex \n     Haley; in the music of Mahalia Jackson, Billie Holiday, and \n     Duke Ellington; in the resolve of athletes such as Jackie \n     Robinson and Muhammed Ali; in the vision of leaders such as \n     Frederick Douglass, Thurgood Marshall, and Martin Luther \n     King, Jr.; and in the bravery of those who stood on the front \n     lines in the battle against oppression such as Harriet Tubman \n     and Rosa Parks;\n       Whereas the United States of America was conceived, as \n     stated in the Declaration of Independence, as a new nation \n     dedicated to the proposition that ``all Men are created \n     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the Pursuit of Happiness'';\n       Whereas the actions of Americans of all races demonstrate \n     their commitment to that proposition: actions such as those \n     of Allan Pinkerton, Thomas Garrett, and the Rev. John Rankin \n     who served as conductors on the Underground Railroad; actions \n     such as those of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who shined a light on \n     the injustices of slavery; actions such as those of President \n     Abraham Lincoln, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation, \n     and Senator Lyman Trumbull, who introduced the 13th Amendment \n     to the Constitution of the United States; actions such as \n     those of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Chief Justice Earl \n     Warren, Senator Mike Mansfield, and Senator Hubert Humphrey, \n     who fought to end segregation and the denial of civil rights \n     to African Americans; and the thousands of Americans of all \n     races who marched side-by-side with African Americans during \n     the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas since its founding the United States has been an \n     imperfect work in progress towards these noble goals;\n       Whereas American History is the story of a people regularly \n     affirming high ideals, striving to reach them but often \n     failing, and then struggling to come to terms with the \n     disappointment of that failure before recommitting themselves \n     to trying again;\n       Whereas from the beginning of our Nation the most \n     conspicuous and persistent failure of Americans to reach our \n     noble goals has been the enslavement of African Americans and \n     the resulting racism;\n       Whereas the crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the \n     ultimate expression of racism in the United States following \n     Reconstruction;\n       Whereas the Federal Government failed to put an end to \n     slavery until the ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865, \n     repeatedly failed to enact a federal anti-lynching law, and \n     still struggles to deal with the evils of racism; and\n       Whereas the fact that 61 percent of African American 4th \n     graders read at a below basic level and only 16 percent of \n     native born African Americans have earned a Bachelor's \n     degree; 50 percent of all new HIV cases are reported in \n     African Americans; and the leading cause of death for African \n     American males ages 15 to 34 is homicide demonstrates that \n     the United States continues to struggle to reach the high \n     ideal of equal opportunity for all Americans: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the tragedies of slavery, lynching, \n     segregation, and condemns them as an infringement on human \n     liberty and equal opportunity so that they will stand forever \n     as a reminder of what can happen when Americans fail to live \n     up to their noble goals;\n       (2) honors those Americans who during the time of slavery, \n     lynching, and segregation risked their lives in the \n     underground railway and in other efforts to assist fugitive \n     slaves and other African Americans who might have been \n     targets and victims of lynch mobs and those who have stood \n     beside African Americans in the fight for equal opportunity \n     that continues to this day;\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to the founding principles of \n     the United States of America that ``all Men are created \n     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and \n     the Pursuit of Happiness''; and\n       (4) commits itself to addressing those situations in which \n     the African American community struggles with disparities in \n     education, health care, and other areas where the Federal \n     Government can play a role in improving conditions for all \n     Americans.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is Black History Month.\n  I look forward to Black History Month each year because it reminds me \nof my late friend, Alex Haley. Alex Haley died 13 years ago this month. \nI can still remember his funeral in Memphis and the big crowd there--\npeople from all over America, leaders like Jesse Jackson. I spoke too; \nlots of us did.\n  There must have been 300 people in the room who thought they were his \nbest friend. There were thousands of people around America and around \nthe world who thought they were Alex Haley's best friend. He was a \nremarkable individual.\n  I remember saying that Alex Haley was God's storyteller, because he \ncould tell a story. I remember saying, too, that I think we just used \nhim up because he was such a generous man with his time.\n  After the funeral in Memphis, a procession drove to Henning, TN--not \nso far from Memphis--50 or 60 miles. We were there at the home where \nAlex Haley stayed in the summers with his grandparents.\n  This was a Friday. The African flute played a beautiful melody. It \nwas cold. It was cold in February.\n  After the casket was laid in the grave, the stone was put there. On \nthat stone were the words that Alex Haley lived his life by: ``Find the \ngood and praise it.''\n  I remember that afternoon as if it were yesterday, even though it was \n13 years ago. I remember Alex Haley as if he were perched here in this \nroom looking us over.\n  I remember Alex Haley not just because of his death during Black \nHistory Month 13 years ago, but because of how he lived his life during \nBlack History Month in the Februaries before 1992. Almost every \nFebruary would find Alex\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\nHaley on an all-night red-eye flight to Tennessee from a speaking \nengagement in some distant place so he could drive to some small \nTennessee town and fulfill a commitment he made months earlier to a 4th \ngrade teacher to help her students celebrate Black History Month.\n  Teachers loved Alex Haley's visits because he had wonderful stories \nto tell, stories of Frederick Douglass, of Thurgood Marshall, of Martin \nLuther King. Of the heroes and heroines, both black and white of the \nunderground railroad, of Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, W.E.B. Dubois, \nJames Baldwin, and Ralph Ellison.\n  But the most riveting of all the stories that Alex Haley told those \nchildren were the ones Alex learned sitting on the porch steps in \nHenning, TN, in the summertime, listening to his great-aunts and his \ngrandmother tell stories of his ancestor Kunta Kinte. He used to say \nhis Great-Aunt Plus, rocking on the porch, telling those stories, could \nknock a firefly out of the air at 15 feet with an accurate stream of \ntobacco juice.\n  Once Alex Haley rode across the Atlantic Ocean for 3 weeks in the \nbelly of a freighter to try to imagine what it must have been like for \nKunta Kinte to be captured in the Gambia, Africa, and brought to \nAnnapolis and sold as a slave. Alex spent 13 years tracing what had \nhappened between the arrival of Kunta Kinte, his seventh generation \ngrandfather, and Alex's own birth.\n  Alex Haley discovered one important piece of that puzzle when \nspeaking in Simpson College in Iowa in the early 1970s. He told \nstudents and faculty there that he had found the name of the man who \nhad bought Kunta Kinte on the Annapolis dock, but Alex could not trace \nwhat had happened after that.\n  A faculty member arose and said, Mr. Haley, my seventh generation \ngrandfather purchased your seventh generation grandfather. Alex stayed \nwith that faculty member for several weeks and because of that \nencounter was finally able to weave together the rest of the story of \nthe struggle for freedom which became America's best-watched television \nminiseries, the story of ``Roots.''\n  It is in the spirit of Alex Haley that I offer this resolution \ncelebrating Black History Month. This resolution honors the \ncontributions of African Americans throughout the history of our \ncountry. It recommits the Senate to the goals of liberty and equal \nopportunity for every American. It condemns the horrors of slavery, of \nlynching, of segregation, and other instances in which our country has \nfailed to measure up to its noble goals, and it pledges to work harder \nto improve educational, health, and job opportunities for African \nAmericans and for all Americans.\n  African Americans were brought forcibly to these shores in the 17th \ncentury. From that dark beginning, however, they have overcome great \nobstacles and continue to do so, to take a prominent place among the \nmany people of diverse backgrounds who have come together here to form \na single nation. African Americans have made and continue to make \nsignificant contributions to the economic, educational, political, \nartistic, literary, scientific, and technical advancement of the United \nStates of America.\n  I have repeatedly emphasized the importance of the study of American \nhistory. One of our national tragedies and embarrassments is that our \ntwelfth graders score lower on the national assessment of educational \nprogress on U.S. history than on any other subject. We should be \nashamed of that. Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, Senator Kennedy, \nother Senators on this side, and I have worked together to try to \nchange that.\n\n  This is our opportunity--in a month devoted to black history--to \nespecially recognize the history of African Americans in this country \nand to recognize that it is one of the greatest examples of our \nnational quest to reach the high ideals set for us by our Founding \nFathers. The Declaration of Independence dedicated us to the \nproposition that ``all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by \ntheir Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are \nLife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.''\n  Our history is one of striving to reach this lofty ideal. The \ntreatment of African Americans is our most egregious failure. Slavery, \nlynching, and segregation are all examples of times when this Nation \nfailed African Americans. We failed to live up to our own promise of \nthat fundamental truth that all men are created equal.\n  However, for every time we have failed, we have struggled to come to \nterms with that disappointment and we have recommitted ourselves to try \nagain. Where there once was slavery, we passed the thirteenth and \nfourteenth amendments abolishing slavery and declaring equal protection \nunder the law for all races. Where there was segregation, came Brown v. \nBoard of Education and the Voting Rights Act. There are so many moments \nlike these in our history and it is these moments we also celebrate \nwith this resolution.\n  In addition, I do not believe we should simply rest on the \naccomplishments of our past. We celebrate and remember our history so \nwe can learn its lessons and apply them today. Today's wrongs are \nbegging for attention. African Americans in this country face \nsignificant and often crippling disparities in education, in health \ncare, in quality of life, and in other areas where the Federal \nGovernment can play a role. The best way for each one of us, and for \nthe United States Senate, to commemorate Black History Month is to get \nto work on legislation that would offer African Americans and other \nAmericans better access to good schools, better access to quality \nhealth care, better access to decent jobs.\n  There is no resolution we can pass today that will teach one more \nchild to read, prevent one more case of AIDS, or stop one more violent \ncrime. However, I hope by joining me and supporting this resolution, \nthe Members of this Senate will also join me in finding ways to look to \nthe future and continue to contribute to this work in progress that is \nthe United States of America.\n  I don't know what my friend Alex Haley would say about this Senate \nresolution, the one I am about to introduce, or that Senate resolution. \nBut I do know how he lived his life. I do know how he celebrated Black \nHistory Month. He told wonderful stories about African Americans and \nother Americans who believed in the struggle for freedom and the \nstruggle for equality. He minced no words in describing the terrible \ninjustices they overcame. He said to those children he had flown all \nnight to see that they were living in a wonderful country of great \ngoals, and while many in the past had often failed to reach those \ngoals, that we Americans always recommit ourselves to keep trying.\n  So, Mr. President, today I introduce a Senate resolution celebrating \nBlack History Month, and it is in the spirit of Alex Haley that I offer \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1140-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1140-S1141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 45--COMMENDING THE JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY DUKES \nFOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2004 NCAA DIVISION 1-AA NATIONAL FOOTBALL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Schumer) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 10\n\n       Whereas an estimated 1,006,970 women and 370,990 men are \n     stalked annually in the United States and, in the majority of \n     such cases, the person is stalked by someone who is not a \n     stranger;\n       Whereas 81 percent of women who are stalked by an intimate \n     partner are also physically assaulted by that partner, and 76 \n     percent of women who are killed by an intimate partner were \n     also stalked by that intimate partner;\n       Whereas 26 percent of stalking victims lose time from work \n     as a result of their victimization and 7 percent never return \n     to work;\n       Whereas stalking victims are forced to take drastic \n     measures to protect themselves, such as relocating, changing \n     their addresses, changing their identities, changing jobs, \n     and obtaining protection orders;\n       Whereas stalking is a crime that cuts across race, culture, \n     gender, age, sexual orientation, physical and mental ability, \n     and economic status;\n       Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law and under the \n     laws of all 50 States and the District of Columbia;\n       Whereas rapid advancements in technology have made cyber-\n     surveillance the new frontier in stalking;\n       Whereas there are national organizations, local victim \n     service organizations, prosecutors' offices, and police \n     departments that stand ready to assist stalking victims and \n     who are working diligently to craft competent, thorough, and \n     innovative responses to stalking;\n       Whereas there is a need to enhance the criminal justice \n     system's response to stalking and stalking victims, including \n     aggressive investigation and prosecution; and\n       Whereas Congress urges the establishment of January, 2006 \n     as National Stalking Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) National Stalking Awareness Month provides an \n     opportunity to educate the people of the United States about \n     stalking;\n       (B) all Americans should applaud the efforts of the many \n     victim service providers, police, prosecutors, national and \n     community organizations, and private sector supporters for \n     their efforts in promoting awareness about stalking; and\n       (C) policymakers, criminal justice officials, victim \n     service and human service agencies, nonprofits, and others \n     should recognize the need to increase awareness of stalking \n     and availability of services for stalking victims; and\n       (2) Congress urges national and community organizations, \n     businesses in the private sector, and the media to promote, \n     through National Stalking Awareness Month, awareness of the \n     crime of stalking.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncalling for the establishment of a National Stalking Awareness Month. \nEach year, approximately 1.4 million Americans--over 1 million women \nand about 400,000 men--are stalked. This statistic is truly staggering. \nDespite the prevalence of stalking and its recognition as a crime in \nall 50 States, this crime is often ignored.\n  Stalking is an issue that affects 1 in 12 women and 1 in 45 men \nduring their lifetime. It cuts across all lines of race, age, and \ngender. Women and men across the United States have struggled \nemotionally and financially to rebuild their lives after being \nvictimized by a stalker.\n  With rapidly advancing technology, I fear that stalking will become \neven more common and that the perpetrators will become even harder to \ncatch. Increasingly, smaller cameras now allow perpetrators to stalk \ntheir victims from afar, often without even being detected. Video \nvoyeurism is the next frontier in stalking and more must be done to \ncombat this problem.\n  This resolution applauds the efforts of policymakers, law enforcement \nofficers, victim service agencies, and other groups that currently \npromote awareness of stalking. This resolution also\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\nencourages these groups to examine new and innovative ways to promote \nprevention and prosecution of stalking crimes. By increasing awareness \nand devising practical and effective means to reduce the prevalence of \nthis crime, we can help the police, prosecutors, and victims to \nconfront this horrible crime.\n  Stalking is a tremendous problem, and it is one that we need to do \nmore to address. A National Stalking Awareness Month would help to \neducate and increase awareness about stalking. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this resolution. We can--and we should--do more \nto ensure that stalkers are brought to justice and that their victims \nare not forced to live in fear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1142-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 11--HONORING THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN FOR THEIR \n  BRAVERY IN FIGHTING FOR OUR FREEDOM IN WORLD WAR II, AND FOR THEIR \n     CONTRIBUTION IN CREATING AN INTEGRATED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Shelby) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 45, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 45) commending the James Madison \n     University Dukes football team for winning the 2004 NCAA \n     Division I-AA National Football Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I congratulate the James Madison \nUniversity Football team for winning the 2004 NCAA Division I-AA \nfootball championship with a 31 to 21 victory over the Montana \nGrizzlies. This resolution expresses congratulations of the Senate \nthese outstanding young men.\n  As a former collegiate athlete and an avid football fan, I want to \nexpress the pride felt by all students, faculty and alumni of James \nMadison University at this tremendous accomplishment by the football \nteam. Head Coach Mickey Matthews and his superb coaching staff: Curt \nNewsome, Jeff Durden, George Barlow, Kyle Gillenwater, Phil Ratliff, \nChip West, Ulrick Edmonds, J.C. Price, Tony Tallent, Jim Durning, \ndeserve much of the credit for the accomplishment of these student \nathletes and should also be highly commended.\n  The James Madison University Dukes Football team fought to a 10 to 7 \nhalftime lead on the strength of tailback Maurice Fenner's 1-yard \ntouchdown and kicker David Rabil's 28-yard field goal. The Dukes went \non to win the game with an outstanding second half performance, rushing \nfor 257 and outscoring the Montana Grizzlies 31 to 21.\n  In his distinguished career, Head Coach Mickey Matthews has won 40 \ngames in 6 years at James Madison University and has taken the Dukes to \nthe playoffs twice in his tenure. The American Football Coaches \nAssociation has named Coach Matthews the 2004 Division I-AA National \nCoach of the Year for his performance in the Dukes' championship \nseason. Coach Matthews lead the Dukes to become the first team in \nDivision I-AA history to win the national title without playing a \nsingle playoff game at home, battling for three consecutive playoff \nroad victories. In addition to their 2004 national title, the team also \nshares the Atlantic Ten Championship title, one of the toughest \nDivision I-AA conferences in the country.\n  The members of the 2004 James Madison University Football have indeed \nmade their university proud and should be applauded for their character \nand leadership, both on and off the playing field. I congratulate Nick \nAdams, Ryan Bache, L.C. Baker, Alvin Banks, Brandon Beach, Antoinne \nBolton, D.D.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 46, which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 46) commemorating the life of the \n     late Zurab Zhvania, former Prime Minister of the Republic of \n     Georgia.\n\n  This being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I offer a resolution commemorating \nthe life of the late Zurab Zhvania, former Prime Minister of the \nRepublic of Georgia.\n  At the request of President Bush, I was honored to lead a delegation \nlast weekend to represent the United States at Prime Minister Zhvania's \nfuneral. Also representing the United States was Paul Applegarth, \nMillennium Challenge Corporation CEO; and Lorne Craner, President of \nthe International Republican Institute.\n  Prime Minister Zhvania was a prominent leader in Georgia's Rose \nRevolution. He was a true reformer, lauded for his intellectual acuity, \nand a friend of America. I was fortunate to meet with Zhvania last \nDecember. We had an extensive discussion about Georgia's promising \nfuture and vigorous agenda to transform it into a regional model of \npolitical and economic progress.\n  The U.S.-Georgia relationship is strong. I am grateful to Georgia's \nrecent decision to increase its troop level in Iraq. I am also grateful \nfor its partnership in the War on Terror, including its troop \ncommitment in Afghanistan and to the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. I \nam hopeful that our strategic relationship with Georgia will continue \nto grow as we face the new threats of the 21st century.\n  The death of Prime Minister Zhvania is a loss for Georgia, for the \nUnited States, and for the community of democratic nations. I ask my \ncolleagues for their support of this resolution.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on a personal note, I knew Zurab \nZhvania. I worked with him quite a bit. He was one of the original \ndemocracy advocates inside Georgia, a country that came out of the \nformer Soviet Union, a wonderful man, with a great heart. He started \nout as an environmentalist. That is how he got active in the political \nsystem. He and Mr. Shevardnaze formed an alliance and moved the country \ntoward democracy through a tumultuous time period. He was one of the \nlead architects of the Rose Revolution and democracy coming forward in \nGeorgia.\n  I cannot let this pass without noting what an incredible loss he is \nto Georgia. He would have been one of at least the top one to three \npeople who make that country move to where it is today. They are \nsuspicious circumstances under which he died--gas inhalation in an \napartment. It appears to be natural causes, but there has been a lot of \ndifficult political activity going on in Georgia--kidnappings and \ndeaths that have taken place. I hope that was not the case.\n  I have my own personal thoughts of him, and my sympathy goes out to \nhis family--his wife and young children. He was 41 years old. He was a \nwonderful guy and he will be sorely missed in Georgia and around the \nworld. I know his family will miss him dearly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 46) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 46\n\n       Whereas on the night of February 3, 2005, the Prime \n     Minister of the Republic of Georgia, Zurab Zhvania, died, \n     apparently due to carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a \n     malfunctioning heater;\n       Whereas the death of Prime Minister Zhvania at the age of \n     41 is a tragic loss for the Republic of Georgia;\n       Whereas Zurab Zhvania was a dedicated reformer whose \n     visionary leadership inspired a new generation of political \n     leaders in the Republic of Georgia;\n       Whereas Zurab Zhvania founded the Citizen's Union Party, \n     which won elections in 1995, making him the Speaker of the \n     Georgian Parliament;\n       Whereas under the leadership of Speaker Zhvania, the \n     Georgian Parliament was transformed into an effective and \n     transparent legislative institution;\n       Whereas in November 2001, Speaker Zhvania resigned his \n     position in protest when government authorities attempted to \n     suppress the leading independent television station in the \n     Republic of Georgia;\n       Whereas Zurab Zhvania formed the United Democrats, a party \n     that blossomed into one of the major forces that brought \n     about the Rose Revolution in the Republic of Georgia in \n     November 2003;\n       Whereas in the most dangerous hours of the Rose Revolution, \n     when it appeared that armed force could be used against the \n     peaceful protestors, Zurab Zhvania dismissed his bodyguards \n     and led a march to Parliament accompanied only by his young \n     children;\n       Whereas Zurab Zhvania was named Prime Minister of the \n     Republic of Georgia in November 2003, and led governmental \n     efforts to develop and implement far-reaching economic, \n     judicial, military, and social reforms thereby turning the \n     promise of the Rose Revolution into real results that have \n     dramatically improved life in the Republic of Georgia;\n       Whereas the strong commitment of Zurab Zhvania to the \n     peaceful restoration of the territorial integrity of Georgia \n     was most recently displayed in the central role he played in \n     the development of the unprecedented and generous proposal of \n     the Republic of Georgia for resolving the status of South \n     Ossetia peacefully and justly; and\n       Whereas Zurab Zhvania's vision of the historical destiny of \n     Georgia was eloquently expressed before the Council of Europe \n     on April 27, 1999, when he said, ``I am Georgian and \n     therefore, I am European'':\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its deepest condolences to the family of \n     Zurab Zhvania for their tragic loss of a son, husband, and \n     father;\n       (2) commends the courage, energy, political imagination, \n     and leadership of Zurab Zhvania that were so critical to the \n     development of a democratic Republic of Georgia; and\n       (3) recognizes that the integration of the Republic of \n     Georgia into Euro-Atlantic institutions will be the \n     completion of the vision of Zurab Zhvania and his most \n     lasting legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/08/senate-section/article/S1144-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2005\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

For the remainder of the day, we will continue to offer \nand debate amendments to the class action bill. Therefore, rollcall \nvotes are expected throughout tomorrow's session.\n  Just for the knowledge of Members, I know the leader intends to move \nthis bill forward, getting it done this week. As has been stated during \nthe debate, it is the hope to move this forward so the House can \nconsider it and move it on to the President in as early a fashion as \npossible.\n\n[[Page S1145]]\n\n  This is a bipartisan bill with strong support. Not everybody agrees \nwith it, obviously, but this is something we hope can move forward as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Kansas will yield, through the Chair, \nI would like to make a point on the Record that there will be other \nSenators offering amendments tomorrow.
