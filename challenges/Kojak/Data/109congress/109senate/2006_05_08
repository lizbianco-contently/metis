Mr. President, today we will return to debate on several \nhealth care proposals. We had previously slated this week to consider \ntwo medical liability, medical malpractice reform bills, as well as the \nsmall business health plan bill reported by the HELP Committee. Because \nthere was an objection to proceeding to each of these three bills, I \nwas forced to file cloture last week on each of these bills on the \nmotion to proceed. Thus, the first vote will be at 5:15 today on one of \nthe medical liability bills and the second medical liability bill, if \nwe do not get cloture on the first, to follow.\n  At 5:15, the vote will be on the Medical Care Access Protection Act \nof 2006, S. 22. If cloture is not invoked on that comprehensive bill, \nthe Senate will then immediately vote to invoke cloture on the motion \nto proceed to S. 23, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access To \nCare Act. That second bill is similar to the first, S. 22, but limits \nitself to litigation and focuses just on obstetrical and gynecological \ncare.\n  If the Senate is not able to turn to either of these pieces of \nlegislation, the next vote we will have will be tomorrow morning, \nTuesday morning, on cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1955, the \nHealth Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act. This \nis the bill reported by Chairman Enzi's committee called the small \nbusiness health plans bill. The bill is intended to aid small business \nowners by giving them more power to negotiate for affordable insurance \nfor their employees and their families.\n  We have set aside debate throughout the day today to allow Senators \nto speak on any of these three health care measures. I look forward to \nthe debate on each of these issues--each very important--as we look at \nthe overall affordability of health care, the access to health care, as \nwell as the quality of health care for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4119-7", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4119-S4120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, at this point I would like to briefly \nextend some comments I made at the end of last week on the issue of the \nmedical liability bills that are before this body.\n  On Friday, the Senate filed cloture on the medical liability reform \nbill--or actually two bills--and we will vote on at least one of those \nbills today, this afternoon. All of this centers around the fact that \nour broken medical liability system is hurting every American, every \npatient, every physician, and the health care system. But the important \nthing is that it hurts every American. It is an issue that, as a \nphysician as well as a Senator, concerns me deeply. Indeed, it needs to \nconcern and should concern every single American who is walking or will \nwalk into a doctor's office. That is because every American is \nsuffering from the high costs which are totally unnecessary and, in \nmany ways, frivolous and out of control.\n  A litigation lottery system is what it really is that we suffer from \ntoday. Each year, health care costs are rising three to four times \nfaster than the average American's paycheck, and that is in part--in \npart--driven by this litigation lottery system, a system that is \ndriving up costs, and when it drives up costs, it drives up the \npremiums that not just doctors pay, because those premiums are passed \non to the patients and potential patients, but it drives up costs, \ndiminishes access to health care today, and thus diminishes quality for \nevery American. Access to quality issues are equally important to the \ncosts, but they are all interrelated.\n  Innocent doctors and patients are being punished because of the greed \nof a few opportunistic trial lawyers who are exploiting the system the \nway it is currently configured. Thus, the legislation that we propose \nand that we hope we will be able to debate on the floor reforms that \nsystem--it fixes the system--with a sense of fairness and commonsense \nreform.\n\n  This is an issue which I have been compelled to bring back to the \nfloor again and again, really on principle, because it is the right \nthing to do. In\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\nthe last Congress, in the 108th Congress, I attempted to bring medical \nliability reform to the Senate on three separate occasions. Each time, \na minority of Senators blocked consideration and prevented an up-or-\ndown vote on those pieces of legislation. Indeed, although we will have \nto see how the votes fall here in about 4 or 5 hours, they may do so \nagain today. But I am going to remain determined to press for action on \nprinciple because it is the right thing to do. It boils down to the \nfact that health care dollars should be spent on patients and not on \nlawyers who are out abusing the system--on patients and not lawyers. It \nis a clear choice.\n  Last week, I talked a little bit about my own son Harrison who \ntraveled with me to town meetings around the country a couple of years \nago. We went to Florida, we went to Pennsylvania, and we went to Ohio \nand talked about a range of issues. Being a physician and a Senator, \ndoctors would come up to me again and again and tell their stories \nabout having to stop practicing their specialty, a neurosurgeon or an \nobstetrician who has to stop delivering babies, or actually moving out \nof Pennsylvania down to other States in the South or out of Ohio or out \nof Florida because they really had no choice. At the end of that trip, \nmy son said: Dad, I know you love medicine and that is your life. My \ngranddad was a family physician and loved it, and both my uncles are \nphysicians. But why in the world, Dad, would you encourage me to go \ninto a profession where everybody gets sued--not just once but again \nand again and again--even if they have done nothing wrong?\n  That is what hurts and also really scares me because it means we are \ngoing to lose a whole generation of good people, committed people who \ncare about treating patients, who simply aren't going to go into the \nprofession because they don't want to expose themselves or, more \nimportantly, their own families to these frivolous lawsuits. It is \nhappening.\n  I hope everybody listening to this debate over the next few hours and \nhopefully several days will ask their physicians, whoever they are--\npick up the phone and call them or e-mail or if you are going to the \ndoctor's office ask them: Does this medical liability stuff really mean \nthat you are unable to treat patients in the way you otherwise would? \nIt really is affecting cost and access and quality? Just ask them, and \nI guarantee the answer will be yes.\n  Access to care. Across the country right now, one out of two counties \ndoes not have an OB-GYN. That means mothers or expectant mothers are \nhaving to drive extra miles, as fewer and fewer people deliver babies, \nin order to have their babies delivered. Three-quarters of \nneurosurgeons will no longer operate on children, in large part because \nof the number of lawsuits. Increasingly, neurosurgeons are not taking \ntrauma calls at the local hospital wherever you live in the world today \nbecause they know by taking that trauma call, their malpractice \npremiums, their liability premiums skyrocket because of the likelihood, \neven if they give good care, of being sued.\n  I have seen it and heard about it, talking again and again to my own \nmedical colleagues and in traveling across Tennessee. In Tennessee, 81 \nout of the 95 Tennessee counties don't have a neurosurgeon. Half don't \nhave an orthopedic surgeon, an emergency physician, or an OB-GYN. \nAverage malpractice premiums for Tennessee doctors have increased 90 \npercent--90 percent--in the last 6 years.\n  As a result of all of this, my colleagues in Tennessee tell me, or at \nleast nearly three-quarters of them tell me--and in a recent survey--\nthat their medical communities already have a shortage of the high-risk \nspecialties, the trauma specialists, the obstetricians, the \nneurosurgeons, and those same counties are having a hard time \nrecruiting new physicians. Nobody is going to move into a county where \nthose premiums are sky high and the risk of them being sued is so high.\n  We have to reform the system. We can do it with commonsense reforms. \nThe reforms have been laid out in the legislation.\n  The nationwide picture is very similar. The AMA, the American Medical \nAssociation, says we have reached crisis proportions in 21 States, \nincluding Florida, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and \nTennessee. Families in these States are simply not getting the quality \nof care they need because of these out-of-control liability premiums.\n  Right now, if you talk to obstetricians, about one out of seven \nstopped delivering babies, and they point to the reason of the \nskyrocketing medical liability costs. We talk about the doctors and we \ntalk about their premiums, but let's remember that as a result of those \ncosts and premiums, you lose the access, you lose the availability. The \nexcessive costs, the waste--it doesn't go down to the doctor-patient \nrelationship; it doesn't mean you get better care. Ultimately, it is \nthe patients who suffer. It is the American people who suffer--not the \ndoctors, not just their premiums. Ultimately, it is the patient's care \nthat suffers.\n  High-risk specialists. Again, I say this as a cardiac surgeon talking \nabout my colleagues, but the neurosurgeons I mentioned are the ones who \nare getting hit the hardest. Emergency room staff are being depleted. \nThat is a big concern. I will cite it again and again on the floor: If \nsomething happens to you driving home today, is there going to be a \nneurosurgeon there to take care of that head injury? Increasingly, it \nis less likely that you will have that sort of expertise there in the \nemergency room.\n  We know how to address this crisis. This is the good news. We know \nthere are things we can do that work. Commonsense reform, based on \nprinciple, is not all that hard to do.\n  I was in Texas last month, about 3 or 4 weeks ago, talking to the \ndoctors there, and they have seen the results of a reform movement that \nis alive and well and has had an impact. Since 2003, the rate of \nmalpractice filings has declined by 80 percent in most major Texas \ncounties. This year alone, the rate cuts by five major Texas insurers \nwill save physicians nearly $49 million in premium payments. They say \nthey save physicians $49 million and, remember, all of those premiums \njust get passed on to the American people and get translated into \nhigher premiums that you pay for your monthly health care security. \nBetween 3,000 and 4,000 doctors have moved into the State, into Texas, \nwhere just the opposite is happening in Pennsylvania and Ohio and \nFlorida, where physicians are moving out of the State.\n  The Texas story is a true success story. Because of this inequity \nfrom State to State, we need a national approach.\n  As I mentioned, we will be voting in a few hours on the medical \nliability reform bills. These bills are a part of a larger vision of \nhealth care which is patient centered--patient centered--which is \nprovider friendly, which centers on 21st century information and choice \nand an element of control. But this is a major piece in reaching that \nvision. We need our doctors and hospitals and offices to be places \nwhich they are intended to be--places of healing and not minefields for \ngreedy, predatory lawyers who are simply exploiting a system that needs \nto be reformed.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to vote today for cloture so \nthat we can discuss both of these medical liability bills. My \ncolleagues know well that the medical liability system does need \nreform, and as a physician and as a Senator, I know we can deliver \nthese meaningful reforms, and I intend to do so. I hope we are given \nthat opportunity. I encourage all of our colleagues to vote for cloture \nso we can address these bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4120-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I would simply mention to the distinguished \nleader before he leaves that a week ago, I came to the floor and talked \nabout immigration and indicated that we would be willing to go \nforward--10 amendments on each side--and with the direction where I \nthink we should go on conference. I hope the leader will understand \nthat time is running out. We need to be able to do this.\n  We are terribly concerned, even more concerned based on the \nstatements\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\nfrom the House last week. Chairman Sensenbrenner gave a speech last \nweek talking about why he had, in his bill, his legislation, at the \nrequest of the White House--I am sure the White House has backed off on \nthis; I certainly hope so--but making people who are here who are \nundocumented, felons. He gave some illustrations that were not very \ngood. He talked about, Japan doesn't have many immigrants that come \nillegally. That is right, that is because it is an island. They would \nhave to swim there or come in on an airplane or boat. They don't have \nthe mass migration problems we have.\n  I hope the leader, with the many things he has to do, would \nunderstand that we have, after this week, only 2 weeks left in this \nlegislative session. The leader stated we are going to try to finish \nthis before Memorial Day. To do that, we are going to have to get on \nthat bill. If we have all these amendments, it is going to take a lot \nof time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, briefly, because I know the Democratic \nleader has another statement to make, I am absolutely committed to \ncompleting and giving adequate time to complete what is a complex bill. \nAs the Democratic leader implied, there are a lot of issues we need to \ntalk about in this bill. I appreciate the spirit in which he and I are \napproaching the bill, in terms of allowing debate and amendment and \nalso addressing issues about conference, to make sure--I know what his \nintent is--that the will of the Senate is expressed strongly in that \nconference.\n  I do encourage all of our colleagues to recognize that step one is \ndebating the bill here on the floor of the Senate, getting it off the \nfloor with a majority vote, and I would argue for a good comprehensive \nbill stressing the border and border security. What I would like to do, \nas I discussed scheduling with the Democratic leader, is to be on the \nimmigration bill next week and the following week. That should give \nadequate time.\n  There was one last thing, at least on our side of the aisle. In terms \nof numbers of amendments, we are doing our very best to focus each and \nevery day on the amendments which would be substantive amendments, to \ntry not to have unnecessary amendments or amendments just for political \nreasons but substantive amendments coming to the floor. Hopefully, \ncoming to the floor, people will continue work. People don't see that \non the floor, but literally every day we are meeting looking at those \namendments. So once we get on the bill, we can have a fair process, not \na lot of unnecessary time spent figuring out what the amendments would \nbe. I am confident that we can, working together, be on a bill that \nwill be a comprehensive bill, that will be a bill reflecting the will \nof the Senate, by early next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4121-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4121-S4123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEDICAL MALPRACTICE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, people will have other thoughts on medical \nmalpractice legislation as they come to the floor, as they cast their \nvote. But for me, I want to make this a day to remember a wonderful \nwoman by the name of Billie Robinson. I have handled medical \nmalpractice cases. I want to talk about this one. I have talked about \nher before. I want to talk about her again. I could talk about other \ncases, but nothing has been so fixed in my mind, as I prepared for \ntoday, as Billie Robinson.\n  I really didn't know Billie Robinson when she had all of her \nfaculties; I only knew her after she had this surgery. Billie Robinson \ncame from my hometown of Searchlight. She was like some other people in \nSearchlight, she had basically no education. She was a hard worker. She \nworked very hard physically. She developed headaches that were \ndifficult for her to describe, but she did her best and went to a \nseries of physicians. Every physician she went to told her she drank \ntoo much and she should lay off the booze and she would be better.\n  She ultimately went to her fifth or sixth doctor, and the doctor \ndecided maybe he should look and see what is inside her head and \nordered some x rays and other diagnostic tests and found she had a \ntremendously large tumor in her head causing these blinding headaches. \nHer activities, her actions were not a result of alcoholism; they were \nthe result of her head having a tumor causing her these horrible \nheadaches. And yes, she did drink. She drank everything she could get \nher hands on to try to relieve that pain. A simple test early on would \nhave determined what was wrong with Billie Robinson.\n  As I said, when I saw her, she had already had the surgery. She \ndidn't speak well. She would speak with very slurred speech, but you \ncould tell this woman was a good woman. She had a good heart. She had \nno alternative, in an effort to live her remaining days in some \ndignity, but to try to seek some type of redress for the negligence of \nthose doctors who had seen her, and she did get some satisfaction. It \nwas not necessary that we go to a jury because those doctors who had \nattempted to treat her realized they had not done their job properly. \nSo she lived out her life in a condition that was not appropriate.\n  Had she had that surgery years before when the tumor was small, she \nwould have been normal. It was not a malignant tumor. By the time they \nwere able to operate, there had been so much damage because of the \ngrowth of the tumor that she had significant brain damage. She was able \nto buy herself a new mobile home and lived a quiet, peaceful life in \nSearchlight.\n\n  Today, I remember Billie Robinson. Had this legislation been in \neffect that the majority is trying to pass today, if it had been in \neffect then, Billie Robinson would not have been able to buy herself a \nnew mobile home. She worked for minimum wage almost all of her life. \nShe would not have been able to have recovered compensation for the \npain and suffering, to any degree, that she went through. She basically \nwould not have had much.\n  Today, I rise in protest. I rise to object to these Republican bills, \nthese two bills that are put here as a result of the insurance \nindustry. These measures before the Senate do not represent a serious \nattempt to improve health care or the civil justice system in our \ncountry. Moving to these bills is a tired political exercise, and the \nSenate should reject this political exercise out of hand. To think, \nwith American consumers paying more than $3 a gallon for gas--the \nrecord is in San Diego, $3.40 today; all over Nevada, it is more than \n$3; the average across the country is $2.95--college tuition moving out \nof the reach of the middle class; to think, with the number of the Iraq \nwar dead now pushing 2,500; to think, with immigration now being a \nsecurity crisis unresolved; to think, with our country's deficit soon \napproaching $9 trillion; to think, with 46 million Americans lacking \nhealth care coverage, that we are moving to bills that are unnecessary \nand will go nowhere? What a waste of the Senate's time.\n  It is wrong that we are doing this. We could more profitably use this \ntime on any of the issues about which I just spoke. We could more \nproperly use the scarce time remaining to address any of these urgent \nchallenges facing America's families. I haven't even mentioned energy. \nWe could do that. And we could address the real health care crisis, not \nthis ``make do'' health care crisis.\n  Both of these bills the Senate will consider today contain the same \none-size-fits-all cap on damages. These bills have been rejected time \nand time again, and rightfully so. Both contain the same unjustified \nprotections for hospitals, rest homes, HMOs, and, of course, insurance \ncompanies. In fact, these proposals are virtually identical to \nlegislation we turned aside three times the last Congress. These bills \nare the same old song, and the votes will be the same old dance: \nDemocrats protecting the American consumer from these huge companies.\n  The top of this company pyramid, of course, is the insurance company, \nthen hospital companies, extended-care facilities, rest homes. Even \nthough these measures would dramatically rewrite the tort laws of all \n50 States and even though they would denigrate the legal rights of \ncountless Americans, they have undergone no serious legislative review \nin this Congress.\n  Don't be fooled by the bill numbers--S. 22 and S. 23--they are simply \nplaceholders for legislative text that was only formally introduced \nlast Wednesday. In fact, the text of these bills was not even available \nuntil a couple of days ago.\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\n  The majority leader used a procedural technique called rule XIV that \nbrings these bills straight to the Senate floor to avoid consideration \nof these bills by either the Judiciary Committee or the Health \nCommittee. There has not been a single committee hearing, not a single \nwitness, not a single opportunity to amend, not a single opportunity to \ncompromise or negotiate. With this insurance industry legislation \nbefore this body, every step of the legislative process has been \nabandoned.\n  Why has the majority proceeded in this manner? Because this is not a \nserious exercise in legislating. It is a political stunt being \nperformed for the sole purpose of allowing Republicans to go back to \ntheir special interest friends led by the insurance industry and say: \nLook what we have tried to do to help, even though they should not be \nfooled by these transparent theatrics because that is all it is.\n  The majority is short-circuiting the committee process because of the \nillusion of medical malpractice crisis. It is an illusion. It doesn't \nexist. Medical malpractice crisis? No. Health care crisis? Yes. There \nis a health crisis, but it has nothing to do with tort laws. It has \nnothing to do with the Billie Robinsons of this world. It has nothing \nto do with the people out there who are struggling to be able to take \ntheir kid to see the doctor, to be able to buy prescription drugs. It \nis a crisis when 46 million Americans have no health insurance, it is a \ncrisis when health insurance is too costly for the average American. It \nis a crisis when medical errors are the sixth leading cause of death in \nAmerica. But not a single provision in this legislation will provide \nhealth insurance to the uninsured, lower health care costs, or make \npatients safer. In reality, the whole premise of the medical \nmalpractice crisis is unfounded.\n  Over the weekend, I read a book. It is an insightful book entitled \n``The Medical Malpractice Myth,'' written by Tom Baker. Who is Tom \nBaker? Tom Baker is not a trial lawyer, he is not a lawyer who \nspecializes in medical malpractice cases. Tom Baker's father and \nfather-in-law are physicians. Tom Baker is a professor of law at the \nUniversity of Connecticut School of Law. He is director of the \nInsurance Law Center at that university. He is not affiliated in any \nway with trial lawyers.\n  In this book, Professor Baker methodically debunks the most common \nmyths in the medical malpractice debate.\n  Myth No. 1: ``Lawyers, not doctors, cause malpractice.''\n  Professor Baker presents numerous studies demonstrating that the real \nproblem is too much malpractice, not too much litigation. Of course, \nmost doctors are skilled professionals and don't commit malpractice, \nbut just as there are a few rotten apples in every basket, there are a \nsmall number of unskilled, uncaring, and negligent physicians in every \nState. Unfortunately, they don't always come to the attention of the \nlicensing boards, and some move from State to State to avoid \ndisciplinary action. These rotten-apple doctors should be held \naccountable, and the victims of their negligence deserve to be \ncompensated, just like Billie Robinson deserves to be compensated.\n  Myth No. 2: ``Lawsuits make health care unaffordable.''\n  That is a myth.\n  Professor Baker demonstrates that medical malpractice rates are based \nmore on the cyclical nature of the stock market than on malpractice \nverdicts. When insurance companies' investments lose money, the \ncompanies raise their rates which they charge doctors to compensate for \ntheir loss.\n  There is no better example that exists than what St. Paul did in the \nLas Vegas, NV, area. In fact, they had a deal. If the Clark County \nMedical Association referred a doctor to them, they gave a kickback to \nthe Clark County Medical Association. They had almost all of the \nmedical malpractice insurance in the Las Vegas area. What happened? \nThere was a general lapse in the economy, the stock market wasn't doing \nwell, real estate wasn't doing well, and they were in big trouble \nbecause they do not make their money with their premiums. They invest \nthe premiums. That is where they make the money. When they make bad \ninvestments, that is when they come in and start talking about how \nunaffordable medical malpractice is. As a result, caps on damages do \nnot reduce insurance premiums in the long run.\n  For the most part, insurance rates have not gone down in those States \nwhich have capped damages. Nevada is a good example. After the self-\nimposed crisis that St. Paul created, the Governor held a special \nsession of the legislature and they set a cap of $350,000 on pain and \nsuffering damages. OB-GYN malpractice premiums are 37 percent higher \nthan in States without caps, general surgery premiums are 52 percent \nhigher, and internal medicine premiums are 44 percent higher. In fact, \nsince 2001, claims paid by Nevada's largest insurer have dropped 16.7 \npercent while premiums have increased almost 33 percent.\n  From 2000 to 2005, the net payouts of malpractice insurers declined \n3.1 percent. But over the same period in which payouts were declining, \nnet insurance premiums were increasing by 93.2 percent. So claims \ndecreased, but the companies more than doubled their premiums.\n  Even if caps on damages did affect malpractice premiums, there is no \nreason to believe that caps would make health care more affordable \noverall.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, malpractice costs \namount to less than 2 percent of overall health care spending. If a \nreduction of 25 to 30 percent in malpractice costs were attainable, it \nwould lower health care costs by only 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent.\n  Myth No. 3: ``Lawsuits deny access to care.''\n  That is a myth. It is only a myth.\n  Despite the century-old complaint that lawsuits drive doctors from \ntheir practices, the medical profession continues to grow each year, \nand applications to medical schools have increased--and they are \nincreasing right now. The number of physicians in the United States has \nincreased every year since 1996, from 738,000 in 1996 to almost 885,000 \nin 2004--less than 2 years ago.\n  In 2003, the nonpartisan General Accounting Office surveyed five \nStates repeatedly cited by the American Medical Association as examples \nof communities suffering from shortages of care because doctors are \nfleeing. The report concluded that such claims are widely overstated, \nand I quote, ``Many of the reported physician actions and hospital-\nbased service reductions were not substantiated or did not widely \naffect access to health care.'' Where doctor shortages exist, they are \ndue to population shifts and the reluctance of doctors to practice in \nrural and low-income areas.\n  In any event, caps on damages do not change the availability of \nphysicians. States without caps on damages have more doctors per capita \nand 14 percent more active physicians than States with caps on damages. \nFor example, the number of OB-GYNs in the United States has increased \nby nearly 25 percent--from 33,000 in 1990 to 42,000 in 2004. But in \nNevada, where we have caps on damages, there are 27 percent fewer OB-\nGYNs than in States that don't have caps.\n  Myth No. 4: ``Lawsuits cause doctors to practice wasteful defensive \nmedicine.''\n  In his book, Dr. Professor Baker devotes a whole chapter to the goods \non defensive medicine. He cites reports from the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the former Congressional Office of Technology Assessment \nthat question estimates of defensive medicine. The Congressional Budget \nOffice specifically concludes that any savings from reducing defensive \nmedicine would be small at best.\n  Myth No. 5: ``Most lawsuits are frivolous.''\n  Anyone who listened to the radio today heard a report that this isn't \ntrue. Take one look at the book ``The Faces of Neglect Behind the \nClosed Doors of Nursing Homes''--and you'll see case after case of \nneglect in these institutions, case after case, horrible pictures of \nthings that were done to these men and women in rest homes. If this \nlegislation passes, don't worry about holding them accountable anymore.\n  Not every lawsuit has merit, but the tort system has plenty of \nmechanisms for weeding out frivolous claims. According to Professor \nBaker, ``[m]ost undeserving claims disappear before trial; most trials \nend in a verdict for the doctor; doctors almost never pay claims out of \ntheir own pockets; and\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nhospitals and insurance companies refuse to pay claims unless there is \ngood evidence of malpractice.'' And that is an understatement.\n\n  At the same time, the assertion that there exists an ``explosion'' in \nmedical malpractice payouts in recent years is simply untrue. The \naverage verdict size is relatively low and has remained stable for many \nyears. A study by Americans for Insurance Reform found payouts have \nbeen virtually flat since the mid-1980s. As it is, Americans use the \ncivil justice system as a last resort, going to court after all their \nefforts have failed.\n  For these reasons, Professor Baker concludes that the medical \nmalpractice crisis is a product of exaggeration and distortion.\n  But even if there were a medical malpractice problem that needed to \nbe cured, these bills are not the right medicine. They are riddled with \nmajor flaws. Let me talk about a few of them.\n  First, they would impose an unreasonably low $250,000 cap on pain and \nsuffering. Proponents of these bills claim that the cap is $750,000, \nbut in the typical case where there is a single negligent party, the \ncap remains $250,000. In cases where the wrong limb is amputated or a \npatient is paralyzed or a mother loses a child, $250,000, I submit, is \ngrossly inadequate. And it is even worse under S. 23. Under this \nlegislation, the life of a woman rendered sterile by gross negligence \nof an OB-GYN is worth less than that of a man mistakenly sterilized.\n  This is bad legislation.\n  Second, these bills discriminate against women in more ways than \nthat. By capping pain and suffering while simultaneously preserving \nfull compensation for lost wages and salary, these bills devalue the \nworth of homemakers and stay-at-home parents. For instance, a homemaker \nwhose reproductive system is destroyed by negligent treatment would \nsuffer only noneconomic losses which are arbitrarily capped by this \nbill.\n  At the same time, the bills limit punitive damages, a change which \ndisproportionally affects women patients. Punitive damages are very \nrare in malpractice cases, but the cases where they do occur often \ninvolve sexual abuse of a female patient. Punitives would be virtually \nimpossible to receive under this legislation.\n  Third, the bills unjustifiably protect large corporations that own \nnursing homes from liability when they abuse or kill their patients. \nThe National Citizens Coalition for Nursing Home Reform released this \nbook, I mentioned earlier, ``The Faces of Neglect; Behind the Closed \nDoors of Nursing Homes,'' which profiles the heartbreaking experiences \nof 36 Americans who have suffered from abuse and neglect while in long-\nterm facilities. These are only a few cases of hundreds and hundreds. \nThe book includes the story of Barbara Salerno, a Reno, NV, woman whose \nfather died due to the neglect of a nursing home. It is a tragic case.\n  The numbers of seniors who could be hurt by this bill are staggering. \nAccording to the GAO, 300,000 elderly and disabled residents live in \nchronically deficient nursing homes where they are ``at risk of harm \ndue to woefully deficient care.'' Nationwide, 26.2 percent of nursing \nhomes were cited for violations related to quality of care by \nregulatory agencies in 2004 alone, yet this bill gives sweeping \nliability protections to these negligent facilities.\n  Fourth, these bills are an affront to federalism. Republicans love to \ntalk about States rights, except when they want to impose a Federal \nsolution on all 50 States. More than half of all States have already \nenacted malpractice reforms, but these bills would override these State \nlegislative decisions. Specifically, this bill preempts those States \nwhich have debated a cap on damages and decided against that step on \ntheir own.\n  For these reasons and many others, the pending bills are \nobjectionable. In fact, the entire concept of medical malpractice \nreform is misguided. The right way to bring down medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums is to reform the insurance industry, which is badly \nin need of oversight.\n  A study commissioned by the Center for Justice and Democracy showed \nthat insurance premiums more than doubled between 2000 and 2004 even \nthough claims for pay-outs remained essentially flat. Given this price \ngouging, it is little wonder that the profits of the Nation's five \nlargest medical malpractice insurers rose by nearly 18 percent last \nyear, more than double the ``Fortune 500'' average.\n  We need to strengthen Federal oversight of insurance industry \npractices that contribute to these rises in malpractice premiums. \nUnfortunately, the insurance industry enjoys almost complete immunity \nfrom Federal antitrust laws, and using this exemption, insurance \ncompanies can collude to set rates, resulting in higher premiums than \ntrue competition would achieve. Federal enforcement officials cannot \ninvestigate any such collusion because of this exemption.\n  I am embarrassed to say this law came about as a result of the Nevada \nSenator McCarran. The McCarran-Ferguson Act. That is, I submit, the \nonly bad thing he did.\n  This act was passed to give a few years of relief to the insurance \nindustry. Now, some 70 years later, insurance companies are the only \nbusinesses--other than Major League Baseball--not subject to antitrust \nlaws. This rationale for this exemption has long since passed. \nInsurance should be like any other business--subject to antitrust laws.\n  Senator Leahy's bill would accomplish this. To pretend these medical \nmalpractice bills have anything do with making health more affordable \nis a cruel joke. These bills override the sound judgment of State \nlegislatures and juries and substitute the arbitrary judgement of an \ninsurance friendly Congress.\n  We should not reward insurance companies making record profits. We \nshould help doctors by reforming the insurance industry rather than \nundermining the legal rights of seriously injured malpractice patients. \nThat is what these would do.\n\n  I am going to vote against cloture. It is bad legislation. I hope \nthat once again, we will help the American consumers and defeat these \ntwo bad bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4123-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4123-S4146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MEDICAL CARE ACCESS PROTECTION ACT OF 2006--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration on the motion to proceed to S. 22, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 422, S. 22, a bill to \n     improve patient access to health care services and provide \n     improved medical care by reducing the excessive burden the \n     liability system places on the health care delivery system, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 1:30 \np.m. until 2 p.m. shall be under the control of the minority, and the \ntime from 2 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. shall be under the control of the \nmajority. The time will rotate in this format until the time from 5 \np.m. to 5:15 p.m. which will be under the control of the majority.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, under the previous order, with \nthe time being allocated to this side, I wish to speak on the Medicare \nprescription drug deadline that is fast approaching 1 week from today. \nSince this week is called Health Week In the Senate, it is strange we \nare not going to be discussing the extension of the deadline of May 15, \na week from today. It is a deadline for all the senior citizens. For \nthose who want to sign up for the Medicare prescription drug benefit, \nthey have to do so by the deadline; otherwise, they get penalized 1 \npercent a month. If they sign up for the wrong plan, they are stuck for \na year and they cannot change plans.\n\n  Of course, senior citizens are having a very difficult time figuring \nout in this multiplicity of plans what the formulary is in a plan, if \nit would cover their prescription drugs. If suddenly they choose a plan \nthat does not cover their prescriptions, they are stuck for a year \nunless they do not sign up, and then they are going to be penalized \neconomically up to 12 percent a year.\n  It is imperative we take up this legislation and extend the deadline \nand provide essential protections for Medicare beneficiaries during the \nfirst year of implementation of this Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  We have been advocating for some period of time providing seniors \nwith a meaningful prescription drug coverage, not one that is overly \nconfusing and\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\none that fails to address the escalating costs of prescription drugs. \nThe plan has passed. It passed several years ago, and it is being \nimplemented. Our job now is to help the seniors who are going to choose \nto enroll in the program, to help them pick the plan that is right for \nthem. The stakes are very high. We must provide them with the time and \nresources they need to make an informed decision.\n  I have spoken with Medicare beneficiaries all across my State of \nFlorida. They are understandably confused. They are concerned about \nthis new prescription drug benefit. They are facing a number of private \nplan options. Sorting through all of these options is difficult for our \nsenior citizens.\n  This is not the first time the senior Senator from Florida has spoken \nin the Senate. I have offered this to the Senate several times. It has \nreceived majority votes, but we have not passed it into law.\n  An example: In my State, there are 18 companies offering 43 \nstandalone prescription drug plans. Each of these different options \ndiffers in terms of premiums, cost sharing requirements, drugs covered, \nand pharmacy access. Sorting through these plans is complicated and \ntime consuming.\n  Further complicating matters, the Medicare drug benefit has been \nmarred by implementation problems. This adds to the confusion for the \nSenators. To give an example, in a rural community where there is only \none pharmacy, seniors naturally want to get their prescriptions from \nthat pharmacy. What happens if that pharmacy is not covered in the \nformulary of the plan they pick?\n  They need time to sort through all of this. Yet the beneficiaries, \nthe Medicare recipients who do not select their plan, 1 week from \ntoday, will face a substantial financial penalty.\n  On the other hand, if we can delay the late enrollment penalties and \ngive a Medicare recipient the chance to change plans once during the \nfirst year, we can make sure our senior citizen constituents are not \nforced to make a hasty decision they are going to regret later.\n  I have introduced S. 1841, the Medicare Informed Choice Act. This \nbill extends the annual open enrollment period under the Medicare \nprescription drug plan through all of this year of 2006. It will not \nimpose a late enrollment penalty and allows a one-time change in plans \nat any point in 2006.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, if we extend the \ndeadline for all of 2006, over 1 million more senior citizens will sign \nup for the program. In addition, another 7.5 million seniors will pay \nlower premiums because they will have fewer penalties. Why in the world \nwould we not be doing this for our senior citizens?\n  A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrates the need \nfor this legislation. In that survey, 4 in 10 elderly Americans still \ndo not know the enrollment deadline for the new Medicare drug benefit \nis May 15. In addition, in that survey, nearly half of all the seniors \nare unaware they face a financial penalty if they delay.\n  This bill I have filed, S. 1841, is a time-limited step to help ease \nthe pressure of the first year of this new prescription drug benefit. \nIt is time to stop playing politics with the health care of our \nseniors. It is time to start putting their needs first.\n  The Senators have heard their citizens back home. They are very clear \nin what they would like us to do. I urge all of our colleagues, every \ntime we bring this up--a majority favor this position, but it is always \nbeat down, saying we have to have the deadline. There is no reason we \nshould put this imposition on our senior citizens 1 week from today \nwhen they are going to pay the penalties.\n  As we have already indicated earlier, I ask unanimous consent in the \nSenate that upon disposition of Calendar No. 417, S. 1955, the Enzi \nsmall business health care bill, the Committee on Finance be discharged \nfrom further consideration of the bill I have just talked about, S. \n1841, and that the Senate proceed then to its immediate consideration. \nThat is my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Alabama, I \nobject. The matter has not been cleared by committee or the Republican \nleadership.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I understand that is the position of the \nmajority.\n  We will continue to fight this out over the course of this week. This \nis ``doing right'' by our seniors. As the Good Book says: Come and let \nus reason together.\n  I am offering an extension for the entire year. We ought to have some \ncoming together, to reason together, on some kind of extension, even if \nit is not for the remaining 6 months of the year in which we can help \nout our senior citizens.\n  I will continue to press this in the course of this week's debate. I \nwill continue throughout, as I have just indicated, to bring up this \nmatter. I will continue to ask unanimous consent from the Senate that \nthis matter be brought to the Senate because of the emergency nature of \nmeeting the deadline a week from today, May 15, to help out our senior \ncitizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with great fanfare, the majority leader \nhas announced this is Health Week in the Senate. This is a week he has \nset to address the Nation's urgent health issues. But there is \nsomething very big missing from this agenda. The American people are \ndemanding action on embryonic stem cell research.\n  In poll after poll, the overwhelming majority of Americans favor \nlifting the President's arbitrary and harsh restrictions on embryonic \nstem cell research. The American people want the Senate to vote on H.R. \n810, a bill passed almost a year ago, 350 days ago to be exact, by the \nHouse of Representatives. It was offered by a Republican, Congressman \nMike Castle from Delaware, and a Democrat, Congresswoman DeGette from \nColorado. It was bipartisan. It passed the House. Yet it has been \nsitting here for nearly a year and we cannot bring it up.\n  How in the world can we have Health Week in the Senate and not bring \nup H.R. 810 and allow consideration of the public's No. 1 health \nresearch priority? Instead we are scheduled to debate three bills that \nhave no chance of passage in the Senate. The majority leader knows it, \nI know it, and the rest of the Senate knows it.\n  It is a gimmick that we are talking about health care. However, we \nwill have bills that somehow excite the political base, get certain \nsegments moving in this political year.\n  The American people want the Senate to address the issue of embryonic \nstem cell research. I tried to explain to my nephew, Kelly, who was \ninjured 26 years ago in a tragic accident on an aircraft carrier. He \nhas been a quadriplegic ever since. He finds it incomprehensible and \ntotally unacceptable that we in the Senate cannot bring up this bill \nand pass it. I tried to explain to him that it is politics. He says \nthis is ridiculous, it shouldn't be Democrat or Republican.\n  This is the most promising revolutionary avenue of biomedical \nresearch, and it is being blocked because of politics? Try explaining \nthat to someone with juvenile diabetes, ALS, Parkinson's, spinal cord \ninjuries.\n  I appreciate the fact that some Republican Senators have been \noutspoken. I see Senator Hatch in the Senate, Senator Specter, and \nSenator Smith urging the majority leader to bring up the bill. Senator \nFrist himself gave an eloquent and courageous speech last summer when \nhe endorsed H.R. 810.\n  Why don't we have it in the Senate? This is Health Week. Bring it up.\n  Leader Frist said last summer:\n\n       Therefore I believe the President's policy should be \n     modified. We should expand Federal funding and current \n     guidelines governing stem cell research carefully and \n     thoughtfully, staying within ethical bounds.\n\n  That is what the majority leader said last summer. I could not agree \nmore. In December, they asked unanimous consent to pass the cord blood \nbill. I spoke on it at that time. We wanted the two to go together. We \nlet the cord blood bill pass--fine, I am all for that--with a promise \nthat we would somehow get a vote on H.R. 810 sometime in this session.\n  This session is almost half over. We have Health Week. Stem cell \nresearch is not on the agenda. That is a shame. Why don't we bring up \nH.R. 810 and debate it? We could have a time limit. The votes are here \nto pass it. We know\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\nthat. We know the votes are here to pass it. Why don't we bring it up?\n  On the President's arbitrary date of August 9, 2001, he said there \nwere 78 stem cell lines. We now know there are only 22. Of those 22, \nall are contaminated with mouse cells. They will never be used for any \nkind of human interventions.\n  The President's policy of August 9, 2001, is a dead end. It offers \nfalse hope to millions of people across America and around the world \nwho are suffering from diseases that could be cured or treated \nthroughout embryonic stem cell research.\n  Scientists have made great advances in deriving the stem cell lines \nsince August of 2001. They have been grown without mouse cells. \nShouldn't our top scientists be studying those lines instead of being \nlimited to the 22 that will never be used in humans?\n  In closing, we do not expect our astronomers to study the heavens \nwith Galileo's telescope. We do not expect geologists to study the \nEarth with a tape measure. It is time we move to the next level of \nresearch to help people who are suffering from ALS, Parkinson's \ndisease, and juvenile diabetes. We should bring up embryonic stem cell \nresearch and pass it in the Senate during Health Week.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I share the frustration of the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa about stem cell research, but I do \nbelieve the majority leader is committed to bringing it up, and I \nexpect him to do that, I hope, within the near future.\n  But today I rise to speak in support of S. 22, the Medical Care \nAccess and Protection Act of 2006, and S. 23, the Healthy Mothers and \nHealthy Babies Access to Care Act. I am a proud cosponsor of both \nbills.\n  These bills address the medical liability and litigation crisis in \nour country, a crisis that is preventing patients from receiving high-\nquality health care or, in some cases, any care at all because doctors \nare being driven out of practice. This crisis is limiting or denying \naccess to vital medical care and needlessly increasing the cost of care \nfor every American.\n  This issue is much more difficult to assess than just studying \nphysicians who leave practice. The more important issue is how \nphysicians are changing their mode of practice and financial structure \nin response to increasing costs from medical malpractice insurance \npremiums.\n  As many know, this crisis began when obstetrician/gynecologists \nstarted getting out of the obstetric care business. Unfortunately, it \nhas now progressed to almost all medical specialties, limiting high-\nrisk/low-return activities, such as emergency room coverage, to limit \nexposure. Just last week, the RAND Corporation reported that over 70 \npercent of emergency rooms in this country do not have adequate \nphysician staffing. And who ends up suffering the most as a result? \nWell, the patient does.\n  In a city such as Salt Lake, where there are academic medical \ncenters, this results in patient cases shifting from lower cost \ncommunity hospitals to the higher cost settings.\n  The chief operating officer of our University of Utah Hospital was in \nmy office recently to discuss the impact of this problem on the \nfinancial stability of the hospital. He told us it is becoming \nincreasingly difficult for his hospital to provide care to the poor and \nuninsured.\n  On the financial side, we are seeing physicians' practices modifying \ntheir financial structure and, in some cases, taking advantage of the \nfact that there is growing demand and diminishing supply in the \nphysician world. Primary care physicians are creating upfront fees for \nservices which also allow for reduced practice size. The bottom line \nis, lacking a different strategy for reimbursement and/or practice \ncosts--a good part of which is driven by malpractice insurance--we are \ndriving private physicians away from traditional settings. Instead, we \nare creating a trend that adversely affects physician access and supply \nand increases costs in other sectors of the health care environment.\n  The Utah Hospital Association president tells me that a major \nhospital system in Utah saw its malpractice premiums increase 300 \npercent in the last 10 years, while at the same time being continually \nrecognized nationally for its outstanding clinical practice.\n  The time to act is now. This crisis is jeopardizing access to health \ncare for many Americans. The medical liability crisis also is \ninhibiting efforts to improve patient safety and stifling medical \ninnovation. Excessive litigation is adding billions of dollars in \nincreased costs and reducing access to high-quality health care.\n  I am really deeply concerned that we are needlessly compromising \npatient safety and quality health care. We know that about 4 percent of \nhospitalizations involve an adverse event and 1 percent of \nhospitalizations involve an injury that would be considered negligent \nin court.\n  These numbers have been consistent in large studies conducted in my \nhome State of Utah, New York, California, and Colorado, just to mention \n4 States. However, the equally troubling statistic is that few cases \nwith actual negligent injuries result in claims and less than one-\nfifth--that is 17 percent--of claims filed actually involve a negligent \ninjury.\n  This situation has been likened to a traffic cop who regularly gives \nout more tickets to drivers who go through green lights than to those \nwho run through red lights. Clearly, nobody would defend that method of \nensuring traffic safety. And we should not accept such an inefficient \nand inequitable method of ensuring patient safety. These numbers are a \nsearing indictment of the current medical liability system.\n  I believe we can do better for the American people. The two bills \nbefore us are important steps in that path.\n  The problem is particularly acute for women who need obstetrical and \ngynecological care because OB/GYN is among the top three specialties \nwith the highest professional liability insurance premiums. This has \nled to many leaving their practices, thus resulting in a shortage of \ndoctors in many States, including my home State of Utah.\n  Studies by both the Utah Medical Association and the Utah Chapter of \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, often called \nACOG, underscore the problem in my State. Over half--50.5 percent--of \nUtah family practitioners have already given up obstetrical services or \nnever even begun the practice of obstetrics at all.\n  Of the remaining 49.5 percent who still deliver babies, 32.7 percent \nsay they plan to stop providing obstetric services within the next \ndecade. Most plan to stop within the next 5 years.\n  An ACOG survey revealed that over half--53.16 percent--of OB/GYNs in \nUtah have changed their practice. They are retiring, relocating, or \ndropping obstetrics because of the medical liability reform crisis. \nThis change in practice leaves 1,458 pregnant Utahns without OB/GYN \ncare.\n  The medical liability crisis, while affecting all medical specialties \nand practices, hits OB/GYN practices especially hard. Astonishingly, \nthree-quarters--76.5 percent--of obstetrician/gynecologists report \nbeing sued at least once in their career. Indeed, over one-fourth of \nOB/GYN doctors will be sued for care given during their residency. \nThese numbers have discouraged Americans finishing medical school from \nchoosing this vital specialty. I know this is the case in my home State \nof Utah.\n  Currently, one-third of OB/GYN residency slots are filled by foreign \nmedical graduates, compared to only 14 percent one decade ago. That is \none-third to 14 percent. OB/GYN doctors are particularly vulnerable to \nunjustified lawsuits because of the tendency to blame the doctor for \nbrain-injured infants, although research has proven that physician \nerror is responsible for less than 4 percent of all neurologically \nimpaired babies.\n  Ensuring the availability of high-quality prenatal and delivery care \nfor pregnant women and their babies--the most vulnerable members of our \nsociety--is imperative. We need to pass this legislation.\n  An August 2003 GAO report concluded that States that have enacted \ntort reform laws with caps on noneconomic damages have slower growth \nrates in medical malpractice premiums and claims payments. From 2001 to \n2002, the average premiums for medical malpractice insurance increased \nabout 10\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\npercent in States with caps on noneconomic damages. In comparison, \nStates with more limited reforms experienced an increase of 29 percent \nin medical malpractice premiums. Overall, the situation has gotten \nworse. In 2004, malpractice insurance costs increased 55 percent; in \n2005, 34 percent; and in 2006, 18 percent. That is 107 percent in just \n3 years. Now, under anybody's measure, that is an unfair cost for \nphysicians to bear for a system that does not achieve the goal of \neither rewarding the most injured patients or improving the safety and \nquality of health care.\n  Medical liability litigation directly and dramatically increases \nhealth care costs for all Americans. In addition, skyrocketing medical \nlitigation costs indirectly increase health care costs by changing the \nway doctors practice medicine.\n  Defensive medicine is defined as medical care that is primarily or \nsolely motivated by fear of malpractice claims and not by the patient's \nmedical condition. According to a survey of 1,800 doctors published in \nthe journal, Medical Economics, more than three-quarters of doctors \nbelieved they must practice defensive medicine. A study of defensive \nmedicine conducted by the current director of the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, Dr. Mark McClellan, before he took office used \nnational health expenditure data and showed that medical liability \nreform had the potential to reduce defensive medicine expenditures by \n$69 billion to $124 billion in 2001, an amount that is between 3.2 and \n5.8 times the amount of malpractice premiums. That amount would be \nsignificantly greater today\n  The financial toll of defensive medicine is great and especially \nsignificant for reform purposes as it does not produce any positive \nhealth benefits. Not only does defensive medicine increase health care \ncosts, it also puts Americans at avoidable risk.\n  Now, there is good defensive medicine and there is bad defensive \nmedicine. But the vast majority of defensive medicine is extra defenses \nin order to have the history of the patient show the doctor did \neverything in his power. Frankly, that leads to more and increased \ncosts every time the doctor has to do extraordinary analyses just to \nmake sure his history has everything he possibly can think of in it, \neven though that is very seldom necessary.\n  Nearly every test and every treatment has possible side effects. \nThus, every unnecessary test, procedure, and treatment potentially puts \na patient in harm's way. Seventy-six percent of physicians are \nconcerned that malpractice litigation has hurt their ability to provide \nquality care to patients.\n  What can we do to address this crisis? The answer is plenty. And \nthere are excellent examples of what works.\n  HHS has reported how reasonable reforms in some States have reduced \nhealth care costs and improved access to and quality of care. More \nspecifically, in States with limits of $250,000 to $350,000 on \nnoneconomic damages, premiums have increased at an average of just 18 \npercent compared to 45 percent in States without such limits.\n  California enacted the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, also \nknown as MICRA, more than a quarter century ago. MICRA slowed the rate \nof increase in medical liability premiums dramatically without \naffecting negatively the quality of health care received by the State's \nresidents. As a result, doctors are not leaving California.\n  Furthermore, between 1976 and 2000, premiums increased by 167 percent \nin California while they increased three times as much--505 percent--in \nthe rest of the country. Consequently, Californians were saved billions \nof dollars in health care costs and Federal taxpayers were saved \nbillions of dollars in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.\n\n  Before coming to Congress, I litigated several medical liability \ncases as a defense lawyer. I have seen heart-wrenching cases in which \nmistakes were made. But, more often, I have seen heart-wrenching cases \nin which mistakes were not made and doctors were forced to expend \nvaluable time and resources defending themselves against frivolous \nlawsuits. And the vast majority of these suits are frivolous.\n  An Institute of Medicine report, ``To Err Is Human,'' concluded that \n``the majority of medical errors do not result from individual \nrecklessness or the actions of a particular group--this is not a `bad \napple' problem. More commonly, errors are caused by faulty systems, \nprocesses, and conditions that lead people to make mistakes or fail to \nprevent them.''\n  We need reform to improve the health care systems and processes that \nallow errors to occur and to identify better when malpractice has not \noccurred.\n  The reform that I envision would address litigation abuses in order \nto provide swift and appropriate compensation for malpractice victims, \nredress for serious problems, and ensure that medical liability costs \ndo not prevent patients from accessing the care they need.\n  So we need to move ahead with legislation to improve patient safety \nand reduce medical errors.\n  Without tort reform, juries are awarding astounding and unreasonable \nsums for pain and suffering. A sizable portion of those awards goes to \nthe attorney rather than the patient. The result is that doctors cannot \nget insurance and patients cannot get the care they need.\n  All Americans deserve the access to care, the cost savings, and the \nlegal protections that States like California and Texas provide their \nresidents. Today's bills will allow us to begin to address this crisis \nin our health care system, give our citizens, especially women and \ntheir babies, access to OB/GYN doctors, and enable physicians to \nprovide high-quality, cost-effective medical care.\n  So I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to \nsupport cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciated the opportunity to listen \nto the statement of my colleague from Utah and hearing of the effects \nthat medical malpractice liability costs are having in his particular \nState. I think all of us in this body could stand on the Senate floor \nand discuss what is happening in our respective States and in our \nrespective regions as we look at how medical malpractice issues are \naffecting access to care and access to quality physicians.\n  Truly, across the Nation, emergency departments are losing staff. \nCritical services are being cut and even trauma units being closed. One \nin seven obstetricians has stopped delivering babies. Countless \nsurgeons are no longer performing high-risk procedures. You have to \nstop and ask the question: What has happened? What has caused this \nbreakdown in our Nation's medical liability system?\n  Skyrocketing medical liability rates are forcing so many of our \ndoctors across the country to stop practicing medicine. It is the \nmillions of patients around the country who suffer when this happens.\n  In the State of Alaska, where our patients, my constituents, live \nthroughout some 586,000 square miles, the situation is chilling. It is \na crisis. We have 25 to 30 percent fewer physicians than our population \nneeds. In fact, Alaska has one of the smallest numbers of physicians \nper capita in the United States. We need a minimum of 500 more doctors \njust to be at the national average of physicians per capita.\n  An American Medical News article recently declared Alaska's \nprecarious situation by stating that ``Alaska has long ranked among the \nworst states in terms of physician supply.'' Just recently, we learned \nabout new deployments with one of our medical units in the Anchorage \narea coming out of Elmendorf. We have had a recent deployment of \nAlaskan military physicians and health care providers, and this month \nwe are losing over 60 health care providers. So the few civilian \nphysicians we have in the area are being asked to absorb some 5,400 \nmilitary and military families into their already strained practices.\n  In certain of the physician specialties, the shortages there are at \neven worse levels.\n  For example, we all know Alaska is a huge State, a State larger than \nTexas, California, and Montana combined. Envision that area. We have \nlost half of our internists. Over one-half of the internist population \nis now gone from the State of Alaska. And, in Alaska, a State where we \nhave the highest rate\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\nof traumatic brain injury in the Nation, we have three neurosurgeons \nfor the entire State. Where do you go? You have to go outside, you go \nto Seattle. But you have to leave the State for that medical care.\n  In Nome, a town in western Alaska where my mother was born, there are \nno anesthesiologists. Nome is the regional hub in the Northwest. There \nare no anesthesiologists. So if you are a woman who is delivering a \nbaby and the condition requires that a C-section be performed, you \ncan't have the C-section done in Nome because there is no \nanesthesiologist. You have to get on a jet and fly an hour and a half \nto Anchorage. These are the situations we deal with in Alaska on a \ndaily basis.\n  Many of these physicians were forced out of practice because they \ncould no longer afford their medical liability premiums. Our physician \nshortage crisis was a key reason that medical liability reform was so \nimportant to Alaska. It was last May, as the legislature concluded its \nbusiness, as they are doing this week, that the Alaska State \nLegislature passed a medical liability reform bill. Like the bills \ncurrently before the Senate, the Alaska bill fully compensates a \npatient for all quantifiable damages, such as lost wages and all \nmedical and future medical costs. And like the legislation we have \nbefore us, the Alaska law places reasonable limitations on \nunquantifiable, noneconomic damages.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries has stated that placing limitations \non unquantifiable, noneconomic damages is ``imperative in stabilizing \nthe physician professional liability insurance marketplace.''\n  Our hope with the new legislation is that the Alaska law will provide \nequitable and predictable settlements in medical injury cases resulting \nin a more stable, professional liability insurance marketplace and, \nmost importantly, it will help us with the recruitment of physicians to \nfill the chronic shortage.\n  I am happy to report that our medical liability reform does appear to \nbe working. Ketchikan General Hospital, for the first time in years, \nhas been able to recruit two new physicians. We have an internist and a \ngeneral surgeon. For the first time also in years, I am told, their \nmedical liability premiums have not increased.\n  Additionally, the Mat-Suu Valley has been able to recruit a \ncardiologist and Anchorage has finally been able to recruit a \nreconstructive surgeon. Both of these physicians fled their states that \nwere in ``liability crisis'' and moved to Alaska where reform has been \nenacted. This is good news.\n  However, this is an issue that has national implications. That is why \nwe in Washington must act now. The bills before the Senate, S. 22 and \nS. 23, are based on a fair and commonsense approach that passed in the \nState of Texas. As a result of the Texas law, physicians are returning \nto that State, particularly in the underserved specialties and \ncounties. Insurance premiums to protect against frivolous lawsuits have \ndeclined dramatically, with the State's largest carrier reporting \ndeclines of up to 22 percent and other carriers reducing premiums by an \naverage of 13 percent. The number of lawsuits filed against doctors has \nbeen cut almost in half.\n  Too many lives around the Nation are threatened or lost because good, \nquality physicians are forced out of their practice. A majority of the \nAmerican public supports medical liability reform and ending lawsuit \nabuse. It is time that the Senate passed effective medical liability \nreform. I am pleased we are at that juncture today.\n  I see the chairman of the HELP Committee. He has done a great job on \nso many of these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for her kind \ncomments. I want to make a few comments about medical liability, and \nthen I want to talk about a bill for which we will be voting tomorrow \nmorning on the motion to proceed. There is not much debate time on that \nso I will try to work in about 5 minutes on it and hope that that will \nconvince everybody it needs to be debated. That is all we are going to \nbe voting on, whether we ought to debate it at all.\n  First, I want to read a little bit from a book entitled ``Fixing Our \nBroken Health Care System.'' It was written by Senator Charles Scott, a \nState Senator from Wyoming. He has been the chairman of the Labor, \nHealth, and Social Services Committee for many years. He was chairman \nof that committee when I served. He writes in his book:\n\n       We in Wyoming are having the problem in one of our \n     communities right now. In 2003 the doctors in Newcastle quit \n     delivering babies. The community is small and the doctors \n     each were delivering between 20 and 25 babies a year. At that \n     rate their malpractice insurance costs had risen to over \n     $1,000 per delivery.\n\n  He does the math to show what the difference would be between \nobstetrics and family health, and divided it by the 20 babies.\n\n       Roughly half of their deliveries are paid for through the \n     state Medicaid program which pays $866.25 per delivery for a \n     normal . . . delivery; the payment increases to $1,401.87 if \n     normal prenatal and post-partum care is provided.\n\n  The cost for them is $1,317, and the most they can get is $1,401.87. \nUsually you get $866. You can see where they are losing money before \nthey pay rent, before they pay the nurses, before they pay themselves a \ndime. They couldn't raise their private rates because in that community \nmost young couples starting a family couldn't afford a higher rate, and \ntoo many were not covered by insurance.\n\n       The economics were clear--the doctors were losing money \n     with each delivery. They dropped the obstetric part of their \n     practice, and now a woman in Newcastle has to be driven 73 \n     miles to Gillette, Wyoming, or 80 miles to Rapid City, South \n     Dakota, to have her baby delivered by a medical doctor.\n\n  You have to remember that we get a little bit of snow out in Wyoming \nsometimes, which can make that journey a little bit hazardous because \nthere is a lot of cost to traveling 73 or 80 miles to have your baby, \nand probably cuts into the prenatal care.\n  I want to devote the remaining couple of minutes I have to talking \nabout the bill we will vote on tomorrow morning with hardly any debate. \nIt shouldn't hardly take any debate because the motion that we will be \ndebating is whether we are going to debate a bill that will provide \nhealth care for small businesses across this Nation, that is supported \nby over 200 small business associations that recognize that there are \nabout 22 million employers and employees out there who are uninsured \nbecause they can't afford it. This bill is designed to give them access \nto insurance. They have none right now. They recognize what they need \nto be able to do is ban together across State lines with their \nassociation to have enough clout to negotiate with their insurance \ncarrier so they can get a lower rate.\n  But what we are talking about now is cloture on a motion to proceed. \nThat allows for about 3 days' worth of debate, normally, before you get \nthe vote. Then when you have the vote, you devote another 30 hours to \ndeciding whether you are going to debate the bill or not. I am hoping \nthe other side will see the need not to have this vote. I know they are \nhearing from their small businessmen. Everybody knows that small \nbusiness is the backbone of the U.S. economy. If they have looked at \nthe polls, they have found that 89 percent of the people in the United \nStates, even after hearing the disadvantage of the old AHP form of this \nlegislation, which is not this legislation, even after hearing those \ndisadvantages, 89 percent said this legislation was needed to save \nsmall businesses.\n  We shouldn't be taking a needless vote. I am hoping it will be \nvitiated in the morning, and we will go ahead with the debate so people \ncan see where the bill is going to go. I have never seen so much money \nspent in opposition to a bill before there was even permission to \ndebate it. And neither have all the people who called me from Wyoming, \nother places in the United States, and in the District. You may have \nheard ads that said: Stop Enzi.\n  It isn't stop Enzi. It is keep small business from being able to get \nreasonable insurance. That shouldn't happen before a debate. That kind \nof thing sometimes happens when a bill is coming out of conference \ncommittee, after it has been amended on the floor of the Senate, after \nit has been amended on the floor of the House, after the two sides have \ngotten together and said: Is\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nthere a solution on which we can agree?\n  If they agree on something that is radical, then this kind of action \nis usually done, not when we are talking about whether we ought to \ndebate it, whether we ought to amend it, where it ought to go, where it \ncan go, and what can be done. This bill needs to be voted on after a \ndebate, not stopped from having a debate.\n  The NFIB collected 500,000 petitions asking for us to debate this \nbill. It isn't the same bill that we have been talking about before, \nthe bill that the House has passed eight times in the past. This is a \ndifferent bill. I got the insurance companies and the insurance \ncommissioners to sit down with the associations and talk about a fair \nway of maintaining State control and maintaining consumer oversight at \nthe State level. I have to say there are a lot of rumors out there. \nThat is partly what PBS did. They reported a bunch of assertions \nwithout verification.\n  We are trying to get that corrected now. But I have never seen a bill \nthat generated so much opposition before it was even debated. I hope we \nwill cut that out and go ahead and vitiate the cloture motion so that \nwe don't have to take the 30 minutes it is going to take to do that \nvote, and get right to the debate and start offering amendments and \ndebate what can be done.\n  That is the process we ought to use. That is the process that we \nnormally use. But I suspect there is a lot of money that can be lost if \nthose small businessmen can actually negotiate against the insurance \ncompanies. I will get into that more when it is the appropriate time, \nnot when we are talking about whether we ought to proceed on the bill \nat all.\n  I see that I have used my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today marks the start of what the majority \nleader has called Health Week in the Senate. We start today with two \ncloture votes because legislation has been brought to the Senate that \ndeals with what is called medical malpractice, or ``medmal,'' reform. \nThe bills we are being asked to consider have not been before a Senate \ncommittee, have not been a part of a committee hearing. They have just \nbeen brought to the floor of the Senate so we can have two cloture \nvotes, both of which will fail. This is about someone wanting to cross \na check off their list of what they feel they must do in the Senate. It \nhardly serves the opportunity to address serious issues. There is a \nway, for example, to address the issue of medical malpractice reform. \nBut it is not this way.\n  I must say, as I said the other day, there are challenges in this \narea, but I think the way to address the challenge of medical \nmalpractice is not to decide that victims of medical malpractice should \nnot be given the opportunity to seek redress. That doesn't make any \nsense to me.\n  Mr. President, there are many things we can and should talk about \nthis week, if this is, in fact, Health Week. When the cloture votes are \nheld later in the afternoon--and both will fail--then my understanding \nis that we will go to the legislation offered by the Senator from \nWyoming. It is further my understanding that the leader will what is \ncalled ``fill the tree''; that is, we will be on that legislation, but \nwe will not be able to offer any amendments.\n  Let me talk about a couple of things. I came to the floor to talk \nabout, during Health Week, the need to deal with something called stem \ncell research. I know that is a controversial issue. But it is one I \nthink the American people deserve to have the Congress address and deal \nwith. Almost 1 year ago--May 24, 2005, to be exact--the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives passed their Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act with \nbroad bipartisan support. It will expand the number of embryonic stem \ncell lines eligible for Federal funding.\n  Back in July of 2005, the majority leader in the Senate made a speech \nand he outlined his support for expanding the number of stem cell lines \navailable for research. He pledged to bring the issue to the floor of \nthe Senate at some point during this Congress. If this is the week we \nare going to be dealing with health care in the Senate, I encourage the \nmajority leader to set aside time for an open and fair debate on stem \ncell research.\n  Embryonic stem cell research holds great promise for addressing some \nof the devastating diseases that we face--diabetes, Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, heart disease, cancer. To shut off or limit medical \nresearch is an unbelievable mistake for this country. I, like many \nothers, have lost loved ones to disease. When I lost a daughter to \nheart disease, I decided that I would never try to placate one group or \nanother by stopping promising research to try to address diseases that \npeople all across this planet face.\n  Embryonic stem cell research is so unbelievably promising. This is \nnot just about some ethereal debate, it is about real people. We have \nabout 400,000 embryos frozen at in vitro fertilization clinics, and \n8,000 to 11,000 of them are thrown away every year. Yes, 8,000 to \n11,000 fertilized embryos that are frozen at the IVF clinics are just \ndiscarded, put in a trash can called ``medical waste.'' Would they not \nbetter be used to advance medical research? One million babies have \nbeen born in this world by in vitro fertilization. It started in \nEngland, called the ``test tube baby.'' One million babies have been \nborn.\n  When we had a hearing in the Commerce Committee about stem cell \nresearch, one of the witnesses was asked the question--in fact, I asked \nthe question. He opposed in vitro fertilization. He said it should not \nhappen.\n  I said: Do you think those 1 million people who were born that way \nshould not have been born?\n  He didn't think they should have been born; it was wrong. There are 1 \nmillion people living among us that are here as a result of in vitro \nfertilization. At the clinics where IVF takes place, the egg and sperm \nare united in a test tube and fertilized in a petri dish for the \npurpose of implanting in a woman's uterus and growing a baby. They \nproduce far more embryos than they need. As a result, you have in \nstorage about 400,000 embryos--400,000--of which 8,000 to 11,000 each \nyear are simply discarded.\n\n  President Bush and others have decided that they shall not be used \nfor stem cell research. I am not talking about the stem cell research \nin which a cell is cloned. That is called somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer. I will talk about that in a moment. I am talking about \nembryos that are going to be thrown in a waste can and discarded. This \nAdministration and too many in this Congress believe these discarded \nembryos cannot and should not ever be used for embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  Let me put a face to this issue and hold up this picture. This is a \nyoung woman I met with recently. This is a picture of Camille Johnson. \nShe is in the middle. She plays the clarinet in the middle school band. \nI have met Camille and her mother several times. She is a volunteer \nwith the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. She gave me something \nthat I keep in my office. This is to describe what this young girl goes \nthrough with diabetes--and I will describe why I am talking about \ndiabetes.\n  This young lady has had some very close calls and serious \nhospitalizations with her diabetes. It is very aggressive. She is poked \nwith a needle every day at 7 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 5 o'clock, and 8 \no'clock--1,460 pokes with a needle to test her blood every single year. \nShe receives 1,095 shots every year. She has to watch her diet every \nday. If she does not keep her diabetes under control, the complications \nare amputation, blindness, kidney failure, heart failure, and death.\n  Why do I describe that? Because there is remarkable research going on \nto use stem cells to treat diabetes. The work that has been done in the \ntransplant of islets to the pancreas is unbelievably important work. \nYet we are told that much of this work cannot continue with Federal \nfunding. Stem cell research has shown such great promise. For example, \nin spinal cord injuries, stem cell research has allowed disabled rats \nwith damaged spinal cords to walk again. It has relieved diabetes and \nParkinson's disease symptoms in mice. It has developed heart cells, eye \ncells, and nerve cells. I was told of a researcher who described, I \nbelieve, two dozen mice in which researchers induced severe heart \nattacks. They injected stem cells back into the heart muscles of those \nmice, and a couple of weeks later nearly all of the\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\nmice not only didn't show severely damaged hearts, which they had after \na heart attack, but they showed no damage to their hearts at all. So \nthere has been unbelievable progress with stem cell research.\n  Yet we are told by some that research should not go forward. Let me \ndescribe for a moment some of the other areas, in addition to embryonic \nstem cell research, that are so controversial: The issue of taking one \nskin cell from one's ear lobe, for example, and putting it into an \nevacuated egg. The skin cell is stimulated to create a blastocyst, or \ncluster of cells, 100 to 200 cells. Those cells can eventually be \ninjected back into your own heart muscle. There has been no fertilized \negg. It is simply your own skin cell that has been stimulated to \nreproduce. Yes, it creates an embryo, but there is no fertilized egg. \nIt creates an embryo that will never become a human being.\n  We are told by some that is murder; you have destroyed an embryo. No, \nthis is about life, about saving lives. Those who want to shut down \nthese promising areas of research, in my judgment, are just dead wrong.\n  The last campaign I ran for office, the first two television \ncommercials that were run by my opponent--the first was about gay \nmarriage, that I voted against amending the U.S. Constitution to \nprohibit gay marriage. I can hardly think that George Washington, \nThomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, Mason and Madison, as they looked at \nwhat they had created as a Constitution, would think: What have we \nmissed here? We need to put something in about gay marriage. I don't \nthink that belongs in the Constitution.\n  The first commercial was of two men kissing, with the message you \nwould expect from the extremists. The second commercial was about a \ncampfire leader sitting around a campfire at night with little kids \nsitting around gathered in front of him. ``Tell us a scary story,'' the \nlittle kid said. Then the campfire leader said, ``Well, there is a man \nnamed Byron''--referring to me, I guess--``and he has a plan to implant \nembryos into mommies' uteruses, wombs, and harvest them later for body \nparts.''\n  That is an unbelievably ignorant television commercial, but that \ncommercial was born of an attempt to distort my position on the issue \nof stem cell research.\n  I am not interested in harvesting body parts. I am not interested in \nthe discussion about murdering embryos. I am interested in a discussion \nabout saving lives and about continuing the kind of promising research \nthat exists that might unlock the mysteries of Alzheimer's disease, \nmight provide a cure for Parkinson's, for diabetes, or heart disease.\n  I am not suggesting there are not some ethical considerations that \nneed to be made with respect to how we do it, and I don't suggest we \nshould discard those issues. But I am suggesting that a country that \nshuts down that research has made a horrible mistake. My point in \ncoming to the floor was, if this is Health Week, then let's talk about \nhealth issues, about the Indian Health Care Improvement Act that has \nbeen stranded. Let's talk about that and bring it to the floor and vote \non it.\n  No group of Americans has more difficult health issues to face than \nNative Americans. Let's talk about that on the floor of the Senate.\n  Let's vote on the proposition the majority put in the prescription \ndrug bill that prohibits the Federal Government from negotiating for \nlower drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry. Let's have that on \nthe floor and vote on that. There are half a dozen of those issues. But \nI speak today about stem cell research. If we are going to be serious \nabout health care and have a health care week, then we ought to talk \nabout this issue.\n  The House of Representatives has already passed a bill. The majority \nleader said we would have a bill on the floor of the Senate, and it \nappears at this point that we will head toward the end of this session, \ndespite the fact there is bipartisan support for legislation that will \ndeal with stem cell research in the appropriate way.\n  I understand this is a serious issue. I don't dismiss the concern of \nothers, nor do I accept, however, that this is somehow a discussion \nabout murder. This is a discussion about saving lives. It is a \ndiscussion about finding cures to devastating diseases. This country \nought to be in the lead when it comes to research that can provide \ncures for diseases. Stem cells provide much of that opportunity.\n  This young girl, Camille Johnson, deserves to have the opportunity to \nhave the very best treatment available. Some of that will come from \nstem cell research. And perhaps we will find a cure for diabetes. \nPerhaps Camille Johnson will not live her life as a diabetic. Maybe \nthrough stem cell research we will find this cure and one day she won't \nhave to take shot after shot to provide her body with sufficient \ninsulin for her to live. Let's hope that is the case.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to voice my concern \nabout the current debate we have begun on the floor of this body. This \nis the fourth time that we in this Chamber have devoted floor time for \nlegislation to restrict the rights of those injured by medical \nmalpractice. Once again, this bill is being considered without any \ncommittee consideration whatsoever, without any hearings examining this \nquestion, and without any attempt to enter into meaningful negotiations \nwith the minority over our very legitimate concerns about this \nlegislation. So to begin with, we are going to take a week of the \nSenate's time to debate a piece of legislation which has not been \nconsidered by committee, has had no hearings and no effort to try to \nreach any kind of a compromise position on critical legislation dealing \nwith medical malpractice.\n  I have always believed that the best public policy comes out of \nconsensus, when we work together as Democrats and Republicans, not when \none side tries to dictate to the other exactly what we are going to \nhave to accept or reject. By bringing together a broad coalition of \npeople, we can and have on many occasions enacted laws and made sure \nthey work as they ought to. Yet, too often these days, we are seeing \ntactics meant to divide rather than to reach any kind of consensus at \nall--tactics, in my view, which have no place in our system of \ngovernance and which will undoubtedly lead to bad public policy, if any \npublic policy at all.\n  I come to this medical liability debate with no prejudgments about \nthe merits of the claims of those who support this legislation. I have \nnever shied away from legal reform when warranted, and most of my \ncolleagues know this. In the past, I have supported reform to class \naction litigation, securities litigation, asbestos litigation, Y2K \nlitigation, and the list goes on. In each and every one of those \ninstances, I worked with Republicans and other Democrats to fashion \ncompromise consensus legislation. We did it on class action, we did it \non asbestos, we did it on securities litigation, and I was pleased to \ndo it with my colleague from Utah, Bob Bennett, on Y2K legislation. Yet \non this occasion dealing with medical malpractice, no effort is being \nmade at all to reach any consensus. No hearings, no committee work, \njust take it or leave it with legislation that is seriously flawed.\n  I have also opposed legal reforms when I believed it was unwarranted, \nsuch as reforms that effectively inoculate gun manufacturers and \nsellers from essentially any and all liability, and I say that as a \nSenator representing a State with the largest number of gun \nmanufacturers in the United States, and one of the largest gun \nmanufacturers in the world. They are wonderful people. I respect them \nimmensely. But the idea that we would take an entire industry and \nexcuse it even from the worst kind of negligence made no sense to me \nwhatsoever.\n  A recent proposal to shield vaccine manufacturers from \nresponsibilities for the safety and effectiveness of their products was \nsomething I opposed as well, since it made no sense to me whatsoever.\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\n  The two bills we are going to consider this week--one to cap \nnoneconomic damages for all medical malpractice cases and one to cap \ndamages in cases involving women and children--fall into the \nlatter category. These are unwarranted proposals, they are unfair, and \nthey are terribly unwise.\n\n  I could quote facts to let my colleagues know how troubled I am about \nthese proposals. The point is very simple. The pillars upon which the \nsupporters of this legislation rest their arguments are deeply flawed. \nAs we heard our colleague from New York, Senator Pat Moynihan, say on \nnumerous occasions: Everyone in this Chamber is entitled to their \nopinions, but they are not entitled to their own set of facts.\n  The facts here are very clear. The fact is the magnitude of this \ncrisis regarding medical malpractice has been drastically overstated. \nThe number of physicians in the United States increased from 814,000 to \n885,000 between the years 2000 and 2004, and the number of OB/GYNs \nincreased from 40,000 to 42,000 in the same period, while the birth \nrate was in decline in many States.\n  What we normally hear is we are losing physicians, people are leaving \nthe profession, OB/GYNs are packing up and moving on to other \nprofessions. The fact is there are more OB/GYNs today than there were \nin the year 2000.\n  We should be looking to rein in health care costs, but the supporters \nof this proposal are looking in the wrong place, in my view. The fact \nis, liability premiums account for less than 1 percent of health care \ncosts. Let me repeat that. Liability premiums account for less than 1 \npercent of health care costs, and yet, when we hear this debate this \nweek, we will hear numbers that bear no relationship to the facts.\n  The fact is that the number of claims and the value of jury awards \nhave not spiked, as some suggest. Between the years 2001 and 2004, the \nnumber of claims filed actually decreased by almost 14 percent, and the \namount that defendants and their insurers are paying for medical \nmalpractice claims, including jury awards and settlements, has not \nincreased in relationship to medical inflation.\n  The fact is that those States which have adopted caps have seen \ngreater increases in premiums than States without caps. Let me repeat \nthat. In those States which adopted caps, they have seen a greater \nincrease in premiums than States without caps. Seven of the 10 States \nwith the highest premiums already have caps. In 2003, premiums actually \nincreased by 17.1 percent for OB/GYNs in States with caps, compared to \na 16.6-percent increase in States without caps on these awards. In \n2004, the average premium for physicians in States with caps was \n$46,733. The average premium in States without caps was $42,563. So, if \nanything, the evidence suggests the caps on patient damages actually \ncorrespond to higher insurance premiums for doctors.\n  Again, these numbers are high. Premiums that are $46,000 or $42,000 \nare extremely large. But if we are going to address the problem, then \nwe ought to address the cause of why these premiums are so high.\n  I could continue to quote a number of these facts to underscore my \npoint, but I think the point is very simple. Again, the facts which the \nsupporters of this bill rest their arguments on are flawed. Again, they \nare entitled to their opinions but not their facts.\n  The number of practicing physicians is on the rise. The number of \nmedical malpractice claims is actually falling. The amount of awards to \nvictims actually lags behind inflation. Malpractice premiums in States \nwith caps are higher than in States without caps. Those are the facts. \nAnd based on this evidence, we are being asked to limit the rights of \ninjured patients. The facts fail utterly to dictate such a conclusion, \nin this Senator's opinion.\n  But if neither the number of claims nor the amount of malpractice \nawards can explain rising premiums, then what is the explanation? What \nis going on? According to several analysts, the increase in premiums \ndoes, in fact, correlate with fluctuations in the stock market and \ninterest rates.\n  One recent study showed premiums closely tracked insurers' economic \ncycles. During good economic times, insurers slashed premiums to \nattract as much business as possible. This is because every new policy \nbrings in an additional so-called float, money to invest in a booming \nmarket. However, when the market turns, the investment returns are \nweak, as has happened in the last few years, and insurers raise their \nrates or, in some cases, leave the market altogether. When this \nhappens, of course, the result is often a crisis in the availability \nand affordability of insurance. This is what we have seen over the past \nseveral years. In fact, with markets showing some improvement, the \nevidence suggests today that premium increases are slowing \ndramatically.\n  The idea of placing caps on noneconomic damages is also unfair. One \nof the bills we are considering today seeks to limit the legal rights \nof a very specific segment of our society, and that is women and \nnewborns.\n  It is important to remember that this bill is going to affect those \nwho have actually been injured by malpractice. This is not just anyone \nwho has a bad outcome, but malpractice. An individual has been accused \nof malpractice. A jury has already decided that they are eligible to \ncollect noneconomic damages, that malpractice has occurred. Somebody \nhas messed up terribly and caused a woman or a child to suffer. That \nconclusion has been reached. Now we are saying we are going to put a \ncap on that damage and limit it only to economic damages. We are \nessentially telling women and infants that their injuries and the \nsuffering they experience as a result are not worth as much as the \ninjuries and suffering of other people in this country.\n  We are going to single out women and children for special \nconsideration, and that is to say: You have been damaged because of \nmalpractice, and here we are going to make it almost impossible for you \nto collect any damage beyond economic damages.\n  Furthermore, these bills do not take into account the extent of \ninjuries and the costs thereof. As a result, they will hurt the most \nseriously injured, those who might receive a noneconomic damage of more \nthan $250,000 were it not for this arbitrary cap.\n  Finally, this legislation is terribly unwise, in my view. Reasonable \nlitigation provides accountability. When health care providers make \nmistakes, they should be held accountable. Placing a cap on noneconomic \ndamages simply removes the incentive for the health care system to \nimprove quality and patient safety, and it does so with no guarantee \nthat there will be any reduction in doctors' medical malpractice \npremiums. In fact, time and time again, insurance companies have \nrefused to commit to lowering premiums, even if a cap is enacted.\n  Last year, for instance, a spokesman for the American Insurance \nAssociation said:\n\n       We have not promised price reductions with tort reform. Six \n     months after Texas enacted a cap like the one we are \n     debating here today, one insurer in that State tried to \n     raise premiums by 19 percent, arguing that noneconomic \n     damages are a small percentage of total losses paid. \n     Capping noneconomic damages would show lost savings of 1 \n     percent or less.\n  I just have a few more comments to make on this issue. I realize I am \nextending my time. I see my colleague from Kentucky and my colleague \nfrom Tennessee are here. Let me just wrap up, Mr. President, and take a \nminute, if I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. There are other things we need to be doing. Information \ntechnology in health care would be a major step forward. I have \nsupported almost every major tort reform piece of legislation here in \nthe last 10 years. I have done it on securities litigation reform. I \ndid it on class action. I was willing to do it on asbestos and on Y2K \nlegislation. In all of those cases, we worked out compromises to make \nsure that what we were doing would make sense.\n  This bill makes no sense whatsoever. The facts show that there is no \njustification for moving in the direction we would be with this piece \nof legislation. I urge my colleagues to reject this proposal and come \nback with a piece of legislation that really would make a difference.\n  If we really want to reduce these kinds of costs, there are steps \nthat can\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nbe taken to allow us to do it. But with this bill, the number of \ndoctors is increasing, the number of OB/GYNs is increasing. States with \ncaps are watching premium costs go up, and States without caps are \nwatching premium costs go down--the exact reverse of what we are \nclaiming we would accomplish with this legislation. The details of my \nstatement make that clear.\n  Again, you are entitled to your opinion but not facts. The fact is, \nwe are going in the wrong direction with this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to step back, allow for some hearings to go forward, allow \nfor people to sit down and look into things as we did with class \naction, as we did with Y2K and asbestos litigation. With those bills, \nwe put together and produced good legislation. This bill is nothing \nlike that and does not deserve to be on the floor without that kind of \nwork.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Akaka are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am here today to stand in strong \nsupport of S. 22 and S. 23. I do so as a Senator from Pennsylvania \nrepresenting a State that has been racked by the consequences of having \na tort liability system that is simply out of balance, out of whack. \nThat imbalance is causing real tragedies to occur on a daily basis in \nthe Commonwealth. People are not getting access to the kind of care \nthey deserve because, as I will lay out in great detail, physicians are \nleaving the State and hospitals are closing down because of the cost of \nawards, in particular in areas that serve high-risk patients in some of \nour communities where there are underserved populations, whether they \nare inner city or very rural. Patients are not getting access, whether \nit is to neurosurgery or high-risk obstetrics or orthopedic care and \nother types of high-risk specialties, and physicians are leaving areas \nin our State, both rural and urban, because of this liability crisis.\n  I had hoped that the Commonwealth itself and our State legislature \nwould have responded to this problem. They have tried on a couple of \noccasions, and the Governor has vetoed legislation to make that happen, \nand so we are here today to try to solve this problem on a national \nlevel.\n  I believe that while Pennsylvania is severely impacted, probably as \nmuch as any State in the country, this is a problem which has national \nimpact. It impacts the Medicare and Medicaid system which this Congress \nand which the Federal Government pay for. So I do believe it is \nappropriate for us to consider it.\n  I wish to make sure that folks understand what we are trying to \naccomplish. I have had people come to me on more than one occasion and \nask questions about why we are trying to limit people's right to sue. \nNo. 1, we are not limiting anybody's right to sue. People can sue a \nphysician or a hospital or a drug company or anybody else in the health \ncare arena. They can sue as many times as they want and as often as \nthey want and for as much as they want. The only thing we are \nattempting to do as far as a limitation in this bill is to limit the \naward in one category of damages.\n  There is, of course, more than one category of damages allowed in \nmost liability suits.\n  Certainly there are economic damages allowed for income loss, so that \nif you lost income as a result of the injury you incurred, you have \nlost the ability to earn future income or some portion of future \nincome, that is fully recoverable. If you have medical bills in the \npast or going forward--for example, let's say you were left without the \nuse of an arm or maybe you ended up in a wheelchair as a result of \nmedical malfeasance on the part of a provider--there is no limit on the \namount of medical recovery you could have. Nothing in the bills we are \nlooking at limit recovery in those areas whatsoever. There are also \npunitive damages that are available. Punitive damages are damages \nagainst someone who does something malicious or willful to harm you in \nthe conduct of providing care, and there is no limit whatsoever on any \npunitive damages in this legislation.\n  All we attempt to do is take one category of damages, which is \nloosely known as pain and suffering, and try to put a cap on that; we \ntry to quantify that. It is very hard to quantify it in the first \nplace, but we are just trying to say that we want to put a cap on that. \nWhy? Why would you want to put a cap on that? Because in some cases, \nyou look at the harm that has been done to somebody and you say: Wow, I \ncan't even think about how much pain or how much suffering or how that \nperson's life has changed, and I would like to help. Well, the reason \nwe need to put some sort of limitation on it is in order to strike a \nbalance between the desire of our fellow citizens, through a jury or \njudge, to compensate someone for the injury they had in exchange for \nthe costs associated to our society and to the medical system, which \nresults in other people not getting care.\n\n  We can go to a recent conference I attended in Philadelphia where it \nwas relayed to me that we have had I think it is nine maternity wards \nin the city of Philadelphia close down over the past few years--nine--\none most recently in northeast Philadelphia and the last one in the \nmost densely populated area of Philadelphia, an urban population, where \nthe OB ward closed down. So if you live in northeast Philly, which is \nagain the largest area population-wise in the city of Philadelphia, \nthere are no hospitals to deliver babies. You have to come into the \nCenter City area or the neighboring county to get obstetrical care. You \nhave consequences. You have consequences of high-risk pregnancies where \npeople do not get to the delivery room on time and mothers and children \nare harmed.\n  One of the reasons I have introduced S. 23, the bill we are going to \nhave a cloture vote on later today in order to proceed, is, in fact, to \nsay that this is of crisis proportion in my State, and even if we can't \ndo a broader bill, let's try to do a narrower bill that deals with the \nissue of mothers and children to make sure there is care for those \nparticularly vulnerable in our population.\n  I had an ER doctor in suburban Philadelphia tell me that just over \nthe last couple of years, they have been able to document I think seven \npeople who have shown up in emergency rooms in suburban Philadelphia \nwith head traumas who were not treated because there were no \nneurosurgeons available on call. There just was no one to come. As a \nresult, seven people are now dead who, had there been someone on call \nand available, without question would have lived. You ask the question: \nWho do the family members of those deceased people sue? The answer is \nthey can't sue anybody. They get no recovery. They get nothing. Why? \nBecause we have a system that rewards a very few--maybe justifiably. I \nam not arguing that their award isn't justifiable. I would probably \nargue for an enormous amount of money, depending on what the injury is. \nThe question is, How do we balance that person's right to be \ncompensated with another person's right in the future to get health \ncare?\n  That is what this attempts to do: balance the rights of those who are \ninjured with the rights of those who will be injured if we don't limit \nthose first rights. We see that happening every day in Pennsylvania, \nand that is one of the reasons I feel so passionate about bringing this \nlegislation to the floor and trying to attempt to do something here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  What we do in trying to limit rights is actually different from what \nwe have done in the past here. We try to limit the ability to recover--\nnot the right to sue but the ability to recover--in some small way. It \nmost cases, it will be a small way.\n  What this does is it provides certainty in the insurance market. \nRight now, you have a category of damages called pain and suffering. I \nthink if you asked 100 people how much suffering--if you took a case \nand said: How much should this person be awarded for this much \nsuffering, would you get 100 different answers. It is hard to insure \nagainst those 100 different answers about what a judge or a jury is \ngoing to do. So by putting a limit here, you are\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nthen able to quantify for insurance purposes and allow insurance \ncompanies to offer reasonable insurance packages for physicians and \nhospitals, and you put physicians in--this is also important--you put \nphysicians in a position where they are not simply practicing defensive \nmedicine, which drives up the cost of health care precipitously.\n  The cap we are talking about here is a $250,000 cap on a physician, a \n$250,000 cap additionally on the health care provider, on the \ninstitution where the care is provided. If there is more than one \ninstitution, it is a total cap of $500,000, so two or more institutions \ncould combine, for a total of $500,000. So it is a $750,000 total cap, \nwhich is three times what we voted on here last session of Congress.\n  So this is a much higher cap. I have said in the past, both on the \nfloor and around my State, that I thought the $250,000 cap was a bit \nlow, and I feel more comfortable with this cap, and it allows \nflexibility for the States to do something different. This just takes \ncare of situations where there aren't any caps in place by the State.\n  So I think we have a situation where we have a bill that puts in a \nreasonable limitation on damages. Even though I certainly can make the \nargument that there may be cases where this would be a difficult limit, \nit is a balance between limiting somebody's recovery and making sure \nthat by doing so, you have access to care for other people who will be \nharmed if we don't limit that recovery.\n  I want to talk about the situation specifically in Pennsylvania. This \nis a tragic situation that we have seen evolve over the past several \nyears where the liability costs have just gone through the roof. We \nhave a situation where, if you look between 1999 and 2005, the 20 most \npopulous States saw a 15-percent to 35-percent increase in the number \nof Medicare physicians. In Pennsylvania we saw a 10-percent decline in \nthe number of physicians available to treat Medicare patients.\n  The number of doctors in training who stayed in Pennsylvania? In \nPennsylvania we are very blessed with a lot of great medical schools. \nWe train a lot of physicians and train a lot of health care workers \ngenerally in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and in between. Twelve years \nago, in 1994, we had a rate of about 50 percent of all the physicians \nwe trained in Pennsylvania stayed in Pennsylvania. Two years ago it was \n7.8 percent. We went from 13th in the country, during this time, of the \npercentage of physicians under the age of 35--we were 13th in the \ncountry in the percentage of physicians under the age of 35. Today we \nare 45th in the country in the percentage of physicians under the age \nof 35. We have older and older doctors; fewer and fewer are staying. \nThis is a crisis. It is horrible now. It is only going to get worse if \nwe do not do something about it.\n  Why? If you look at it, the payouts have skyrocketed from $180 \nmillion in 1991 to $450 million 2 years ago. The average liability \npayout per physician--the average is $6,000 nationwide. It is $16,000 \nin Pennsylvania, almost three times as much. This is a serious problem \nin our State.\n  We are looking to Washington, DC, to help. They are saying just in a \ncouple of years we could have a shortfall of nearly 10,000 physicians \nin the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. So this is a pressing problem, one \nI hope we can get to.\n  Just allow us to bring up the bill, allow us to debate. Here we are, \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world. We have a huge problem in \nmy State, and I suggest we have others stand up and talk about the \nproblem in their States. If you don't like the solution we have put \nforward, then let's have a debate. Let's have some amendments. Let's \ntalk about how we can change the bill around to move it forward. But \nnot allowing us to bring it up is not a reasonable alternative.\n  We have heard from folks in our State. This is a petition. We have \ngotten a whole bunch. I just wanted to reproduce one of the hundreds of \npetitions we have received, particularly focused on what is going on \nwith our obstetrical care. These are citizens, in this case, from West \nReading, PA, who said:\n\n       Every day OBGYNs are closing doors because of America's \n     medical liability crisis. Is yours next? We the undersigned \n     are in favor of keeping women's health care availability and \n     strongly urge Congress to enact meaningful legislative \n     relief.\n\n  That is what we are trying to accomplish today. It is amazing, the \neffect of this on--I always say physicians, but it is health care \nprofessionals, not just physicians. ``One-third of residents''--\n  This is from the Department of Health Policy and Management in the \nHarvard School of Public Health. They did some surveys and talked to \nphysicians out in our State. It says:\n\n       One-third of residents in their final or next to last year \n     of residency planned to leave Pennsylvania because of the \n     lack of availability of affordable malpractice coverage. . . \n     . Those who are about to leave Pennsylvania named malpractice \n     cost as the primary reason three times more often than any \n     other factor.\n\n  I met with a woman graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in \nthoracic surgery. She had a decision to make: to come to Washington DC, \nor stay in Philadelphia. She is from Philadelphia; her family is there. \nShe wants to stay. The cost of malpractice insurance in Washington is \n$4,000 for her specialty. In Philadelphia, $40,000, 10 times the \namount, plus the complexity of not being able to practice the medicine \nshe wants to practice.\n\n       Seventy-one percent of residency program directors reported \n     a decrease in retention of residents in the state since the \n     onset of the professional liability crisis. For some programs \n     the decreases were very large.\n       An environment of mounting liability costs in Pennsylvania \n     appears to have dissuaded substantial numbers of residents in \n     high risk specialties from locating their clinical practices \n     in the state.\n\n  This is a serious problem. I am going to talk about it some more. We \nprobably are not going to be successful today, but I will be back on \nthe floor, not just today but in the future to continue to talk about \nthis critical crisis that we have in our commonwealth. It is not just \nabout making sure that we have reasonable malpractice rates. It is \nabout access to care. It is about people who are going to be hurt and \nare going to die because we have not put this medical liability system \nin balance. We need to do so and it would be a great start if the \nSenate would allow us to proceed to that debate today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor his observations, not only about the state of medical care access \nin Pennsylvania, but across the Nation. I would like to make some \nobservations about the situation in Kentucky and across the Nation as \nwell.\n  I am obviously here to support the Medical Care Access Protection \nAct. On several occasions in recent years this body has attempted to \ndebate commonsense reforms to our medical liability system--a system \nthat we all know is increasing health care costs and limiting patients' \naccess to care.\n  Unfortunately, the minority party's obsession with obstructionism has \nprevented this body from even considering medical liability reform. But \nthe problem of patients not getting the care they need is simply not \ngoing to go away on its own. The Senate needs to act, and act now.\n  Passing the Medical Care Access Protection Act would leave doctors \nfree to go where the patients are, not just where the lawyers aren't. \nLet me turn briefly to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Like 20 other States across our Nation, we, in Kentucky, are facing a \nmedical liability crisis. In past years, I have shared stories of \ndoctors who left Kentucky, of hospitals that have closed their \nmaternity wards, and of women who have been denied access to care \nbecause their doctors could no longer afford the medical liability \npremiums.\n  I wish I could tell my colleagues that I was out of such stories; \nthat the problem had fixed itself. Unfortunately, that is not the case. \nThe minority has not allowed this body to act, and the problem has not \ngone away. So today I would like to share a story that ran earlier this \nyear in my hometown newspaper, the Louisville Courier-Journal, back on \nJanuary 29.\n\n       Rashelle Perryman's first two babies were born at \n     Crittenden County Hospital in Marion, KY, about 10 minutes \n     from her home. But her third child, due in June, is to be \n     born in Madisonville, 40 miles away in Hopkins County, \n     because rising malpractice insurance rates caused doctors at \n     the Crittenden County Hospital to stop delivering babies last \n     year.\n       That forced the hospital to drop obstetrical services and \n     Ms. Perryman to find a new doctor.\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\n       ``I don't like it at all,'' she said about having to give \n     birth in another county. She's a nurse at Crittenden County \n     Hospital and its former obstetrics supervisor.\n\n  So she knows a good bit about the subject matter.\n\n       With Perryman's first two deliveries, ``I knew everybody \n     here in the hospital, and I was comfortable,'' she said. \n     ``And now I am going somewhere where I don't know anybody, or \n     how anything's done.''\n\n  Ms. Perryman will have to travel a long 40 miles to deliver her \nchild. Just to put her plight in perspective, 40 miles is about the \nsame distance from the Capitol to downtown Baltimore. I know we will \nall hope for a safe delivery for Ms. Perryman, but what if there are \ncomplications along the way? Wouldn't it be better for both Ms. \nPerryman and her baby if they could still go to their local hospital, \nrather than driving 40 miles down the road?\n  Would any Member of the Senate want his wife, or his or her daughter, \nto have to drive as far as Baltimore in a similar circumstance?\n  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated problem within this one \nKentucky community. Our Lady of Bellefonte in Ashland, KY, and Knox \nCounty Hospital in eastern Kentucky have also stopped delivering \nbabies. They are not delivering babies anymore. Patients in west \nKentucky who need the services of an emergency neurosurgeon frequently \nmust be transferred to St. Louis or Nashville because there are not \nenough neurosurgeons to staff the hospitals in Paducah around the \nclock.\n  From 2000 to 2004, the number of practicing OB/GYNs in the country \nfell from 504 to 473. Among those OB/GYNs who have remained in the \nState, fewer and fewer of them are still willing to deliver babies. \nEven among those who are staying in the State, fewer of them are \nwilling to deliver babies.\n  The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology report that 18 \npercent of Kentucky OB/GYNs have stopped delivering babies entirely. \nNearly one-third of OB/GYNs, 31 percent, have limited the number of \n``high-risk'' expectant mothers they will see for liability reasons.\n  So even among those who are still willing to deliver babies, they are \nsort of preselecting the mothers based upon the riskiness of the \nprocedure and parceling out those who are more risky to someone else or \nsome other community or whoever will accept the liability potential.\n  The Kentucky Medical Association reviewed State and hospital records \nand found that only 426 doctors in Kentucky delivered babies last year. \nThat is down 79 doctors from 1 year before.\n  Let me say that again. We have in Kentucky gone down to 426 doctors \nwho delivered babies last year, down 79 from the year before.\n  As I have noted in the past, 66 of Kentucky's 120 counties have no \nOB/GYNs at all. The red counties on the map, all across my State, from \neast to far west--the red counties have no OB/GYNs at all; 66 out of \n120 counties. Over half of our counties have no OB/GYNs at all.\n  What does this mean to the patients? I think it is rather obvious. It \nmeans that patients such as Ms. Perryman, on one of the most \nchallenging but important days of her life, will need to travel far \nfrom home to deliver her baby.\n  This problem extends far beyond Kentucky's borders. In his State of \nthe Union Address this year, President Bush noted that 1,500 American \ncounties have no OB/GYN. So these 66 counties in Kentucky are not \nunique; 1,500 counties across America don't have a single OB/GYN.\n  As the map next to me shows, the American Medical Association reports \nthat 21 States are now facing a full-blown medical liability crisis.\n  The red States have a full-blown medical liability crisis--21 of \nthem. A few years ago, there were just 12. You will notice Texas, Mr. \nPresident? Texas is an interesting State to note. It is getting itself \nout of the crisis stage, heading in the direction of being a State not \nin crisis, as a direct result of legislation similar to what we are \nsuggesting be enacted on the Federal level.\n  So we know the Texas reforms work because we see Texas now moving \nfrom a State in crisis to a State that is effectively reforming and \nbasically halting the crisis.\n  An example of a State with a serious problem still is Arizona. Some \nof my colleagues might recall the story of one Arizonan, Melinda \nSallard, from a few years ago. In 2002, the administrators at Copper \nQueen Community Hospital College in Brisbee, AZ, were forced to close \ntheir maternity ward because their doctors' insurance premiums had \nrisen by 500 percent; 500 percent. A few months later, Melinda awoke at \n2 o'clock in the morning with sharp labor pains. Since her local \nhospital stopped delivering babies because of the medical liability \ncrisis, Melinda and her husband were faced with a 45-mile drive to \nSierra Vista in order to reach the nearest hospital with a maternity \nward.\n  As many of us who are parents know, babies don't always wait for the \nhospital, particularly when that hospital is almost an hour away.\n  Melinda gave birth to her daughter in a car on a desert highway \nleading to Sierra Vista.\n  When the child was born, she wasn't breathing. Her levelheaded mother \ncleared the child's mouth and performed CPR. After resuscitating the \ninfant, Melinda wrapped her in a sweater, and the new family completed \nthe journey to Sierra Vista.\n  Thankfully, both mother and daughter survived. However, it is clearly \nunacceptable that expectant mothers should be forced to drive past a \nperfectly good hospital and continue on 45 miles through the desert to \ndeliver a child.\n  We have here a picture of the mother and daughter, and in that \nparticular instance, because of a particularly alert mother, we were \nable to avert a crisis.\n  There are commonsense reforms the Senate can adopt that will lower \nmedical liability premiums and allow doctors to continue their \nlifesaving work. In past years, the Senate has considered legislation \nmodeled after the successful MICRA reforms out in California that have \ncontained medical liability premiums for more than 25 years. I have \nsupported those efforts, but we are taking a different approach this \nyear and we are modeling this legislation offered by Senators Santorum, \nEnsign, and Gregg on the Texas reforms to which I referred a few \nmoments ago. The Texas reforms are a little more generous, and they \nalso are clearly working to get the right result.\n  It is important to remember that under any of this legislation, \npatients would be allowed to recover 100 percent of their economic \ndamages. This can include hospital bills, lost wages, therapy, and \nrehabilitation costs, and a wide variety of additional expenses a \nvictim might incur.\n  In an attempt to reach a compromise on the contentious issue of non-\neconomic damages, the Medical Care Access Act includes, as I said, \nTexas's tiered cap on non-economic damages that could allow a patient \nto recover as much as three-quarters of a million dollars. That is \nthree times the amount of non-economic damages that was available under \nlegislation we previously considered here in this Senate.\n  Our colleagues across the aisle have indicated they would not \nconsider legislation that would limit non-economic damages at $250,000. \nThis bill does not have that limitation. Hopefully, a limitation on \nnon-economic damages alone of three-quarters of a million dollars will \nbe more acceptable.\n  This legislation also includes important reforms, such as ``fair \nshare liability,'' limits on lawyers' fees, and collateral source \nreforms that have been a part of previous proposals here in the Senate.\n  This problem is not going to go away on its own. The Senate has an \nopportunity to act. I hope we will, in fact, vote cloture and get to \nthis legislation. If there are amendments to be offered, fine. Let us \nhave votes and move in the direction of addressing this serious \nnational health care problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this legislation, S. 22, is not a serious \nattempt to address a significant problem being faced by physicians in \nsome States. It is the product of a party caucus rather than the \nbipartisan deliberations of a Senate committee. It was designed to \nscore political points, not to achieve the bipartisan consensus which \nis needed to enact major legislation. In fact, the legislative language \nwas not even available for review until late last\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\nweek. For these reasons, it does not deserve to be taken seriously by \nthe Senate.\n  We must reject the simplistic and ineffective responses proposed by \nthose who contend that the only way to help doctors is to further hurt \nseriously injured patients. Unfortunately, as we saw in the Patients' \nBill of Rights debate, the Bush administration and congressional \nRepublicans are again advocating a policy which will benefit neither \ndoctors nor patients, only insurance companies. Caps on compensatory \ndamages and other extreme ``tort reforms'' are not only unfair to the \nvictims of malpractice, they do not result in a reduction of \nmalpractice insurance premiums.\n  Not only does this legislation fail to do what it claims, but it \nwould do many things that its authors are attempting to conceal. In \nreality, this legislation is designed to shield much of the health care \nindustry from basic accountability for the care it provides. While \nthose across the aisle like to talk about doctors, the real \nbeneficiaries will be insurance companies and large health care \ncorporations. This amendment would enrich them at the expense of the \nmost seriously injured patients; men, women and children whose entire \nlives have been devastated by medical neglect and abuse.\n  S. 22 would drastically limit the financial responsibility of the \nhealth care industry to compensate injured patients for the harm they \nhave suffered. This legislation is extremely broad in its scope. It \ndefines a ``health care liability claim'' as any claim ``based upon the \nprovision of, use of, or payment for--or the failure to provide, use, \nor pay for--health care services.''\n  It is attempting to use the sympathetic family doctor as a Trojan \nhorse concealing an enormous array of special legal privileges for \nevery corporation which provides a health care service, or insures the \npayment of a medical bill. For example, this proposal would shield HMOs \nand health insurers that refuse to provide needed care. Less \naccountability will never lead to better health care.\n  Every provision of this bill is carefully designed to take existing \nrights away from those who have been harmed by medical neglect and \ncorporate greed.\n  This legislation would deprive seriously injured patients of the \nright to recover fair compensation for their injuries by placing an \narbitrary cap on how much they can receive for non-economic loss, that \nis for the very real pain and suffering these victims experience every \nday. This cap only serves to hurt those patients who have suffered the \nmost severe, life-altering injuries and who have proven their cases in \ncourt.\n  They are the paralyzed, the brain-injured, and the blinded. They are \nthe ones who have lost limbs, organs, reproductive capacity, and in \nsome cases even years of life. These are life-altering conditions which \ndeprive a person of the ability to engage in many of the normal \nactivities of day to day living. It would be terribly wrong to take \ntheir rights away. The Bush administration talks about deterring \nfrivolous cases, but caps by their nature apply only to the most \nserious cases which have been proven in court.\n  A person with a severe injury is not made whole merely by receiving \nreimbursement for medical bills and lost wages. Noneconomic damages \ncompensate victims for the very real loss in quality of life that \nresults from a serious, permanent injury. It is absurd to suggest that \n$250,000 is fair compensation for a person paralyzed for life.\n  The sponsors of this bill claim that they have increased the cap from \n$250,000 to $750,000. But that claim is very misleading. The $250,000 \nlimit would still apply to the overwhelming majority of malpractice \nvictims, no matter how severe their injuries. The $750,000 limit would \napply only to the small number of cases in which three different \ndefendants--one doctor and two health care institutions--were all \nresponsible for the victim's injury. It would not even apply in cases \nwhere three doctors all committed malpractice. In reality, nothing has \nchanged from prior Republican bills. Nearly all victims would still be \nprohibited from receiving more than $250,000 for their injuries.\n  Caps are totally arbitrary. They do not adjust the amount of the \ncompensation ceiling with either the seriousness of the injury, or with \nthe length of years that the victim must endure the resulting \ndisability. Someone with a less serious injury can be fully compensated \nwithout reaching the cap.\n  However, a patient with severe, permanent injuries is prevented by \nthe cap from receiving full compensation for their more serious \ninjuries. Is it fair to apply the same limit on compensation to a \nperson who is confined to a wheelchair for life that is applied to \nsomeone with a temporary leg injury?\n  Caps discriminate against younger victims. A young person with a \nsevere injury such as paralysis must endure it for many more years than \nan older person with the same injury. Yet that young person is \nprohibited from receiving greater compensation for the many more years \nhe will be disabled. Is that fair?\n  Caps on noneconomic damages discriminate against women, children, \nminorities, and low income workers. These groups do not receive large \neconomic damages attributable to lost earning capacity.\n\n  Women who are homemakers and caregivers for their families sustain no \nlost wages when they are injured, so they only receive minimal economic \ndamages. Should a woman working in the home receive less compensation \nfor the same injury than a woman working outside the home? Is that \njust?\n  A seriously injured child may be confined to his or her home for \nyears of painful recuperation, but that child has no lost wages. Should \nhe get less compensation than an adult with a similar injury? Is that \nfair?\n  Noneconomic damages--compensation for lost quality of life--is \nparticularly important to these vulnerable populations.\n  In addition to imposing caps, this legislation would place other \nmajor restrictions on seriously injured patients seeking to recover \nfair compensation. At every stage of the judicial process, it would \nchange long-established judicial rules to disadvantage patients and \nshield defendants from the consequences of their actions.\n  First , it would abolish joint and several liability for all damages. \nThis means the most seriously injured people may never receive all of \nthe compensation that the court has awarded to them. They may not even \nreceive full payment for their lost wages and medical bills. Under this \nprovision, health care providers whose misconduct contributed to the \npatient's injuries will in many cases be able to escape responsibility \nfor paying full compensation to that patient.\n  Second, the bias in the legislation could not be clearer. It would \npreempt State laws that allow fair treatment for injured patients, but \nwould allow State laws to be enacted which contained greater \nrestrictions on patients' rights than the proposed Federal law. This \none-way preemption contained in section 11(c) shows how result-oriented \nthe legislation really is. It is not about fairness or balance. It is \nabout protecting defendants.\n  Third, the amendment preempts state statutes of limitation, cutting \nback the time allowed by many States for a patient to file suit against \nthe health care provider who injured him. Under the legislation, the \nstatute of limitations can expire before the injured patient even knows \nthat it was malpractice which caused his or her injury.\n  Fourth, it places severe limitations on when an injured patient can \nreceive punitive damages, and how much punitive damages the victim can \nrecover. Under the bill, punitive damages can only be awarded if the \ndefendant acted ``with malicious intent to injure'' or ``deliberately \nfailed to avoid unnecessary injury.'' This is far more restrictive than \ncurrent law. It entirely prohibits punitive damages for ``reckless'' \nand ``wanton'' misconduct, which the overwhelming majority of States \nallow. In the very small number of cases where punitive damages would \nstill be allowed, the bill would cap them at twice the amount of \neconomic damages, no matter how egregious the defendant's conduct and \nno matter how large its assets.\n  Fifth, it imposes unprecedented limits on the amount of the \ncontingent fee which a client and his or her attorney can agree to--\nlimiting it to 15 percent of most of the recoveries. This will make it \nmore difficult for injured patients to retain the attorney of their \nchoice in cases that involve complex legal issues. It can have the \neffect of denying them their day in court. Again\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\nthe provision is one- sided, because it places no limit on how much the \nhealth care provider can spend defending the case.\n  If we were to arbitrarily restrict the rights of seriously injured \npatients as the sponsors of this legislation propose, what benefits \nwould result? Certainly less accountability for health care providers \nwill never improve the quality of health care. It will not even result \nin less costly care. The cost of medical malpractice premiums \nconstitutes less than two-thirds of 1 percent, 0.66 percent, of the \nNation's health care expenditures each year. For example, in 2004, \nhealth care costs totaled $1.88 trillion, while the total cost of all \nmedical malpractice insurance premiums was $11.4 billion. Malpractice \npremiums are not the cause of the high rate of medical inflation. This \nbill will not make health care more affordable.\n  The White House and other supporters of caps have argued that \nrestricting an injured patient's right to recover fair compensation \nwill reduce malpractice premiums. But, there is scant evidence to \nsupport their claim. In fact, there is substantial evidence to refute \nit.\n  Between 2000 and 2003, there were dramatic increases in the cost of \nmedical malpractice insurance in States that already had damage caps \nand other restrictive tort reforms on the statute books, as well as in \nStates that did not. No substantial increase in the number or size of \nmalpractice judgments suddenly occurred which would have justified the \nenormous increase in premiums that many doctors were being forced to \npay. Now rates have stabilized, again both in States with and States \nwithout damage caps.\n  Comprehensive national studies show that medical malpractice premiums \nare not significantly lower on average in States that have enacted \ndamage caps and other restrictions on patient rights than in States \nwithout these restrictions. Insurance companies are merely pocketing \nthe dollars which patients no longer receive when ``tort reform'' is \nenacted.\n  Let's look at the facts. Slightly more than half of the States have a \ncap on medical malpractice damages. Many of them have had those \nstatutes for a substantial number of years. The other half of States do \nnot have a cap on malpractice damages. The best evidence of whether \nsuch caps affect the cost of malpractice insurance is to compare the \nrates in those two groups of States. Based on data from the Medical \nLiability Monitor on all 50 States, the average liability premium in \n2005 for doctors practicing in States without caps on malpractice \ndamages $45,719--was actually lower than the average premium for \ndoctors practicing in States with caps, $51,405. There are many reasons \nwhy insurance rates vary substantially from State to State. This data \ndemonstrates that it is not a State's tort reform laws which determine \nthe rates. Caps do not make a significant difference in the malpractice \npremiums which doctors pay. This is borne out by a comparison of \npremium levels for a range of medical specialties.\n  The average liability premium in 2005 for doctors practicing internal \nmedicine was more--18.7 percent more--for doctors in States with caps \non malpractice damages--$16,212--than in States without caps on \ndamages--$13,658. Internists actually pay more for malpractice \ninsurance in States that have caps.\n  The average liability premium in 2005 for general surgeons was more--\n19.4 percent more--for doctors in States with caps--$57,662--than \nStates without caps--$48,267. Surgeons are paying more for malpractice \ninsurance in the States that have caps.\n  The average liability premium for OB/GYN physicians in 2005 in States \nwith caps--$80,341--was also more than for doctors in States without \ncaps--$75,233. OB/GYNs in States with caps paid slightly more--7 \npercent more--than in States without caps.\n  Clearly, a State's tort laws do not determine that State's medical \nmalpractice insurance rates.\n  This evidence demonstrates that capping malpractice damages does not \nbenefit the doctors it purports to help. It only helps the insurance \ncompanies earn even bigger profits. As Business Week Magazine concluded \nafter reviewing the data at the height of the malpractice rate crisis \n``the statistical case for caps is flimsy.''\n  In 2003, Weiss Ratings, Inc., a nationally recognized financial \nanalyst, conducted an in-depth examination of the impact of capping \ndamages in medical malpractice cases. Their conclusions sharply \ncontradict the assumptions on which this legislation is based. Weiss \nfound that capping damages does reduce the amount of money that \nmalpractice insurance companies pay out to injured patients. However, \nthose savings are not passed on to doctors in lower premiums.\n  The Weiss Report, stated:\n\n       Since the insurers in the states with caps reaped the \n     benefit of lower medical malpractice payouts, one would \n     expect that they would reduce the premiums they charged \n     doctors. At the very minimum, they should have been able to \n     slow down the premium increases. Surprisingly, the data show \n     they did precisely the opposite.\n\n  Between 1991 and 2002, the Weiss analysis shows that premiums rose by \nsubstantially more in the States with damage caps than in the States \nwithout caps. The 12-year increase in the median annual premium was \n48.2 percent in the States that had caps, and only 35.9 percent in the \nStates that had no caps. In the words of the report:\n\n       On average, doctors in States with caps actually suffered a \n     significantly larger increase than doctors in states without \n     caps . . . In short, the results clearly invalidate the \n     expectations of cap proponents.\n\n  Since malpractice premiums are not significantly affected by the \nimposition of caps on recovery, it stands to reason that the \navailability of physicians does not differ between States that have \ncaps and States that do not. AMA data shows that there are 283 \nphysicians per 100,000 residents in States that do not have medical \nmalpractice caps and 249 physicians per 100,000 residents in States \nwith caps. Clearly there is no correlation.\n  If a Federal cap on noneconomic compensatory damages were to pass, it \nwould sacrifice fair compensation for injured patients in a vain \nattempt to reduce medical malpractice premiums. Doctors will not get \nthe relief they are seeking. Only the insurance companies, which \ncreated the problem, will benefit.\n  Insurance industry practices were responsible for the sudden dramatic \npremium increases which occurred in some States between 2000 and 2003. \nThe explanation for these premium spikes can be found not in \nlegislative halls or in courtrooms, but in the boardrooms of the \ninsurance companies themselves.\n  There were substantial increases in a number of insurance lines, not \njust medical malpractice, during that period. Insurers make much of \ntheir money from investment income. Interest earned on premium dollars \nis particularly important in medical malpractice insurance because \nthere is a much longer period of time between receipt of the premium \nand payment of the claim than in most lines of casualty insurance. The \nindustry creates a ``malpractice crisis'' whenever its investments do \npoorly. The combination of a sharp decline in the equity markets and \nrecord low interest rates several years ago was the reason for the \nsharp increase in medical malpractice insurance premiums during that \nperiod. What we witnessed then was not new. The industry has engaged in \nthis pattern of behavior repeatedly over the last 30 years. When ``tort \nreform'' laws are enacted, the insurance companies pocket the resulting \nsavings to bolster their profits.\n  Data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shows \nthat in 2005, the profits for the five largest for-profit medical \nmalpractice insurers were more than double those of the Fortune 500 \naverage 17.7 percent v. 8.7 percent.\n  Doctors, especially those in high risk specialties, whose malpractice \npremiums have increased dramatically do deserve premium relief. That \nrelief will only come as the result of tougher regulation of the \ninsurance industry. When insurance companies lose money on their \ninvestments, they should not be able to recover those losses from the \ndoctors they insure. Unfortunately, that is what is happening now.\n  Doctors and patients are both victims of the insurance industry. \nExcess profits from the boom years should be used to keep premiums \nstable when investment earnings drop. However, the insurance industry \nwill never do that voluntarily. Only by recognizing the real problem \ncan we begin to structure an effective solution that will bring an end \nto unreasonably high medical malpractice premiums.\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\n  There are specific changes in the law which should be made to address \nthe abusive manner in which medical malpractice insurers operate. The \nfirst and most important would be to subject the insurance industry to \nthe Nation's antitrust laws. It is the only major industry in America \nwhere corporations are free to conspire to fix prices, withhold and \nrestrict coverage, and engage in a myriad of other anticompetitive \nactions. A medical malpractice ``crisis'' does not just happen. It is \nthe result of insurance industry schemes to raise premiums and to \nincrease profits by forcing antipatient changes in the tort law. I have \nintroduced, with Senator Leahy, legislation which will at long last \nrequire the insurance industry to abide by the same rules of fair \ncompetition as other businesses.\n  Unlike the harsh and ineffective proposals in S. 22, this is a real \nsolution which will help physicians without further harming seriously \ninjured patients. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership continues to \nprotect their allies in the insurance industry and refuses to consider \nreal solutions to the malpractice premium crisis.\n  I want to conclude with a quotation from the analysis of medical \nmalpractice premiums by Weiss Ratings, Inc. Weiss Ratings is not \nspeaking from the perspective of a trial lawyer or a patient advocate, \nbut as a hard-nosed financial analyst that has studied the facts of \nmalpractice insurance rating. Here is their recommendation to us based \non those facts:\n\n       First, legislators must immediately put on hold all \n     proposals involving non-economic damage caps until convincing \n     evidence can be produced to demonstrate a true benefit to \n     doctors in the form of reduced med mal costs. Right now, \n     consumers are being asked to sacrifice not only large damage \n     claims, but also critical leverage to help regulate the \n     medical profession--all with the stated goal that it will end \n     the med mal crisis for doctors. However, the data indicate \n     that, similar State legislation has merely produced the worst \n     of both worlds: The sacrifice by consumers plus a \n     continuing--and even worsening--crisis for doctors. Neither \n     party derived any benefit whatsoever from the caps.\n\n  Before yielding the floor, I want to briefly address the second \nmalpractice bill, S. 23, that the Republican leadership has brought \nbefore the Senate. The only difference between them is that the first \nbill would take basic rights away from all patients, while the second \nbill takes those rights away only from women and newborn babies who are \nthe victims of negligent obstetric and gynecological care. That \ndifference does not make the latter bill more acceptable. On the \ncontrary, it adds a new element of unfairness.\n  The proponents argue that they are somehow doing these women and \ntheir babies a favor by depriving them of the right to fair \ncompensation when they are seriously injured. It is an Alice in \nWonderland argument which they are making. Under their proposal, a \nwoman whose gynecologist negligently failed to diagnose her cervical \ncancer until it had spread and become incurable would be denied the \nsame legal right as a man whose doctor negligently failed to diagnose \nhis prostate cancer until it was too late. Is that fair? By what \nconvoluted logic would that woman be better off? Both the woman and the \nman were condemned to suffer a painful and premature death as a result \nof their doctors' malpractice, but her compensation would be severely \nlimited while his is not. She would be denied the right to introduce \nthe same evidence of medical negligence which he could. She would be \ndenied the same freedom to select the lawyer of her choice which he \nhad. She would be denied the right to have her case tried under the \nsame judicial rules which he could. That hardly sounds like equal \nprotection of the law to me. Yet, that is what the advocates of this \nlegislation are proposing.\n  Of course, this bill does not only take rights away from women. It \ntakes them away from newborn babies who sustain devastating prenatal \ninjuries as well. These children face a lifetime with severe mental and \nphysical impairments all because of an obstetrician's malpractice, or \nmisconduct by a health care provider or insurer. This legislation would \nlimit the compensation those children can receive for lost quality of \nlife to $250,000 in nearly all cases--just $250,000 for an entire \nlifetime. What could be more unjust?\n  There are babies who suffered serious brain injuries at birth and \nwill never be able to lead normal lives. There are women who lost \norgans, reproductive capacity, and in some cases even years of life. \nThese are life-altering conditions. It would be terribly wrong to take \ntheir rights away. The Republicans talk about deterring frivolous \ncases, but caps by their nature apply only to the most serious cases \nwhich have been proven in court. These badly injured patients are the \nlast ones we should be depriving of fair compensation.\n  The entire premise of this bill is both false and offensive. Our \nRepublican colleagues claim that women and their babies must sacrifice \ntheir fundamental legal rights in order to preserve access to OB/GYN \ncare, that they must leave their rights at the door. The very idea is \noutrageous. For those locales--mostly in sparsely populated areas--\nwhere the availability of OB/GYN specialists is a problem, there are \nfar less drastic ways to solve it.\n  This bill is based on the false premise that the availability of OB/\nGYN physicians depends on the enactment of Draconian tort reforms. If \nthat were accurate, States that have already enacted damage caps would \nhave a higher number of OB/GYNS providing care. However, there is in \nfact no correlation. States without caps actually have 29.1 OB/GYNS per \n100,000 women, while States with caps have 25.5 OB/GYNS per 100,000 \nwomen. States without caps actually have more OB/GYNS serving their \nfemale population.\n  This is not a more acceptable bill because it applies only to women \nand newborn babies injured by obstetrical and gynecological \nmalpractice. That makes it even more arbitrary, even more outrageous. \nNot one victim should be denied the basic rights that this bill would \ntake away.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose both of these very unfair bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak directly to the issue of \nthe bill that applies to the need of women to be able to access doctors \nwhen they are delivering children and generally to get care from OB/\nGYNs. The Senator from Massachusetts has characterized this bill. Let \nme characterize it, as I think the facts are on the side of this bill.\n  The purpose of this bill is to allow women, especially women who are \ntrying to have children, to have adequate health care. There is a \ncrisis in this country today. Large numbers of women either cannot find \nan OB/GYN to assist them or if they can find an OB/GYN, they only have \none choice. If they do not get along with that doctor, if they find \nthey are not comfortable with that doctor, they have no other choice \nbut that doctor.\n  This bill sets up a very clear decision: You can be for the trial \nlawyers or you can be for women. You can be for the trial lawyers or \nyou can be for doctors who want to deliver babies as their profession. \nYou can be for the trial lawyers or you can be for children, especially \nchildren in prenatal situations. That is the choice in this bill.\n  The facts are almost uncontrovertible because they are so clear. The \nnumber of doctors practicing and delivering babies is dropping \nradically. This is especially true--especially true--in rural areas. \nYou cannot--let's put it this way: A trial lawyer cannot deliver a \nbaby. They are talented people. In fact, in the years 2003 and 2004, \nthey contributed over $185 million in political contributions, and as a \nresult, they were able to garnish $18 billion in fees dealing with \nmalpractice activity. So they are talented people. I do not deny that. \nBut a trial lawyer cannot deliver a baby.\n  But we are getting to a point where if you are a young woman or a \nwoman who desires to have a child, you are probably going to have to \ndrive by the courthouse to find your doctor because they are being \nsubjected to so many lawsuits, if they happen to be in the business of \ndelivering babies.\n  New Hampshire is a classic example of this situation. There is only \none doctor north of the White Mountains, which is a fairly large amount \nof area and a great place to live, and people who live there choose to \nlive there because it is a great place to live. There is only one \ndoctor above the White\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nMountains--that is called northern New Hampshire--who delivers babies. \nIf that doctor is not around or if that doctor is on a break or maybe \nif you do not like that doctor, you literally are going to have to \ndrive an hour, 2 hours, maybe even longer, in order to see a doctor if \nyou are a woman who wants to get care in delivering your child. And \nbelieve me, that can be a dangerous experience, driving in a snowstorm. \nHopefully, you can get somebody to drive you if you are about to \ndeliver. But in any event, driving through a snowstorm in northern New \nHampshire is a difficult situation. But that is what people are \nsubjected to in that part of the State because the doctors who used to \npractice up there, who used to deliver babies, cannot afford to deliver \nbabies any longer in that part of the State. Why? Because the \npopulation is not large enough to pay their premiums, which have \nescalated, skyrocketed, doubled--doubled upon doubled--over the last 20 \nyears in the area of delivering children. So they have opted out of the \npractice. In fact, one doctor simply closed her practice and moved to \nanother State because of the fact that the cost of insurance premiums \nwas so high.\n  Another whole practice in Rochester, NH, with five OB/GYNs, simply \npicked up their practice and moved across the State line to Maine \nbecause of the cost of delivering babies.\n  One of the leading doctors in the State, Dr. Cynthia Cooper, who is \nhead of the New Hampshire Board of Medicine and an OB/GYN, has given up \ndelivering babies, as I understand it.\n  Dr. Patricia Miller from Derry, NH, a town of 38,000 people, has also \ngiven up delivering babies, after 15 years.\n  I had a doctor in Laconia, which is in the Lakes region--a beautiful \npart of the State--who essentially told me he has to deliver babies \nthrough November simply to pay the cost of the premium for his \ninsurance. He does it because he feels it is his obligation, his \nobligation as a doctor, because that region would not have his talent \nand his care. But believe me, it is hardly an incentivizing event to \npursue that type of practice.\n  What drives these premiums? Well, if you listen to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, it is the evil insurance companies. Insurance companies \ndo not drive these premiums. What a fallacious argument that is. They \nset the premium in order to be able to afford to pay the costs, which \ncosts are generated by the excessive amount of lawsuits that are being \nbrought and the extraordinary recoveries which, on occasion, are simply \nout of whack.\n  When trial lawyers in this country are obtaining $18 billion in fees \nover a 2-year period that could have been money--if the Senator from \nMassachusetts wants to help out the health care system--that could have \nbeen money which could have gone into health care delivery, think of \nhow many OB/GYNs would be practicing out there.\n  Well, one State decided to do something about that, the State of the \nPresiding Officer: Texas. In an act of considerable clairvoyance, I \nwould say, they decided to take the California model, which has worked \npretty well, and improve on it. As a result, they have put in place a \ntiered system of recovery, which is what the bill does. It essentially \nfollows the Texas model, which was a follow-on to the California model.\n  In both Texas and California, recovery has been reasonable for those \npeople injured. But equally important, doctors have started to practice \nmedicine again, instead of just basically defending themselves from \nlawsuits. It has become affordable to become a doctor and practice in \nthe State of Texas, so much so that the facts speak for themselves. Mr. \nPresident, 3,000 new doctors have moved into Texas since this law was \npassed, with 81 new obstetric doctors. That is a huge increase in \nmedical opportunity and care, especially for women, women of \nchildbearing years, and for children because Texas had the good sense \nto take this approach. The same has occurred in California.\n  So progress has been made. We have uncontrovertible facts which show \nthat you can resolve this issue, that you can allow women to have the \nopportunity, especially women of childbearing age, to see doctors and \nhave choices in doctors and be able to be cared for by doctors who wish \nto deliver babies and can afford to deliver babies.\n\n  This is a huge step forward for those two States. It is time the \nFederal Government, the National Government, address the issue, also. \nThat is why we have brought forward this very targeted bill.\n  The bigger bill, which I also support, is an excellent idea. There \nare other specialties that need attention: neurosurgeons, emergency \nroom docs, doctors, especially, practicing in underserved areas. If you \nare a doctor in an emergency room or if you are a doctor practicing in \nan underserved area, you are not making a lot of money. You are \nfortunate if you are making anything. I do not know what the hourly \nrate works out to, but those doctors work massive hours. Considering \nthe huge amount of expense they put into their education and their \nprofessional development, their return is not all that high if they \nhave decided to pursue caring for people in underserved areas, rural or \nurban areas, or emergency rooms. Yet they get hit with these premiums, \nwhich essentially make it very difficult for doctors to choose that \ncourse of practice, which is so important.\n  So a broader bill does make sense. But it gets attacked, and it has \nbeen attacked rather aggressively from the other side, with the \nfootnotes that have been handed to the other side by the trial lawyer \ngroups, as they try to set up the straw dog of the insurance companies \nor the straw dog of some sort of recovery system that is unfair to the \nseriously injured. So the bigger argument becomes more complex and more \ndifficult to understand and can be more obfuscated and has been \neffectively by our friends on the other side and by the trial bar.\n  But it is very hard to obfuscate, it is very hard to get past the \nsimple fact that there is only one OB/GYN practicing in northern New \nHampshire. It is very hard to get by the simple fact that if you are a \nwoman in rural Kansas or rural New York or rural Illinois or urban \nareas within those States or rural Texas, you are going to have a lot \nof problems finding a doctor when you decide to have children because \nthe doctors have been driven out of the business of the practice by \nthese excessive and unrelenting lawsuits.\n  So this bill is very simple. Rather than getting into the rather \nconvoluted, smoke-filled discussion of the entire medical reform issue, \nit just goes at one great, important need in our country; that is, if a \nwoman wants to have a child, she should have high-quality medical care \nso that child is brought into the world in the best possible condition \nand the woman's health is protected during the childbearing period. \nThis bill will do that, and I hope everyone will support it.\n  At this point, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on a couple of \ncloture motions dealing with medical malpractice reform. We will have a \ndebate later this week on small business health plans. This is a week \nin which we have an opportunity to address what is probably one of the \nmost important, if not the most important, domestic policy issues that \nwe will deal with in the foreseeable future; that is, access to health \ncare for more Americans, more affordable health care for more \nAmericans.\n  These issues are not new to the Congress. In fact, as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, I had the opportunity to vote numerous times \non medical malpractice reform, on small business health plans to allow \nmore people to have access to health care by joining larger groups, \nthereby driving down the cost of insurance and providing coverage to \nsome of the 45 million people who currently are not covered.\n  Estimates are that as small business health plans pass, we will have \n11 million more Americans with health insurance, making a big dent in \nthe ranks of the uninsured. In the time since I first came to Congress \nin 1996, in the last\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\ndecade, there have been 13 different votes in the Congress: There have \nbeen five votes on medical malpractice reform; there have been eight \nvotes on small business health plans. In those cases, the House of \nRepresentatives has acted. There have been majority votes coming out of \nthe House. That legislation would then come to the Senate where it \nwould be obstructed, filibustered, and ultimately would die.\n  I submit to my colleagues that these are both measures for which \nthere is majority support in the Congress. If you look at the House, \nthey have passed it repeatedly. If you look at the Senate, if we had a \nvote today and we had to get 51 votes or a simple majority in the \nSenate, we would be able to pass medical malpractice reform. We would \nalso be able to pass small business health plans. The other side has \nrepeatedly denied us an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on these \nparticular issues. That is wrong. It is wrong for a lot of reasons, but \nit is wrong, most importantly, because it is hurting the welfare of \nAmericans who desperately need access to health care and need the cost \nof health care brought down.\n  Today when we vote on medical malpractice reform, we will be \naddressing an issue that affects the well-being of all Americans \nbecause in one way or another, when physicians have to deal with \nescalating premiums for liability insurance, those costs ultimately get \npassed on to all of us. If you don't believe that, look at the \nstatistics.\n  In 2002, the Health and Human Services issued an update on the \nmedical liability crisis. It found that the direct cost of medical \nliability coverage and the indirect cost of defensive medicine \nincreased the amount the Federal Government must pay for Federal health \nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid by $22.5 billion a year.\n  Additionally, a January 2006 Pricewaterhouse Coopers study entitled \n``The Factors Fueling Rising Health Care Costs,'' concluded that \nmedical liability and defensive medicine accounted for 10 percent of \nthe increase in the rising cost of health insurance premiums.\n  The median liability jury award in medical liability cases almost \ntripled between 1997 and 2004. In 2003, the GAO found:\n\n       Losses on medical malpractice claims--which make up the \n     largest part of insurers' costs--appear to be the primary \n     driver of rate increases in the long run.\n\n  With these statistics and findings of not only the GAO but numerous \nindependent studies, it is easy to see that it is time for Congress to \naddress the medical liability crisis. S. 22 and S. 23 provide needed \nand sensible medical liability reform. Based on the Texas stacked cap \nmodel for noneconomic damages, these pieces of legislation allow up to \n$750,000 for noneconomic damages and unlimited awards for economic \ndamages. Additionally, plaintiffs may recover punitive damages twice \nthe amount of economic damages, or $250,000, whichever is greater.\n  S. 22 and S. 23 also maximize patient recovery by limiting the fees \nattorneys may recover on a contingency basis. My State of South Dakota \ncurrently has a cap of $500,000 for noneconomic damages. S. 22 and S. \n23 respect States rights and do not preempt noneconomic damage caps in \nplace, not only in South Dakota but in 25 other States as well. It is \ntime the obstruction in the Senate come to an end and that we put \npatients before lawyers and allow a straight up-or-down vote on S. 22 \nand S. 23. Obstructing a vote on medical liability reform jeopardizes \nevery American's access to quality health care and raises the cost for \nindividual taxpayers as well as for State and Federal Governments. This \nis especially true in rural States such as South Dakota where there is \nonly one licensed physician for every 450 residents.\n  I believe it is high time the Senate show the American people that \nCongress understands their concerns about access to and the cost of \nhealth care. Pass S. 22 and S. 23 and do what I believe a majority in \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives support; that is, to \naddress the rising cost of health care by putting reasonable limits in \nplace, many of which have been adopted and are successfully working in \nStates throughout the country. It is time to end the obstruction and \nallow these measures to be voted on. I hope my colleagues will vote \nthat way when the cloture votes come up.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, a lot has been said about the Texas \nmodel, which is the bill that we are considering today. I wanted to \ntalk a little bit about what the Texas situation was before 2003 when \nsignificant medical malpractice reform was enacted.\n  According to the Texas Department of Health, 24 counties in Texas had \nno primary care physicians, 138 counties had no pediatricians, and 158 \ncounties had no obstetricians. Texas ranked 48th of the 50 States in \nphysician manpower. Why were we having such trouble? Because the cost \nof doing business in Texas before 2003 was unsustainable due to \nincreased litigious activity. Insurance rates were driving our doctors \nout of Texas, or they were going out of business and not even \npracticing medicine anymore.\n  In 1991, Texas averaged 13 claims per 100 physicians. Yet by 2000, \nTexas averaged over 30 claims per 100 physicians. Of these claims, \nthere was a disproportionate growth in noneconomic damages, damages \nsuch as pain and suffering, loss of consortium. This growth was in \ncontrast to awards of economic damages such as lost wages and medical \ncare costs. In 1991, noneconomic damages averaged only 35 percent of \ntotal verdicts. By 1995, they were 65 percent of total verdicts.\n  From 1999 to 2003, the Texas Medical Liability Trust, which covered \nabout one-third of the State's doctors, increased rates by 147 percent. \nIn the Rio Grande Valley, physicians in general surgery and OB/GYNs \nranked sixth and seventh, respectively, in the Nation for highest \npremium rates in 2002. Naturally, all of these costs were passed on to \nconsumers. The impact on litigation in the Texas health care system was \nundeniable and unsustainable.\n  In 2003, Texas made bold changes to the tort system in an attempt to \nrestore access to health care, and we have seen a dramatic change. \nTexas has gained more than 3,000 physicians since passing liability \nreform. After a net loss of nine orthopedic surgeons in our State from \n2000 to 2003, the State has experienced a net gain of 93 orthopedic \nsurgeons since 2003. After a net loss of 14 OB/GYNs from 2001 to 2003, \nTexas has had a net gain of 91 since 2003.\n  We have also added 273 anesthesiologists, 24 neurosurgeons, 24 \npediatric cardiologists, 14 pediatric oncologists, and 10 pediatric \nsurgeons since passing liability reform.\n  Claims in most Texas counties have been cut in half. Prior to the \nreforms, statewide claims averaged close to 400 per month. After the \nreforms, claims have averaged 200 per month in our State.\n  Prior to reform, Texas had five liability carriers. Since reform, \nTexas has added 3 new rate-regulated carriers and 13 new unregulated \ninsurers. The five largest insurers announced rate cuts last year, with \nan average premium reduction of 11.7 percent.\n  Anecdotally, I have talked to doctors who are coming back into \npractice, doctors who have said they have seen as much as 40 percent \ncuts in premiums for medical liability.\n  Medical liability reform works. Lawsuits are down, insurers have \nreturned to the State, rates are down, and physician numbers are up. \nThis means better health care for the citizens of our State.\n  The bills before us that we will be voting on today are modeled on \nthe Texas plan. Damages for pain and suffering are allowed, but not at \nsuch exorbitant rates that doctors are taken out of our health care \nsystem. Since 2003, Texas has seen an increase in the quality of health \ncare for our citizens because more physicians are coming back to the \nState.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Year after year, we have \ntried to reform medical malpractice in this country, and the Senate has \nbeen the stumbling block. Let's do something good for health care and \naccess to health care for our citizens, and let's start debating \nmalpractice reform.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls the time until 5 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I find it unfortunate that we do not hear \nany discussion by proponents of this legislation about what is best for \npatients injured or killed by medical errors. The debate in favor of \nmalpractice award caps has been cast in terms of patient accessibility \nto health care, but what about patient safety? Capping noneconomic \ndamages may benefit insurance companies, but it does nothing for \nvictims and nothing to address the serious problem of preventable \nmedical errors.\n  Despite all of the rhetoric and all the myths and misinformation \nabout the so-called crisis facing our medical professionals, what about \nthe fact that studies have estimated that medical errors kill up to \nnearly 100,000 people each year? How does capping what a victim can \nrecover help address this tragic fact? Rather than having all the talk \nbe about alleged physician shortages and phantom reductions in \ninsurance rates, we should be looking at how to improve the quality of \ncare patients receive and how to improve patient safety. This \nlegislation does nothing to provide any incentive for health care \nproviders to improve the safety of their services, drug companies to \nrigorously test their products, or nursing homes to provide responsible \nand compassionate care to our elderly citizens.\n  Aside from the fact that caps on non-economic damages will not \naddress exorbitant insurance rates, such caps harm both women and \nchildren. The Wall Street Journal published an article in 2004 \ndetailing the effects of California's non-economic damages cap. The \narticle discussed how the California law has created two classes of \nmalpractice victims: those who earn large amounts of money and get good \nrepresentation, and those who do not and cannot find advocates willing \nto take on their cases. The effect is that many women who do not work, \nbut raise children, cannot get representation because they cannot point \nto an annual salary that will be lost, and thus lawyers are reluctant \nto invest the hundreds of thousands of dollars necessary to litigate a \nmeritorious claim. The same is true for children, whose recovery under \nthis legislation would depend on often difficult estimates of the cost \nof future care. A California attorney quoted in The Wall Street Journal \narticle summed up the California law's effect by concluding: ``We are \nsaying to doctors and hospitals it's OK to kill somebody who comes from \na poor family because ultimately they aren't going to have the same \neffect on our medical-malpractice insurance as somebody who comes from \na rich family.'' The similar one-size-fits-all approach in this \nlegislation is the wrong way to go.\n  I also question the timing of partisan legislation that will do \nnothing to address patient safety. As insurance rates, like gas prices, \ncontinue to soar to the benefit of corporate profits, as the number of \nuninsured continue to rise during this presidency, the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate seeks to take up partisan legislation that will help \na few very powerful insurance companies become even more powerful. \nRather than take up legislation to apply competitive antitrust \nprinciples to the business of insurance, the majority leader insists \nthat we limit our actions to legislative proposals that will deprive \ncitizens injured by medical errors a full measure of justice. Instead \nof taking up legislation to push the frontiers of life-saving medicine \nthrough stem cell research, we are going to debate whether we should \nmake it easier for insurance companies to continue their predatory \nbehavior at the expense of both doctors and patients. Instead of \ncalling this a malpractice bill, we should call it a gift to the \ninsurance companies bill.\n  In recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of Americans have taken to the \nstreets in peaceful demonstrations to urge sensible and humane \nimmigration reform and the public clearly wants Congress to address \nthese issues and to strengthen our borders, and instead we are \ndiscussing how to dismantle our internal borders and tread on State \nsovereignty by nullifying State tort law. A war rages in Iraq in which \nour Nation's best and bravest are making the ultimate sacrifice to \nadvance democracy, and meanwhile we are talking about how to curtail \nAmericans' access to justice. Forty-five million people do not have \nhealth insurance in this country, and yet we are considering \nlegislation that will make it harder for children who suffer lifelong \ninjuries from medical errors to get the long term care they need. The \ngap between the richest Americans and everyone else continues to widen, \nbut instead of taking up legislation to raise the minimum wage, the \nmajority leader wants to shield lucrative insurance companies from \nhaving to pay fair awards to medical malpractice victims. Where in the \nmajority leader's schedule are the American people's real priorities?\n  There are ways to improve health care. These bills do not do that. \nThere are alternatives that address the high costs of medical \nmalpractice insurance and patient safety, but they differ from the \nnarrow approach we debate today. There are solutions to both the \ncurrent high rate of medical errors, as well as high insurance costs, \nthat will not further victimize patients or intrude into the \nsovereignty of State legislatures and citizens, but they are not \nbrought before the Senate for consideration and action.\n  If we want to address high insurance costs, let us address the \nunhelpful practices within the insurance industry and find a real \nsolution that does not penalize victims of medical errors. If we want \nto bring down the number of medical errors, merely cutting costs and \nincreasing profits for insurance companies is not the way to go. \nCapping malpractice awards does nothing to treat the root cause of \nmalpractice lawsuits. Let us put patients before insurance companies in \nthis debate and find real solutions to the preventable medical errors \nthat are occurring every day.\n  Some of us have proposed legislation to tackle the problem of rising \ninsurance costs without taking away American citizens' access to \njustice. If we want to improve patient care and lower the number of \nmedical malpractice claims, we need to find ways to prevent medical \nerrors at the rate they occur now. That is common sense. Senator Obama \nhas proposed the Hospital Quality Report Card Act of 2006 to provide \naccountability within those hospitals compensated through Medicare by \nrequiring highly detailed reporting of safety procedures, patient \naccessibility, the incidence of errors and infections, and many other \nareas important to both patient safety the effectiveness of treatment. \nSenator Obama's bill would provide the information to help consumers \nmake an informed decision about where to obtain treatment. It would \nprovide the information necessary for hospitals to improve the safety \nand effectiveness of their services. It would allow insurers and \npurchasers of insurance to reduce the likelihood of claims by sending \ntheir insured customers and employees to the best hospitals available, \nand would allow doctors and policy makers to target areas in need of \nimprovement. Senator Obama's bill puts the priorities of patient safety \nand health care improvement first. I commend the Senator from Illinois \nfor this bill and I urge other Senators to join me in supporting it.\n  If we want to reign in the costs of insurance for health care \nproviders, we must address the conditions within the insurance \nindustry. I have proposed a bill along with Senator Kennedy to exempt \nmedical malpractice insurers from the counterproductive McCarran-\nFerguson Act. This bill would give regulators the tools necessary to \nprevent anti-competitive business practices that hurt doctors and \npatients. If medical malpractice insurers are artificially driving up \nthe costs of insurance, we should stop it. Health care in our country \nis too important to allow profits at the expense of patients. We are \nnot going to stop soaring insurance premiums by cutting off the access \nof victims to justice. We are going to stop them by stopping the anti-\ncompetitive behavior of the insurance companies. Again, health care in \nour country is too important to allow profit at the expense of \npatients, especially when in the last 6 years we have seen the highest \nincrease in the number of uninsured Americans in my lifetime.\n  I urge other Senators to join me in rejecting legislation that will \ndo nothing more than benefit profitable insurance companies under the \nguise of improving patient accessibility. Let us work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to come up with real solutions to the\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nproblem of preventable medical errors. Let us find ways to end the \nabusive practices in assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Let \nus find ways to lower insurance costs without hurting victims. Those in \nneed of care must be able to trust their doctors and health care \nproviders without doubt. Elderly Americans deserve the best care that \ncan be provided. Our doctors and other health care providers deserve to \nbe treated fairly in the marketplace when purchasing malpractice \ninsurance, and not be affected by artificial monopolies and price-\nfixing cartels. If we work together, we can make progress and make a \ndifference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Enzi \nfrom Wyoming and his staff and my staff for the effort they have put \ninto S. 1955. I was pleased to work with them in trying to help our \nNation's small businesses and our Nation's uninsured.\n  Mr. President, 45 million people don't have health insurance in our \ncountry today. We have heard that statistic so many times that it is \nstarting to feel numb to us, but we can't let that happen. Forty-five \nmillion people translates to about one of every six Americans. I would \nlike to put a face to that figure and start bringing some feeling back \nto the state of health insurance coverage in the United States.\n  If the 45 million uninsured Americans held hands and formed a chain \nbetween New York City and Los Angeles, they would not only stretch the \nentire distance, they would be able to go back and forth from coast to \ncoast 14 times.\n  We can no longer wait to help this ever-growing number of people gain \nhealth insurance. It is time to start increasing the number of insured \npeople in our country, and this bill does just that.\n  It is projected that S. 1955 will make health insurance affordable \nfor 1 million working Americans, and that is a sizable start to the \nprocess of providing health insurance to the one in six without it.\n  By allowing business and trade associations to band their members \ntogether and offer group health insurance coverage on a national or \nstatewide basis, we will be making an important stride in making health \ninsurance affordable for Americans.\n  Nearly every week since becoming a Senator, I have heard from small \nbusiness owners in my State that can no longer afford health care for \nthemselves or their employees.\n  Health care premiums are experiencing double-digit growth annually. \nSmall businesses can't keep up with the costs. Since 2000, group \npremiums for family coverage have grown nearly 60 percent. So if we \ndon't do something to help small businesses cope with the cost of \nhealth insurance, soon we will have an entire workforce without health \ninsurance coverage.\n  This bill, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and \nAffordability Act of 2005, is designed to lower health insurance costs \nby stimulating market reforms and promoting competition, while allowing \ntrade associations the ability to offer group insurance plans for \nemployees.\n  It is important to note that we keep oversight at the State level \nwith the State insurance commissioners. For the past 10 years, the \nSenate has debated AHP legislation, and for 10 years nothing has \nhappened to help our small businesses provide those health benefits. \nAnd small business health plans can work. It is time we looked at \nsomething that can and will work.\n  I believe in this legislation because it is the first health benefits \nlegislation to get both sides--the business folks and the insurance \nfolks--working together.\n  Senator Enzi and I know that concerns have been raised about this \nbill, and each time we have been approached by a group with a concern, \nwe have listened and we have tried to work together to strengthen this \nbill and its hopes for making health insurance affordable for America's \nsmall businesses.\n  The traditional AHP bill gave a rating and mandate advantage to \nassociation plans that resulted in adverse selection and an unlevel \nplaying field. The Enzi-Nelson bill eliminates the rating and mandate \nadvantage that Federal AHPs would have had under previously proposed \nlegislation, which went nowhere. As a former insurance commissioner \nmyself, it was crucial to me that this bill adhere to strict insurance \nprinciples. I think the bill before us will do just that.\n  As I see it, we have three options. The first is to do nothing to \nhelp the 45 million uninsured Americans. Since I genuinely believe we \nall want to improve health care, I will move on to the next option.\n  The second option is to keep trying to pass AHP legislation year \nafter year, but I am afraid this approach will result in about the same \ndismal outcome as the do-nothing option that no one wants.\n  The third option, which I think is the best solution, is to act on \nsmall business health plans and pass this legislation.\n  In Nebraska, there are at least 30,000 small businesses with fewer \nthan 50 employees who would be directly impacted by this legislation. \nCurrently, 20,000 of these businesses don't offer health benefits.\n  I read a report last month by respected actuaries who looked at our \nbill. They believe it will help small businesses reduce health \ninsurance costs by $1,000 per employee and shrink the number of \nuninsured working families by 8 percent. That is 1 million Americans \nwho will now be able to afford health insurance because of the bill.\n  Recent survey results conducted by a bipartisan research firm shows \nthat S. 1955 enjoys the support of 89 percent of Americans. It is a \nrare day in the United States anymore when 9 out of 10 people are \nunited behind a cause.\n  So I hope this unity carries over to the Senate floor and that \ncolleagues will join with Senator Enzi, myself, and others and pass S. \n1955. It is in the best interest of Americans who want health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the medical \nliability reform bills before us today: one is a comprehensive reform \nbill that I introduced, and the other specifically deals with OB/GYNs, \nwhich Senator Santorum introduced.\n  There are a couple of very important points to make on this \nlegislation. First of all, Senator Nelson, a friend of mine, just spoke \nabout the number of uninsured Americans. Over the next couple of days, \nwe are going to vote on legislation to establish Small Business Health \nPlans. This is good legislation that is intended to help reduce the \nnumber of uninsured.\n  But another problem related to the number of uninsured Americans is \nthe high cost of health care. The cost of health care is making it too \nexpensive for people to afford health insurance. One of the primary \ndrivers of health care costs is increasing medical liability premiums \nfor health care providers.\n  Doctors are being forced out of their practices because they cannot \nafford to practice anymore. We saw the trauma center in southern Nevada \nclose for a 10-day period. It serves 10,000 square miles. People died \nbecause of the closure. We have also seen maternity wards close across \nthe country. Neurosurgeons and other specialists are no longer taking \ncalls unless the calls are for cases that are not very risky. \nSpecialists can't afford to take high-risk cases because they risk \nlosing everything they have based on seeing one case.\n  I have a good friend in southern Nevada who practices obstetrics. In \nhis practice, he specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Because of the \nmedical liability problems that we have seen in the past several years, \nhis insurance company limits the number of high-risk pregnancies with \nwhich he can assist.\n  If you are a woman and you are pregnant with a high-risk pregnancy, \nit would seem to me that you would want the best of the best to take \ncare of you. That only makes sense. But because of the medical \nliability crisis we are facing in this country, the best of the best \nare limited in the number of cases they can see.\n  If you are a doctor in America today--this is becoming a truism--you \nwill be sued. If you practice long enough, you will be sued in America \ntoday. We need to deal with the number of frivolous lawsuits that are \nclogging our legal system.\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\n  Every American needs to ask themselves this fundamental question: If \nyou were in an automobile accident or if you needed care in an \nemergency room, and the specialist you wanted to see wasn't available, \nwasn't there, was no longer practicing, or wouldn't take the call, \nwould you accept the reason that this happened is because this body, \nthe Senate, wouldn't even take up a bill and debate medical liability \nreform, which could bring down health care costs, as it has in several \nStates across America? If you were a mother who had a high-risk \npregnancy or any type of pregnancy, and you couldn't get obstetrical \ncare, how would you feel if the reason you couldn't get care was \nbecause your doctor left practice or left the State because medical \nliability insurance premiums were too high?\n  We have a serious problem. According to the American Medical \nAssociation, 21 States are in crisis today, 6 States are not, and the \nrest of the States are headed toward crisis. The six States that are \nnot in crisis have all passed meaningful medical liability reform. The \nbill before us today is modeled after one of those States: the State of \nTexas. The State of Texas has a $250,000 cap for a judgment against a \nhealth care provider. In addition, the patient can be awarded up to \n$250,000 for a judgment against one health care institution. If two or \nmore institutions are involved, the patient can receive up to $500,000, \nwith each institution not liable for more than $250,000. Thus, injured \npatients can be awarded noneconomic damages for pain and suffering \ntotaling $750,000. The legislation has no limits on economic damages \nfor necessary health care expenses that you may incur over your \nlifetime. You can sue for unlimited economic damages. But, the caps on \nnoneconomic damages are key to whether the legislation is effective.\n  Let's compare a couple of States, Texas and Pennsylvania. Texas has \nenacted meaningful medical liability insurance reform; Pennsylvania has \nnot. These are just two examples. In Texas, doctors are moving back to \nthe State. As a matter of fact, nine hundred doctors specializing in \nemergency care and high-risk procedures have moved to Texas since 2003, \nwhen Texas law was enacted. Texas infants and children now have better \naccess to specialists. Ninety-four pediatric specialists alone have \nmoved into the State. In contrast, Pennsylvania doctors are leaving the \nState. I believe there are more medical schools in Pennsylvania than \npractically anywhere else in the country, yet doctors are leaving the \nState--not because they don't love Pennsylvania, but because they \ncannot afford to practice in Pennsylvania. In Texas, the premiums for \nmedical liability insurance policies are going down. In Pennsylvania, \nthey continue to skyrocket. Because of medical liability reform in \nTexas, 30 new medical liability insurers have come into the State to \nwrite policies for doctors. In Pennsylvania, medical liability insurers \nare leaving the State.\n  The difference here is that doctors in Texas can shop among 30 \ndifferent medical liability insurers. And, market forces bring \ninsurance prices down. Because of all of this, it is becoming less \nexpensive to practice medicine in Texas and more expensive to practice \nin Pennsylvania.\n  The bill I offered, which is before us today, is modeled after the \nTexas legislation. The bill establishes caps on noneconomic damages. \nThe bill also limits attorneys' fees. This provision will ensure that \npatients receive a larger percentage of their damage awards. I believe \nthat the person who is injured with a true medical malpractice case \nshould get the award instead of having the award go to higher and \nhigher attorneys' fees.\n  My legislation also includes an expert witness provision to ensure \nthat relevant medical experts serve as trial witnesses. This provision \nis extremely important. Today, if you have a medical liability case \nbefore a jury, they bring in so-called professional witnesses to \ntestify who are used to further abuse the system. There is a whole \nindustry of these so-called professional witnesses who travel around \nthe country and testify. The problem is that a lot of these so-called \nprofessional witnesses are not experts in the field in which they are \ntestifying. This bill says that if you are, for instance, testifying in \na neurology case, then you should be a specialist in neurology. I know \nthis is common sense, but that is not the way our courts work today. \nThis bill would require a specialist or an expert to truly be an expert \nin the field in which they are testifying.\n  This bill has been contentious for several years. The trial lawyers \nand their cohorts spent $182 million over the last few elections. And \nthey have gotten back out, just in medical liability awards, $18 \nbillion. That is a 10,000-percent return on their investment in \npolitics.\n  We cannot allow the trial lawyers to control this debate. We cannot \nallow the trial lawyers to say: We are not even going to allow for \ndebate of this bill on the floor of the Senate. That is what is \nhappening. This bill isn't even going to be allowed to have an up-or-\ndown vote. Some people say: Let's have insurance reform. Let's bring it \nall on. Let's have those amendments and let's debate it. But the other \nside of the aisle is not even allowing us to debate this bill on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  This crisis is not going away; it is getting worse in America. We \nmust act as a responsible body. It is unfortunate that the greatest \ndeliberative body supposedly in the history of the world can't even \ndeliberate on this bill. It is time to bring real medical liability \nreform to the floor of the Senate and debate it. Let's let the American \npeople see what the medical liability reform debate is all about. Let's \ngo forward so that we can save our doctors, nurses, nurse midwives, and \nother health care providers, so that when patients need care, they get \nthat care.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to continue on with some of the \ncomments I was making earlier about the critical situation in \nPennsylvania with respect to this liability crisis and a couple of \nexamples of how out of control the system has become. I was at St. \nLuke's Hospital up in the Lehigh Valley, and I was saddened by the \nchanges that have happened with some of the losses of physicians that \nhave occurred in there. It is one of the growing areas of our State, \nand this is an area that has been hit with very high rates of \nmalpractice and obviously, as I will discuss here, losing physicians.\n  I want to talk about a couple of things. One is a case that St. \nLuke's was involved in that tells you how absurd, and particularly in \nthis case, the jury awards are in Philadelphia, which has been the big \nproblem area in Pennsylvania--some of the jury awards that have come \nout of Philadelphia.\n  We had a case in September and October of the year 2000 which \ninvolved a baby girl born 3 months premature to a 17-year-old mother \nwhose medical records indicated a crack cocaine addiction. The mother \nbegan experiencing complications, including a partial placental \nabruption and premature labor. The mother was admitted to another \nhospital for these complications and then transferred to St. Luke's. \nThe mother was placed on strict bed rest and given medication to stop \nthe onset of labor and to prevent progression of the placental \nabruption. Despite warnings from her doctor about the risks to her baby \nof premature birth and possible neurological damage, possibly death, \nthe mother, against medical advice, left the hospital. She turned up 3 \ndays later with complete placental abruption and premature delivery \ncould not be avoided at that point. Emergency surgery was performed. \nThe baby was delivered weighing 4.1 pounds. The baby had a common \ncondition with premature babies which is an opening in the heart that \nusually closes shortly after birth. The baby was treated for 29 days in \nthe neonatal intensive care unit at St. Luke's, was given medication to \nattempt to close the opening in the heart. The baby had an adverse \nreaction to the medication. Surgery was required to close the opening. \nThe surgeon was unsuccessful. There were no documented complications in \nthe surgery, no allegations that St. Luke's did anything wrong or \nimproper in her care.\n  The baby was transferred to another hospital for further surgery. \nDuring treatment at the second hospital, the baby had complications, \nwas transferred back to ICU at St. Luke's. Again, no documented \ncomplications during the second stay at St. Luke's up\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nuntil the child's release. The mother during this time gave up parental \nrights. The baby was adopted down the road by parents who elected not \nto seek legal action. But--and this is somewhat unknown--somehow or \nanother, an attorney in Philadelphia was appointed the guardian ad \nlitem to the child because of the child's nexus to a second hospital \nlocated in Philadelphia County. So the lawyer sued on behalf of the \nbaby without the consent or knowledge of either the actual parent or \nthe adopted parent.\n  The verdict in the case was $100 million against the hospital--a $100 \nmillion verdict in this case. So you wonder: Well, gee, why are we \ntrying to put caps on awards? A $100 million verdict in this case. That \nverdict would have shut down this hospital, which is a major medical \ncenter in the Lehigh Valley. Subsequent to the verdict, they negotiated \na settlement for substantially less money. But the bottom line is, you \nhave a situation where things get out of control because bad things \nhappen to people. People are injured. In this case this little baby, \nbecause of a whole lot of factors I have detailed, is going to have a \ntough life. But is it the fault of St. Luke's Hospital? Is it the fault \nof the physicians who were attending? The answer from all indications \nis no. But you have someone who feels bad that this child is going to \nneed some help, so you give verdicts of $100 million.\n  The consequence at St. Luke's was that since 2000, 32 private \nphysicians have left St. Luke's as a direct result of the malpractice \ninsurance crisis. Twelve OB-GYNs, 5 neurosurgeons, 2 pulmonary \nspecialists, 3 orthopods, 3 general surgeons, 2 internists, and 1 pain \nmanagement specialist. There has been a 44-percent decline in the \nnumber of private practice OB-GYN physicians on their medical staff.\n  One of the reasons I have introduced S. 23 is because it is not just \na problem at St. Luke's, it is a problem in Philadelphia, a problem in \nPittsburgh. We are down to I think three maternity wards in the city of \nPittsburgh. This is a problem across our State. Unfortunately, the \nheavy hand of politics is played not just here in Washington but also \nin our State Capitol.\n  There was a study done that showed that the trial attorneys in \nAmerica in the 2003-2004 election cycle contributed $182 million to \npolitical campaigns--$182 million. That sounds like a lot of money. It \nis a lot of money. But it is actually a pretty good investment on the \npart of the trial attorneys. Because for that $182 million, they were \nable to collect $18 billion in fees--$18 billion in fees. That is a \n10,000-percent rate of return. Not a bad investment. So they are \ninvesting in the political climate here. They are investing to make \nsure there is no balance in the system. They are investing because they \nwant to keep things out of whack. They want to keep those 40- and 50-\npercent awards, the percentages of contingency fees to these big \nawards, so they can keep the gravy train coming.\n  That is something our health care system cannot afford. We cannot \nafford to allow this kind of litigation to be practiced in the health \ncare arena. It is destroying our ability to keep physicians in \nPennsylvania. It is destroying our ability to have responsible medicine \npracticed--not defensive medicine but appropriate medicine and \nresponsible medicine that treats patients the way they should be \ntreated, not the way they need to be treated to avoid possible \nlitigation.\n  That is not responsible medicine. That is not the medicine physicians \nwant to practice. But, increasingly, in my State, that is the medicine \nthey are practicing, and unless we do something tonight, in a few \nminutes, they are going to have to continue to practice that way.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the dilemma \nthis Nation is facing regarding access to quality, affordable health \ncare. Next to the economy, it is the greatest domestic challenge facing \nour Nation. In fact, the rising cost of health care is a major part of \nwhat is hurting our competitiveness in the global marketplace.\n  One of the biggest factors driving health care costs through the roof \nis medical lawsuit abuse. I have been concerned about this issue for \nquite some time--in fact, since my days as Governor of Ohio. I wish we \nhad the outpouring of support for medical liability reform back then \nthat I see now. In 1996, I essentially had to pull teeth in the Ohio \nLegislature to pass my tort reform bill.\n  I signed it into law in October 1996. Three years later, the Ohio \nSupreme Court ruled it unconstitutional, and if that law had withstood \nthe supreme court's scrutiny, Ohioans wouldn't be facing the medical \naccess problems they are facing today.\n  While things are getting marginally better in some communities in \nOhio thanks to the California MICRA-like reform initiatives that were \npassed in Ohio in 2002 and 2003, doctors are still leaving their \npractice, and in too many towns, patients are not able to receive the \ncare they need. In fact, too many physicians in northeast Ohio are \nstill feeling the strain of skyrocketing premiums. For example, \nthoracic surgeons in Ohio are paying as much as $181,000 annually, and \nOB/GYNs in the area are paying $200,000 annually for liability \ncoverage.\n  The past 5 years have been especially tough on physicians.\n  Back in 2002, The Medical Liability Monitor ranked Ohio among the top \nfive States for premium increases, and no one felt the impact of this \nincrease more than the Schwieterman family in Ohio's rural west-central \nMercer County. I have mentioned brothers, Doctors Jim and Tom \nSchwieterman, along with their father, retired Dr. Don Schwieterman, \nbefore here on the floor, but their story is worth repeating.\n  Together, these 3 doctors have delivered about 5,700 babies over the \nyears. This family has a 113-year history of bringing babies into the \nworld--their great-grandfather started their current medical practice \nin 1896. Most importantly, they have never been sued for a delivery.\n  Yet, as of September 27, 2004, this family gave up delivering babies \nbecause of escalating malpractice insurance costs. Their insurance \nrates rose from $25,000 annually to over $80,000 in just 4 years--a \nthreefold increase. Dr. Jim Schwieterman has stated that he would \ncontinue to deliver babies if he could just break even; unfortunately, \nhe can't.\n  This situation becomes even more devastating when you learn that Dr. \nJim Schwieterman was one of only a handful of obstetricians providing \nobstetrical care in Mercer County. Now, pregnant mothers must travel, \nin many cases, outside of the county to get obstetrical care.\n  Women in Morrow County, OH, are faced with a similar situation. As of \nJanuary 2003, the only remaining physician in the county still \ndelivering babies, Dr. Bachedler, was forced to stop after his \nliability costs more than doubled in one year.\n  Sadly, obstetricians are not the only physicians in my State who are \nbeing forced out of practicing medicine. Dr. Romeo Diaz, an oncologist \nfrom my hometown of Cleveland, saw his liability premiums rise $60,000 \nannually. Despite his patients attempt to help him raise the money he \nneeded to remain in practice, Dr. Diaz closed his doors in 2003.\n  The decision to limit or close their practice does not come easily to \nthese physicians. Some time ago, a good friend of mine brought to my \nattention a letter from an OB/GYN in Dublin, OH, who had decided to \nretire from his practice. He wrote the following to his patients:\n\n       On June 17, 2003, I received my professional liability \n     insurance rate quote for the upcoming year, and it is 64 \n     percent higher than last year's rate. I have seen my premiums \n     almost triple during the past two years, despite never having \n     had a single penny paid out on my behalf in twenty-seven \n     years as a physician. Even worse, during this time the \n     insurance company has reduced the amount of coverage that I \n     can purchase from $5 million to only $1 million, while jury \n     verdicts have skyrocketed, often exceeding $3-4 million. If I \n     were to purchase this policy, I would be putting all of my \n     family's personal assets at risk every time that I delivered \n     a baby or performed surgery. I refuse to do that. I have \n     therefore decided to retire from private practice on July 31, \n     2003, the final day of my current liability insurance policy. \n     This is not a decision that I take lightly, but unfortunately \n     it has become necessary. For many of you, I have been part of \n     your life for years. I have delivered your babies, and helped \n     you through some of life's most difficult challenges. It has \n     truly been an honor.\n\n  Like these doctors, in 2004, a survey by the Ohio State Medical \nAssociation, OSMA, indicated that 34 percent of Ohio physicians expect \nto close their\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\npractices within the next 2 years without a reversal in medical \nliability rates. And whether they are ultimately forced to close their \ndoors, a majority of physicians in Ohio agree that rising medical \nliability rates have directly impacted the way they practice medicine. \nFifty-six percent of them believe they have increased the number of \ntests they have ordered for patients in order to protect themselves \nfrom potential lawsuits.\n  In fact, a March 3, 2003, report by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services calculated the practice of defensive medicine costs the \nUnited States a total of between $70 and 126 billion a year and \nestimates that the cost for the Federal Government alone is between $35 \nand $56 billion. This is costing you and me real money.\n  Nevertheless, I am very hopeful when I now hear from physicians back \nhome that thanks to the latest packages of tort reform measure that \npassed the Ohio State Legislature, medical liability rates are finally \nbeginning to stabilize.\n  In fact, a January 2006 Ohio Department of Insurance report found \nthat overall rate increases pursued by the five largest insurers were \nsignificantly less in 2005 than in previous years--6.7 percent in 2005, \ncompared to 20 percent in 2004 and approximately 30 percent in 2003. \nFor 2006, one insurer has even lowered its rates by 5 percent.\n  Good, balanced legislation can make all the difference. Just like we \nare beginning to see in Ohio, medical liability reform efforts in \nStates like Texas are providing real results. We have been hearing a \ngreat deal about the good news coming out of Texas this week on the \nSenate floor, and it is for good reason. In 2003, the Texas Legislature \nenacted comprehensive sweeping medical liability reforms, with \nreasonable limits on noneconomic damages. Texas voters also understood \nthe importance of this reform and approved proposition 12 amending the \nState constitution to specifically allow the legislature to enact the \nreasonable caps.\n  In just 3 short years, the results have been tremendous. It is hard \nto believe, but Texas physicians are once again able to competitively \nshop for medical liability coverage according to the Texas insurance \ncommissioner.\n  While this is great news, in many places across the Nation, the \nsituation is not the same, and the need for Federal medical liability \nreform is still very real.\n  Since the 107th Congress, I have been coming to the floor to speak in \nsupport of numerous medical liability bills: The HEALTH Act, the \nPatients First Act, The Healthy Mothers and Babies Access to Care Act, \nand the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act, and others. \nUnfortunately, none of these pieces of legislation garnered the 60 \nvotes needed here in the Senate to achieve cloture.\n  Frustrated by this, several years ago, I spent countless hours along \nwith the American Medical Association, AMA, going door to door to meet \nwith my colleagues to examine other possible approaches for reform. I \nmet with a number of my colleagues to explore those approaches and \ngenerate the kind of support needed to get to 60 votes.\n  The biggest complaint I heard from my colleagues is that the cap on \nnoneconomic damages in these earlier bills was too low. For this \nreason, I am especially hopeful about the legislation before us today \nand proud to be a cosponsor of both the Medical Care Access Protection \nAct and the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act.\n  These bills provide the Senate with a new approach to reforming our \nmedical liability system. Like past bills, this legislation provides \nfor unlimited payments on economic damages, but it would also mimic the \nState of Texas' approach to capping noneconomic damages. This \nlegislation would limit noneconomic damage awards to $250,000 for each \nclaimant, a healthcare provider, or each of two health care \ninstitutions. In total, this legislation creates a $750,000 cap on \nnoneconomic damages.\n  I also heard concerns from my colleagues that past versions of \nmedical liability reform bills would preempt State laws when some \nStates already have laws that are working.\n  The bill before us preserves States' rights by keeping medical \nliability statutes in place and by allowing future State laws to \nsupersede Federal limits on damages.\n  Further, the bill protects patients by placing reasonable limits on \nattorney fees, provides a review of expert witnesses to provide greater \ncreditability to cases, and maximizes patients' recovery for damages by \nlimiting the amount of payment attorneys are able to claim from awards.\n  I have been so passionate about the need for liability reform over my \npublic service career because the issue is very personal to me. When I \nwas young, I suffered from osteomyelitis, a disease in the bone marrow. \nDuring my 6-month hospital stay, I had two physicians who approached my \nparents with treatment options for me. One physician wanted to go with \nthe ``gold standard'' treatment at the time, which would more than \nlikely have saved my life but also had the potential to leave me \nwithout use of my right leg. The second physician, Dr. Holoway, offered \nmy parents a more experimental option, one that was less invasive and \nposed less of a risk to my leg. I am thankful my parents chose the more \nexperimental treatment, which left me with full mobility.\n  I wonder whether a physician in Dr. Holoway's shoes today would have \ntaken the same approach with all the potential legal implications. I \nfear in today's environment that doctor would not.\n  For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support both the Medical \nCare Access Protection Act and the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies \nAccess to Care Act. I am confident these bills strike a delicate \nbalance between the rights of aggrieved parties to bring lawsuits and \nreceive rapid and fair compensation and the rights of society to be \nprotected against frivolous lawsuits and outrageous rewards for \nnoneconomic damages--damages that are disproportionate to compensating \nthe injured and made at the expense of society as a whole.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to support moving to \nlegislation which would address the serious problems faced today by \ndoctors, hospitals and other medical professionals who provide medical \nservices, including obstetrical and gynecological services, while \nproviding fair treatment to people who are injured in the course of \nmedical treatment.\n  While most of the attention has been directed to OB/GYN malpractice \nverdicts, the issues are much broader, involving medical errors, \ninsurance company premiums and insurer investments.\n  I support caps on noneconomic damages so long as they do not apply to \nsituations such as the paperwork mix-up leading to an erroneous double \nmastectomy of a woman or the death of a 17-year-old woman on a North \nCarolina transplant case where there was a faulty blood type match or \ncomparable cases in the OB/GYN services area.\n  An appropriate standard for cases not covered could be analogous \nprovisions in Pennsylvania law which limit actions against governmental \nentities or in the limited tort context which exclude from the caps \ndeath, serious impairment of bodily function, and permanent \ndisfigurement or dismemberment.\n  Beyond the issue of caps, I believe there could be savings on the \ncost of OB/GYN malpractice insurance and other malpractice insurance by \neliminating frivolous cases by requiring plaintiffs to file with the \ncourt a certification by a doctor in the field that it is an \nappropriate case to bring to court. This proposal, which is now part of \nPennsylvania State procedure, would be expanded federally, thus \nreducing claims and saving costs. While most malpractice cases are won \nby defendants, the high cost of litigation drives up OB/GYN malpractice \npremiums and other premiums. The proposed certification would reduce \nplaintiff's joinder of peripheral defendants and cut defense costs.\n  Further savings could be accomplished through patient safety \ninitiatives identified in a report of the Institute of Medicine. On \nNovember 29, 1999, the Institute of Medicine, IOM, issued a report \nentitled: To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System. The IOM \nreport estimated that between 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized Americans \ndie each year due to avoidable medical mistakes. However, only a \nfraction of these deaths and injuries are due to negligence; most \nerrors are caused by\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\nsystem failures. The IOM issued a comprehensive set of recommendations, \nincluding the establishment of a nationwide mandatory reporting system; \nincorporation of patient safety standards in regulatory and \naccreditation programs; and the development of a non-punitive culture \nof safety in health care organizations. The report called for a 50 \npercent reduction in medical errors over 5 years.\n  The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services \nand Education, which I chair, held three hearings to discuss the IOM's \nfindings and explore ways to implement the recommendations outlined in \nthe IOM report. The fiscal year 2001 Labor-HHS appropriations bill \ncontained $50 million for a patient safety initiative and directed the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, to develop guidelines \non the collection of uniform error data; establish a competitive \ndemonstration program to test best practices; and research ways to \nimprove provider training. These initiatives were funded at $55 million \nin fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and $84 million in fiscal years 2004, \n2005, and 2006, for a total of $412 million.\n  There is some evidence that increases in OB/GYN insurance premiums \nand other premiums have been caused, at least in part, by insurance \ncompany losses, the declining stock market of the past several years, \nand the general rate-setting practices of the industry. As a matter of \ninsurance company calculations, premiums are collected and invested to \nbuild up an insurance reserve where there is considerable lag time \nbetween the payment of the premium and litigation which results in a \nverdict or settlement. When the stock market has gone down, for \nexample, that has resulted in insufficient funding to pay claims and \nthe attendant increase in OB/GYN insurance premiums. A similar result \noccurred in Texas on homeowners insurance where cost and availability \nof insurance became an issue because companies lost money in the market \nand could not cover the insured losses on hurricanes.\n  In structuring legislation to put caps on jury verdicts in \nmalpractice cases, due regard should be given to the history and \ndevelopment of trial by jury under the common law where reliance is \nplaced on average men and women who comprise a jury to reach a just \nresult reflecting the values and views of the community.\n  Jury trials in modern tort cases descend from the common law jury in \ntrespass, which was drawn from and intended to be representative of the \naverage members of the community in which the alleged trespass \noccurred. This coincides with the incorporation of negligence standards \nof liability into trespass actions.\n  This ``representative'' jury right in civil actions was protected by \nconsensus among the state drafters of the U.S. Constitution's Bill of \nRights. The explicit trial by jury safeguards in the Seventh Amendment \nto the Constitution were adaptations of these common law concepts \nharmonized with the Sixth Amendment's clause that local juries be used \nin criminal trials. Thus, from its inception at common law through its \ninclusion in the Bill of Rights and today, the jury in tort/negligence \ncases is meant to be representative of the judgment of average members \nof the community, not of elected representatives.\n  The right to have a jury decide one's damages has been greatly \ncircumscribed in recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court. \nAn example is the analysis that the court has applied to limit punitive \ndamage awards.\n  The Court has shifted its Seventh Amendment focus away from two \ncenturies of precedent in deciding that federal appellate review of \npunitive damage awards will be decided on a de novo basis and that a \njury's determination of punitive damages is not a finding of fact for \npurposes of the re-examination clause of the Seventh Amendment--``no \nfact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the \nUnited States, than according to the rules of the common law.'' Then, \nin 2003, the Court reasoned that any ratio of punitive damages to \ncompensatory damages greater than 9:1 will likely be considered \nunreasonable and disproportionate, and thus constitute an \nunconstitutional deprivation of property in non-personal injury cases. \nPlaintiffs will inevitably face a vastly increased burden to justify a \ngreater ratio, and appellate courts have far greater latitude to \ndisallow or reduce such an award.\n  These decisions may have already, in effect, placed caps on some jury \nverdicts in malpractice cases which may involve punitive damages.\n  The pending bills are a starting point for analysis, discussion, \ndebate and amendment. I am prepared to proceed with the caveat that \nthere is much work to be done before the Senate would be ready, in my \nopinion, for consideration of final passage.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today, once again, in support of \nhealth care liability reform.\n  I have long been a major supporter of reforming our medical \nmalpractice laws in an effort to stem the astronomical increases in \nhealth care costs. In fact, in the 108th Congress, I was pleased to \noffer my own amendment on health care liability reform called the \nProtect the Practice of Medicine Act.\n  While my amendment was supported by the American Medical Association, \nthe American College of Surgeons, and a number of other associations \nrepresenting the men and women in our medical profession, \nunfortunately, a procedural move by opponents prevented my amendment \nfrom receiving an up-or-down vote.\n  In fact, opponents of health care liability reform have been using \nprocedural tactics in the Senate to prevent an up-or-down vote on this \nissue for years now. The consequences are grave: men and women, who \nhave invested years of their lives training to become doctors and \nhundreds of thousands of dollars on their education, continue to leave \nthe practice of medicine due to the high cost of malpractice insurance.\n  Opponents of reform argue that the cost of medical malpractice \ninsurance is stabilizing and that the increases in malpractice premiums \nare not as dramatic as they were a few years ago. The truth is that \nthese premiums remain extremely high. Having rates stabilize does not \nmean that those rates have gone down. Time and time again, doctors come \ninto my office and tell me that they are having a difficult time making \na living and keeping quality staff because of the staggering amounts \nthey are paying for medical liability insurance.\n  I have received numerous letters from medical professionals in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia and from across the Nation that share with me \nthe very real difficulties they are encountering with malpractice \ninsurance and the consequences of this problem. Let me read part of one \nthose letters that was sent to me by a doctor in Virginia. The doctor \nwrites:\n\n       I am writing you to elicit your support and advice for the \n     acute malpractice crisis going on in Virginia. . . . I am a \n     48-year-old single parent of a 14 and 17 year old. After all \n     the time and money spent training to practice OB/GYN, I find \n     myself on the verge of almost certain unemployment and \n     unemployability because of the malpractice crisis. I have \n     been employed by a small OB/GYN Group for the last 7 years. . \n     . . Our malpractice premiums were increased by 60 percent . . \n     . The reality is that we will not be able to keep the \n     practice open and cover the malpractice insurance along with \n     other expenses of practice.\n\n  Out of respect for this doctor's privacy, I will not share the \ndoctor's name, but I do keep her letter in my files.\n  According to the American College of Surgeons, many surgeons are \nbeing forced to retire earlier, stop providing high-risk procedures, or \nmove to States where strong medical liability reforms are in place.\n  On March 16, 2006, Norfolk, VA's, newspaper, the Virginian-Pilot, \nfeatured the story of Dr. Shawne Bryant, an OB/GYN in Kempsville, VA. \nDr. Bryant explained that she stopped performing surgery in 2003, \nciting high malpractice insurance rates. She redirected her talent into \nquiltmaking.\n  Dr. Bryant, who has been in the field of obstetrics and gynecology \nfor 21 years, said, ``I used to be in the operating room two to three \ndays a week. This [quiltmaking] is an outlet for me because I'm still \nworking with my hands.'' Since giving up the practice of surgery, \nBryant has made eight quilts.\n  Both Time Magazine and Newsweek have thoroughly detailed the crisis \ndoctors are facing across America.\n  In June of 2003, Time Magazine had a cover story on the affects of \nrising malpractice insurance rates. The story, entitled ``The Doctor is \nOut,'' discusses\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\nseveral doctors, all across America, who have had to either stop \npracticing medicine or have had to take other action due to increased \ninsurance premiums.\n  One example cited in Time's article is the case of Dr. Mary-Emma \nBeres. Time reports that, ``Dr Mary-Emma Beres, a family practitioner \nin Sparta, N.C., has always loved delivering babies. But last year \nBeres, 35, concluded that she couldn't afford the tripling of her \n$17,000 malpractice premium and had to stop. With just one obstetrician \nleft in town for high risk cases, some women who need C-sections now \nmust take a 40-minute ambulance ride.''\n  Dr. Beres' case makes clear that not only doctors are being affected \nby the medical malpractice insurance crisis--patients are as well. With \nincreased frequency, due to rising malpractice rates, more and more \npatients are not able to find the medical specialists they need.\n  Newsweek also had a cover story on the medical liability crisis. That \ncover story was entitled ``Lawsuit Hell.'' I was particularly struck by \nthe feature in this magazine about a doctor from Ohio who saw his \nmalpractice premiums rise in one year from $12,000 to $57,000 a year. \nAs a result, this doctor, and I quote from the article, ``decided to \nlower his bill by cutting out higher-risk procedures like vasectomies, \nsetting broken bones and delivering babies--even though obstetrics was \nhis favorite part of the practice. Now he glances wistfully at the \ncluster of baby photos still tacked to a wall in his office, `I miss \nthat terribly,' he says.''\n  Without a doubt, the cost of medical malpractice insurance premiums \nare having wide-ranging effects. It is a national problem, and it is \ntime for a national solution.\n  President Bush has indicated that the medical liability system in \nAmerica is largely responsible for the rising costs of malpractice \ninsurance. The American Medical Association and the American College of \nSurgeons agree with him, as does almost every doctor in Virginia with \nwhom I have discussed the issue.\n  Let me state unequivocally that I agree with our President, with the \nAMA, with the American College of Surgeons, and with the vast majority \nof doctors all across Virginia.\n  I am pleased that S. 23, the Healthy Mothers and Health Babies Access \nto Care Act, reduces the excessive burden the liability system places \nspecifically on the delivery of obstetrical and gynecological services. \nAnd I am pleased that S. 22, the ``Medical Care Access Protection Act \nof 2006'' or ``MCAP Act,'' extends liability protections to all health \ncare providers and health care institutions.\n  These bills are a commonsense solution to a serious problem, and it \nis time for us to vote up or down on this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, once again we are faced with ill-advised \nmedical malpractice bills coming to the Senate floor without any \ncommittee consideration. Some argue that we have a malpractice \ninsurance crisis that is driving doctors from the practice of medicine, \nparticularly in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, or OB/GYN. But \nwe haven't yet explored these issues in the Senate at all. No committee \nhas held hearings or marked up a bill on this topic. Instead, extreme \nproposals have been brought directly to the floor and Senators are \nexpected to vote for them. Indeed, motions to proceed to two different \nbills are being considered at the same time because no one really \nexpects them to succeed. This is just a show. That is not how the \nlegislative process should work on an issue of importance to so many \npeople. I will vote no on cloture, as I have repeatedly in the past and \nwill do in the future, until this issue is addressed in a serious way.\n  I would like very much for Congress to address the problem of \nmalpractice insurance premiums once we understand the causes of the \nproblem and the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. But by \nbringing these bills directly to the floor, the majority simply \ndemonstrates that it is not serious about addressing the problem. It \njust wants to play a political card. To the extent that there really is \na malpractice insurance problem, what is going on here is a cynical \nexercise, designed only to fail and to provide fodder for political \nattacks.\n  These bills, in my judgment, will not solve the problem that they \nsupposedly have been designed to address. What they will surely do is \nharm innocent Americans who have suffered horrible and permanent injury \nat the hands of negligent medical practitioners.\n  There are many provisions of S. 22 and S. 23 with which I have \nserious disagreement. Let me just mention a few. In a provision called \nthe ``fair share rule,'' the bills eliminate joint and several \nliability in the lawsuits covered by the bills. What that means is that \nif one responsible defendant is insolvent and has no insurance \ncoverage, the victim of malpractice ends up without a full recovery of \nhis or her damages. This is not fair. Most state laws provide that the \nrisk of one defendant being insolvent or judgment-proof is borne by the \nother responsible defendants. There is no reason to change this \nlongstanding principle of law. All it does is make it more likely that \ninjured mothers and children will not recover the damages that a court \nhas decided they are due.\n  Another problem with these bills is a new statute of limitations that \napplies only in States that are more protective of the injured party \nthan the new Federal standard. Shorter statutes of limitation don't \ndiscourage frivolous claims, they encourage them. Lawyers facing a \nlooming statute of limitations are more likely to file lawsuits to \nprotect their clients' options. Imposing a statute of limitations of as \nlittle as one year, as these bills do, does not allow adequate time to \ninvestigate a case and determine if it really should be brought.\n  But perhaps the most ill-advised provision in these bills is the cap \non noneconomic damages. These caps have been modified from previous \nbills and are designed to look more generous, although they actually \nwon't be in most cases. Indeed, it will be very rare for a plaintiff to \nreach the new maximum caps because most lawsuits don't name at least \none doctor, and least two hospitals or other institutions as \ndefendants.\n  We have held no hearings on the medical malpractice issue in this \nCongress, but at the one hearing held on this issue in the last \nCongress, the Judiciary and HELP Committees heard from Linda McDougal, \na 46-year-old Navy veteran from Woodville, WI. Several years ago, Ms. \nMcDougal underwent a double mastectomy after her biopsy results were \nswitched with those of another patient. She didn't have cancer, she \nnever had cancer. We can be thankful for that. But her life, and her \nfamily's life, will never be the same.\n  I hope everyone in the Senate will read Linda McDougal's testimony \nand learn about her experience. It is a powerful cautionary tale for \nthose of us who are charged with voting on legislation concerning \nmedical malpractice.\n  I find it hard to believe that anyone in this body can look Linda \nMcDougal or any of the thousands of victims of catastrophic medical \nmalpractice in the eye and say, ``all your pain and suffering is worth \nonly $250,000, or maybe $750,000 if you sue enough people.'' Would any \nof us be able to tell our mothers or our wives or our daughters that \ntheir damages should be limited in this arbitrary way if they were the \nvictims of the unspeakable pain and lifelong sadness that Linda \nMcDougal will endure? Remember, Linda McDougal didn't have \nextraordinary medical bills or lost wages. Her damages are noneconomic. \nBut her loss is real, it is permanent, it is unfathomable.\n  There is no question that we have a problem in this country over the \ncost of malpractice insurance. But the solution cannot be to penalize \ninnocent victims like Linda McDougal, to prolong and extend their \nsuffering by denying them adequate compensation.\n  Caps on noneconomic damages are a cruel hoax. They are advertised as \na disincentive to frivolous lawsuits. But they have the most impact on \nthe most serious and nonfrivolous cases, cases where unimaginable pain \nhas been inflicted on someone by a careless health professional.\n  In addition, we have virtually no evidence that caps on economic \ndamages will actually lower insurance rates. Indeed, in States that \nhave caps on noneconomic damages, insurance premiums increased 48 \npercent from 1991 to 2002. But in States without caps, the increase has \nbeen only 36 percent. So the case has simply not been made that\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\nthe caps in this bill will lower malpractice premiums. But more \nimportantly, the case has not been made, and in my view cannot be made, \nthat these caps are fair to victims like Linda McDougal.\n  There very well may be solutions that we in the Senate can develop to \naddress the cost of medical malpractice insurance in this country and \nthe effect on patient care that rising premiums are causing. And there \ncertainly are things we can do to address the disturbing problem of \nmedical error in this country. The Institute of Medicine estimates that \nbetween 44,000 and 98,000 adverse medical events occur in hospitals \nevery year. Other studies suggest that those numbers may be a vast \nunderestimate.\n  If we want to reduce malpractice insurance premiums we must address \nthese problems as well as looking closely at the business practices of \nthe insurance companies. What we shouldn't do is limit the recovery of \nvictims of horrible injury to an arbitrarily low sum.\n  This is obviously a complicated issue. This is the kind of issue that \nneeds to be explored in depth in our committees so that a consensus can \nemerge. It is certainly not the kind of issue that should be brought \ndirectly to the floor with such a great gulf between supporters and \nopponents. So I will vote no on cloture today on both S. 22 and S. 23, \nand I hope that these bills will go through the HELP Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee before we begin floor consideration of this \nimportant topic.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURR).

On this vote, the yeas are 49, \nthe nays are 44. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last Wednesday, Senator Ensign introduced S. \n22, the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006, a bill that would \n``cap'' legal damages awarded to victims of medical malpractice. \nSenators Santorum and Gregg similarly, just last week, introduced S. \n23, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act, a bill \nto limit legal damages in cases involving obstetrical and gynecological \nservices.\n  Today I voted not to invoke cloture on the motions to proceed to \nthese two bills, because there has been no debate of these particular \nmeasures in the 109th Congress. There have been no hearings scheduled \nor held on the bills this year, and their provisions raise questions to \nwhich West Virginians deserve complete and well-considered responses.\n  The situation in West Virginia today is not as it was several years \nago, when the State legislature enacted medical liability tort reform. \nAt that time, there was a perceived crisis based on the escalating \ncosts of medical insurance premiums, and there were serious concerns \nthat doctors and other health care providers may have been leaving the \nState to avoid the expenses they incurred in protecting themselves from \nlegal liability. Today, however, even the West Virginia State Medical \nAssociation, a strong supporter of medical liability reform, advises \nthat, based on the significant changes passed by the West Virginia \nState Legislature in 2003, the State has ``already seen positive \nresults with recent decreases in insurance premiums and an increase in \nthe ability to recruit physicians to the state.''\n  Based on the acknowledged success of West Virginia's legislative \nenactments in this area, it would be irresponsible, if not downright \nfoolhardy, to enact S. 22 and S. 23 with little examination and no \nrecent debate, particularly when the provisions of these bills would \nexplicitly preempt certain State laws. In addition, the bills shorten \nthe time during which patients can bring cases; they limit punitive \ndamages; they exempt from product liability lawsuits health care \nproviders who have prescribed drugs or devices approved by the FDA; and \nthey generally revamp our Nation's medical liability system in the wink \nof an eye, though the bills' provisions have been subject to little, if \nany, serious scrutiny.\n  Based on the changes that have occurred in our medical liability \nsystem since 2003, legislation of this importance requires careful \nconsideration by the Senate's relevant committees of jurisdiction. To \ngive such important provisions such short shrift, particularly in this \nchanged environment, would do a tremendous disservice to medical \nproviders and patients throughout both West Virginia and the Nation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Today the Senate once again considered medical liability \nreform bills--S. 22 and S. 23--both of which would impose an arbitrary \ncap on the amount of noneconomic damages--pain and suffering awards--an \ninjured patient can receive in a medical malpractice lawsuit.\n  This is not the first time the Senate has dealt with such \nlegislation. In years past, there were real problems with skyrocketing \npremiums that insurance companies were charging doctors. Even then, \nimposing damage caps was the wrong approach to address the issue and \nremains just as wrong today. A so-called reform based on arbitrarily \ncapping pain and suffering awards is not a panacea. Studies show that \npassing a Federal medical malpractice law with damage caps will likely \nhave no impact on runaway insurance premiums. Further, there is no \npromise that any savings insurance companies realize from such a law \nwould be passed on to doctors.\n  Moreover, we find that medical malpractice premiums have leveled off \nor are no longer increasing in both States with and without caps on \nnoneconomic damages. A reasonable person could question why we are even \nconsidering this legislation when it appears the problem is abating. \nNonetheless, some insist against all evidence that we need to pass \nthese bills to save the health care system. Just as I have opposed \nsimilar damage cap bills in the past, I will oppose both S. 22 and S. \n23.\n  Wisconsin has thoroughly addressed this issue with great success. As \na result, we do not have a medical liability insurance crisis like some \nother States. Wisconsin has a noneconomic cap and a system that works \nfor doctors and patients alike. Specifically, Wisconsin limits the \namount of liability insurance a medical professional must obtain, and \nbeyond that, Wisconsin's Patient Compensation Fund ensures that injured \npatients are fully reimbursed for their damages. I oppose doing \nanything to upset the delicate balance the State has found.\n  Though neither S. 22 nor S. 23 would preempt Wisconsin's damage caps, \nWisconsin law would be overturned in several other areas. For example, \nWisconsin law grants children the right to sue, better ensures that \nvictims fully recover their damages from defendants, and does not limit \nattorney fees as much as the Federal proposal. I will not support a \nFederal solution that undoes Wisconsin's law.\n  To be sure, the larger issue of medical liability reform deserves a \nserious debate instead of the resurfacing of a one-sided solution. We \nmight want to look to Wisconsin as a model.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I voted in favor of invoking cloture \non S. 22, the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006, and S. 23, \nthe Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. I have \nconcerns about various aspects of the legislation including the \nspecific levels of the proposed damage caps. However, I do believe that \nreform of the medical malpractice system should be considered by the \nSenate to discourage frivolous lawsuits and to ensure that individuals \nare able to access affordable health care. For these reasons, I voted \nto invoke cloture on both of these bills in an effort to move this \nimportant debate forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I do need to \nexplain where we are in this process.\n  We have a bill that made it out of committee to provide for small \nbusiness health plans. There has been unanimous consent requested to \nproceed to the debate. That was denied. That is just the right to \ndebate the bill, but it was denied. So a cloture motion was put in, and \nwe will vote on that cloture motion tomorrow. That will be the 3 days \nafter the cloture motion was filed. So that is a 3-day delay that we \nalready have in solving small business health plan problems.\n  Tomorrow morning we will vote at 10. I can't imagine anybody voting \nagainst better health for people who work in small businesses. I am \nanticipating that we will get 60 votes. When we get 60 votes, we still \nwill not get to debate the bill. We will have 30 hours of debate on \nthat cloture vote before we will get to offer any amendments. Thirty \nhours. That could easily be 3 days. It could easily be Thursday before \nwe get to offer the first amendment. I hope the other side will help to \nget cloture so that we can proceed to the debate. Then I hope that they \nwould agree to shorten that time significantly so we could actually get \nto amendments and debate the bill.\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\n  We need to have a debate over the rising cost of health care. More \nimportantly, we need to take action. Americans are tired of the status \nquo. They are tired of more of the same from the Senate. They are tired \nof excuses. They do want to see change for the better.\n  The majority leader announced his intention to bring a bill before \nthe Senate that would allow small businesses to band together across \nthe country and negotiate for better health care benefits at better \nprices. This bill sets up a system where we get a little bit of \nuniformity out there for the small businesses to band together across \nState lines and form a big enough pool that they have some power to \nnegotiate against the insurance companies.\n  It is probably important to do that vote. I have some actuarial \nstudies that show how many more people will be brought into the system, \nand CBO has done some evaluations of how many more people will be able \nto be insured and what kind of savings there will be. But I don't think \nthey have the numbers right. The numbers are far greater than what they \nlist.\n  Here is the reason I believe that. I had a lot of people call me \nFriday and Saturday and Sunday and let me know about the ads being run \nacross the country. They are not referring to it as the small business \nhealth plans or even the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and \nAffordability Act. They are not even referring to it as S. 1955. They \nare referring to it as the Enzi bill. It is not the Enzi bill. It is \nthe small business health plan bill. There are even Web sites set up. \nThousands, if not millions, of dollars are being spent on advertising \nagainst it, which tells me that perhaps the ability for small companies \nto get together and negotiate against the insurance companies might be \nworth a lot more than anybody anticipated. That is where the ads are \ncoming from.\n  Tomorrow morning we will be voting on the motion to proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 1955. The bill will reduce the cost of health care, \nespecially for America's small business owners and working families. \nToday, of the 45 million people without health insurance, 22 million \nown or work for small business, according to the Small Business \nCommittee definition of a small business, or they live in families that \ndepend on that small business for wages. Besides the 22 million out of \nthe 45 million, there is another 5 million who are self-employed who \ncould take advantage of this bill. That makes 27 million people who \ncan't afford decent health insurance right now.\n  It is long past time for Congress to take action. The American people \naren't going to accept excuses any longer. It is time for the Senate to \ntake the first major step in nearly 15 years toward more affordable \nhealth insurance options for small businesses and working families.\n  There has been a bill on the House side that has passed 8 times in \nthe last 12 years for association health plans. The Senate has never \ngotten any kind of a bill like that out of committee until now. This \nbill is not quite like that bill. This bill was derived by talking to \nthe insurance companies, talking to the insurance commissioners, having \nthem sit down with the associations and try to find a workable way that \nwould not unlevel the playing field so that some people would be paying \nmore for their health insurance while others were paying less. They \nworked for almost a year with me. All of them were convinced that \nsomething needed to be done. All of them were willing to work in a \npositive manner to come up with a bill that would work. That is what we \nhave before us now.\n\n  That is not to say that the bill won't be changed through the debate, \nif we can get to the debate. There probably will be changes. There can \nbe amendments to the bill. One of the things I have learned being in \nthe State legislature as well as in Congress is that quite often \namendments do help make a bill better. I do know that the American \npeople support giving small businesses the same power that big \nbusinesses have had to negotiate for better benefits and better prices.\n  The fact that it has taken us so long to get to this point has to be \nfrustrating for our constituents and the small businessmen. That is \nmost of the people in the United States. They are either small business \nor they work in small businesses. When they work in a small business, \nthey understand the plight of the business much better than in a big \nbusiness. We already gave big business a lot more opportunity to \nnegotiate than what we have in this bill for small business. This is a \ngreat start for small businesses to bring those costs down.\n  Small business owners and working families do want an up-or-down vote \non small business health plans. They think they deserve it, and I \nbelieve they deserve it. I believe almost everybody here thinks they \ndeserve a vote on whether they ought to be able to have a fraction of \nwhat the big companies have as an advantage in working with the \ninsurance companies.\n  For years the small business owners have been asking the Senate to \ngrant them the power that the big businesses have so they can secure \naffordable health care for their employees and their families. For the \nfirst time in over a decade, the Senate committee has reported a bill \nthat gives small business owners the power they are seeking. Americans \nhave sent hundreds of thousands of letters, petitions, phone calls, e-\nmails, faxes to the Senate over the past few weeks in support of small \nbusiness health plans. The National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, one of the associations interested in this, delivered \n500,000 petitions from across the United States asking us to do \nsomething. The people have taken time out of their busy days to demand \naction, and they deserve that up-or-down vote.\n  I remember getting permission, shortly after I got to the Senate, to \nhold a small business hearing in Casper, WY. That is the big city in \nthe center of Wyoming. I held that hearing. I was pleased. I had about \n100 small businessmen show up to lend their support and express their \nneeds.\n  Afterward, one of the reporters asked: Aren't you disappointed you \nonly had 100 people show up?\n  I said: Actually, this is small business. I am kind of surprised that \n100 showed up because in small business, if you have an extra person \nwho can spend a day at a hearing, you would probably fire them because \nyou would have one more person than you needed.\n  In small business, they don't have nearly the diversity or the \nspecialization, but they have a lot of personal ability and flexibility \nto take their product to market and to make a difference against the \nbig companies that way. But they need some extra help. I know the \nminority leader will want an up-or-down vote on a bill sponsored by \nSenators Durbin and Lincoln. I believe the minority leader should get \nthat up-or-down vote, even though I don't believe the bill he supports \nwould provide the kind of change small business owners want and need. I \nknow what the support is for that bill. I would love to do the \ncomparisons between what we are trying to do in small business health \nplans and that. Let's see what the will of the Senate is, and let's not \nresort to blocking consideration through procedural motions.\n\n  I am sure some of my Democratic colleagues will want to use their \nshare of the 30 hours of debate after this vote to discuss a variety of \nhealth care issues. Some Members of the minority will want to discuss \nthe Medicare drug benefit. I have heard that on the floor in this \npreliminary time. Some will want to talk about drug importation. Some \nwill want to talk about stem cell research. I know that from the debate \nwe have had on the floor today. It is their right under the Senate \nrules.\n  I am not sure how I would go about explaining that to the small \nbusiness owners and the working families who work in those small \nbusinesses. I suppose that the vast majority of those small business \nowners are going to be too busy during the day and night to watch the \nSenate debate on C-SPAN2. But those who do will understand that the \nissues we are talking about are not the solution they are expecting, \nand that they are external to the bill we are debating at this time. \nThose are important issues. But if they are just being done to block a \nbill--and that will be the way it will be termed by small business--I \nsuspect there will be a price to pay for that kind of action.\n  I hope, for all our sakes, that the TVs in hospital emergency rooms \nare not tuned to C-SPAN. Some of those Americans who depend on small \nbusiness and are in the emergency room may have no health insurance. \nMaybe their company dropped the coverage last year or\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nmaybe the company could not afford health insurance in the first place.\n  What would they say if they were watching us this week? After all, \nthe caption on the screen will read that we are supposed to be debating \nhealth insurance for working families. But instead of debating two \ncompeting visions for providing more affordable health care options for \nsmall businesses, we will be talking about Democratic amendments on a \nnumber of issues, including the Medicare drug benefit, which has \nalready been done, and people are signing up in numbers that had not \nbeen anticipated. There is also already enough competition out there \nthat it has driven the prices down. That is what competition does. It \nis working for seniors and they are saving money.\n  But instead of talking about things that are working for Americans, \nwe should be debating the challenges that still face us, such as the \nrising cost of health care for America's working families.\n  Every day, emergency rooms treat more than 30,000 uninsured Americans \nwho work for or depend on small business. That is at least 30,000 \nreasons why we should move right away to the consideration of S. 1955 \nto create small business health plans.\n  For the first time in more than a decade, the Senate has been \npresented with a bill that would create a whole new set of affordable \nhealth care choices through small business health plans.\n  Is it the perfect bill? No. I have never seen one in my 9 years in \nthe Senate. We won't get to see anything even near perfect if we don't \nget to debate it. I believe most of my colleagues like the concept of \ngetting as much perfection through amendments as possible and do want \nto work with me on it. Procedural votes won't get that done.\n  If we are waiting for the perfect bill, the one true and \ncomprehensive solution to fix our health care system, then someone \nneeds to bring us a tent, flashlights, and field rations, because we \nare going to be a very long time waiting for that. I am hoping it is \nnot a series of 30-hour waits to debate things that won't have anything \nto do with getting small business health plans for small businesses. \nAmericans are never waiting for perfection from Congress. They have \ngiven up on that long ago. But they do want action.\n  We have a good bill before us. We have a bipartisan bill before us. I \nam a former small business owner and I know something about the \nstruggle to provide affordable health care to my family and to my work \nfamilies.\n  Senator Ben Nelson, who coauthored this bill, is a former State \ninsurance commissioner, so he knows something about the importance of \nprotecting consumers. Senator Nelson and I have spoken about this bill \nwith just about every Member of the Senate. We think it is a very good \nbill, and we have reached out to our colleagues over the last several \nmonths to take their concerns into account as we put the bill together.\n  Some of our colleagues will have amendments they believe will make it \neven better, and they should have the opportunity to offer those \namendments. Neither Senator Nelson nor I are afraid of that, nor are we \nafraid of any alternative bills that Members might want to propose.\n  I urge my colleagues to set aside tomorrow's motion to proceed to the \nconsideration of the bill. Let's get on with it, debate it, and have \nsome amendments. We can have constructive votes on the floor on a \nnumber of issues that will improve this bill. But if we have to go \nthrough the procedural motions, let's keep in mind those 27 million \nuninsured Americans who work for or depend on small businesses. Those \nare 27 million Americans who are counting on the Senate to act now--not \nnext month, not next year, but now.\n  Let's take the step toward more affordable health care for all \nAmericans by giving small business owners the power to create small \nbusiness health plans for themselves, their families, and their \nworkers. Give them the chance they are seeking, instead of more of the \nsame excuses for not acting. I don't think they will buy that.\n  I am hoping some of the media that is doing coverage will do a little \nbit better job than I happened to see last weekend. PBS did a special. \nThey forgot to talk to anybody who worked on the bill. They talked \nabout some problems with California's health care and attributed it to \nthis bill. This bill cannot be the cause of that yet because it is not \nin California.\n  There have been concerns by a number of other groups. One was the \nattorneys general for a number of States. Again, it would have been \nnice if they would have talked to us to be sure they had the right bill \nand had read it before they took their action. So we will be covering \nthat in the next few days.\n  If we have to talk for 30 hours, we will be plenty willing to do \nthat. There are a lot of people in small businesses who see this as a \nprimary concern and need, and they wish to see it done as soon as \npossible. They will not be very forgiving if people are holding things \nup to try to defeat the bill instead of making constructive progress.\n  I appreciate all those who have worked with me and all of those who \nare still working on amendments. Particularly, I would appreciate it if \nthey would talk to me. There are some good ideas out there, things that \nwould work. Many are for clarification. It will make a difference to \nsmall business. I hope everybody will get past this motion to proceed \nand the 30 hours of debate will get finished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4149-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4149-S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today the U.S. Civil Rights Commission \nannounced its opposition to S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act of 2005, which the Commission found to \n``discriminate on the basis of race.''\n  It is possible that the Senate will be asked in the next few weeks to \nconsider this legislation. I hope my colleagues will agree with the \nCivil Rights Commission and oppose this legislation.\n  Here is what the Commission had to say:\n\n       The Commission recommends against passage of the Native \n     Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005, or any other \n     legislation that would discriminate on the basis of race or \n     national origin and further subdivide the American people \n     into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of \n     privilege.\n\n  S. 147, the act to which the Commission refers, would create a \nseparate, independent, race-based government for native Hawaiians. It \nwould undermine our unity in this country. It would undermine our \nhistory of being a nation based not on race but upon common values of \nliberty, equal opportunity, and democracy.\n  The question the bill poses is thus one that is fundamental to the \nvery existence of our country. It creates a new government based on \nrace. Our Constitution guarantees just the opposite--equal opportunity \nwithout regard to race.\n  Hawaiians are Americans. They became United States citizens in 1900. \nThey have saluted the American flag, paid American taxes, fought in \nAmerican wars. In 1959, 94 percent of Hawaiians reaffirmed that \ncommitment to become Americans by voting to become a state. Like \ncitizens of every other state, Hawaii votes in national elections.\n  Becoming an American has always meant giving up allegiance to your \nprevious country and pledging allegiance to your new country, the \nUnited States of America.\n  This goes back to Valley Forge when George Washington himself signed \nand then administered this oath to his officers: ``I . . . renounce, \nrefuse, and abjure any allegiance or obedience to [King George III]; \nand I do swear that I will to the utmost of my power, support, maintain \nand defend the said United States. . . .''\n  America is different because, under our Constitution, becoming an \nAmerican can have nothing to do with ancestry. That is because America \nis an idea, not a race. Ours is a nation based not upon race, not upon \nethnicity, not upon national origin, but upon our shared values, \nenshrined in our founding documents, the Declaration of Independence \nand the Constitution, upon our history as a nation, and upon our shared \nlanguage, English. An American can technically become a citizen of \nJapan, but would never be considered ``Japanese.'' But if a Japanese \nperson wants to become a citizen of the United States, he or she must \nbecome an American.\n  That's who we are as Americans, and when we forget that, we run the \nrisk of\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\nundermining our greatest strength. Some say that diversity is our \ngreatest strength. And it is a great strength, but hardly our greatest. \nJerusalem is diverse. The Balkans are diverse. Iraq is diverse. Our \ngreatest strength is that we have taken all that magnificent diversity \nand forged it into one Nation.\n  My heritage is Scotch-Irish. In early America, the Scotch-Irish \nreferred to themselves as a race of people. But despite Scotch-Irish \ncontributions to American independence and some injustices before \nindependence, they did not ask for a separate nation based on race.\n  It is suggested that ``native Hawaiians'' are different because they \nlived on the islands of Hawaii before Asian and white settlers came \nthere, and that their previous government was undermined by Americans \nwho came. So, the argument goes, they should be treated as an American \nIndian tribe.\n  But U.S. law has specific requirements for recognition of an Indian \ntribe. A tribe must have operated as a sovereign for the last 100 \nyears, must be a separate and distinct community, and must have had a \npreexisting political organization. Native Hawaiians do not meet those \nrequirements. In 1998 the State of Hawaii acknowledged this in a \nSupreme Court brief in Rice v. Cayetano, saying: ``The tribal concept \nsimply has no place in the context of Hawaiian history.''\n  If the bill establishing a ``native Hawaiian'' government were to \npass, it would have the dubious honor of being the first to create a \nseparate nation within the United States. While Congress has recognized \npre-existing American Indian tribes before, it has never created a new \none. This is a dangerous precedent. This is not much different than if \nAmerican citizens who are descended from Hispanics that lived in Texas \nbefore it became a republic in 1836 created their own tribe, based on \nclaims that these lands were improperly seized from Mexico. Or it could \nopen the door to religious groups, such as the Amish or Hassidic Jews, \nwho might seek tribal status to avoid the constraints of the \nEstablishment Clause of the Constitution. If we start down this path, \nthe end may be the disintegration of the United States into ethnic \nenclaves.\n  Hawaii itself is a proud example of the American tradition of \ndiversity. According to the 2000 Census, 40 percent of Hawaiians are of \nAsian descent. Twenty-four percent are white. Nine percent said they \nwere Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders. Seven percent claimed \nHispanic ethnicity and 2 percent were black. Twenty-one percent of \nHawaiians reported two or more racial identities. Their two Senators \nare of native Hawaiian and Japanese ancestry. Their Governor is white \nand also happens to be Jewish. But what unites Hawaii is not its \ndiversity, but its common Hawaiian traditions and the fact that \nHawaiians are all Americans.\n  The proposed new government for ``native Hawaiians'' would be based \nsolely upon race. S. 147 makes individuals eligible to be ``native \nHawaiian'' specifically by blood. Surely we have by now learned our \nlesson about treating people differently based upon race. Our most \ntragic experiences have occurred when we have treated people \ndifferently based upon race, whether they were African-Americans, \nNative American, or of other descent.\n  In the documents to which we have pledged allegiance, the way we have \nsought to right those wrongs is to guarantee respect for each American \nas an individual, regardless of his or her race. This legislation \ninstead would compound those old wrongs. It would create a separate \ngovernment, and separate rules--perhaps later even separate schools--\nbased solely upon race.\n  To destroy our national unity by treating Americans differently based \nupon race is to destroy what is most unique about our country. It would \nbegin to make us a United Nations instead of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The Senate should heed the advice of the U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights and defeat this legislation that would discriminate on the basis \nof race or national origin and further subdivide the American people \ninto discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege and \ncreate a new, separate, race-based government for those of native \nHawaiian descent.\n  This idea is the reverse of what it means to become an American. \nInstead of making us one nation indivisible, it divides us. Instead of \nguaranteeing rights without regard to race, it makes them depend solely \nupon race. Instead of becoming ``one from many,'' we would become many \nfrom one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in response to my good friend and \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Tennessee, who spoke about \nlegislation that is critical to the people of Hawaii, S. 147, the \nNative Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005.\n  S. 147 would extend the Federal policy of self-governance and self-\ndetermination to Hawaii's indigenous peoples, the native Hawaiians, by \nauthorizing a process for the reorganization of a native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity for the purposes of a government-to-government \nrelationship with the United States.\n  My colleague raised the actions by the U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights last week. The Commission issued a report in opposition to S. \n147. The report was based on a briefing that was conducted on January \n20, 2006.\n  I am seriously concerned about the lack of objectivity in the \nCommission's review. The Commission never contacted its Hawaii advisory \ncommittee, which includes members who are experts in Hawaii's history \nand Indian law. Not once was the advisory committee informed of the \nbriefing or allowed to contribute to the Commission's report.\n  Further, despite the fact that the Commission was provided with the \nsubstitute amendment which reflects negotiations with the executive \nbranch, the Commission chose to issue its report based on the bill as \nreported out of committee. The substitute amendment to S. 147 will be \noffered when we consider the bill and reflects negotiations with the \nofficials from the Department of Justice, Office of Management and \nBudget, and the White House.\n  The substitute amendment satisfactorily addresses the concerns \nexpressed by the Bush administration regarding the liability of the \nU.S. Government, military readiness, civil and criminal jurisdiction, \nand gaming. The amendment has been publicly available since September \n2005 and has been widely distributed.\n  I applaud the efforts of Commissioners Arlen Melendez and Michael \nYaki who voted in opposition to the report and tried to inject \nobjectivity and fairness into this process. It really saddens me when \nan independent commission begins to act in a politically motivated \nmanner.\n  Despite this fact, I remain committed to my constituents and the \npeople of Hawaii. I will continue to work to bring this bill to the \nSenate floor as it has been promised by the majority leader and the \njunior Senator from Arizona. The people of Hawaii deserve no less than \na debate and a vote on an issue of critical importance to them and to \ntheir State.\n  When I first started my career in Congress over 30 years ago, there \nwas a protocol and a courtesy. If legislation was going to impact a \nparticular State, and the leaders of that State all supported the \nissue, it was protocol that other Members would not interfere or \nobstruct efforts to legislate on behalf of that State. Unfortunately, \nthis longstanding protocol and courtesy, I am ashamed to say, no longer \nexists.\n  S. 147 is widely supported in Hawaii--widely supported in Hawaii. The \nbill enjoys the bipartisan support of my colleagues, Senators Cantwell, \nColeman, Dodd, Dorgan, Graham, Inouye, Murkowski, Smith, and Stevens. \nIt is strongly supported by Hawaii's first Republican Governor in 40 \nyears, Linda Lingle. She supports this bill. It is supported strongly \nby Hawaii's State Legislature which has passed three resolutions in \nfavor of extending the Federal policy of self-governance and self-\ndetermination to native Hawaiians. It is supported by almost every \nsingle political leader in Hawaii. S. 147 is also supported by native \nHawaiians and non-native Hawaiians.\n  Why, you might ask? Because in Hawaii, native Hawaiian issues are \nnonpartisan. We have tremendous respect for the indigenous peoples who \nhave shared their lands, traditions, and cultures with the rest of us.\n  Mr. President, I have been patient, and the people of Hawaii have \nbeen patient. For the past 3 years, the majority and Democratic leaders \nhave been\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\nworking with me to uphold a commitment that was made at the end of the \n108th Congress that we would consider and vote on this bill. \nUnfortunately--again, unfortunately--their efforts have been thwarted \nby a handful of colleagues who have taken it upon themselves to block \nthis bill despite the widespread support from the State of Hawaii.\n  After 7 years of delay by a few of my colleagues, it is time we are \nprovided with the opportunity to debate this bill in the open. I will \nbe coming to the floor to talk about my bill every day until we begin \ndebate on the bill. I will use every day to talk about what my bill \ndoes and does not do and to respond to the outright untruths that have \nbeen spread about the legislation. I will use every day to help share \nHawaii's history with my colleagues as the opponents of this \nlegislation have taken it upon themselves to rewrite the tragedies of \nHawaii's history in a manner that suits them for the purposes of \nopposing this legislation.\n  I am deeply saddened by their tactics, but I am committed to ensuring \nthat the Members of this body and all of the citizens in the United \nStates understand Hawaii's history and the importance of extending the \nFederal policy of self-governance and self-determination to Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples, the native Hawaiians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4151-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the memory of Marine LCpl Stephen Bixler, of Suffield, CT, who \nwas killed last week while serving our Nation in Iraq. He was 20 years \nold.\n  Tragically, Corporal Bixler's life was cut short when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated while he was on patrol in Iraq's Al Anbar \nprovince. He was on his third tour of duty with the Marine Corps, \nhaving served previous tours in Haiti and Iraq. His heroic service is \nremembered today by a grateful nation.\n  Service and leadership. These are the traits that best defined \nStephen Bixler--as a talented runner on his high school cross-country \nteam and as senior patrol leader in Boy Scout Troop 260. He was awarded \nthe rank of Eagle Scout after working hard to improve the Jesse F. \nSmith Memorial Forest. He decided early on in high school that he \nwanted to serve his country, and shortly after graduating in 2003 he \njoined the Marines.\n  Stephen returned home during the holidays last year and took the time \nto speak to students at his former high school about his experiences \noverseas and his pride in serving his country.

Mr. Presidemt, I have sought recognition to cosponsor \nand speak in support of legislation introduced by Senator Santorum \ncalled the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act. \nThis bill would authorize research into deriving stem cells using \nalternative methods that would not result in the destruction of a human \nembryo.\n  This legislation, which Senator Santorum and I have drafted in close \npartnership, represents a good faith effort to find common ground among \nthose who support human embryonic stem cell research and those who do \nnot. This bill is fully complementary to legislation that Senators \nHarkin, Hatch, Feinstein, Smith, and Kennedy have introduced--the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act of 2005--which would allow Federal \nfunding for research on additional human embryonic stem cell lines. It \nwill move forward research that could potentially eliminate the \nobjections that some have to embryonic stem cell research while \nachieving the same goals. However, let me be clear, this legislation is \nnot a substitute for supporting H.R. 810, the House-passed version of \nthe Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005.\n  I believe medical research should be pursued with all possible haste \nto cure the diseases and maladies affecting Americans. In my capacity \nas Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have backed up this belief by supporting \nincreases in funding for the National Institutes of Health. I have said \nmany times that the NIH is the crown jewel of the Federal Government--\nperhaps the only jewel of the Federal government. When I came to the \nSenate in 1981, NIH spending totaled $3.6 billion. In fiscal year 2006, \nNIH received a little over $29 billion to fund its pursuit of life-\nsaving research. The successes realized by this investment in NIH have \nspawned revolutionary advances in our knowledge and treatment for \ndiseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, \nmental illnesses, diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, ALS and many \nothers. It is clear to me that Congress's commitment to the NIH is \npaying off. This is the time to seize the scientific opportunities that \nlie before us, and to ensure that all avenues of research toward \ncures--including stem cell research--are open for investigation.\n  In 1998, I learned of the discovery of human embryonic stem cells. \nThese cells have the ability to become any type of cell in the human \nbody. Another way of saying this is that the cells are pluripotent. The \nconsequences of this unique property of stem cells are far-reaching and \nare key to their potential use in therapies. Scientists and doctors \nwith whom I spoke--and who have since testified before my \nAppropriations Subcommittee at 17 stem cell-related hearings--were \nexcited by this discovery. They believed that these cells could be used \nto replace damaged or malfunctioning cells in patients with a wide \nrange of diseases, This could lead to cures and treatments for maladies \nsuch as Juvenile Diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, \ncardiovascular diseases, and spinal cord injury.\n  Senator Harkin and I took the lead on making Federal funding \navailable for this promising research. On the issue of funding human \nembryonic stem cell research, I along with Senators Harkin, Hatch, \nFeinstein, Smith, and Kennedy are the Senate sponsors of the Stem Cell \nResearch Act of 2005, which we hope will soon be coming up for a vote \nin the Senate. That critical bill would enable Federal funding of stem \ncell research with new human embryonic stem cell lines.\n\n  Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos that would otherwise \nhave been discarded. During the course of in vitro fertilization--IVF--\ntherapies, sperm and several eggs are combined in a laboratory to \ncreate 4 to 16 embryos for a couple having difficulty becoming \npregnant. The embryos grow in an incubator for 5 to 7 days until they \ncontain approximately 100 cells. To maximize the chances of success, \nseveral embryos are implanted into the woman. The remaining embryos are \nfrozen for future use. If the woman becomes pregnant after the first \nimplantation, and does not want to have more pregnancies, the remaining \nembryos are in excess of clinical need and can be donated for research. \nEmbryonic stem cells are derived from these embryos--destroying the \nembryo in the process. This process raises concerns for some, including \nmy distinguished colleague Senator Santorum.\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\n  Although I disagree with the calculus that embryos should be \ndiscarded rather than used in research, I recognize and appreciate \nthese deeply felt objections. In fact, I took the lead on creating an \nembryo adoption awareness campaign in fiscal year 2002, and continue to \ninclude $2 million for that campaign in the HHS appropriation. If these \nembryos are likely to be donated to families that cannot conceive, I \nwant this to be the first choice. However, with 400,000 frozen embryos \nin IVF clinics around the country, the supply far exceeds the demand \nand embryos are being discarded. Nonetheless, I want to pursue this and \nother options to address the objections of some of my colleagues.\n  When the President's Council on Bioethics reported on several \ntheoretical methods for deriving stem cells without destroying embryos, \nI immediately scheduled a hearing to investigate these ideas. On July \n12, 2005, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee heard testimony from five \nwitnesses describing several theoretical techniques for deriving stem \ncells without destroying embryos. All five witnesses supported moving \nforward with the alternative methods without abandoning embryonic stem \ncell research. The alternative stem cells would theoretically also have \nthe key ability to become any type of cell. Let me briefly mention \nseveral of the techniques discussed at the hearing.\n  Dr. Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technologies claims to have derived \nstem cells from a single cell extracted from 2-day-old, eight-celled \nmouse embryos. This single cell is called a blastomere and its removal \nfrom human embryos does not destroy the original embryo. Scientists \nknow a single cell can be taken from a 2-day-old embryo without \ndestroying it, because it is routinely done in pre-implantation genetic \ndiagnosis.\n  Dr. William Hurlbut, a Stanford University bioethicist, supports a \ntechnique where a cloned embryo would be created whose DNA is mutated \nsuch that it cannot develop into a baby. This altered embryo would be \ndestroyed for its stem cells. Since the embryo never had the potential \nto produce a baby, some of the objections normally raised with \nembryonic stem cell research would be circumvented.\n  Several scientists have suggested deriving stem cells from \ntechnically dead embryos. When embryos frozen during in-vitro \nfertilization are thawed, some never resume dividing and thus are \ndiscarded.\n  Many scientists are attempting to turn back the clock on older cells \nso they again become ``pluripotent,'' the scientific term for the \nability to turn into any tissue. Scientists already are trying to do \nthis to some degree through ``adult stem cell'' research, such as \nturning blood-making cells into cells that produce liver or muscle \ntissues.\n  The legislation, which Senator Santorum and I have drafted, is meant \nto encourage these alternative methods for deriving stem cells without \nharming human embryos. The act amends the Public Health Service Act by \ninserting a section that:\n  (1) Mandates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nsupport meritorious peer-reviewed research to develop techniques for \nthe derivation of stem cells without creating or destroying human \nembryos.\n  (2) Requires the Secretary to issue guidelines within 90 days to \nimplement this research and to identify and prioritize the next \nresearch steps.\n  (3) Requires the Secretary to consider techniques outlined by the \nPresident's Council on Bioethics, such as altered nuclear transfer and \nsingle cell derivation.\n  (4) Requires the Secretary to report yearly on the activities carried \nout under this authorization.\n  (5) Includes a ``Rule of Construction'' stating: ``Nothing in this \nsection shall be construed to affect any policy, guideline, or \nregulation regarding embryonic stem cell research, human cloning by \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer, or any other research not specifically \nauthorized by this section.''\n  (6) Defines ``human embryo'' by reference to the latest definition \ncontained in the appropriations act for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  (7) Authorizes ``such sums as may be necessary'' for fiscal years \n2007 through 2009.\n  Knowing that scientists never know exactly which research will lead \nto the next great cure, I have always supported opening as many avenues \nof research as possible. Based on that line of reasoning, I have always \nsupported human embryonic, adult, and cord blood stem cell research. My \ngoal is to see cures for the various afflictions that lower the quality \nof life--or end the lives--of Americans.\n  The Santorum/Specter bill focuses attention on one of those avenues \nof research. I must emphasize that this bill is not a substitute for \nsupport of human embryonic stem cell research or support for H.R. 810. \nThe two bills are complementary in their scope and together will \nadvance our understanding of biomedical science and bring us another \nstep closer to the cures and treatment that we all desire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4152-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MONTANA'S NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 1-163rd \ninfantry battalion of Montana's National Guard for their continued \ncontribution to our Nation. In peacetime, these soldiers have performed \nadmirably at home in Montana, but in wartime the members of the first \nof the l63rd infantry battalion truly deserve recognition.\n  For 18 months, they were deployed to Iraq where, on a daily basis, \nthey risked their lives to defend our Nation's core beliefs--freedom, \njustice, and equality. In November of 2005, 700 troops returned home to \nMontana.\n  While serving abroad, these men and women spent the majority of their \ntime at 3 forward operating bases in northern Iraq. They bravely \nundermined insurgency in the largest and most dangerous area in the \n116th Brigade's area of operations.\n  These Montanans risked their lives daily during their field \noperations. In total, the 1-163rd infantry battalion performed 6,400 \npatrols where they encountered frequent attacks. During their \ndeployment, the 1-163rd engaged in over 35 direct battles with members \nof the Iraqi insurgency and received small arms fire over 130 times. \nThe battalion also defused almost 200 improvised explosive devices, \nIEDs, and experienced 359 IED detonations.\n  In addition to the routine patrols that the unit regularly performed, \nthe battalion also conduced 35 task force level operations, 10 joint \ntask force air assault missions, and 120 deliberate company-level \noperations.\n  Despite the dangerous conditions, the 1-163rd infantry battalion \nstill made considerable advances in neutralizing their area of \noperations. The battalion was able to reduce the number of arms and \ninsurgents in the area. Hundreds of Iraqi weapon systems were \nconfiscated, including AK-47s, rocket propelled grenades and mortar \ntubes, and over 100 insurgents were detained. These efforts were \ncritical in minimizing the likelihood of future attacks in the area.\n  Not only did the 1-l63rd improve the overall safety of northern Iraq, \nbut this infantry battalion also participated in the extensive \nreconstruction effort. In total, 68 projects worth $7.5 million were \nsuccessfully implemented by the battalion. Countless improvements to \nmunicipalities in northern Iraq are directly attributable to the 1-\n163rd.\n  Today I wish to especially commend two members of the 1-163rd who did \nnot return home but instead gave their lives in service to this great \nNation. SGT Travis Arndt, 23, from Great Falls, MT, was killed in \naction near Kirkuk, Iraq, on September 21, 2005. MSG Robbie McNary, 42, \ndied in combat in Hawijah, Iraq, on March 31, 2005, leaving behind his \nwife and three children in Lewistown, MT. Let us remember them for \ntheir honorable service and ultimate sacrifice.\n  As a Montanan, an American, and a Senator, I would like to truly \nthank and commend the first of the 163rd infantry battalion of the \nMontana's National Guard for their excellent performance during this \nlast deployment and their impressive dedication and loyalty to this \nnation.\n  In November, when the 1-163rd returned to Montana from their 18-month \ndeployment, they were applauded for their success, but I would like to \nkeep that recognition alive. Long after this war on terror is over, we \nwill remember their contribution to our most valuable freedom and \nsecurity. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4153-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF NANCY IRISH\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to wish a happy \nbirthday to Nancy Irish of Stafford Springs, CT. Nancy will be \ncelebrating her 100th birthday on May 9. While the birthday itself is, \nof course, worthy of much celebration, those who know Nancy well--her \nfriends, relatives, coworkers and neighbors--would all tell you that \nNancy deserves the most congratulations for the life she has led over \nthe past 100 years.\n  Born May 9, 1906, to Italian immigrant parents, Nancy lived in New \nYork until she and her family moved to Massachusetts when she was a \nteenager. On July 12, 1924, she married Daniel Woods Irish, and \ntogether they moved to Connecticut. They had three children, Daniel, \nDarian, and Dolores. When her husband Daniel tragically passed away \nearly, Nancy worked very hard to provide for her family. Throughout her \nlife, she held a variety of jobs, including working in the Tobacco \nValley cigar industry and, at one time, running a taxi business and a \nrooming house. After years of hard work, Nancy retired to Florida for \nover 20 years before moving back to Connecticut. She is currently \nenjoying a well-deserved retirement and loves spending time with her \nfamily, including two surviving children, five grandchildren, nine \ngreat-grandchildren and a great-great-grandson.\n  Nancy Irish has lived a long, remarkable life and has touched many \npeople's lives. If you consider the strength, determination, and hard \nwork she has demonstrated throughout her life, can it really be any \nshock that she has lived such a long, fulfilling life? Happy birthday, \nNancy Irish. May your 100th year be your best yet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4153-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CELEBRATION OF NAVY WEEK\n\n Mr. OBAMA.

Many brave Illinois citizens have \nserved and continue to serve honorably in the U.S. Navy.\n  There are more than 350,000 active duty and more than 135,000 Ready \nReserve Navy personnel in the U.S. Navy, serving the Nation in support \nand defense of the values and freedom that all people in the United \nStates cherish.\n  This week, members of the Navy in Illinois will spend time serving \ntheir country and community in other ways. The Navy band will perform \nin city parks throughout Chicago, and Navy personnel will work at food \nbanks and travel to the Great Lakes Veterans Hospital to support those \nwho are a part of the great history of the U.S. Navy.\n  In addition, the Navy will participate in Habitat for Humanity, \nbuilding houses around Illinois, and they will work with the Chicago \nChristian Industrial League to help the homeless of Chicago and those \nsuffering from substance abuse.\n  Recognizing ``Navy Week'' will allow us to celebrate the strength and \nbravery displayed by members and veterans of the U.S. Navy and the role \nthey have played throughout our history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4153-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING JOHN FALES\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and \ncongratulate Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah for his leadership and dedication to \nraising awareness about disabilities around the world.\n  Emmanuel was born without a tibia in his right leg, leaving it \nuseless and severely deformed. This would have been an enormous \nobstacle for anyone in our society to overcome. But he was not born \nhere--he was born in Ghana, where historically the disabled were often \npoisoned or left to die. At the time, it was believed that a child was \nborn disabled due to a sin the mother had committed. Because of his \nson's deformed leg, Emmanuel's father abandoned his family, and his \nmother's friends encouraged her to kill or, at the very least, abandon \nher disabled son.\n  Instead, she chose to nurture and encourage him, making the radical \ndecision to send him to primary school, rather than sending him to the \nstreets as a beggar.\n  Unfortunately, his mother died when he was 13, and Emmanuel was \nforced to drop out of school. His only option for survival was to shine \nshoes for a living--earning the equivalent of only 2 dollars a day.\n  Despite his struggle, Emmanuel's story is a successful one. He \nrefused to resort to begging, and instead chose to focus the attention \nof his countrymen on the issue of discrimination of the disabled in \nGhana. His method: biking across Ghana--with one leg. The only problem \nwas that he didn't own a bicycle.\n  After seeking support from the Challenged Athlete Foundation in the \nUnited States in 2002, Emmanuel began his journey through Ghana, \ngarnering media attention with every mile. By the time he reached his \ndestination, Emmanuel was a national hero.\n  After 2003, when he competed in a triathlon, riding a 56-mile bike \nsegment as part of a relay team, he was given a whole new life. Doctors \nwere able to free him from his crutches by partially amputating his leg \nand applying a prosthetic one.\n  Emmanuel has since dedicated his life to improving the lives of \nGhana's many disabled citizens. In conjunction with the Free Wheelchair \nMission, Emmanuel has helped provide free wheelchairs to disabled \npeople around the world. He has started a cycling team, a wheelchair \nbasketball team, and a running team for physically challenged athletes, \nand is currently working on starting a sports academy for disabled \nathletes in Ghana.\n  Today, of the 20 million people living in Ghana, 2 million are \ndisabled. Thanks to the efforts of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, Ghanaians \nwith physical disabilities are living their lives with purpose, \ndignity, and value.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4153-5", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4153-6", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4153-S4154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\nStates submitting sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4154-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOTIFICATION OF THE CONTINUATION OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BLOCKING THE \nPROPERTY OF CERTAIN PERSONS AND PROHIBITING THE EXPORT OF CERTAIN GOODS \n                            TO SYRIA--PM 47\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs. \n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.

A bill to provide for additional outreach and education \nrelated to the Medicare program and to amend title XVIII of the Social \nSecurity Act to provide a special enrollment period for individuals who \nqualify for an income-related subsidy under the Medicare prescription \ndrug program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am proud to file the Medicare Part \nD Outreach and Enrollment Enhancement Act of 2006. This timely piece of \nlegislation addresses two very targeted administrative issues that have \ncome to light since Medicare's new prescription drug benefit became \neffective earlier this year. I am also pleased that Senator Bingaman is \njoining on this bill.\n  With more than 30 million beneficiaries now receiving coverage \nthrough Medicare Part D, the program is well on its way to helping \ndeliver much needed access to lower cost prescription drugs. And with \nthe close of the initial enrollment period on May 15 looming, the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and advocacy \norganizations across the country are working diligently to provide last \nminute assistance to those beneficiaries still wishing to enroll.\n  However, even after the May 15 deadline passes, beneficiaries will \nstill need counsel on the program's benefits, including the \navailability of the low-income subsidy. For instance, dual eligible \nbeneficiaries and those who previously received assistance through a \nMedicare Savings Program have the ability to change their prescription \ndrug plan monthly. This particularly vulnerable group of beneficiaries \nlikely will need extra assistance in choosing a plan that more \nappropriately meets their medical and financial needs.\n  There also are those beneficiaries who will age into Medicare \nthroughout the year. They will be provided an initial enrollment period \nto choose a prescription drug plan once they turn age 65. And with the \nfirst regular enrollment cycle beginning in November, many \nbeneficiaries will need advice as they evaluate new plan options or \nconsider switching plans if their existing coverage has changed. We owe \nit to our seniors to provide them quality information so they can make \nthe best possible prescription drug plan choice.\n  That is why I am asking for increased Part D outreach and education \nfunding in the bill I am filing today. State Health Insurance Programs \n(SHIPs), which provide a range of valuable services, help beneficiaries \nselect quality prescription drug plans, identify additional financial \nhelp with their drug costs, and resolve general enrollment \ndifficulties.\n  This year, CMS supported the outreach work of SHIPs with a $30 \nmillion allotment. Despite this funding, there still remains a great \nneed to raise further awareness about the new Part D benefit among \nbeneficiaries and provide them assistance with selecting an\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\nappropriate prescription drug plan. The Outreach and Enrollment \nEnhancement Act would allocate SHIPs an additional $13.5 million, \nbringing their total funding to $43.5 million, or, one dollar per \nMedicare beneficiary. To assure that the work of SHIPs is sufficiently \nsupported in future years, the bill also creates a new funding \nauthorization that is set to increase as the number of Medicare \nbeneficiaries grows.\n  The legislation I am filing today also provides funding to the Area \nAgencies on Aging (AAA) and Native American aging programs that have \nabsorbed an increased workload since the passage of the Medicare \nModernization Act. In Oregon, the Multnomah County AAA has incurred \n$30,000 in expenses related to Medicare outreach since the beginning of \nthis year, but they have received very little new funding in return. \nThe bill recognizes the important role AAAs and Native American aging \nprograms play in helping elderly Americans enroll in Medicare by \nproviding new funding in the amount of $6.3 million this fiscal year.\n  Apart from increased funding for outreach and education, the bill \naddresses a very targeted problem with the current enrollment process \nthat has recently become apparent. Beneficiaries who believe their \nincome and asset levels may qualify them for extra help with their \nprescription drug costs may apply for a low-income subsidy (LIS) at any \npoint during the year. If they submit an application to the Social \nSecurity Administration (SSA) during an initial enrollment period but \ndo not receive notification of their eligibility before the enrollment \ndeadline, they have one of two options available to them. They could \nenroll into a prescription drug plan before the deadline not knowing \nwhether they will have to pay all or part of the costs of the monthly \npremium. This could place a beneficiary in the awkward position if they \nchoose a plan that they ultimately are unable to afford.\n  Under a recent CMS administrative action, beneficiaries who have \napplied for the LIS subsidy could choose to delay their enrollment in \nthe program until they receive notification of their eligibility for a \nsubsidy. However, they still would be required to pay a late enrollment \npenalty. While enrolling late may allow a beneficiary to make a more \ninformed decision regarding their prescription drug plan, it would not \nbe fair to assess them a fee simply because there was administrative \ndelay in processing their LIS application. Both of these scenarios \nplace beneficiaries in an untenable position. For the enrollment \nprocess to be successful, beneficiaries need to have as much \ninformation available to them as possible so they may choose the \nprescription drug plan that best meets their preferences.\n  The Outreach and Enrollment Enhancement Act provides a solution to \nthis dilemma. The legislation creates a special 30-day enrollment \nperiod that begins on the day a beneficiary receives a decision \nregarding their LIS eligibility. Most importantly, the late enrollment \npenalty that would be imposed upon them under current law would be \nwaived during the special enrollment period, in addition to the time it \ntakes SSA to process their application. This small, yet significant, \nchange to the existing enrollment process will allow LIS beneficiaries \nsufficient time to effectively consider and evaluate prescription drug \nplan options with all necessary information. We cannot afford to \nundermine seniors' trust in Medicare's prescription drug program by \npenalizing a certain group of beneficiaries for a problem that is \ncreated by the federal government.\n  I understand that many of my colleagues prefer to address \nadministrative issues with Medicare Part D at a later date, so that the \ninitial implementation process can run its full course without undue \ninterference from Congress. While I would agree with that argument in \nprinciple, there are a number of existing problems that only serve to \ntarnish Medicare's image if we allow them to linger much longer. I \nbelieve providing additional resources for outreach and educational \nservices and correcting the LIS enrollment issue are two such problems \nthat Congress should address immediately--before the May 15 deadline \npasses.\n  The SSA has estimated that 80,000 beneficiaries might not have been \nnotified of their LIS eligibility by the close of the first regular \nenrollment period. It would be entirely unfair to assess even one of \nthese beneficiaries a late enrollment penalty, when by their \nunderstanding, they were playing by the rules CMS and SSA set forth \nregarding the low-income subsidy.\n  I ask the Majority Leader and my colleagues to support my call for \nthe Outreach and Enrollment Enhancement Act to be treated as an \nemergency measure and provide it quick passage in the Senate. By taking \nup this very targeted measure, Congress can demonstrate to America's \nseniors that we are committed to the continued success of the Medicare \nprescription drug program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 2760. A bill to suspend the duty on imports of ethanol, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kyl and \nSununu to introduce a bill to strike the ethanol import tariff.\n  With record high gas prices and demand for ethanol growing faster \nthan expected, I believe we need to act now to ease the ethanol supply \ncrunch.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been strongly opposed to the \nethanol mandate that was included in the energy bill enacted last \nAugust.\n  Today, more than ever, I believe that the time has come to end \nunwarranted subsidies to ethanol producers.\n  They include: $4.5 billion in agricultural subsidies in 2004 alone \nthat benefit corn farmers (Environmental Working Group); a 51 cent per \ngallon tax credit for ethanol producers; and a 7.5 billion gallon \nethanol mandate that was included in the energy bill.\n  The current 51 cent per gallon subsidy is costing American taxpayers \n$2 billion per year, and will cost even more after 2012--almost $4 \nbillion per year--when the use of ethanol is mandated to nearly double.\n  Now that the ethanol mandate is law, it is time for the subsidies to \ncease.\n  I believe we need to start by striking the 54 cent per gallon ethanol \nimport tariff.\n  Ethanol imports are extremely limited, even though production costs \nfor ethanol in foreign countries are significantly lower than in the \nUnited States.\n  For example, according to the Congressional Research Service, \nBrazilian productions costs are 40 to 50 percent lower than in the \nUnited States. Yet the tariff raises the cost of ethanol enough to pose \na significant barrier to imports.\n  It is egregious to put such a high tariff on ethanol importation. It \nmakes it impossible for U.S. consumers to purchase the lowest-cost \nethanol.\n  And with the refineries choosing to phase-out MTBE this year, the \ndemand for ethanol is even greater than was expected.\n  It is not clear if the domestic supply will be able to meet that \ngrowing demand.\n  Any ethanol supply disruption will hurt drivers on the east and west \ncoasts the most.\n  Right now, ethanol is produced in the Midwest and must be trucked or \nrailed to the coasts. According to news reports, ethanol delivery from \nthe Midwest is currently being hindered by strong demand for limited \nrail time and a shortage of trucks and drivers.\n  If we strike the tariff, refineries can have more economic and \nefficient access to ethanol.\n  So, it's time to eliminate this 54 cent tariff and give consumers a \nbreak at the pump.\n  And we are not alone in this effort. Just last week, the President \nasked that Congress consider eliminating the tariff.\n  If they are going to be forced to use ethanol, our refineries should \nhave the ability to buy it from the cheapest seller. They should not be \nconstrained by artificial protectionist tariffs.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me to strike this tariff.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2762. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure \nappropriate payment for the cost of long-term care provided to veterans \nin State homes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today to protect \nthe state home program and expand the\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\nability of states and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to care \nfor veterans. I truly believe that the state home program is an \nincredibly valuable asset as we grapple with how best to care for our \naging veterans. The program has proven time and time again that it is \ncost effective.\n  VA involvement in the state home program dates back to 1888 when \nCongress first authorized Federal grants-in-aid for veterans in State \nhomes. Today, there are 119 State-operated Veterans' Homes in 47 States \nand the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. State homes provide nursing home \ncare in 114 of these homes and domiciliary care in 52 of these \nlocations.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the State home program is supported in \ntwo ways by VA--construction grants and per diem payments. Subject to \navailable funding, VA provides construction matching-grant funding for \nup to 65 percent of the cost of constructing or rehabilitating homes, \nwith at least 35 percent covered by State funding commitments.\n  The per diem portion of the program provides current reimbursement to \nState homes--currently $63.40 for a day of nursing home care. This \namount equates to less than 30 percent of the total cost to provide \nthis care. Yet, VA is currently authorized to provide up to 50 percent \nof States' costs.\n  In January of this year, Chairman Craig and I held field hearings in \nmy State of Hawaii. The hearing on the island of Kauai focused \nexclusively on long-term care in rural settings. We heard from two \nwitnesses who spoke about the benefits of the State home program and \nways to improve upon it, so as to specifically care for rural veterans.\n  Tom Driskill, the President and CEO of Hawaii Health Systems \nCorporation, testified about the soon-to-be-built State home in Hilo. \nHe said, ``The synergy of a combined Federal and State funding of the \nhome has been the catalyst for making this dream a reality.'' The Hilo \nhome will be Hawaii's first State home and will house 95 beds and will \nserve veterans throughout the State.\n  The Committee also heard testimony about an innovative approach to \nfill significant gaps in long-term care services to veterans due to the \nnature and geography of certain States. Bob Shaw, the National \nLegislative Chairman for the National Association of State Veterans' \nHomes, testified that large State homes are not appropriate for the \nmore remote locations in Hawaii. Instead, he argued, we should look to \nhow Alaska has managed the challenge.\n  Rather than building large new homes, the State of Alaska is using \nits own Pioneer Homes, which provide nursing care to older Alaskans, in \norder to care for veterans. Similarly, Hawaii could use existing beds \nin the community and deem such beds as part of the State home program. \nDoing so would trigger per diem payments from VA to help defray the \ncost of nursing home care.\n  Accordingly, my legislation would authorize VA to provide \nconstruction grants and per diem payments for small long-term care \nunits, approximately 10 to 30 beds, in pre-existing health care \nfacilities. Such units would address gaps in long-term care services \nfor veterans living in remote and rural regions including Alaska, \nWyoming, Idaho, Montana, Kansas and other large, rural States.\n  I am quite proud of the changes we made to VA long-term care as part \nof the Millennium Act, which provides nursing home care to veterans who \nare 70 percent or more service-connected. I think we can expand the \nlocations where such mandatory nursing home care is available. \nCurrently, there is no mechanism in current law to permit VA to pay \nState homes for care provided to service-connected veterans. My \nlegislation would authorize VA to place severely disabled service-\nconnected veterans directly in State homes and would require VA to \nreimburse State homes for the cost of such care.\n  The legislation would also authorize severely disabled, service-\nconnected veterans in State homes to receive VA's comprehensive \nmedication benefit. Currently, such veterans are eligible to receive \nVA's full medication benefit if they are residing in community nursing \nhomes but not if they reside in State homes. We need to ensure \nequitable coverage of medication needs.\n  Finally, this legislation mandates consultation and reporting \nrequirements for VA prior to implementation of proposed changes to the \ncurrent per diem system. Such requirements should include, at a \nminimum, consultations with Congress, State governments, and State \nhomes. In addition, VA should be required to report to Congress how any \nsuch proposed changes would affect the long-term viability of the State \nhome program before any such changes take effect. As part of the FY 06 \nbudget, the Administration proposed dramatic restrictions to current \nper diem payments so as to only include a small portion of the veterans \ncurrently in State homes. Such a proposal, if enacted, would have \ndevastated care in the homes.\n  Mr. President, we can give States and VA more tools to deal with \nburgeoning long-term care needs of veterans.

Res. 469\n\n       Whereas the 47-year communist dictatorship of Fidel Castro \n     in Cuba received the lowest rating from Freedom House in its \n     ``Freedom in the World 2005'' report for political rights and \n     civil liberties, and is categorized by that organization as \n     ``repressive'' and having ``virtually no freedom'';\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch describes Cuba in its ``World \n     Report 2006'' as ``an undemocratic government that represses \n     nearly all forms of political dissent'';\n       Whereas human rights observers have documented that the \n     regime in Cuba attempts to intimidate human rights dissidents \n     and their families through ``acts of repudiation,'' \n     consisting of mobs of regime supporters screaming threats and \n     insults;\n       Whereas, on April 25, 2006, an act of repudiation against \n     Martha Beatriz Roque became violent when she was punched, \n     knocked down, and dragged outside her home in Havana while \n     she was leaving to attend a meeting with Michael E. Parmly, \n     the Chief of Mission-Designate for the United States \n     Interests Section in Havana, Cuba;\n       Whereas Martha Beatriz Roque is a citizen of Cuba and \n     leader of the Assembly to Promote Civil Society in Cuba, a \n     coalition of 365 independent civil society groups within \n     Cuba;\n       Whereas, in March 2003, the regime of Fidel Castro \n     imprisoned dozens of Cuban dissidents including Martha \n     Beatriz Roque for their activities supporting freedom and \n     democracy; and\n       Whereas Martha Beatriz Roque was released in 2005 for \n     health reasons without a pardon or a commutation of her \n     sentence: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the brutality of the regime of Fidel Castro \n     toward Martha Beatriz Roque, a 61-year-old woman in frail \n     health;\n       (2) demands the regime of Cuba allow the people of Cuba to \n     exercise their fundamental human rights, rather than \n     responding to calls for freedom with imprisonment and \n     intimidation;\n       (3) commends the courage and perseverance of Martha Beatriz \n     Roque and all dissidents in Cuba;\n       (4) calls on the regime of Cuba to release the hundreds of \n     political prisoners still held today and to stop the \n     intimidation of dissidents and their families; and\n       (5) calls for continued international support and \n     solidarity with pro-democracy leaders in Cuba.\n\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4161-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4161]]\nSENATE RESOLUTION 470--PROMOTING A COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL AGREEMENT IN \n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KERRY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Conversely, I believe the U.S. \nwould benefit if its citizens knew the languages and cultures of other \nnations. We must develop long-term relationships with people throughout \nthe world and learn to speak other languages, whether or not the \nlanguages spoken are considered critical for a particular situation or \nemergency. As 9/11 showed us, the failures of communication can do \nswift damage.\n  S.

It further states that despite the \nlinguistic and historic cultural diversity of the nation we are all \nAmericans and our common language is English. However, even though \nEnglish is our common language, the State Department offers \ntranslations of the National Anthem, the U.S. Constitution, the Pledge \nof Allegiance, and other U.S. documents in French, Arabic, and other \nforeign languages on its Web site to help people better understand \nAmerica. Nor did President Bush refrain from singing the National \nAnthem in Spanish when he was running for office in 2000 or prevent pop \nstar Jon Secada from singing our anthem in both English and Spanish \nwhen entertaining the President in 2001.\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\n  The resolution offered by my colleagues states that the original \nnational motto of the United States, E Pluribus Unum--from many, one--\nis incorporated into the Great Seal of the United States, is printed on \nU.S. currency, and inscribed on the wall of the Senate Chamber. The \nsponsors of this resolution use these examples to argue that from many \nlanguages and backgrounds we have one language--English. However, our \nNation's motto is written in Latin--not English.\n  The translation of key statements of national unity, such as the \nPledge of Allegiance and the National Anthem, affords immigrants who \nhave not fully learned the English language and individuals from all \nacross the world the opportunity to better understand these symbols of \nAmerica and the ideals of freedom that they represent. Such \ntranslations help those outside the U.S. to better understand our \nculture and our beliefs.\n  Last June, the Pew Global Attitudes Project released a report on \nAmerica's image. Survey results from the citizens of 16 nations found \nthat only six nations, one of which is the U.S., have a 50 percent or \nmore favorable view of the United States. We cannot win the hearts and \nminds of people of other nations and promote American ideals if we \nclose the door on people expressing their support for our country and \nthe freedoms on which it was founded.\n  Our Constitution grants us the freedom of speech. This resolution, by \nlimiting the language in which we can recite the Pledge of Allegiance \nor sing the National Anthem, violates the spirit of the Constitution \nand is antithetical to the very freedoms and beliefs that these \nstatements of national unity represent.\n  To limit the ability of non-English speakers to know about the United \nStates and, in turn, show their support for the U.S., would be a \ndisservice to the country. Since this resolution is non-binding I will \nnot object to it being acted upon by the Senate. However, I do not \nsupport the resolution.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 458) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 458\n\n       Whereas Francis Scott Key wrote the words of the Star-\n     Spangled Banner in English in 1814, inspired by the sight of \n     the American flag still waving at Fort McHenry after 25 hours \n     of continual bombardment by British forces;\n       Whereas Congress declared the Star-Spangled Banner the \n     National Anthem of the United States in 1931 (section 301 of \n     title 3, United States Code);\n       Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United \n     States, written in English, was first specified in law by \n     Congress in 1942 (section 4 of title 4, United States Code);\n       Whereas the Oath of Allegiance, to which lawful permanent \n     residents swear upon becoming citizens of the United States \n     (as required under section 337 of the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 1448)), is based, in part, on \n     language originally written in English by General George \n     Washington and sworn by him and his general officers at \n     Valley Forge in 1778;\n       Whereas the vast majority of Americans are immigrants or \n     the descendants of immigrants, proud of their ancestral \n     country, but prouder still to be American;\n       Whereas millions of Americans speak or study additional \n     languages, but English is their common language;\n       Whereas the original national motto of the United States, \n     ``E Pluribus Unum'', meaning ``from many, one'', signifies \n     the coming together of people from many foreign countries to \n     form one Nation, was incorporated into the Great Seal of the \n     United States in 1776, is printed on currency of the United \n     States, and inscribed on the wall of the Senate chamber;\n       Whereas the people of the United States are united not by \n     race, ancestry, or origin, but by a common language, English, \n     and by common belief in the principles prescribed in the \n     founding documents of the Nation, especially the Declaration \n     of Independence and the Constitution; and\n       Whereas, to become citizens of the United States, under \n     sections 312 and 337 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1423 and 1448), lawful permanent residents of the \n     United States who have immigrated from foreign countries \n     must, among other requirements, renounce allegiance to the \n     government of their country of origin, swear allegiance to \n     the laws and Constitution of the United States, and \n     demonstrate an understanding of the English language: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate affirms that statements or songs \n     that symbolize the unity of the Nation, including the \n     National Anthem, the Oath of Allegiance sworn by new United \n     States citizens, and the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of \n     the United States, should be recited or sung in English, the \n     common language of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/08/senate-section/article/S4162-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AUTHORIZING CORRECTION OF THE ENGROSSMENT OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO \n                               H.R. 4939\n\n  Mr. ENZI.
