Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished majority whip, the assistant leader. I acknowledge we \nhave a lot of work to do during this work period. I hope we can \naccomplish a great deal. We had a great couple of weeks right before we \nleft. I hope the week off, the Fourth of July, was good for everyone. I \nknow it was for me to get away from Washington and breathe some of that \ngood desert air.\n  Sandra Day O'Connor retired just over a week ago. As the first woman \nto serve as a Supreme Court Justice, she blazed a trail which I hope \nmany will follow. She decided cases the old-fashioned way, based on \nlaw, not politics.\n  As a westerner, she brought to the Court a love of the land and an \nappreciation for individual rights. I salute the people of Arizona for \ngiving us such a dedicated public servant, someone who served in the \nState of Arizona as a State legislator, a member of an intermediate \ncourt of appeals and, of course, an inspiring career as a Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  Now we have begun the process of finding her replacement. The \nConstitution gives the President and the Senate shared responsibility \nto fill this vacancy because a President may only act with the advice \nand consent of the Senate. I appreciate very much President Bush \nbeginning this process of consultation the way he has. I will always be \ngrateful for the private meeting he and I had prior to her retiring and \nthe phone call he placed to me the day of her retirement.\n\n  It speaks volumes that his chief of staff, Andy Card, was calling \nvarious members of the Senate from Scotland. Harriet Myers called \nvarious members of the Senate. That is important. I appreciate it very \nmuch. In the days and weeks ahead, it is important that meaningful \nconsultation continues. Together we can find someone who will bring the \ncountry together.\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\n  The President has asked the majority leader, the ranking member and \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee meet with him early tomorrow \nmorning. I look forward to that meeting.\n  This is what President Reagan did when he appointed Sandra Day \nO'Connor: He brought the country together. Both parties cheered her \nnomination. That can happen again if President Bush nominates us a \nJustice we can all be proud of, a mainstream Justice committed to \nprotecting the rights of all Americans. There are large numbers of \nconservative jurists and lawyers who fit that description perfectly.\n  Events in London last Thursday reminded us that the freedoms and \nrights Supreme Court Justices protect are a threat to those with a very \ndifferent view of the world. My heart and my prayers go out to the \nvictims of the London attacks and the people of Great Britain. The \nbombings were the acts of cowards. We must redouble our effort to track \ndown the murderous thugs who committed those terrible acts. We must \ncontinue our effort to track down the murderous thugs who would do us \nharm.\n  I have great affection and admiration for the people of Great \nBritain. Their proud tradition of resiliency and determination was on \ndisplay last week in the face of this latest attack on their people and \nthe great city of London.\n  Unfortunately, the British people have considerable experience with \nattacks of terrorists on their homeland, including repeated terrorist \nattacks from supporters of the Irish Republican Army. There are \nimportant lessons that can be drawn from the British response to these \nattacks. First, Britain remains determined not to change its way of \nlife and its principles while at the same time vigorously pursuing \nthose responsible for the criminal acts.\n  It is important to note the people of Great Britain care about the \nIrish people, just as we do. I have been to that wonderful emerald \nisle. I love the country. I love the island. The fact that a few people \nperpetrated those acts of violence does not take away from our \nadmiration for those people.\n  The same applies in Britain with the acts of Islamic terrorists. That \ndoes not take away from the fact that the people who follow the Islamic \nreligion are good people who follow a very important, good religion. \nThe morality code of that religion is significantly important. They are \ngood people. I have gotten so close to them.\n  My wife's two physicians, a surgeon and an internist, are Pakistanis. \nThey are among our closest friends. We visit each other's homes often. \nWe celebrate different holidays together. We exchange presents. They \nare wonderful people. These are two devoutly religious men whose \nreligion we have learned to respect greatly. The people of Great \nBritain understand that. They did not sever relations with an entire \npeople because of the actions of a very few who are part of that \npeople.\n  There was great concern in the wake of these attacks about a backlash \nagainst the Arab community. What we saw was just the opposite: a couple \nof broken windows by a few troublemakers, but basically nothing. The \npeople of Great Britain have come together, all people have come \ntogether, all walks of life, all religions. That is an example for us. \nI am hopeful Great Britain and we in the United States will continue to \nheed both of these lessons in the wake of last week's bombings.\n  As the distinguished assistant leader mentioned, there is a third \nlesson we can draw from the London attacks and it is relevant to \nmatters in the Senate. I say what my distinguished colleague mentioned, \nthe senior Senator from Kentucky. We are going to take up the Homeland \nSecurity bill. The lesson we need to learn is simple: Fighting \nterrorism overseas is not enough to ensure that terrorists will not \nstrike where we live. Today the Senate begins consideration of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. That will occur in less than an \nhour. We spend more in Iraq in a single month than we spend on first \nresponders all year. Failure in Iraq is not an option, and we will \ncontinue to support our troops, but we must do more to support the war \non terror here at home.\n  The minority, the Democrats, are committed to doing everything \npossible to defeat terrorism abroad. We have repeatedly argued that we \nneed to be equally vigorous in our efforts to protect the American \npeople from terrorist attacks at home. Unfortunately, the \nadministration has never grasped this reality. We have offered \namendment after amendment and they have been defeated on party line \nvotes.\n  We supported establishment of the Homeland Security Department before \nSeptember 11. And as we recall, this administration opposed the \nestablishment of this agency even after September 11. Once the \nadministration relented and a homeland security agency was established, \nDemocrats repeatedly sought to ensure that this agency received the \nresources it needed to make Americans and America more secure.\n  Democrats sought to beef up our security on rail and transit systems, \nour chemical plants, our nuclear power generating facilities, and this \nadministration and the Republican Senators in this Senate said no.\n  Democrats sought to increase security on chemical and nuclear \nfacilities, as I have indicated, and other critical infrastructure. It \nwas ``no'' again. Democrats attempted to improve security at this \nNation's ports and the Bush administration, Republicans, said no. \nFinally, we sought to ensure that this Nation's first responders obtain \nthe resources they need to deter terrorists from attacking, and again \nRepublicans said no.\n  The bill before the Senate presents another opportunity for all \nMembers. We will have amendments to address each of these areas this \nweek. I am hopeful, with everything we know, the majority will at long \nlast agree with Democrats that we should be doing much more to protect \nthe Nation from terrorist attacks at home.\n\n\n                                Veterans\n\n  Let me close with a few words about our Nation's veterans. After \nmonths of denial--in fact, more than a year--that a problem even \nexisted, Senate Republicans late last month agreed with Democrats--\nreluctantly--that our veterans were not getting the care and resources \nthey earned and deserved. Remember, we brought this up before committee \non at least two occasions, as well as on the Senate floor, and every \ntime it was voted down by a strict party line vote and we did not get \nthe veterans what they wanted.\n  With great fanfare, Senate Republicans announced they were wrong for \nopposing Democratic efforts to provide additional efforts to the \nveterans health care system and would not support providing an \nadditional $1.5 billion.\n  We appeared to be on the road to getting something done for our \nveterans. Unfortunately, rather than quickly passing the Senate figure \nand ensuring our veterans immediately got the resources they need, \nHouse Republicans decided to play games and give our veterans \nsignificantly less in the process, more than half a billion.\n  Even worse than what the Republicans in the House did, rather than \nstanding up for a vote they had cast a day or so earlier, Senate \nRepublicans blinked and backtracked. Senate Republicans objected to a \nunanimous consent request to make the House-passed bill consistent with \nthe level they had supported just a few hours earlier.\n  Our first amendment, then, on this bill will be to give the Senate \nmajority another opportunity to show our veterans and the American \npublic where they stand. We will offer an amendment to give the \nveterans an additional $1.5 billion. Probably that is not enough \nbecause from some of the statistics we hear it is now closer to $2 \nbillion. But what if we are wrong? What if we are giving the veterans a \nlittle more? Is there anything wrong with that? I do not think we are \ngiving them a little more. We are giving them less. But would there be \nanything wrong with that? I hope the resounding answer is no.\n  So I hope that the majority will join us in supporting this \namendment. And, just as importantly, let's not play politics with \nAmerica's veterans.\n  I again thank my friend, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, for \nallowing me to speak now because he did have the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/11/senate-section/article/S7946-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7946-S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                        LONDON TERRORIST ATTACKS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to express my condolences\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\nto the victims and their families after last Thursday's depraved and \nsavage terrorist attacks in London. I also rise to pledge my, and I am \nsure the entire U.S. Senate's, steadfast support for the people of \nLondon and the United Kingdom as they stand resolute--as they always \nhave--in the face of terror.\n  On July 7 of last week, bombs exploded in three subway trains of the \nLondon Underground. A fourth ripped open a city bus. At least 52 are \ndead, and hundreds are wounded.\n  Just as a personal note, I have a daughter living in the London area. \nJust a month ago, I put her on the subway right near where one of the \nbombs went off. So I was among the many Americans who were frantically \ninterested in getting word on our own relatives after the attacks, \nwhich is another indication of just how closely tied the United States \nand the United Kingdom are.\n  These killers, whoever they are, have an utter disregard for human \nlife. They indiscriminately kill innocent people. The explosions were \ntimed to go off during the morning rush hour, to kill the maximum \nnumber of people.\n  But we should not be surprised by the barbarity of July 7. We have \nseen it before. On September 11, 2001, the same impulse of evil that \ntouched London stretched over the ocean to the United States and \nmurdered 3,000 of our own.\n  Ever since the terrorist attacks of September 11, America has waged a \nglobal war on terror. We resolved that day to pursue the terrorists and \nbring them to justice before they could strike American soil again. \nThis latest attack has changed nothing. We are still defiant in the \nface of terror. We are still committed to following terror wherever it \nmay hide, wresting it out from the swamps and shadows where it takes \nharbor, and destroying it.\n  The United Kingdom has been a strong and steadfast ally throughout \nthe war on terror. Her resolve is only strengthened by this latest \nattack. Our British cousins will fight the terrorists with the same \nheroic mettle their forefathers used to face down Hitler during World \nWar II. Sixty years ago, Americans tuned their radios to hear of \nBritish courage during the German bombing of London. Today, we see that \nsame British courage on television. Many Londoners returned to ride the \nUnderground and buses the very next day, unbowed by the terrorists.\n  Prime Minister Tony Blair has led his country magnificently in the \nwar on terror. He follows in the footsteps of previous Prime Ministers \nwho have steeled their nation's spine in times of challenge: Margaret \nThatcher and Winston Churchill. I have no doubt Prime Minister Blair \nwill respond to these attacks with the same courage and resolve as his \npredecessors, and he obviously has all of our full and unqualified \nsupport.\n  America and Great Britain united will never yield to the terrorists. \nWe will defeat them, and at the same time, we will spread justice and \nliberty to combat their call to oppression and death. Our cause, which \nspeaks to the noblest parts of the human soul, will win, just as it has \nthroughout our shared and glorious history.\n  May God bless America and the United Kingdom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/11/senate-section/article/S7947-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ALLY MILDER\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, just 2 weeks ago a former staffer and \nlongtime friend, Ally Milder, and a business associate of hers came to \nspend the weekend at the Grassley farm in New Hartford, IA. I tried to \nget Ally to step out of her fancy shoes for a couple of days and learn \na little about farming. I never did persuade her to feed pigs, but we \nhad a lot of laughs.\n  Today I stand before the Senate with great sadness because Ally \nMilder--my former chief counsel and a good friend to Barbara and me--\ndied suddenly last Thursday at the age of 50. Ally is gone suddenly and \ntoo young. I extend my deep sympathy to her mother Frances and sisters \nJulie and Kelly, and pay tribute to Ally Milder with much regard.\n  I met Ally in 1981. She was one of my first counsels on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I was a freshman Senator. She was fresh out of law \nschool and stayed on my staff until 1987, becoming chief counsel during \nthat time. Ally and I shared a great interest in religious freedom. Her \nleadership helped me to be very active in Soviet Jewry issues as a \nSenator, including a 1983 trip to the Soviet Union where we met with \nRussian Jews, the refuseniks, in Moscow. Ally was instrumental in \nforming the InterParliamentary Group for Human Rights in the Soviet \nUnion, an important weapon in the fight against abuses and for freedom \nfor Soviet Jews. Her tremendous enthusiasm and commitment to this \nimportant cause was also proved when she staffed passage of legislation \nto change the address of the Soviet Embassy in Washington to One \nSakharov Plaza. We had to fight the State Department and all kinds of \nother powerful interests to prevail and provide a daily reminder that \nAmerica would not overlook the plight of dissidents. Ally personally \nmade a difference in the course of history with her work in this area \nof human rights.\n  Ally worked on many issues during those years, including the \nnomination of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court and \nextension of the Voting Rights Act. Under her leadership of my \nJudiciary staff, the False Claims Act was passed and signed into law. \nThis landmark legislation updated a Civil War-era law to empower \nindividual citizen-whistleblowers to fight fraud against the taxpayers. \nIn the nearly two decades this law has been on the books, it has \nreturned more than $12 billion to the U.S. Treasury that would \notherwise have been lost to fraud. In addition, Ally oversaw renewal of \nChapter 12 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, which was a lifeline for \nfamily farmers needing to reorganize debt and stay in farming during \nthe terrible farm crisis of the 1980s.\n  Whatever she was working on, Ally brought energy, a let's-make-it-\nhappen attitude, and characteristic good nature to the task. Her skill \nand style made her a respected and well-liked colleague on the staff.\n  Ally left Washington to return home and run for Congress herself, \nmaking two good attempts for the Second District seat in Nebraska. I \ncampaigned with her several times. She was tireless about reaching the \nvoters, and we spent one of those days going to all the small towns and \nrural areas in the district. From what I know about Ally Milder, both \nbefore and after she ran for the House of Representatives, I am \nconvinced she would have made a very good Congresswoman. Ally went on \nto serve on the State board of education starting in 1992, and launched \na successful consulting and lobbying practice.\n  Ally always kept in close touch, and she loved politics. I appreciate \nthe support she gave me. She was generous and shared her commitment to \nmaking things better in a lot of ways, including mentoring economically \ndisadvantaged young people.\n  It is hard to believe that Ally won't be walking around the corner \nsomewhere, sometime next week, with her big smile and warm embrace. \nKnowing Ally, she might want us to take comfort today in an old Jewish \nsaying that ``the only truly dead are those who have been forgotten.'' \nThere is no doubt that Ally Milder will be remembered. She was full of \nlife, bright, hardworking, and someone focused on the good things in \nlife and making life good for those around her. She will be greatly \nmissed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nAppropriations Committee staff members and interns be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the consideration of the fiscal year 2006 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill and any votes that may occur in \nrelation thereto: Shannon O'Keefe, Carol Cribbs, Kimberly Nelson, James \nHayes, Avery Forbes, Carolina Poarch, Pete Flynn, Jonathan Cahoon, and \nWill Post.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the committee substitute is agreed to and \nconsidered as original text for the purpose of amendment.\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, was agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we turn now to the Homeland Security bill. \nThis is obviously a timely period for taking up this legislation in \nlight of what has happened in London. We recognize, once again, as a \nresult of the heinous crimes that were committed in London that there \nare people out there who totally disregard innocent life and who are \nwilling to kill innocent individuals simply for the purpose of making a \npolitical statement as to what\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\ntheir cause is or what their presumed cause may be.\n  Of course, we were, unfortunately, focused on this fact by 9/11, but \nmaybe over the last 2 or 3 years the success of our Nation in resisting \nattacks has caused a touch of complacency in this area. However, London \nhas to clearly remind us that complacency cannot be tolerated when it \ncomes to fighting these people who call themselves Islamic \nfundamentalists and who are essentially killers, terrorists, murderers \nwithout any moral creed or cause, and whose actions are totally \nunjustified in any form of civilized society.\n  The Department of Homeland Security was set up in the post-9/11 world \nin order to try as a nation to get our arms around the issue of how we \ncan best protect us in the United States of America. It was set up in \nthe context of other agencies that have responsibility for other areas \nof protecting us relative to this war on terrorism.\n  Of course, we have our Defense Department which is, through its \nextraordinary men and women, pursuing the fight against terrorism in \nAfghanistan and in Iraq. We also have agencies, such as the Central \nIntelligence Agency, the FBI, and the Justice Department, that are \ncommitted to making sure they obtain the intelligence necessary to \nprotect us. But within this umbrella of agencies which are trying to \npursue this war on terrorism, there is included, of course, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The Department of Homeland Security was put together as an \namalgamation of different agencies. I think there were 22 initially \nthat were thrown together. Some of those agencies, when they were put \ninto the Department of Homeland Security, were already functioning \nextraordinarily well and had a track record of success. Some of the \nother agencies had a spotty track record. Regrettably, some of the \nagencies did not have a very good track record at all. But they were \nbrought together for the purposes of trying to involve a coordinated \neffort in the area of fighting terrorism.\n  I believe we have to recognize, as we pursue this fight on terrorism, \nthat the people we are fighting are driven by a philosophy which we as \na rational society, especially as a Western society, find hard to \nfathom. The concept that you would kill innocent civilians simply for \nthe purpose of making a point is something which we find repugnant and \nalmost incomprehensible. But that is the nature of the people we fight. \nWe have to understand their purpose is not necessarily to win a global \nwar in the sense it has historically been perceived, such as World War \nI or World War II, or even the Cold War. Their purpose essentially is \nto assert their culture in a way that destroys any culture which they \nperceive as alien to it, to assert their religion in a way in which \nthey perceive destroys any religion which they see as alien to it, or \nany group of states which they see as alien to it. They are willing to \npursue this with fanaticism which allows them to develop individuals \nand attitudes where people will strap bombs to themselves and attack us \nor where they attack innocent individuals, as they did in London. And \nthus, the threat is a threat of immense proportion, and it is a threat \nwhich we have to pursue in a different way than we have pursued other \nthreats that have confronted our Nation.\n  We all understand this, but executing it has become difficult. I \nbelieve we have not yet grasped as a nation how we execute in defending \nourselves from this type of threat. What we know is this, and our \napproach must be tempered by it: We know we can order the priority of \nthe threats as they reflect relative to us. We know, for example, if \nthese individuals get their hands on a weapon of mass destruction--\nchemical, biological or, God forbid, a nuclear-capable weapon--that \nthey will use that weapon. They will use it in a way which kills tens \nof thousands, essentially hundreds of thousands of innocent \nindividuals. So we know that is the No. 1 threat we must confront.\n  We know also that as a nation, because we are a democracy and because \nwe are an open nation and because we seek to participate in the world \nin an open and vibrant way, our borders are porous and that access into \nthis country is easy, and that represents, regrettably now, a threat to \nus.\n  We know also that because we are such an open society and because we \nare a society which is built around the concept of individual \nresponsibility and people being able to go out in the world and \nparticipate in activities, that we have innumerable areas of \ninfrastructure, areas of individual participation and activity which \nare open to attack, such as occurred in London. And that is an issue of \nthreat.\n\n  What we have attempted to do in this bill is take the resources we \nhave and focus them on a threat-based approach so that we basically \nfocus the most resources on the area where we see the greatest threat. \nThe way we structured this bill is that we are focusing most of the \nenergy of this bill, most of dollars in this bill, in two primary \nareas, as far as new dollars are concerned. We are still spending a lot \nof dollars in a lot of different places, but the new initiatives in \nthis bill are focused on trying to better get a handle on defending \nourselves from an attack by a weapon of mass destruction and, secondly, \nmaking our borders, which are inordinately porous, less porous and \nhaving better accountability as to who is coming into this country and \nwhat their purposes are.\n  We moved a fair amount of money in this bill to try to accomplish \nthose two basic philosophical goals of addressing those two items of \nthreat. That does not mean we underfunded anything in this bill that \nwas already on the board. But it does mean we tried to focus this bill \na little bit better.\n  Within this legislation there are a lot of different agencies. As I \nmentioned earlier, some of them are functioning extraordinarily well, \nsome are functioning in between, and some simply are not doing as good \na job as we hoped they could do. Regrettably, this agency, even though \nit has only been around for 2 years, has had over 486 reports written \nabout it by either the inspector general, the CRS, or the GAO. I \nbrought them with me because I think they are so staggering in their \nproportions it is worth looking at in physical proportions the number \nof reports. There are three piles. If we take one pile, which I \nprobably cannot pick up, and put it on top of another pile--it will all \nfall over, unfortunately--we end up with almost 3 feet 9 inches of \nreports about things not going that well at the Homeland Security \nDepartment. Each one of these reports is substantive. Each one of these \nreports is worth review and requires action. They reflect the fact that \nalmost 3 years after this Department was put together, the Department \nhas some very serious problems, and they need to be addressed.\n  I congratulate the new Secretary, Mr. Chertoff, for his approach to \ntrying to get a handle on some of these problems. He is going to report \nto us Wednesday or Thursday on what his second stage review is. He put \na lot of time into this, but I think his approach will probably be \nbased on the concept that we have to have, first, a policy-driven \napproach and, second, it has to be systemwide. Today, there is too much \nanecdotal reaction in the Department, there is too much haphazard \nreaction, there is too much reaction to the crisis of the day. I think \nhis approach is going to be to put in place a much more systematized \napproach. But that is not going to immediately resolve the problem. \nHopefully, it will begin the process of resolving the problems of this \nDepartment, which are many and acute.\n  This bill does put in place a large number of what, for lack of a \nbetter word, we in the Congress call fences, where we essentially say \nto the Department: Before you get this money, you have to show us you \nare going to do this effectively. It is not something I like to do. I \nam a legislator; I am not a manager. I used to be a manager. I used to \nbe a Governor of a State. That is a management position. But when we \nsee a department which has as many functions as this Department and it \nis not functioning correctly, regrettably, I do think it is the \nresponsibility of the Congress and especially the Appropriations \nCommittee, which has a unique oversight role, to step in and say before \nwe give you more money to do this, we want to make sure that money is \nnot going to be wasted, mismanaged, misplaced, or misappropriated, so \nwe are going to require you to do something else. So this bill has in \nit a lot of what I would call fences.\n  The purpose of the bill, as I mentioned, is to fund more aggressively \nthose areas which we see as threats.\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\nObviously, after London, many people are going to feel that a threat \nwhich needs to receive more attention is the question of how we handle \nmass transit. I could not agree more. There is no question but in light \nof the London attack--and we knew long before this with the Madrid \nattack and before that with the Israeli situation--this is a clear area \nwhere terrorists, who have no regard for human life, tend to focus \ntheir heinous activity. We know mass transit is an issue, but the \nquestion becomes how do we best protect mass transit.\n  We have put in this bill over the last few years literally tens of \nmillions, now hundreds of millions of dollars which is available for \nupgrading security, for upgrading electronic surveillance, for \nupgrading bomb dog activity, for upgrading the number of police \nofficers on mass transit. There is pending, in fact, within the Federal \nTreasury about $115 million to $150 million that has not been spent. \nThere has been so much money put into this so quickly, it simply has \nnot been spent, and it is still available.\n  On top of that, there is the $7 billion which we have put into first \nresponder money which, if States want to reallocate some of that toward \nmass transit protection, they can. That has not been spent. So there is \na lot of money sitting there for the purpose of helping mass transit.\n  If you talk with people who run mass transit, they say it is not \nenough. But as a practical matter, it has not been spent yet. So \nwhether it is enough is clearly irrelevant because until it gets spent, \nit is clearly enough.\n  Independent of that, however--the fact that there is still \nsignificant dollars in the stream of things--we have the issue of how \nto effectively defend mass transit. We all know mass transit is such a \nhuge enterprise where millions of people, on a daily basis--tens of \nmillions if you take all the transit systems in this country--are \nmoving in and out of different transit modes, whether it is trains, \nbuses, or ferries, and are moving in and out of these on a constantly \nchurning basis. The opportunities to attack this type of a system are \nalmost endless.\n  A professional terrorist--and clearly these people are professional. \nThey train for the purpose of killing people, using terrorist weapons. \nThe professional terrorist is always--almost always going to be able to \nfind, in a nation our size, with a transportation system of this size, \ngoing to be able to find a point of attack that is not secure unless--I \ndoubt that we could spend anywhere near enough money. We have enough \nmoney to spend to fully secure mass transit, and if we did we would \nprobably make mass transit nonfunctional.\n  Yes, we can raise the visibility by putting more officers on trains, \nmore bomb dogs and surveillance agents, and we should do that, but as a \npractical matter the way you protect your mass transit system is the \nsame way you protect your other infrastructure systems. It is through \naggressive and robust intelligence. You have to know who these people \nare before they attack you. That is the key to this exercise--robust \nintelligence capability. And there is some irony because to accomplish \nrobust intelligence capability you have to go where the people come \nfrom. Where do they come from? They come from the Middle East. We are \nfighting them in the Middle East. Yet people who have concerns about \nthat want to put dramatically new dollars into the mass transit system.\n  Well, the best place to get intelligence, quite honestly, is the \nbreeding ground of these terrorists: Iraq, Afghanistan. And so that war \nin Iraq and Afghanistan is, as the President has pointed out a number \nof times, taking the war to them to find them before they can find us. \nThen, once you capture the people, you have to get the intelligence \nfrom them. That is why Guantanamo Bay is such an important part of \nintelligence of our country and why people come down to the floor and \ncompare it to a Nazi concentration camp is such a gross misstatement of \nour purpose there and the actual action there. It is totally \nirresponsible to make statements such as that. No one has ever lost \ntheir life at Guantanamo Bay, and the interrogations which occur there \noccur under strict regimes. They are constantly monitored and meet all \nthe necessary responsibilities of legal and humane rights.\n  But we get vast amounts of information as a result of moving very bad \npeople from the Iraq and Afghanistan arena over to Guantanamo Bay. We \nget a vast amount of information from those individuals which gives us \nthe intelligence we need.\n  Then, of course, you have the issue of profiling. Clearly, if you are \ngoing to stop these people, you are going to have to profile. That is \nbeing resisted. And then, of course, you have the issue of the PATRIOT \nAct. Clearly, if you are going to stop these people, you have to know \nwhat they are doing, and the way to do it is through electronic \ninterdiction of their activities to a large degree. Yet you have people \nresisting.\n  Intelligence is the key to defending mass transit. Yet within this \nbody, regrettably, there is a lot of resistance to those elements of \nour efforts which are necessary in order to effectively pursue strong \nintelligence. But that is not an issue for this bill. The homeland \nsecurity intelligence role is not at the margin, but it is certainly \nnot at the center of the effort to gather intelligence. That is done by \nother agencies--the Defense Department, CIA, and FBI. However, I \ncertainly am willing to entertain moving more money into mass transit. \nWe could probably do another $100 million in mass transit and not \naffect this bill substantially. But once you get beyond that, you are \ngoing to have to take it out of the deficit or someplace like that. But \nwill you buy more security with those dollars? Not a great deal, I \ndon't think, because the people you are dealing with know how to get \naround those types of security initiatives however well you may create \na better sense of security.\n  This bill will, I suspect, over the next few days come under \namendment in the area of how better to protect our borders. Maybe we \nwill get better border security. The other part of the equation is how \nyou let people into this country who legitimately want to come to work \nand are not seeking to do us harm but seeking to improve their \nlivelihood. The Guest Worker Program, maybe we will get into that \nprogram, and certainly how best to address mass transit protection in \nlight of London. I am open to all of that. I am flexible. Our purpose \nhere is to make this agency work better.\n  In that context, I congratulate the Senator from West Virginia, my \nranking member, and who has joined us on the floor. He has been a \npartner in putting this effort together. He is totally committed to \ntrying to make sure we have a much safer country and a stronger \nDepartment of Homeland Security. He has done a great job of putting \nforward his ideas, many of which I totally agree with, some of which I \nmay not agree with, but most of which I do agree with. I respect \nimmensely his years of service to this Nation, which have been \nextraordinary, and his counsel, which is exceptional. I thank him and \nhis staff for the generous and extraordinary way they approach \neverything, but especially this bill. As we move forward, I am sure he \nwill have some additional ideas of how we can improve it on the floor, \nand I look forward to hearing those thoughts and ideas and I continue \nto look forward as we move this bill down the road to passage sooner \nrather than later because the Nation does need a Homeland Security \nbill.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened intently to the remarks of \nthe very distinguished Senator as the chairman of this appropriations \nsubcommittee, and I have been very impressed by his remarks. But prior \nto that, over a long period of time I have been very impressed with his \ndedication to the service of the people he represents here and his \ndedication to the Nation. He is an extremely able chairman. He has \nexperience in the executive field, as he has alluded to, and he has \nexperience in the committee system. He is preeminently fair in his work \non the subcommittee, very fair, always willing to listen, and most \ncharitable, may I say, toward me.\n  I am the ranking member on the subcommittee and on the full \ncommittee. But I could never wish for anyone to be more fair, more \nknowledgeable, or anyone whom I would respect more than this man from \nthe mountains of his\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\ngreat State, and I have a tremendous admiration for him and a great \ndeal of fondness for him. He is a chairman sui generis and a gentleman \nalong with it. I like that part, too, especially.\n  Now, Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee \nhas outlined the threat, and he has done so very well. I can't tell you \nhow much I have admired the way he has striven to put together this \nbill and utilized the limited amount of moneys that are available to us \nand do it in a way that will reach those areas that are in most need of \nfunding. I am immensely pleased with the work he has done. His work is \nthe foremost work, of course. As the ranking member, I try to help. I \ndo have a very able staff that works with the staff of the \ndistinguished chairman, and it is through this staff that I am able to \nkeep abreast of things and also to make my feelings known as well.\n  Mr. President, the Senate, then, has before it this bill for fiscal \nyear 2006 Homeland Security appropriations. I cannot commend too much \nthe distinguished chairman, as I have already indicated, and his staff, \nfor their work on this legislation. I also commend the thousands of men \nand women who are on the front lines of America's homeland security. \nThey serve the Nation every hour of every day.\n  I welcome Chairman Gregg to his new duties as chairman of the \nHomeland Security Subcommittee. He comes to it, needless to say, very \nwell prepared. He has a wealth of experience, a wealth of expertise. \nThe chairman targets limited resources--and I emphasize the word \n``limited''--on future threats, not simply the threats posed by the \nattacks of September 11. For the most part, the chairman has attempted \nto allocate resources to those threats that represent the greatest risk \nto the American people. In doing so he has, with my support, included a \nnumber of improvements to the President's budget particularly with \nregard to border security, air cargo security, funds for States to \nimplement the driver's license provisions of the REAL ID Act, as well \nas funding to protect the ``all-hazards'' Emergency Management \nPerformance Grant Program.\n  The committee bill builds on the bipartisan border security \ninitiative that I offered along with Senator Craig to the 2005 \nemergency supplemental. Between the emergency supplemental enacted in \nMay and this bill Congress will have increased the number of Border \nPatrol agents by 1,500, provided funds to train and house these agents, \nincreased the number of immigration investigators, the number of agents \nand detention officers by 817, and increased the number of detention \nbeds by 4,190.\n  The chairman has to be commended for this, and I am profuse in my \nadmiration and my support for what he has done.\n  In addition, the bill contains an important protection for the \nprivacy rights of Americans. We need always to keep these rights in \nmind. I thank Chairman Gregg for his support of language that I \nrecommended concerning secure flight, the Department's proposed new \nairline passenger profiling system. The language would prohibit the use \nof commercial databases for confirming the identity of airline \npassengers. Such commercial databases are unreliable and potentially \ninvade people's privacy.\n\n  The bill before the Senate provides $30.8 billion for discretionary \nprograms, an increase of 4.6 percent. This is a very lean bill. The \ncommittee was put in a difficult position as a result of the \nadministration's proposal to have the Appropriations Committee increase \nthe fees paid by airline passengers, a proposal that would have raised \n$1.68 billion. The Appropriations Committee does not have jurisdiction \nover airline fees and therefore could not approve the proposal. As a \nresult, the committee was forced to reduce spending below the \nPresident's request by $389 million.\n  So the low subcommittee allocation and the fee proposal resulted in \ncuts in firefighter grants, first responder grants, rail and mass \ntransit security grants, Coast Guard operations, and in the number of \nTransportation Security Administration screeners. These cuts are very \nunfortunate. It is regrettable that the administration's apparent lack \nof understanding of the legislative process will have such a direct \nimpact on programs that are so important, that are important elements \nof our homeland security strategy.\n  As the Senate considers this bill, I hope the Senators will look \nfavorably on amendments to restore the cuts in firefighter grants, \nfirst responder grants, and mass transit and rail security grants. The \nutterly tragic events in London last week remind all of us of the \nimminent threat--the imminent threat, may I say--to the American people \nthat is posed by terrorist attacks here at home--here at home.\n  We have heard it said it is better to fight these terrorists in Iraq \nthan it is to fight them in New York City or in Washington. Of course \nthat is true. Nobody doubts that. But don't let anybody be fooled. \nDon't let anybody be fooled. Fighting them in Iraq is not going to make \nus secure from having to fight them here at home in Washington, New \nYork, Tampa, FL--wherever. Don't fall for that malarkey. That is pure \nbunk. Of course we know what that is all about. But it has happened in \nLondon. It happened before that in Madrid, and before that in Japan, \nand it can happen here. No amount of argument, debate, or plain old \nmalarkey should convince anyone that it can't happen here. In my \njudgment, it will. It is coming. These people take their time. They are \npatient. They are not in a big hurry. And it is coming here. It is \ncoming here. The thing about it is these people know when and where and \nhow the attack will be made. We do not. So they have the advantages.\n  Let's just put that bunk to the side; forget it for now. There is \nnothing to it. We are in jeopardy. The American people are in jeopardy \nand we ought to understand that. Last Thursday, when asked if \nadditional funding was needed to secure our mass transit system, \nSecretary Chertoff said, ``I would not make a policy decision driven by \na single event.''\n  I have a great deal of respect for the Secretary. He was down in my \noffice just this morning, outlining something with respect to the \nsurveys which he has been making and on which he intends to report \npublicly, and also outlining his plans for the agency. I must say he \nhas a real grasp, a real feel of the full scope of the problems. I have \nto compliment him for that.\n  But with all due respect for the Secretary, the alarm bells just \ndidn't start ringing last week. The alarm bells have been ringing for \nyears. There have been 16 bombings worldwide linked to al-Qaida. The \nSenate should not be reducing our commitment to firefighters and first \nresponders, or to securing our mass transit and rail system. I am \npleased that the chairman has included my recommendation to direct the \nDepartment to expedite its grantmaking process. All too often--I made \nmention of this in a meeting with Secretary Chertoff in my office \nearlier today--all too often, funds that were approved by Congress last \nOctober will not be given to Federal, State, and local agencies until \nthis September, nearly a full year later. Americans are not made safer \nby having funding for border security, port security, rail security, \nand for hiring firefighters sit--where? In the U.S. Treasury.\n  On June 13, almost a month ago, I wrote a letter to Secretary \nChertoff, calling on him to focus on this problem as part of his review \nof agency operations. I will not ask now, but I will later, that that \nletter be made part of the Record.\n  Unfortunately, the Secretary has not seen fit to respond to my \nletter. That is not worthy of a great deal of comment, but it is worthy \nof some comment. I hope the Secretary's delay in responding is not \nindicative of the administration's intent to continue leaving homeland \nsecurity dollars gathering dust in the Treasury in Washington, DC.\n  I said this to the Secretary this morning. I am particularly appalled \nthat the $150 million that Congress approved last October for mass \ntransit and rail security is still sitting in the Treasury. What in the \nworld? Why in the world hasn't this money gone out? What is it doing \nsitting here in the Treasury? What in the world is wrong? I said it in \njust about that fashion--perhaps not quite that loudly this morning in \nmy office, but I said it, nevertheless. I am appalled by this. What in \nthe world are we waiting on? The Department did not even announce until \nApril how rail and transit systems could apply for the funds, wasting\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\na full 6 months that the rail and transit systems could have used to \nprepare for or to prevent a future attack.\n\n  Time and time again, the administration has talked a good game on \nhomeland security. Man, I will tell you, you just listen to the game \nthey talk and you feel, ``I can sleep better tonight. I will go home \nnow. I will watch the information about who is ahead in this game or \nthat game--I will just forget about all this other stuff.'' But it has \nnot followed through. The administration has not followed through with \na sustained commitment of resources and ideas. So I fear the \nadministration believes that it fulfills its commitment to securing the \nhomeland by creating the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I voted against that, to start with, because I foresaw this. I don't \nclaim to have great powers along these lines. But with all my \nexperience--and I have had some. I have been around here quite a while, \nlonger than anybody else on this Hill--anybody: Anybody sitting in the \ngallery, anybody out there in the offices, anybody downtown, or anybody \nelse. I have been around here longer in this Government, yes, indeed. \nWell, so much for that. But that is some experience. I have had time to \nsee some things and to lament some things. And I have been critical of \nboth parties, both administrations, Democratic and Republican, over the \nyears. So I think I have some basis for saying the things I am saying.\n  Mr. President, America is not made safer by simply reorganizing boxes \non an organizational chart. Repeatedly, the energy, the initiative, the \nresources, and the leadership for homeland security efforts have come \nfrom--where? Guess where. From Congress, the people's branch.\n  In December of 2004, Congress authorized the hiring of 2,000 new \nBorder Patrol agents per year for 5 years; the hiring of an additional \n800 Immigration investigators per year for 5 years to enforce our \nimmigration laws, and the funding of 8,000 new detention beds for the \nholding of illegal aliens. But despite statements by Secretary of State \nRice and statements by former Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Loy \nthat al-Qaida is a threat on our porous borders, there was virtually \nnothing in the President's budget to provide these additional resources \nfor border security--virtually nothing.\n  The bill that is before the Senate today commits real resources to \nsecuring our border with regard to transit and rail security.\n  When terrorists blew up trains last year in Madrid, Spain, the \nadministration had no plan for securing transit and rail systems. The \nhorrific bombings last week in London have raised the same questions \nthat we raised last year. Could it happen here? Are we prepared? \nAccording to the RAND Corporation, between 1998 and 2003, there were \napproximately--I don't know why we say approximately 181, but there \nwere 181 terrorist attacks on rail targets worldwide. Get that: \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, rail systems in the \nUnited States carry about five times--now, get that. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, passenger rail systems such as Amtrak \nin the United States carry about five times as many passengers each day \nas do airlines.\n  Since 2001 I have offered seven different amendments to fund rail and \ntransit security and all of them, all seven, were opposed by the \nadministration and defeated: seven times.\n  Remember Robert Bruce? He was lying up there in the loft of that barn \nand he had lost six times. He was about to give up until he saw that \nspider try to swing his web from this corner to that corner. He watched \nit six times and it failed. On the seventh time, lo and behold, that \nspider made it. So Robert Bruce decided he would try it one more time; \nseven times he tried it, he made it.\n  That number reminds me of that number seven again. Jacob liked Rachel \nand he spoke to the old man--I refer to her father as the old man--\nabout that beautiful daughter. The old man decided he would drive a \nbargain. He said, You can have her, but you work 7 years for her. So \nJacob worked 7 years. At the end of the seventh year he went to say to \nthe prospective father-in-law, How about it? Now I have worked my 7 \nyears, I have carried out my part of the bargain, how about this nice \ngirl you have? I have come to get her.\n  The old man said, No, not yet. You work 7 more. I will give you Leah, \nRachel's sister. You can't have Rachel. The Bible says that Leah was \nweak eyed. So all to his disgust, consternation, and sorrow, old Jacob \nhad to work 7 more years for Rachel.\n  Here we are talking about seven times. Since 2001 I have offered \nseven different amendments to fund rail and transit security and all \nseven, all of them, were opposed by the administration and defeated. \nDespite opposition from the administration, it was the Congress that \ncreated the Rail and Transit Security Grant Program that was first \nfunded in fiscal year 2005, and that is funded in this bill today.\n  I call on the administration to explain to the American people why \nthe $150 million that Congress appropriated last year has not been \ngiven to rail and transit agencies to invest in more cameras, more \nlocks, more canine teams, more training. I ask the Senate to approve \nadditional funding for such grants for fiscal year 2006. The $100 \nmillion included in the bill is $50 million below last year. It is $1.6 \nbillion below the level authorized for 2006 in bills that passed the \nSenate last year.\n\n  While this administration has been focussing on the last attack \ncarried out by hijackers, not one of whom was from Iraq, very little \nattention has been given to other vulnerabilities in aviation security. \nWhile the Transportation Security Administration examines 100 percent \nof checked baggage, most of the cargo that is stored in the same \npassenger aircraft and on cargo planes is not inspected. The threat of \na bomb on an aircraft is not new. In 1988, 259 passengers aboard a Pan \nAm flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, perished when a terrorist-placed \nbomb exploded while the aircraft was 31,000 feet in the sky. Three and \na half years ago, Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, tried to \nblow up an aircraft in flight over the ocean with explosives he carried \nonto the aircraft.\n  Yet, for 3 straight fiscal years, it has been Congress, this body and \nthe other body across the other end of the Capitol, that committed \nresources to address this problem. Since fiscal year 2004, Congress has \nadded $85 million above the President's request to hire air cargo \ninspectors and to advance research of innovative technologies to detect \nexplosives in air cargo.\n  What has the administration done with that funding? It has let $106 \nmillion sit in the Treasury. Six months after this fiscal year began, \nless than 12 percent of the funding appropriated for air cargo has been \nspent. I said this to the Secretary this morning. He will do better, he \nsays. It is taking him a while to get his arms around this. I believe \nhe will do better. Six months after this fiscal year began, less than \n12 percent of the funding appropriated for air cargo has been spent. To \nmake matters worse, the President's budget request for air cargo \nresearch and development in fiscal year 2006 was slashed in half.\n  The bill before the Senate continues the commitment to increasing the \ninspection of air cargo. I commend Chairman Gregg for that decision. \nLet me say it again: The bill before the Senate today, in this year of \nour Lord, this bill continues the commitment to increasing the \ninspection of air cargo. I commend Chairman Gregg for that decision.\n  When it comes to securing the Nation's chemical plant's--and I have \nlots of them down in the Kanawha Valley and Kanawha County, southern \nWest Virginia when it comes to securing the Nation's chemical plants--I \nimagine we probably have maybe the second largest, if not the largest, \nconcentration of chemical plants in the Northern Hemisphere right in \nKanawha County or in West Virginia. When it comes to securing the \nNation's chemical plants, the administration has been stuck in \nquicksand. We know the threat is real. The FBI has warned us about the \nthreat. We know an attack at a chemical plant could cost millions of \nlives. The Environmental Protection Agency has reported that 123 \nchemical facilities, if attacked, could threaten the lives of millions \nof people. My staff person says it would threaten the lives of over 1 \nmillion people. That is a lot of people.\n  For years, the administration has dragged its feet on securing our \nchemical facilities. For years, many in the Senate have pressed the \nadministration\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\nto do more, to show leadership. In response to my request, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the GAO--I don't much like that \nsecond most recent name, the Government Accountability Office--the old \nGAO recently released a report concluding that of the 15,000 chemical \nfacilities in the country, only 1,100 have complied with voluntary \nsecurity standards. It has been more than 2 years since the GAO urged \nthe EPA and DHS to develop a comprehensive strategy for the protection \nof our chemical plants.\n  Last month, the administration finally changed direction on the need \nto provide security standards to the chemical industry. However, the \nadministration has not yet proposed a specific plan or identified \nresources to implement such standards.\n  This bill before the Senate includes two important directives related \nto the protection of our chemical facilities. First, it requires the \nDepartment to provide the committee the estimates of the resources \nneeded to implement mandatory security requirements for the Nation's \nchemical sector. Second, it directs the Department to begin \nvulnerability assessments of the Nation's highest risk chemical \nfacilities. I look forward to the administration following through with \na specific plan.\n  The bill before the Senate today includes $200 million for port \nsecurity grants, $50 million above the amount provided in fiscal year \n2005. Once again, the administration's request was woefully inadequate. \nIt is the Congress that has taken the lead, the people's branch.\n  With the $200 million included in this bill, Congress will have \nfunded $843 million for port security grants since September 11. How \nmuch has the administration requested over that time? Hear me, hear me \nnow. How much money has the administration requested over that time? A \nmeasly little $46 million. Can you believe it? With the $200 million \nincluded in this bill, Congress will have funded $843 million for port \nsecurity grants since September 11. How much has the administration \nrequested over that time, I ask again? A measly $46 million.\n  To make matters worse, the fiscal year 2006 request by the White \nHouse included a proposal to have ports compete against other \nnonaviation modes of transportation by lumping them together in a \nlimited pot of funding.\n  More than 9 million cargo containers enter U.S. ports annually but \nonly 18 percent are inspected. All it takes is a dirty bomb stuffed \ninto one of those 9 million containers to cripple our economy. The $150 \nmillion Congress approved last October is still sitting in the \nTreasury. Why this administration continues to ignore the threat facing \nour seaports is mind-boggling. We cannot afford to wait for the next \nattack.\n  For each of the threats I have discussed today, the bill that is \nbefore the Senate continues congressional initiatives to secure our \nhomeland.\n  Again and again, and I don't get tired of saying it, I commend \nSenator Cochran, the first chairman of the Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity, for his leadership in 2003 and 2004. I again commend our new \ncommittee chairman, Senator Judd Gregg, for giving clear direction to \nthe Department in the bill before the Senate. With the resources that \nhave been made available to the committee, Chairman Gregg has produced \na good bill. Regrettably, as a result of the President's proposal to \nincrease airline passenger fees which the Appropriations Committee \nlacks the authority to approve, this bill does not have all of the \nresources it needs to meet known vulnerabilities. It is essential that \nthe Department of Homeland Security be responsive, not bureaucratic, \nwhile the threat we face is massive, and it is clear our response to \ndealing with it is tepid and unfocused. It will take a commitment of \nenergy, imagination, and, yes, more funding, to better secure our \nhomeland. Again, I thank my chairman and the members of the staff on \nboth sides for their excellent work and long hours, weekends, they have \nspent.\n  Mr. President, I referred to a letter which I had written to the \nHonorable Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, on June 13 of this year. I ask unanimous consent that letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2005.\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     Secretary, Department of Homeland Security,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: You are to be commended for ordering a \n     review of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) \n     organization, processes, and procedures. As you assess how to \n     improve agency operations, I encourage you to focus on a \n     matter that has been a continuing frustration since the \n     Department was established. Letting Federal dollars sit in \n     the Treasury in Washington, DC, does not make America safer. \n     There is no excuse for the appallingly slow pace of making \n     Department of Homeland Security funds available to Federal, \n     State, regional, and local agencies that are responsible for \n     actually making America safer.\n       Americans are made safer when our State and local police, \n     firefighters, and other security agencies hire, train, and \n     equip first responders, and when funds are made available for \n     border security and other law enforcement personnel. Yet, all \n     too often, the Department is slow to announce how State and \n     local agencies can apply for funds; and, all too often, DHS \n     agencies are slow to spend money. Congress approved funding \n     for Fiscal Year 2005 on October 11, 2004. Yet, most \n     application kits were not released by the Department until \n     April 2005, six months later. By the time applications are \n     prepared and reviewed and the money is awarded, it will be \n     the end of the fiscal year. This is time wasted that could \n     have been spent investing in our security.\n       Regrettably, there has been a consistent pattern of delay \n     at the Department.\n       Since October 2004, $65 million has been available under \n     the SAFER Act to hire local firefighters. Seven months later, \n     on May 30, 2005, the Department finally announced how our \n     local fire departments can apply for these funds. Funds are \n     not expected to be given to fire departments to hire \n     firefighters until the end of the fiscal year. Every day, our \n     1.1 million firefighters are prepared to put their lives on \n     the line. I do not understand why the Department waited so \n     long to issue a grant announcement.\n       Since October 2004, $150 million has been available to meet \n     the $6 billion estimated cost of securing our mass transit \n     systems. Over 9.6 billion transit trips are taken annually on \n     the various modes of transit service by Americans. Just a \n     little over a year ago, terrorists struck in Madrid, killing \n     190 and injuring 1,800 after setting off explosives on \n     commuter trains at rush hour. As the Madrid bombing proved, \n     the threat to transit systems is real. It is simply \n     unacceptable that the Department waited until April 5, 2005, \n     to announce how transit agencies could apply for the funds.\n       In October 2004, Congress approved $150 million for port \n     security to protect not only citizens' lives but also our \n     economy. The U.S. Coast Guard has estimated that a major port \n     closure for one month due to a maritime terrorist act could \n     cost up to $60 billion in economic loss to the United States. \n     I do not understand why the Department waited until May 11, \n     2005, to announce how our ports could apply for those funds. \n     As a result, it will be the end of the fiscal year before \n     taxpayers' dollars will be used to make our ports safer.\n       In October 2004, bus security funds were approved by \n     Congress to put preventative measures in place on our buses. \n     It took six months for the Department to put out a notice of \n     how to apply for the funds.\n       Over the last three years, Congress has approved $400 \n     million for the Pre-disaster Mitigation Program to reduce \n     risks and mitigate damage before disasters occur. According \n     to the most recent DHS expenditure plan, 95.5 percent of \n     those funds have not yet been spent, including $31 million \n     approved by the Congress in Fiscal Year 2003 and $136 million \n     approved in Fiscal Year 2004. Those funds could have been \n     spent to prevent loss of property and life; but, instead, the \n     money sits in the Treasury in Washington, DC., while local \n     communities battle a complicated application form and \n     bureaucratic procedures. Natural disasters do not wait for \n     the government to get it right.\n       The Flood Map Modernization Program was funded by Congress \n     to provide resources to update maps across the nation. Flood-\n     prone areas, particularly, need the maps to prevent damage to \n     property and to protect citizens' lives. Of the over $215 \n     million available in the current fiscal year, on1y $3 million \n     has been obligated, slowing down this important process.\n       In July 2002, Congress approved an emergency supplemental \n     appropriation for PortSTEP, a port security table-top \n     exercise program. It took two-and-a-half years for the \n     Transportation Security Administration to launch the $20 \n     million program.\n       In April 2003, Congress enacted $38 million through an \n     emergency appropriation for the Coast Guard to complete port \n     security assessments at tier-one strategic ports, our highest \n     priority ports. Two years later $16.8 million of the $38 \n     million is currently unobligated.\n       Congress included funding in Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005 to \n     hire air cargo inspectors, addressing glaring security \n     vulnerabilities in the shipping of explosives on passenger \n     and cargo aircraft. As of March 31,2005, less than 12 percent \n     of the funding that Congress appropriated for additional air \n     cargo security measures has been obligated.\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\n       In 2001, Congress approved $21.6 million for the Customs \n     Service for improving security on the Northern border. In \n     2003, $14.4 million. was added. Despite the fact that we have \n     137 fewer border patrol agents than we had just seven months \n     ago, this money continues to sit in the Treasury in \n     Washington, DC.\n       As you complete your review of agency operations, I \n     encourage you to expedite the expenditure of homeland \n     security dollars. There is no reason for these funds to sit \n     in the Treasury. There is no evidence that the delay will \n     result in the funds being better spent when they are finally \n     made available to Federal, state, regional, and local \n     agencies. The longer we wait to tighten security, the greater \n     the opportunity for terrorists to strike.\n       Please let me know why it is taking so long to get money \n     out the door, and what specific systems will be put in place \n     to make sure that this irresponsible bureaucratic delay does \n     not continue.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Robert C. Byrd,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. He \nalways brings a great deal of substance and thought to whatever issue \nhe decides to pursue on the Senate floor. Once again, in the opening \nstatement, he reflected that. He does outline many of the issues which \nneed to be addressed. He outlines them well and makes very strong \npoints. It is a result of a cooperative effort between his staff, my \nstaff, himself, and myself that we have gotten this bill to this point. \nAs he said, the purpose of this bill is to address the threats. That is \nour goal.\n  Obviously, there is going to need to be, in light of the London \nevent, some adjustment in the accounts relative to mass transit, and \nthere may be other areas where the Senate wishes to work its will.\n  The basic goal of this bill, as the Senator from West Virginia has \nsaid, and in which he played a major part, is to address the real \nproblems, the real threats that face this Nation. I continue to try to \ndo that, working with the Senator from West Virginia. I appreciate all \nhis cooperation and his effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. What is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.R. 2360.\n  Mr. REID. I first express my admiration for the two managers of this \nbill. Of course, Senator Byrd is a legend, having held every leadership \nposition, sometimes more than once. I enjoyed very much serving in the \nHouse with my friend from New Hampshire, and I recognize his stellar \ncareer as a Governor of his State and now as chairman of the Committee \non the Budget and also the chairman of his subcommittee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1129\n\n  I send to the desk an amendment on behalf of Senator Patty Murray, \nSenator Akaka, and Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Akaka, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1129.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--From any money in the Treasury not \n     otherwise obligated or appropriated, there are appropriated \n     to the Department of Veterans Affairs $1,500,000,000 for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, for medical services \n     provided by the Veterans Health Administration, which shall \n     remain available until expended.\n       (b) Emergency Designation.--The amount appropriated under \n     subsection (a) is designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress).\n       (c) This section shall take effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the managers of the bill allowing me to offer \nthis amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the tragic bombings in London are a sober \nreminder of how vulnerable America and our allies remain to terrorism. \nWhat happened in London last week is likely to be tragically replicated \nif our country does not act boldly to reduce what ought to be called a \nterror tax now imposed on the American people.\n  I call it a terror tax because when we pull up to the corner gas \nstation and pay $2.40 a gallon or so for gas, the reality is a portion \nof that money is then turned over to foreign governments that ``back \ndoor'' it over to Islamist extremists who use that money to perpetuate \nterrorism and hate.\n  What I call the terror tax is not posted as a price at our gas pump. \nWe do not see it in our pay stub. It is not calculated in our balance \nof payments to foreign governments. It is a tax measured not in dollars \nand cents but in risk and insecurity to the American people. It is as \nreal as everything else the American people put their money toward each \nweek.\n  Of the 20 million barrels of oil Americans consume each day, almost \n12 million barrels of it is imported. That percentage, now nearly 60 \npercent, is growing. It was only about 33 percent at the time of the \nArab oil embargo years ago. Our addiction to foreign oil has nearly \ndoubled in what amounts to just a few years.\n  In the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be sitting down as \npart of an effort to write an Energy bill that must take as its \npriority helping to shake us free of this addiction to foreign oil.\n  I voted against the Energy bill in the Senate because I felt it did \nnot do enough to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but I hope, \nespecially at this critical time, on a bipartisan basis during this \nconference it will be possible to make this legislation better.\n  I believe it is important to do as much as possible to reduce the \nterror tax that comes with our dependence on foreign oil. It is not \ngood enough to accept business as usual when our citizens pay record \nprices at the gas pump, only to see foreign governments wink and nod \nwhile terrorist groups make off with substantial amounts of money and \nuse those funds to target the United States. In my view, there is an \nindisputable link not only between the American dependence on foreign \noil and the price our citizens pay at the pump, but between our oil \naddiction and our vulnerability to attack here at home.\n  For this reason, as the House and Senate get together to look at a \nstrategy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, I intend to propose \nfive concrete steps to reduce the terror tax.\n  First, I want the State Department to publish each year for the next \n10 years a report on the flow of money paid by Americans at the gas \npump to foreign governments that ends up in the hands of Islamic \nextremists who target America with acts of terror.\n  Second, since most foreign oil goes to the transportation sector, I \nwant the American automobile industry to be required to increase auto \nefficiency by just 1 mile per gallon each year for the next 10 years. \nThink about what a modest step that is--just 1 mile per gallon. \nOtherwise, the auto industry ought to explain to the American people \nwhy they cannot meet this objective that I am calling for that is so \nimportant to the national security of our people.\n  Third, for each of the next 10 years, the Energy Department should \npublish a list of the most energy-efficient cars in each of the major \ntypes of vehicles so the auto industry would have to compete on the \nbasis of the most fuel-efficient automobiles.\n  Fourth, to increase the responsible production of oil in America, not \noverseas, companies that increase oil production at existing wells \nshall receive a 2-percent annual increase in their tax writeoffs for \nthis production for each of the next 10 years that the company \nincreases production from existing wells in the United States.\n  Finally, this bill must promote new alternatives to oil. I have \nproposed a no-risk way to kick-start efforts to get hydrogen fuel cell \nvehicles on the road within the decade. By creating incentives for \nselling hydrogen vehicles and fuels, we would pay only for performance. \nOnly actions that put hydrogen vehicles on the road or provide stations \nto fuel up would qualify for the incentives.\n  In the nearer term, other alternatives would become readily \navailable. They include cellulosic ethanol made from plant materials \ngrown by American farmers as well as electricity\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\nproduced by flexible fuel hybrid electric vehicles that can be plugged \nin as well as refueled at the pump.\n  Getting a fair energy bill that reduces our dependence on foreign oil \nis just about the most red, white, and blue step this Congress could \ntake. It is absolutely critical if we are to do everything possible to \nensure our national security. Experts from a range of political stripes \nagree that the single most important step Congress can take to make \nAmerica more secure is to reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign \noil.\n  As a member of the conference committee on the energy bill, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to secure these commonsense steps \nto end the terror tax brought about as a result of our addiction to \nforeign oil. Doing so is simply a matter of life and death for the \ncitizens we respect so much here at home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there is now pending on this bill an \namendment offered by the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, relative to \nthe Veterans' Administration. I am not sure how that is going to be \nhandled, but clearly the bill becomes tied up in that issue for a \nwhile. I am not sure whether people are even going to come down and \ndebate that amendment, as it was offered last week to the Interior \nbill. I am not really involved in that skirmish, but I do want to bring \nus back to the essence of this bill and the purpose of this bill and \nreturn to the fact that from my standpoint the biggest concern we have \nto address is weapons of mass destruction. The second biggest concern \nis border security.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about border security because I do \nbelieve this is where the Homeland Security agency can make the largest \ncontribution toward trying to make our Nation more secure.\n  I know there is a lot of concern out there today about what happened \nin England. But you have to remember that the people who probably \ncommitted that act in England came from outside of England. They came \ninto England with evil intent. In fact, I have seen some early news \nreports which have implied the detonating mechanisms used were of a \ntype you could not acquire in England; therefore, it is presumed that \nthe people who committed this act came from outside of England. I think \none can safely assume that, especially in light of 9/11 where the \npeople who attacked us came from outside our country, although in some \ninstances they came with legal visas.\n  So it is critical we get control of our borders. Last year, over 3 \nmillion people came into this country illegally--3 million people. The \nestimate is somewhere between 11 and 15 million people are in this \ncountry illegally. We know that a large percentage of those people, \nespecially people coming across our border with Mexico, are coming here \nbecause they have a legitimate desire to work in America. They are \nseeking jobs. I guess it is a reflection of the strength of our economy \nand the strength of our Nation that people seek to come to America in \norder to get a better livelihood and to give their families a better \nchance of having a better livelihood.\n  Those people are not threats. Those people are here to put in a hard \nday's work and make enough money to have a decent living. In many \ncases, they are doing jobs Americans are unwilling to do. There ought \nto be a way to address that concern, and it ought to be some sort of \nguest worker program. Hopefully, we will address that as a Congress. We \nshould address that. I consider it to be one of the primary needs we \nhave to address.\n  In the context of homeland security, if we could in some way identify \neffectively people who are coming across our borders who are coming not \nwith the purpose of ill-intent but with the purpose of having a decent \njob, that would significantly reduce the number of people we would have \nto focus on relative to the threat they present. So a decent and \nintelligent immigration policy in this country, with an effective guest \nworker program, is critical to our national security.\n  But that is not the responsibility of the Homeland Security agency. \nThe Homeland Security agency's purpose is to actually have the physical \npeople on the border who check the people who come across the border \nand stop the people coming across the border illegally. The pile of \nreports I referred to before--the actual plurality of them if not the \nmajority of them--reflect the failures of our ability to adequately \nmonitor our borders. We have found we are not doing a very good job on \nour borders.\n\n  As I said, 3 million people are coming into the country illegally \nevery year--that is the estimate--and over 10 million people who are \nprobably here illegally already. A fair percentage of those folks are \nnot Mexican. They are coming from another country, but they are coming \nacross the Mexican border. And those people may very well represent \nlegitimate threats to our country. So we need to do something to \naddress this issue.\n  There are different levels where we need to address this issue. I \nmentioned the guest worker program would be a major effort in this \narea, but in the area of just plain security, there are initiatives \nthat need to be pursued. So what we did was we looked at what was \nhappening with our border security effort and concluded there were \ncertain programs on the border that needed really significant increase \nin resources in order to be effective.\n  Some of them, unfortunately, could not take as much resources as we \nwould like to have given them because they simply could not handle it \neffectively. The first was just simply feet on the ground. We need more \nBorder Patrol agents on the ground, especially on the southern border. \nThat is a feet-on-the-ground issue. Unfortunately, because of the \ntraining capacity and because of the ability to hire people who want to \ngo into the Border Patrol as a career, we cannot add as many people as \nwe would like to add.\n  As was mentioned by the Senator from West Virginia, there was, 3 or 4 \nyears ago, a proposal to hire 2,000 a year. What we found was the \nBorder Patrol simply could not find the people. And then they could not \ntrain the people when they did find them. However, we decided a \nsignificant increase was important. Working with the Senator from West \nVirginia again, in the supplemental, we added 500 new Border Patrol \nagents this year. We have now added another 1,000 agents with this \nbill, for an additional 1,500 agents. So that is actually a little bit \noutside the envelope of what the Border Patrol can effectively train.\n  We are also significantly increasing the commitment to the training \nfacilities so we can increase training capacity so that next year, when \nwe have this bill, it is my intention to add more than 1,500. I hope to \nget up to 2,000 next year. The year after that, I hope to get to 2,500. \nThe goal is to get to 10,000 new Border Patrol agents within 5 years. \nWhether we can reach it, I do not know. But if we can get the training \nfacilities up, get the infrastructure up that supports these people, \nand get the Border Patrol agents up, then maybe we can do it \neffectively. But the first step is to add these additional 1,500 \nagents.\n  Now, once you have the Border Patrol physically on the ground, they \nare going to catch people. That is their job. The problem today is that \nwhen they catch people they have to let them go. They send them over to \nthe court, and the court sends them out on their own recognizance. They \nare supposed to return for a court date, and they never return. About \n85 percent of the people who are asked to return do not return. Well, \nthat is not too surprising, really. They came here illegally. Why are \nthey going to return when they are told they can go away and come back \non a different date for their court appearance?\n  We need better and more capacity in the area of detention. So this \nbill, working with the supplemental, again working with the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, adds about 4,000 new detention beds. Again, our \ngoal is, within a limited period of time--hopefully not 5 years in this \ncase, hopefully even less--to be able to detain effectively anybody who \nis caught who is other than a Mexican citizen coming across our border \nwith Mexico, to be able to detain that person as long as it is \nnecessary to make sure they are not a threat to us. It is something we \ncannot do today. But this bill moves in that direction by adding 4,000 \nnew beds in this area.\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\n  We also have the unmanned vehicle program. This program, which is an \nimportant element of the surveillance of our borders, has fallen on \nhard times. In fact, the vehicles were basically stopped about a year \nand a half ago. They just stopped running them because they were not \nworking. They started again, and this bill attempts to get the unmanned \nvehicle program running at a much more aggressive level. This is a \ntremendous opportunity for us to survey the border using fewer \npersonnel more efficiently.\n  In addition, we have technology on the borders, the video and the \nother types of sensor capability. Again, we have run into major \ntechnology problems. Contracts were let that should not have been or \nwere let ineffectually. One more time we got a bunch of reports on this \none. While the program has been restarted, this bill tries to make sure \nthe program goes forward effectively. This is a fencing issue here. We \nare saying we were going to give you a lot more funds, but we want to \nmake sure the funds are spent effectively.\n\n  Also in the area of people coming into this country legitimately who \nactually are going through our immigration entrance system, we have \nvery significant issues of being able to track who they are and when \nthey come in and when they leave. In order to address that, we are \ntrying to set something up called US-VISIT which is a major new \ntechnology initiative of extreme complexity. Therefore, I recognize it \nis not going to come on line maybe in a perfect way.\n  What we are concerned about, speaking for the Senate and for the \nsubcommittee, is that the US-VISIT Program, which is going to purchase \nmassive amounts of software and hardware capability to go into the \nimmigration system, that that program not end up being like the \nprograms we have had in other major Federal agencies which have \ninitiated major complex IT initiatives, such as the Trilogy Program at \nthe FBI, that we not end up being halfway down the road, hundreds of \nmillions of dollars having been spent, and we realize we have a program \nthat doesn't work. This bill attempts to make sure that the US-VISIT \nProgram is being brought on line in a way that we have benchmarks and \nwe know the software is meeting the criteria and the regimes that are \nappropriate to that type of software and that the hardware can \ninterface with it effectively.\n  This bill makes a major initiative in the area of basically putting \nemphasis on the borders, both with the feet-on-the-ground issue, with \nthe technology issue, and with the capital infrastructure issue in the \narea of border facilities and detention facilities. Therefore, I think \nit is the right approach. Is it going to get our borders secure \nunilaterally by this effort? Obviously not. But it is a step in the \nright direction and part of the formula that should lead us to borders \nwhich are more secure.\n  The simple fact is, as a nation, we are not going to be able to \nprotect ourselves from the significant threat of these individuals who \nwill come here for the purposes of killing Americans, and for no other \npurpose, until we get effective control over the borders and know who \nis coming in and why they are coming and make sure we do not allow or \nare able to stop people who are coming into this country whose purpose \nis to commit acts which will harm Americans. This bill is an attempt to \nstep down that road in a much more aggressive way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1133\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting the pending \namendment aside?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1133.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To increase funding for Firefighter Staffing)\n\n       On page 81, line 22, strike ``For necessary'' down through \n     and including ``tion.'' on line 4, page 82, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``For necessary expenses for programs authorized by the \n     Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. \n     2201 et seq.), $615,000,000, of which $500,000,000 shall be \n     available to carry out section 33 (15 U.S.C. 2229) and \n     $115,000,000 shall be available to carry out section 34 (15 \n     U.S.C. 2229a) of such Act, to remain available until \n     September 30, 2007: Provided, That not to exceed 5 percent of \n     this amount shall be available for program administration.''\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will not object to the chairman's \namendment. We need additional funds for the SAFER Firefighter Hiring \nProgram. But this amendment leaves the program to equip and train \nfirefighters $150 million below fiscal year 2005. Last year the \nDepartment received $2.76 billion of eligible applications and could \nonly approve 25 percent of the applications. In response to this \nincredible demand for firefighting funds, the bill will cut firefighter \nequipment and training grants from $650 million to $500 million. So \nwhile I don't oppose the chairman's amendment, I put the Senate on \nnotice that I will offer an amendment to restore the cuts in equipment \nand training for our firefighters. I hope the Senate will agree to the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's point. My \npurpose here is to recognize the fact that we put over $2 billion into \nequipment, and we need to start focusing on training. This will move \n$50 million over to the training side and still leave in the pipeline a \ndramatic amount of money for equipment. We can address that issue down \nthe road, as the Senator from West Virginia represents he may wish to \ndo, but at this point I think this reallocation of funds is a statement \nof policy that is appropriate.\n  I again ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1133) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will speak at a later point about the \nunderlying bill, the Homeland Security appropriations bill. It is an \nimportant piece of legislation. I say to the manager that I just \nchecked with the cloakrooms, and there is nobody coming to speak, so I \nwanted to speak in morning business. I will have an amendment dealing \nwith the proposed passport requirements between the United States and \nCanada, and I will address that later.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 this \nafternoon, the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of a resolution \nwhich is at the desk and relates to the recent bombings in London; \nprovided further that no amendments be in order to the resolution or \npreamble. I further ask that there be a moment of silence prior to the \nvote on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand from my colleague from New \nHampshire that we will be voting on a resolution at 5:30 this evening, \nexpressing our condolences to our allies and friends who had to bear \nthe brunt of a terrorist attack, an aggressive terrorist attack, in \nLondon. It is heartbreaking to see the results of these horrible \nattacks against innocent people committed by terrorists who apparently \nare determined to kill innocent people, as many as is possible, to make \ntheir point, whatever their point is.\n  That attack reminds all of us again of how vulnerable we are and how \nimportant homeland security is, and I think it underscores the \nimportance of this appropriations bill. Homeland security is critically \nimportant. It means we have to have reasonable border security. It \nmeans we have to have port security and a range of other issues. I want \nto mention two things.\n  We have spent a lot of money and a lot of time dealing with security \nof air travel, particularly commercial airlines. Now when you go \nthrough the lines at the airports, they are searching for tweezers and \nall those items that might be used as weapons. Sometimes there are long \nlines. I know it is frustrating. We have devoted a lot of time and \neffort in this country dealing with the last terror attack in which 15 \nof the 19 terrorists were Saudi citizens. Nineteen terrorists drove jet \nairplanes loaded with fuel into buildings to be used as missiles, and \nwe are dealing with that a lot. We are spending a lot of money dealing \nwith this issue of airport security and aviation security.\n  My colleagues, and particularly one of my colleagues who departed the \nSenate, Senator Hollings, have talked a lot about port security. We \nhave about 9 million containers coming in on container ships in this \ncountry in a year--9 million containers in a year. A relatively small \npercentage of those containers are inspected. If, God forbid, \nterrorists should get a hold of a small nuclear weapon, the size of a \ngrapefruit or a basketball, and detonate a small nuclear weapon at one \nof our docks in a container on a container ship, it could obliterate an \nAmerican city. Yet we have not spent nearly as much time dealing with \nport security or, for that matter, rail security as we have dealing \nwith the issue of security at airports and security in commercial air \ntravel. We must do a much better job with respect to ports.\n  When we have that many containers coming into our ports with so few \nbeing inspected, it leaves our country vulnerable.\n  I recall visiting a port one day. I come from a State without ports. \nWe do not have a water boundary. I was interested so I toured a port in \na major city. I asked: What is in that container on that ship?\n  That is frozen broccoli, they said.\n  Is it full of bags of frozen broccoli?\n  Yes, it is full of 100-pound bags of frozen broccoli.\n  How do you know that? Do you know what is in the middle of that big \nold container?\n  No, we just know that is what it says on the bill of lading, frozen \nbroccoli.\n  What if, God forbid, somehow terrorists acquire a nuclear weapon and \nput that in a refrigerated container on a container ship or any \ncontainer on a container ship destined for one of our country's major \nport cities and detonate that nuclear weapon at the docks in the middle \nof one of America's port cities?\n  We must find ways to address those issues, and we have not spent \nnearly the resources necessary to give us adequate security at \nAmerica's ports. We have not spent nearly the resources necessary to \nprovide the security with this country's rail system.\n  We haul every day, all across this country, toxic material, dangerous \nmaterial all across America. If terrorists were to find a way to deal \nwith that and manipulate a terrorist attack in our rail system with the \nkinds of materials that move on our rail system, we would be in a very \ndifficult situation.\n  As we review this legislation today and tomorrow, we need to continue \nto rethink how do we improve, how do we make the adjustments necessary \nto devote more resources for port security, especially port security \nand rail security.\n  I did indicate we do need to control our borders. There is no \nquestion we need to do that. But I think even the President expressed \nsurprise at the suggestion of the Department of Homeland Security that \nwith regard to the 4,000-plus-mile common border with Canada, we are \ngoing to require every person moving back and forth through that common \nborder to have a passport.\n  In my judgment, that is an impractical way to provide security at \nAmerica's borders. As the President suggested, I hope the Homeland \nSecurity Agency will rethink that. In our part of the country we have a \nlong and common border with Canada. Every day there is a substantial \namount of commerce coming back and forth. People farm on both sides. \nPeople work on both sides, do business on both sides. To require a \npassport in both directions would make no sense at all.\n  When I began talking about this before 9/11/2001, we had ports of \nentry at the northern border ports that when they closed in the evening \nsecurity consisted only of an orange rubber cone put in the middle of \nthe road. The polite ones actually stopped and removed the cone before \nthey came across the border. Those who were not so polite would run \nover it at 60 miles an hour.\n  So we have made improvements in those areas but much remains to be \ndone. I hope as we construct, talk about, and consider amendments to \nthis bill, we will finally understand that security means security in \nevery area, not just in aviation or commercial airports. The tragic \nattack in London tells us once again how vulnerable some of these areas \nare and I mentioned two today: our rail system, No. 1, and especially \nNo. 2, our port system, which renders much of our major and largest \nport cities in this country very vulnerable to a devastating terrorist \nattack. We must and we can and we will do better.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Let me note at the outset my appreciation for the \nwork that Senator\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\nLieberman has done on this issue. He and I have worked together with \nmembers of the Homeland Security Subcommittee for the past 3 years on \nthis authorization to develop an improved homeland security funding \napproach based on extensive hearings we have held, much consultation, \nand hard work by our committee.\n  We are pleased to be joined by several cosponsors, including Senators \nCarper, Coleman, Akaka, Voinovich, DeWine, Bingaman, and Salazar.\n  The amendment we offer would for the first time authorize a framework \nfor the billions of dollars the Department of Homeland Security \nallocates each year to assist first responders and State and local \nofficials in helping to prevent terrorism and to prepare for an attack. \nThat important point bears repeating. The more than $8 billion that \nCongress has appropriated for grants to States and localities for \nterrorism prevention and response since 9/11 has never been \ndefinitively authorized.\n  This is not a matter of an authorization having expired, which \nhappens quite frequently around here, but rather of a multibillion-\ndollar program that has never been authorized. This is highly unusual. \nIn fact, my staff checked with CRS, which went back a decade and could \nnot find a single other grant program over $1 billion that has never \nbeen authorized. Sure the appropriators have borrowed a funding formula \nfrom the PATRIOT Act, although the bill before us does not use that \nformula, but in truth the appropriators have had to legislate the \ndetails of the Homeland Security Grant Program year after year. So, for \nexample, the House-passed version of this year's Homeland Security \nappropriations bill determines the minimum allocation that each State \nis to receive, establishes a strict timeframe for applications to be \nsubmitted and for the Department to act on them, requires 80 percent of \nthe grants to be passed on by States to local governments within 60 \ndays, determines for what funds can and cannot be used, and requires \ngrantees to submit reports on their use of funds. That is a lot of \nlegislative language on the House-passed appropriations bills, and \nindeed the Senate version before us contains similar legislative \nprovisions.\n  These are the kinds of programmatic decisions that Congress is \nsupposed to determine through authorization bills, not each year anew \non an appropriations bill. What Senator Lieberman and I are offering \ntoday is the specific, detailed authorization bill that this program \nhas never had. Frankly, we would prefer not to do this, not to offer it \nto the appropriations bill. We believe our legislation, S. 21, which is \nthe product of numerous legislative hearings, two markups, and input \nfrom countless interested parties and many homeland security experts, \nshould be considered by the full Senate on its own. The House recently \npassed a companion measure. S. 21 is on the Senate calendar, having \nbeen reported by the Homeland Security Subcommittee without dissent on \nApril 13. But there are no assurances that it will be brought to the \nSenate floor. So we are offering our authorization bill as an amendment \nto this appropriations measure.\n  Although Senate rule XVI generally prohibits authorizing on an \nappropriations bill, ironically there is an exception when the House \nhas, in essence, opened the door by legislating on the matter in its \nown bill. That is what has happened here, so we believe that rule XVI \nis not implicated.\n\n  Mr. President, you may be saying, Why does this really matter? What \nis important about this bill that it should be brought up rather than \nallowing the situation to continue with slight tweaks and variations \nand new legislative language on the appropriations bill, year after \nyear? Let me talk about the amendment, which is the text of S. 21 as \nreported, with a few changes.\n  The amendment establishes a new formula for distributing homeland \nsecurity grant dollars. It determines how funds are to be allocated, \nsets criteria to ensure that the funds are spent in ways that help \nStates and communities develop essential capabilities to prevent and \nrespond to terrorism, and it holds grantees responsible for achieving \nresults.\n  Perhaps the amendment's most important provisions are those that \ninject needed accountability measures into the grants process. We have \nall heard the horror stories about inappropriate spending of homeland \nsecurity funds. This waste is intolerable, but particularly so when \nthere are so many unmet needs that are scrambling for funds--needs \nwhere the funding simply is not available. Our amendment will put into \nplace tough new standards to ensure that homeland security funds are \nspent wisely and in ways that will help us better prepare for, or \nrespond to, or prevent a terrorist attack.\n  Let me refer to this chart which summarizes the accountability \nmeasures that are included in the Collins-Lieberman provisions. The \nfirst is tying spending to standards. This amendment requires that \nStates distribute and spend homeland security funds only in ways that \nmeasurably help them meet preparedness standards and achieve essential \ncapabilities to be determined by the Department of Homeland Security. \nIn other words, no more spending homeland security dollars on leather \njackets in the District of Columbia or air-conditioned garbage trucks \nin New Jersey. For that matter, even purchases of perfectly appropriate \nitems such as hazmat suits must be tied to achieving essential \ncapabilities set by the Department. This safeguard is designed to \nprevent a community from purchasing equipment that it has no reasonable \nexpectation of needing. I know this is an issue with which the chairman \nof the subcommittee, Senator Gregg, has been particularly concerned.\n  The second accountability measure is a thorough annual audit by the \nGeneral Accounting Office to ensure that funds are not being wasted and \nthat the program is working as intended.\n  Third is greater coordination among the many grant programs that fund \nprevention and response efforts. Our amendment would create a Federal \ninteragency committee to promote coordination of homeland security \ngrants throughout the Federal Government. In particular, this committee \nwould focus on eliminating redundant application, planning, and \nreporting requirements faced by States, local governments, and first \nresponders in applying for and executing different Federal homeland \nsecurity-related grants.\n  Fourth are robust reporting requirements. These are the means by \nwhich accountability can be enforced. The amendment requires grant \nrecipients to submit annual reports on their specific uses of grant \nfunds and their progress in achieving essential capabilities. These \nreports would be submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary, in turn, \nwould be required to submit an annual report to Congress, providing an \naccounting of how grants to States and communities are spent and an \nevaluation of their progress.\n  Fifth are the remedies for noncompliance, what I call the enforcement \nmechanisms. The amendment empowers the Secretary to terminate or reduce \ngrant payments if a State or locality fails to comply with all the \nrequirements of the grant.\n  In addition to these tough new accountability measures, our amendment \nauthorizes a funding amount that is adequate and a distribution formula \nthat is fair. This legislation dramatically increases the funds that \nwould be distributed based on threat, risk, and consequences. It also \nmaintains a meaningful level of funding for each State. Much of the \nfrontline responsibility for homeland security has fallen squarely on \nthe shoulders of our State and local officials and our Nation's more \nthan 9 million first responders. Communities across America have risen \nto this challenge and developed scores of innovative homeland security \nstrategies. For these strategies to be implemented, however, all States \nmust achieve a baseline level of essential capabilities. At the same \ntime, we must direct resources toward locations and facilities that are \nat higher levels of risk and vulnerability.\n  Both of these goals--helping each and every State come up to a \nminimum level of preparedness and targeting funds to those areas and \nfacilities at greatest risk--require an adequate, steady, and \npredictable stream of Federal funding. Absent that stream, we find \nourselves in an escalating argument over whether these resources are \nbeing allocated and spent properly.\n  Unfortunately, this argument increasingly pits our urban centers \nagainst our rural regions. We believe the bill that we have carefully \ncrafted strikes the right balance.\n\n[[Page S7970]]\n\n  Let me acknowledge the hard work of Senators Gregg and Byrd in \nputting together this appropriations bill. We share with them the goal \nof a fair formula for allocating funds to States while increasing the \nproportion of funds that would be distributed based on risk, but the \nproblem is unpredictability. We ask States to prepare multiyear plans \nfor improving their homeland security capabilities and yet each year we \nthreaten to develop a new formula for distributing Homeland Security \ngrant dollars. That is why in supporting our legislation, S 21, the \nNational Governors Association underscored the need for the \npredictability that our amendment would provide.\n\n  On the chart behind me is a quotation from the Governor's letter. It \nreads as follows:\n\n       To effectively protect our states and territories from \n     potential terrorists events, all sectors of government must \n     be part of an integrated plan to prevent, deter, respond to \n     and recover from a terrorist act. For the plan to work, it is \n     essential that it be funded through a predictable and \n     sustainable mechanism both during its development, and in its \n     implementation. A minimum allocation to each state and \n     multiyear authorization levels of funding will provide the \n     predictability necessary to implement statewide plans that \n     will assist governors in securing our nation.\n\n  This is, after all, a partnership with first responders, with local \ngovernments, and with State governments.\n  Our amendment would provide the predictability States need to protect \nour Nation. First, our amendment authorized a sufficient level to \nreverse the trend of declining Homeland Security funding by authorizing \nthe program at the fiscal year 2004 level of $2.9 billion. As the chart \nbehind me demonstrates, funding for first responders is on the decline \nby $900 million from 2004 to the level proposed in the President's \nbudget. We were reminded just last week that the war against terrorism \nhas not been won. The battle continues. It is our first responders who \nare on the front lines. Do we truly believe that now, during a period \nof heightened alert, is the time to scale back our efforts in \npreventing and responding to terrorist attacks? I think not.\n  Our amendment also incorporates a balanced formula. Each State would \nbe guaranteed a minimum allocation of .55 percent of the total funds \nappropriated for State and urban area grants. The minimum, however, is \nscaled so that States with larger populations and higher population \ndensities would receive additional funds. We call this a sliding scale \nbaseline. It will promote a level of preparedness and provide \npredictability. The remainder of the total funds would be distributed \nto States and regions based on the Secretary's determination of risk \nand threat.\n  As this chart shows, the amendment makes a grant investment in \nthreat-based funding. It increases the proportion of risk-based funding \nby more than 60 percent. Moreover, under our sliding scale distribution \nusing factors the Department of Homeland Security employs now in its \nrisk-based approach, another 10.7 percent of appropriated funds would \nbe allocated only to the most populous and most densely populated \nStates.\n  These are important steps toward bridging that urban-rural divide, \nand they balance the need for predictability for bringing each State up \nto a minimum level of preparedness with a heightened emphasis on \nallocating funds based on threat, risk, and consequences.\n  As the ranking member on our committee well knows, since he has \njoined with me in all of these investigations, the choice must not be \nbetween protecting skyscrapers or farms and feedlots that provide our \nfood supply, or chemical plants and industrial zones versus the rural \ncommunities that trucks and trains carrying those hazardous chemicals \npass through. All funds beyond those necessary to cover the baseline \nallocations, more than 60 percent of the total, would be distributed \nbased on the relative threat, vulnerability, and consequences faced by \nan area from a terrorist attack. From this funding pool, the Secretary \nwould make threat-based grants to both States and metropolitan regions.\n  My colleague from Connecticut feels strongly about taking a regional \napproach to homeland security. In allocating the risk-based formula, \nthe Secretary would prioritize grants with consideration given to such \nfactors as population, population density, critical infrastructure, \ncoastlines, international borders, previous terrorist attacks, elevated \nthreat levels higher than the rest of the Nation, as well as other \nfactors he deems appropriate.\n  While allowing judgment on the part of the Secretary, we specifically \ndelineated some of the critical factors--the ones I just read--that the \nDepartment must take into account. In doing so, we take some of the \nmystery out of the black box from which DHS now seems to generate some \nof its funding decisions, decisions that result, for example, in \nMinneapolis receiving funding but not St. Paul.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of the urban-rural argument is the \nassertion often made that locations outside of our largest cities have \nno significant homeland security needs. This is demonstrably untrue. It \nignores a great deal of expertise. It ignores our history.\n\n  A recent study conducted by the Harvard School for Public Health, \nwith coleadership by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services \nand participation by 26 States, shows that rural areas face unique and \nprofound homeland security challenges. A great many power and water \nsupplies as well as virtually our entire food supply are located \noutside of urban areas. Work our committee has done on agro-terrorism \nshows the potential threat to our food supply. In addition, rural areas \nhave far less capacity to deal with a terrorist attack or a public \nhealth crisis.\n  In a letter describing its commercial equipment direct assistance \nprogram, the Department of Homeland Security itself wrote:\n\n       When they face the common threat of terrorism, the needs of \n     smaller jurisdictions are very different from the needs of \n     larger metropolitan areas. Smaller agencies confront threats \n     to the transportation infrastructure, agriculture, water \n     supplies, power grids and other critical items spread out \n     over a wide geographic area.\n\n  I will highlight the next statement because the events preceding \nSeptember 11 show it is so true:\n\n       Terrorists may live and train in rural communities. Targets \n     such as pipelines and nuclear power plants are typically \n     located in smaller jurisdictions.\n\n  Indeed, among the most striking aspects of the report of the 9/11 \nCommission is the extent to which the terrorists did live, organize, \nand train in America's smaller communities. The contacts they had with \nsmaller law enforcement agencies before the September 11 attacks are \nstriking, as well.\n  As the committee reconstituted the movements of the terrorists after \nthey arrived in the United States, the trail led to such places as \nVenice and Coral Springs, FL, Norman, OK, Falls Church, VA, \nLawrenceville and Stone Mountain, GA and, of course, most personal to \nme, Portland, ME. It was Portland, ME from which two of the hijackers, \nincluding the ringleader, began their journey of death and destruction \non September 11. It is not just the large cities that attract those who \nwould do us harm. Indeed, often they feel more secure in hiding in our \nsmaller cities and communities.\n  As we seek to ensure that our communities, large and small, are \nprepared to respond to a terrorist attack, we must not lose sight of \nthe need for prevention. Our amendment ensures that the prevention of \nterrorist attacks, not just response efforts, receives a significant \nshare of Homeland Security funds. This is an area that law enforcement \ngroups tell us over and over again has been neglected.\n  Our amendment ensures that the prevention of terrorist attacks \nreceives significant funds. It would for the first time authorize the \nLaw Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program which funds prevention \nactivities by State and local law enforcement. Under the amendment, 25 \npercent of Homeland Security grant funding would be used for law \nenforcement terrorism prevention, including information sharing, target \nhardening, threat recognition, terrorist intervention activities, \ninteroperable communication, and overtime expenses incurred in support \nof Federal homeland security efforts.\n  The International Association of Chiefs of Police recently released a \nreport that put it very well. They warned:\n\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\n\n       In our national efforts to develop the capacity to respond \n     to and recover from a terrorist attack we have failed to \n     focus on the importance of building our capacity to prevent a \n     terrorist attack in the first place.\n\n  We are never going to be able to protect every single target in this \ncountry. That is why we have to pay attention to the prevention, the \ndetection, the law enforcement side, as well as the response side.\n  Because of our bill's emphasis on terrorism prevention, it has been \nendorsed by the National Association of Police Organizations, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs Of Police, the International Union \nof Police Associations, the National Troopers Coalition, the United \nFederation of Police Officers, the International Brotherhood of Police \nOfficers, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Organization \nof Black Law Enforcement Executives among others.\n  NAPO is the strongest voice supporting law enforcement officers in \nthe United States, representing more than 236,000 sworn law enforcement \nofficers as well as retired officers, and 100,000 citizens who share a \ncommon dedication to fair and effective crime control and law \nenforcement. They, too, have pointed out in a letter to Senator \nLieberman and me that we need to be sure State and local law \nenforcement are properly supported, trained, and equipped to prevent \nterrorism before it occurs.\n  I do not believe we can allocate Homeland Security dollars \neffectively and efficiently unless we listen to and learn from the \nadvice of our law enforcement officers and other first responders. \nGuided by a task force of first responders, the Secretary would \nestablish the essential capabilities I referred to earlier to ensure \nthat first responders have the support they need.\n  Preventing and responding to terrorism is a national challenge, but \npreventing and responding to specific acts of terrorism in the urgency \nof the moment is a regional challenge. We saw this after the September \n11 attack on the Pentagon and in New York City when first responders \nfrom outlying communities rushed in to make invaluable and heroic \ncontributions to the rescue operation.\n\n  We saw it again in simulation at the TOPOFF 3 exercise I observed \nearlier this year with Senator Lieberman. This incident was a simulated \nexplosion and chemical attack at a waterfront festival in New London, \nCT. The contributions by first responders from the outlying smaller \ncommunities were enormous, but their efforts were hampered by a lack of \ninteroperable communications equipment.\n  Senator Lieberman and I saw some first responders who were carrying \nas many as three emergency radios, which slowed the evacuation of those \nwho were playing the injured parties to hospitals throughout the \nregion. In a real attack, these delays--that incompatibility of \nequipment--would have had devastating consequences.\n  Regional planning and coordination are essential, and our amendment \nwould shift the focus of local funding from individual cities to \nmetropolitan regions. Unlike the current Urban Area Security Initiative \nunder which DHS simply announces a list of cities it has selected to \nfund, our amendment would establish an application process for \nmetropolitan region funding.\n  In applying for funding, communities would be given considerable \nflexibility in forming regions that would make the most sense locally. \nOur amendment provides that the regions within the 100 largest \nmetropolitan statistical areas would automatically be eligible to \napply, with additional regions eligible under certain circumstances.\n  Our amendment would also allow for regional coalitions--even those \nspanning multiple States--to apply for grant funding together to \naddress common needs. I think this would lead to real breakthroughs in \nstrategy.\n  Let me give you a concrete example. Several Midwestern States are \njoining together to take steps to prevent and, if necessary, respond to \nacts of agroterrorism. That is exactly the kind of project that our \namendment would provide for and fund. Under current law, these States \ncould not seek funds as a group despite the common threats they face \nand the common solutions they seek. Our amendment breaks out of this \nrigid mold to allow States, counties, cities, tribes, and other \ngovernmental units to think regionally and creatively as they seek to \nprevent and prepare for terrorist attacks.\n  Our amendment would also put the State and local homeland security \nplanning process where it belongs, on the front end. This legislation \nrequires State and local jurisdictions to plan for how funds will be \nspent before the funds arrive. Currently, much of the deliberative \nplanning on how funds will be spent is done on the back end, only after \nDHS has allocated grants to States and urban areas.\n  Moreover--and this actually is another safeguard--our bill would \nrequire States to spend money according to State plans approved by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. More advanced funding means funds will \nbe spent more quickly and according to a coherent strategy.\n  Whenever I meet with first responders, whether it is in my home State \nof Maine or elsewhere, I am always struck by the fact that very few of \nthese brave, dedicated men and women first went into law enforcement, \nfirefighting, or emergency medical services ever thinking they would \nend up on the front lines of a war against terrorism. They have been \nhanded an unprecedented and unimaginable challenge, and they have \naccepted it bravely and willingly. They deserve the equipment, \ntraining, planning, input, accountability, and stability that our \namendment would provide. They deserve to have this critical program \nthat is so essential to the security of our Nation properly authorized, \nfunded, and designed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor with \nChairman Collins of this amendment. I want to speak on its behalf.\n\n\n                       Thanking Senate Colleagues\n\n  Mr. President, I do want to say on a personal matter, very briefly, \nthis is the first day I have returned to the Senate since my mother, \nMarcia Manger Lieberman, left this Earth on June 26. The following week \nI was observing a period of mourning.\n  We were blessed to have Mom live to the age of 90. She taught us a \nlot of lessons throughout life: how faith and family and community \nmatter most. We are going to miss her, of course. But I want to take \nthis moment to thank all my colleagues who reached out to me and my \nfamily, including the occupant of the chair, the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Burr, and my friend and colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins.\n  I thank you and everyone else for your calls and your letters and \nflowers and baskets of food, all of which were a source of great \nstrength and comfort to my family, my sisters and me, and honor the \nmemory of the great lady I was blessed to have as my mom. So I thank \nyou all for that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1142\n\n  Mr. President, Mom, most of all, would say: Life goes on. Every day \nget up and make the most of it. So I am very honored to have the \nopportunity on this day to join with Senator Collins in offering this \namendment.\n  This amendment tracks S. 21, the Homeland Security Grants Enhancement \nAct, which was reported out of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee in April with strong bipartisan support. Senator \nCollins and I believe that the ideas the committee endorsed represent \nthe most balanced, constructive approach to supporting those all across \nAmerica whom we ask to protect the rest of us from harm.\n  This amendment accomplishes many things, including the doubling of \nthe amount of money that will be delivered to States and localities \nmost at risk. It reduces the potential for waste. It authorizes \nadequate funding for our Nation's first responders whom the Senator \nfrom Maine has spoken of so eloquently. It establishes, for the first \ntime, a comprehensive framework for supporting homeland security \nefforts by fully authorizing the essential grants programs that each \nyear have, unfortunately, been left to the whims of the appropriations \nprocess and have left people all across America uncertain.\n\n  These are essential reforms to our grants process, made even more \ncompelling by the knowledge--underscored by last week's bombing in \nLondon--that terrorists are out there, that they\n\n[[Page S7972]]\n\nwill strike, and that we are involved in a world war. It is not like \nany world war before. But this enemy has a mission. It is to destroy as \nmany of us as they can. And they will choose the battlefields, where \nthey will choose them.\n  This amendment responds to that threat in a most direct and sensible \nway. We direct more money to the places that are at greatest risk of \nterrorist attack, that are most vulnerable, and where the consequences \nof an attack would be, obviously, disruptive to the people, to our \neconomic well-being, and to our very way of life. In other words, the \nterrorists obviously strike without regard to the loss of life, \ninnocent life, but they also want to disrupt our society and create \nfear.\n  This amendment responds to that threat in two ways: First, by \nguaranteeing a higher baseline level of funding to the largest and most \ndensely populated States, States that are likely to be at more risk of \nattack and to suffer greater consequences if they are attacked and, \nsecond, by substantially increasing the funds we entrust to the \nHomeland Security Secretary's discretion to allocate based on an \nassessment of risk.\n  A key part of this amendment is also a desire to balance support for \nthose cities and States at high risk without sacrificing the security \nof locations that may not be on the top of a target list today but \ncould very well be in the future. That is because this amendment \nrecognizes what I said a moment ago, that the terrorists aim to break \nour confidence, to create panic, to take advantage of the openness of \nour society. This is a big country. As a result, no matter how good our \nintelligence is, we cannot be certain that in every case--maybe even in \nmost cases--we will be on notice about where the terrorists might \nstrike next.\n  This amendment recognizes the fact that terrorists alter their \nmethods of destruction, of murder, that one day they may strike \nfortified targets such as military facilities, as they have in Iraq and \nin Lebanon, and the next day they may strike soft targets, as they have \nand did when they blew up a discotheque in Indonesia or took hostages \nand brought an end to life at a school in Beslan, Russia.\n  Common sense, therefore, requires us to continue to build basic \ncapacity to prevent and respond to attacks wherever they may occur in \nthis country. And that means everywhere in this country. To build that \ncapacity over time, State and local officials need some predictability \nof funding. They need to know when and how much assistance they are \nlikely to receive from year to year if they are to do what their \ncitizens expect them to do: to plan and carry out the best possible \nhomeland security throughout America. This is a difficult balance to \nreach. But I feel confident that the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee has achieved that balance in this amendment.\n  First, we double the amount of dollars over current levels for grants \nbased on risk. I want to emphasize that because some have criticized \nthe committee action, saying we do not pay attention to the experts' \npredictions of risk. The fact is, we set aside over 60 percent of the \ntotal amount authorized in this measure to distribute to States and \ncities considered to be most vulnerable to a terrorist attack.\n  The rest of the money would be used to guarantee a minimum level of \npreparedness in every State, although more highly or densely populated \nStates would get more money. So each State would be guaranteed a \nminimum of 0.55 percent of the total amount appropriated. The high- and \ndense-population States get a little bit more.\n  Beyond these formula changes, the amendment would streamline the \nState homeland security grant process, require better planning and \ntherefore better spending, and add a dose of reality to the grants \ndistribution process. Unlike the Department's current opaque and \nchangeable approach for distributing the so-called Urban Area Security \nInitiative grants, this amendment, the Collins-Lieberman amendment, \nwould allow metropolitan regions to apply for funding. The 100 largest \nmetropolitan areas could apply. They enter automatically this pool of \neligibles. And others could submit applications with the consent of \ntheir Governor and the Homeland Security Secretary.\n  Each applicant would have an opportunity to make its own case based \non its specific risks, vulnerabilities, and needs. The Department of \nHomeland Security would award the grants based on merit. There would be \nno arbitrary limits on funding to areas that demonstrate they are at \nrisk, such as the population cutoff the Department instituted this past \nyear, saying that if you are not larger than a certain number of people \nyou cannot qualify for the Urban Area Security Initiative, even if you \nhave uniquely vulnerable assets, facilities in that area that in the \nnormal course of exercise of due diligence would require extra support.\n  Our amendment would encourage cooperative planning and execution \nacross jurisdictional lines by allowing at least two contiguous \njurisdictions to submit a regional application. In addition to \ndedicating funding for the largest metropolitan areas in the country, \nour amendment would, for the first time, allow States to apply for \nrisk-based funding and to make the case to the Secretary that there are \nthreats to their jurisdiction that require additional grant money to \naddress.\n  Another critical element of our amendment would be to require the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with \na task force of State and local first responders, to establish what we \ncall essential capabilities--in other words, targets for the levels and \nquality of planning, people, and equipment different types of \ncommunities need to prevent, prepare for, and respond to acts of \nterrorism and other catastrophic events.\n  These essential capabilities will provide guidance to States and \nlocalities, but they also provide benchmarks for measuring State and \nnational progress in achieving preparedness. Other accountability \nmeasures--because we are authorizing a lot of money to be spent here \nfor a good reason, but we are requiring accountability as to how it is \nspent--include, for instance, an annual GAO audit and new, more robust \nreporting requirements for grant recipients and for the Department of \nHomeland Security. This amendment would also give the Secretary the \nauthority to terminate or revoke grants if a recipient doesn't comply \nwith the accompanying requirements.\n  We honor the old proverb that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound \nof cure. That is why, in the very contemporary context of the threat of \nterrorism, our amendment dedicates 25 percent of authorized funds to \nstrengthen law enforcement efforts that are made to prevent attacks \nbefore they occur. We have 700,000 pairs of eyes and ears on the ground \nin every community across this Nation. What am I speaking about? Local \nlaw enforcement officers. They are our foot soldiers, our boots on the \nground in the war on terrorism. But too often, up until now, they have \nbeen left on the sidelines. The brake that stops that next attack on \nNew York, Washington, Los Angeles or any small or mid-size community \nacross America may well come from the alert work of a police officer \nmany thousands of miles away.\n  Senator Collins mentioned some of the small communities across \nAmerica that tragically played critical roles, inadvertently, in all \nthe activity that led up to the September 11 attacks against us. We \nquite simply cannot afford to waste the talents of any law enforcement \nofficer in America. So we have to do what we can to facilitate, \nencourage, and support their vigilance on our behalf.\n  Finally, our amendment authorizes $2.9 billion in funding for fiscal \nyears 2006 and 2007. That is the same level--not higher--as provided in \nfiscal year 2004. Unfortunately, the trend for State homeland security \nfunding is pointing down, not up, even as we understand that the threat \nremains at least as great as it has been up until now, perhaps even \ngreater. But at least a $2.9 billion authorization will send a strong \nmessage that we will provide reliable and consistent funding to get the \njob done at the local level and the State level, that we will not begin \nto chip away at the funds that our allies at the State and local level \ncan expect from the Federal Government.\n  Our amendment improves upon the current approach and upon the \napproach spelled out--I say with respect--in the underlying \nappropriations bill. That is why the Collins-\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\nLieberman amendment has received support, for which the Senator from \nMaine and I are grateful and honored, from the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the International Union of Police Associations, the National \nTroopers Coalition, the National Fire Protection Association, the \nNational Association of Development Organizations, and many others--all \nsupport this amendment. This is an expression of support. Indeed, I \nthink it should be taken as a plea for support by these organizations \nthat represent a broad swath of law enforcement officers at the State \nand local level across America.\n  This amendment is a considered approach to the administration and \ndistribution of homeland security grants. We believe it strikes the \nright balance between not only risk and population, high-risk areas, \naccording to the experts, and other areas that may well be at risk as \nwe go forward, but also risks between providing flexibility and \nensuring accountability. Most importantly, it provides our Nation's \nfirst responders, who are also first preventers in our war against \nterrorism, with a solid, long-term platform of support.\n  It has, once again, been a great pleasure to work with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Collins of Maine, chairman of our committee. We were \ngrateful for the overwhelming bipartisan support of the committee for \nthis measure when it came out of committee as S. 21. We thank our \ncolleagues for that.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut for his excellent statement. We have worked very hard on \nthis issue for the past 3 years. It is my hope that our colleagues will \nrecognize the work that has gone into this measure, whether it is \ncoming up with a fair and balanced--I guess that phrase maybe has \nweight toward it--carefully crafted formula or whether it is the \naccountability measures that are in the bill that I also believe are so \nimportant. Another member of our committee who has been a stalwart \nsupporter of the bill and has worked very hard in shaping many of its \nprovisions from his perspective as a former mayor of a major city is \nour colleague from Minnesota, Senator Coleman. I am very pleased he is \nhere to speak on behalf of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the chairman from \nMaine and the ranking member from Connecticut, for the hard work they \nhave done in working in a bipartisan way and coming up with important, \npractical, commonsense ways to deal with the threats to homeland \nsecurity that deal with the threats to major urban centers, that deal \nwith the opportunity--I want to talk about this a little bit today--and \nthe importance of working on a regional basis.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I represent the Twin Cities. I will talk \na little bit about the Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul, the \nexperience they had dealing with the urban area security initiatives \nunder the present system. The system needs improvement.\n  I rise today to offer my support for the bipartisan amendment offered \nby Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman that will streamline and \nrationalize the State homeland security grant process. My State has a \nwide range of homeland security interests. We share an international \nborder with Canada. We have two major cities in Minneapolis and St. \nPaul. We have two nuclear reactors in Red Wing and Monticello. We have \na major port in the city of Duluth on Lake Superior, connected through \nthe Great Lakes system to the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Atlantic \nOcean.\n  Unfortunately, Minnesota witnessed an average 48-percent reduction in \nthe allocation of Federal homeland security dollars for this year. In \naddition, when the urban security initiative grants were first \nannounced, Minneapolis's funding was cut from $12.2 million to $5.7 \nmillion, and St. Paul's funding was completely eliminated. I am not \nhere to complain about cuts in funding. I am here to raise concerns \nabout the present system, as my colleague from Connecticut discussed, \nhow opaque and changeable it is, and the difficulty of urban centers in \nplanning to meet homeland security needs.\n  As my colleague from Maine indicated, I am a former mayor. I had \nhands-on involvement in this process. You need a greater measure of \ncertainty. When you talk about communities such as Minneapolis-St. \nPaul, it is important to understand that you are dealing with regional \nconcerns, that you cannot cut out one city because it is slightly \nsmaller in size than the other city. I grew up on the east coast. I \nmoved to the Midwest 31 years ago. When I moved to the Midwest, when I \nmoved to St. Paul 1976, my mom, who was still in Brooklyn, thought the \nTwin Cities were Minneapolis and Indianapolis. She didn't realize it \nwas Minneapolis and St. Paul. I excuse my mom. She didn't spend a lot \nof time out of Brooklyn in those days. But I expect more from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. And in 2004 and 2005, anyone who looks \nat a map knows the Twin Cities and understands they work hand in hand. \nThey are regional centers. They are divided by the Mississippi River, \nbut they are connected essentially. They share a bus system, an \nairport, a land grant university. They both have significant major fire \ndepartments that coordinate with each other, particularly in dealing \nwith issues of hazardous materials. The two cities work together on \nresponses for infectious disease outbreaks and other public health \nthreats.\n  Fortunately, the Department of Homeland Security, after much concern \nwas raised by the process this year, granted St. Paul eligibility to \nshare in Minneapolis's funding for this year. I don't think you can \nhave effective homeland security when cities endure wild fluctuations \nin funding such as the 71-percent reduction the Twin Cities face this \nyear. So the Collins-Lieberman amendment makes common sense, practical \nchanges to the homeland security grant process to ensure continuity and \naccountability in terms of money distributed to States and cities.\n  Again, you can't do homeland security well if you are involved in a \nprocess that is opaque, that is changeable, that is prone to the wild \nfluctuations. This amendment wisely encourages regional cooperation by \nmoving the focus of local funding from individual cities to \nmetropolitan regions. Again, the Twin Cities are an ideal example of \nthat. The reality is that, God forbid we faced a major terrorist attack \nin the Twin Cities or in one of the surrounding suburban areas, the \nMall of America, one of the largest tourist attractions in the United \nStates, 35 million people a year right outside the Twin Cities, if that \nwere ever subject to a terrorist attack, clearly the departments of \nMinneapolis and St. Paul would be responding to those concerns. That is \nthe world in which we live. We cannot isolate ourselves and live in \nlittle bubbles anymore. So the importance of focusing on the regional \nlevel reflects the reality of the world in which we live and the \ngeographical reality, and it simply makes sense.\n  Under the new formula, communities are given considerable flexibility \nin forming regions that make the most sense locally. I would encourage \nother areas such as Minneapolis-St. Paul to do that, to understand that \nit is important to be able to combine resources, to maximize resources \nto deal with common threats to the region. Within the amendment, a \nregion must be made up of two or more neighboring municipalities, \ncounties, parishes or Indian tribes and must include the largest city \nin the metropolitan area. This will enable cities such as Minneapolis \nand St. Paul to be considered as one region rather than separate \nentities and benefit from the same funding stream. This makes sense.\n  For our Nation to be prepared, all States must be able to meet a \nbasic level of preparedness. This amendment will double the funds that \nwould be distributed based on threat, risk, and need while maintaining \na predictable and meaningful level of funding for each State.\n  A predictable stream of funding is critical for States and local and \ntribal jurisdictions to embark on a long-term strategy of preparedness. \nThat is the path we are on in a world in which we are so much more \nvulnerable. We need to plan as well as we can--plan for the long term--\nand to have a strategy of\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\npreparedness and to encourage cities and municipalities, counties, \nparishes, and Indian tribes to work together to meet the threats that \nare out there.\n  We currently require States to submit 3-year plans to the Department \nof Homeland Security and it is unrealistic to expect States to \neffectively plan ahead without providing some certainty on the funding \nthey should expect to receive.\n  This amendment also creates new audit provisions, requires mandatory \nreporting, coordination among grant programs at different Federal \nagencies, and that individual expenditures be tied to achieving \nnationally established essential capabilities. So we are tying funding \nto meeting needs that are out there, tying funding to maximizing \ncoordination, tying funding to achieving certain levels of \npreparedness. Tying spending to achieving national preparedness goals \nand holding States accountable to how funds are spent will prevent \nwasteful expenditures on other items that are not needed. Homeland \nsecurity funding is not simply about getting more equipment in a \nFederal agency; it is not a Christmas tree; it is meeting needs. What \nwe have in this amendment is to measure and make sure spending is tied \nto meeting the levels of preparedness and effectiveness. Requiring \ncoordination among different Federal grant programs for first \nresponders will prevent recipients from purchasing duplicative or \nincompatible equipment or training. The bottom line is that homeland \nsecurity dollars will be spent more wisely and effectively, and that is \nwhat we should be doing.\n  This amendment is a great step forward in terms of contributing funds \non a regional basis and ensuring that communities have the tools they \nneed to work together to provide greater security for their residents. \nI look forward to supporting this amendment today and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Collins and Lieberman that would provide for \nhomeland security grant coordination and simplification. I wish to \nthank them both for working with me and the other Members of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs to include a provision in their amendment \nthat is very important to Indian Country.\n  This amendment is based on S. 21, the Homeland Security Grant \nEnhancement Act, a bill that was reported out of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee favorably and of which I am an \noriginal cosponsor. S. 21 recognizes that no State is immune to \nterrorist attack by requiring that each State receive at minimum .55 \npercent of appropriated funding. This is important to States like \nHawaii that are smaller in population, but still have critical assets \nthat need to be protected.\n  The Collins-Lieberman amendment also ensures that Indian tribes have \naccess to homeland security funding. With more than 50 million acres of \nland comprising Indian Country, which includes dams, hydroelectric \nfacilities, nuclear power generating plants, oil and gas pipelines, \ntransportation corridors of railroad and highway systems, and \ncommunications towers, tribal governments need to have funds to protect \nand respond to threats of terrorism. Although the Homeland Security Act \nof 2002 included tribal governments in the definition of ``local \ngovernments,'' this distinction has not guaranteed that tribal \ngovernments are consulted or involved in the protection of the United \nStates. Nor does the act ensure that Indian Country will receive \ncritical information regarding potential terrorist threats, and more \nimportantly, the act does not give tribal governments the authority to \ndetain potential terrorists who are found in Indian Country.\n  While the amendment does not fully address the homeland security \nproblems that some tribal governments are experiencing, it is a \nbipartisan compromise that at the very least will ensure that Indian \ntribes with critical homeland security needs will be able to apply \ndirectly to the Department of Homeland Security for risk-based homeland \nsecurity grants.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues recognize that tribes should have the \nsame access to homeland security funding as the rest of the country. \nThis is an important first step for Indian Country to address homeland \nsecurity issues.\n  Again, I thank Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman for their work \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Thursday, a series of four explosions \nstruck the heart of London during the morning rush hour. At least 49 \ninnocent victims were killed and 700 others were injured. A previously \nunknown group called the ``secret group of al-Qaida's jihad'' in Europe \nclaimed responsibility in the name of al-Qaida for the attacks.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate and the American people, we express our \nheartfelt condolences to the victims, their families, and to the \nBritish people, our cousins across the Atlantic. We share in your grief \nand in your determination to hunt down the criminals who carried out \nthis despicable act. We consider the attack last week on British soil \nan attack on the civilized world. We stand with the British people just \nas they have long stood with us.\n  For nearly two centuries, the United States and the United Kingdom \nhave enjoyed a special relationship. We speak the same language. We \nshare a heritage of freedom and our economies are inexorably \nintertwined. Our militaries, our intelligence services, our great \ncorporations, and our distinguished universities share deep \nrelationships. Today, our forces fight side by side in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, sharing the sacrifices and the victories.\n  As we learned on 9/11, our enemies are coldblooded killers who \ndeliberately target innocent victims--women and men on their way to \nwork, schoolchildren starting the new school year, and vacationers at \nthe beach.\n  Our enemies pervert religion. They despise freedom. They seek to \noverthrow regimes and dominate the world. But as they learned on 9/11, \nAmerica, the United Kingdom, and the free people of the world will not \nstand by. We are taking the fight to their soil, to their caves, to \ntheir hideouts. We are disrupting their terror cells and financing \noperations. We are strengthening our homeland defenses and sharing \ninformation among intelligence agencies and nations.\n  Brave men and women are working every day to thwart the enemy, to \nfind him and bring him to justice. But as President Bush observed \ntoday, the terrorists need to be right only once. Free nations tend to \nbe right 100 percent of the time. They need to be. And the best way to \ndefeat the enemy is to stay on the offense.\n  We will call upon the international community to renew and strengthen \nits efforts to defeat the terrorists, dismantle their networks, and to \ndrain the swamps of injustice, oppression, poverty, and extremism that \nfeed their hateful ideology.\n  In the war on terror, we will not stop. We will not waiver. We will \nstand united against the enemies of freedom. And whatever it takes, \nwherever it takes us, we will win.\n  Mr. President, under the previous agreement, we will now have a \nmoment of silence in memory of those whose lives were lost.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will recognize 1 minute of silence.\n  (The Senate observed a moment of silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nconsider S. Res. 193.

Res. 193\n\n       Whereas the United States and a broad international \n     coalition have been engaged in a Global War on Terrorism \n     since the terrorist attacks in Washington, D.C., New York, \n     and Pennsylvania that occurred on September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas the people and Governments of the United States and \n     the United Kingdom enjoy a deep and enduring friendship \n     undergirded by shared history, language, and values;\n       Whereas the United Kingdom has been a strong and steadfast \n     ally to the United States through two World Wars, the Cold \n     War, the Gulf War, and the Global War on Terrorism, including \n     the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       Whereas terrorists have planned and conducted attacks \n     around the world during the four years after the Global War \n     on Terrorism began in 2001, most notably the bombing of a \n     night club on the Indonesian island of Bali on October 12, \n     2002 that killed 202 people and injured an additional 209, \n     the bombings of two synagogues and the British Embassy in \n     Istanbul, Turkey in November 2003, in which 56 people were \n     killed and over 450 injured, and the bombing of the train \n     system in Madrid, Spain on March 11, 2004 that killed more \n     than 190 people and injured approximately 1,500;\n       Whereas on July 7, 2005, a series of four explosions struck \n     the London public transportation system during the morning \n     rush hour, killing at least 49 innocent civilians and \n     injuring approximately 700 others;\n       Whereas a previously unknown terrorist group claimed \n     responsibility for the attacks in the name of al Qaeda;\n       Whereas the terrorist attacks in London coincided with the \n     opening of the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, a Summit \n     committed to bringing help and hope to the poorest countries \n     of the world;\n       Whereas President Bush immediately condemned the terrorist \n     attacks and extended the ``heartfelt condolences'' of the \n     people of the United States to the people of the United \n     Kingdom;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed, on behalf of the \n     United Kingdom and the world leaders attending the G-8 Summit \n     in Gleneagles, Scotland, to remain steadfast and strong in \n     the fight against terrorism, stating, ``All of our countries \n     have suffered from the impact of terrorism. Those responsible \n     have no respect for human life. We are united in our resolve \n     to confront and defeat this terrorism that is not an attack \n     on one nation, but all nations and on civilized people \n     everywhere. . . . It's important . . . that those engaged in \n     terrorism realize that our determination to defend our values \n     and our way of life is greater than their determination to \n     cause death and destruction to innocent people in a desire to \n     impose extremism on the world'', and declared, ``We shall \n     prevail, and [the terrorists] shall not'';\n       Whereas the North Atlantic Council, the governing body of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, after meeting in an \n     extraordinary session, reaffirmed the determination of the \n     members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to combat \n     the scourge of terrorism and defend the values of freedom, \n     tolerance, and democracy using all available means;\n       Whereas world leaders attending the G-8 Summit in \n     Gleneagles, Scotland expressed condolences to the people of \n     the United Kingdom and issued a joint statement to ``condemn \n     utterly these barbaric attacks''; and\n       Whereas Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking on behalf of \n     the world leaders attending the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, \n     Scotland, declared, ``We are united in the resolve'' to \n     defeat terrorism, which is ``not an attack on one nation, but \n     on all nations'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses deepest sympathies and condolences to the \n     people of the United Kingdom and the victims and their \n     families for the heinous terrorist attacks that occurred in \n     London on July 7, 2005;\n       (2) condemns these barbaric and unwarranted attacks on the \n     innocent people of London;\n       (3) expresses strong and continued solidarity with the \n     people of the United Kingdom and pledges to remain shoulder-\n     to-shoulder with the people of the United Kingdom to bring \n     the terrorists responsible for these brutal attacks to \n     justice; and\n       (4) calls upon the international community to renew and \n     strengthen efforts to--\n       (A) defeat terrorists by dismantling terrorist networks and \n     exposing the violent and nihilistic ideology of terrorism;\n       (B) increase international cooperation to advance personal \n     and religious freedoms, ethnic and racial tolerance, \n     political liberty and pluralism, and economic prosperity; and\n       (C) combat the social injustice, oppression, poverty, and \n     extremism that breeds terrorism.\n  (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on the way from California to \nWashington this morning, my plane had engine trouble, and I had to \nreturn to California. As a result, I was not able to make the vote on \nthe resolution condemning the terrorist bombings in London last week \nand expressing sympathy for the people of the United Kingdom.\n  Had I been present, I would certainly have voted for the resolution. \nI hope that it serves to strengthen our resolve to go after the \nterrorists and to do everything we can to protect the people of the \nUnited States, particularly by doing more to secure our rail and \ntransit systems.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate that inadequacies in \n border protection and alien and drug smugglers' methods, routes, and \n   modes of transportation are potential vulnerabilities that can be \n   exploited by terrorists to illegally smuggle terrorists and their \n   weapons into the United States, surveillance of the entire border \nbetween the United States and Mexico is essential to protect the United \n States, and the Mexican Government must commit to addressing its own \n  domestic border security policies, which contribute to the present \n            inadequacies in our Nation's homeland security)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING BORDER SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The illegal alien population has risen from 3,200,000 \n     in 1986 to 10,300,000 in 2004.\n       (2) In fiscal year 2001, United States Border Patrol agents \n     apprehended almost 1,200,000 persons for illegally entering \n     the United States.\n       (3) Senate Report 109-083 states, ``there are an estimated \n     11,000,000 illegal aliens in the United States, including \n     more than 400,000 individuals who have absconded, walking \n     away with impunity from Orders of Deportation and Removal''.\n       (4) Between 1,000 and 3,000 special interest aliens from \n     countries with an active terrorist presence enter the United \n     States each year.\n       (5) Of the 1,200,000 illegal aliens apprehended on the \n     border between the United States and Mexico, 643 were from \n     countries with known terrorism ties, including Syria, Iran, \n     and Libya.\n       (6) Senate Report 109-083 states, ``officials of the \n     Department of Homeland Security have conceded the United \n     States does not have operational control of its borders'', \n     including areas along the 1,989-mile southwest border between \n     the United States and Mexico.\n       (7) The daily attempts to cross the border by thousands of \n     illegal aliens from countries around the globe continue to \n     present a threat to United States national security.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) this Nation cannot thoroughly address the security of \n     the United States without recognizing the reality of \n     terrorists taking advantage of inadequacies in border \n     security along the border between the United States and \n     Mexico;\n       (2) every effort should be made to increase the technology \n     and efficiency in preventing these individuals from entering \n     the United States across the Mexican border;\n       (3) the Mexican Government has an obligation to secure its \n     side of the border between the United States and Mexico; and\n       (4) the Mexican Government must commit to addressing \n     inadequacies in its own domestic and border security \n     policies, which are contributing to the present dilemma in \n     border security.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I express my appreciation to the subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Gregg of New Hampshire. It is my understanding from the \nchairman that it has been agreed to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe the Senator can ask unanimous \nconsent for approval.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1070) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, the amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill dealing with \nborder security. I commend the subcommittee chairman on the tremendous \ninvestment this bill makes in homeland security and in border security \nto the United States of America.\n  A few months ago when I made one of the first speeches in the Senate \nwith regard to the floor supplemental, I talked a little bit about REAL \nID and what is the largest single domestic issue in the United States \ntoday, illegal immigration.\n  In that particular speech I made a note that I love our system of \nimmigration, love the fact you can come to this country and become a \ncitizen--I am a second-generation American myself--but we have been \nflooded as a nation over the past decade by a tremendous influx of \nthose who have come illegally, many over the border of the south, \nalthough obviously to the north as well.\n  This goes a long way toward providing the funding to Customs and to \nImmigration to begin enforcing laws on the books, making it tougher to \ncome into the United States the wrong way and hopefully making it \neasier to come to the United States the right way, the legal way.\n  We need a partner on our southern border. The sense-of-the-Senate \namendment is very simple. It simply asks the Government of Mexico to \nassist in helping to secure the border between the United States and \nMexico to ensure that those who immigrate into this country are coming \nin consistent with the laws of the United States of America.\n  We have a great trading partner to the south. We have a great \nneighbor to the south. We have a country that shares many common \ninterests. We have a country that we enjoy being our neighbor. We also \nwould like for them to be our partner in seeing to it that the border \nwe share is secure so that those who are crossing are crossing legally \nand consistent with the laws of that nation.\n  I thank the subcommittee chairman for his cooperation. I thank the \nSenate for agreeing to this amendment. I am pleased we can express this \nsense of the Senate that the common interest of\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\nboth countries is in the best interests of America when it comes to the \nborder security between ourselves and the country of Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors of the Collins-Lieberman amendment No. \n1142: Senator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nHarkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. This is in addition to the cosponsors previously cited.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the fiscal year \n2006 Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  Protecting the security of our people and our homeland is the most \nimportant responsibility that any Member of this body possesses. It is, \ntherefore, our solemn obligation to review this bill carefully and make \ncertain it adequately addresses our Nation's vulnerabilities.\n  The question should be, Have we done all that we can do to make \nAmerica safe? Now, obviously, none of us can look into the minds, the \nperverted minds of the terrorists and know everything they might do to \nharm us or people around the world, as we saw again in London last \nweek. But I think we do have an obligation to do all we can. Does that \nmean even after we do it there will never be an attack? Of course not. \nBut we have to try, to the best of our human ability, to protect our \ncitizens and make our Nation safe by deterring, detecting, and \npreventing terrorist attacks.\n  I believe--and I am sure many of my colleagues would agree--that to \nmake America truly safe we need to carefully allocate our homeland \nsecurity resources. We need to make sure the money we appropriate in \nCongress gets to where it is most needed; that the American cities, \nStates and places that are under the greatest threat, that are most \nvulnerable, receive the funding they need to be protected.\n  I have advocated for threat-based allocation of homeland security \nfunds for several years now. Last year, the 9/11 Commission made a very \nspecific recommendation. It urged Congress to base Federal funding for \nemergency preparedness solely--solely--on risks and vulnerabilities.\n  Over the last 4 years, the Department of Homeland Security and its \nagencies have provided $11.3 billion to State and local governments to \nprevent, prepare for, and respond to acts of terrorism. Additionally, \n$3.2 billion in grants and other assistance provided by other Federal \nagencies has also gone to State and local responders to take on the \nterrorist threat.\n  Unfortunately, nearly half of this $14.5 billion has been allocated \naccording to congressionally mandated formulas that bear little \nrelation to need, risk, vulnerability, or threat.\n  Last September, when the Senate took up consideration of the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, I offered an \namendment to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to allocate \nformula-based grants to State and local governments based on an \nassessment of threats and vulnerabilities, in accordance with the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  Although the amendment was tabled, I am thankful, as are I am sure \nmillions of my fellow Americans who live in high-threat communities, \nthat the President has finally heard our concerns. He proposed, in the \nfiscal year 2006 budget, a restructuring of $2.6 billion in grants for \nStates, urban areas, and infrastructure protection. Under the \nPresident's proposal, DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, will \ntarget grants to fill critical gaps in State and local terrorism \nprevention and preparedness capabilities, taking into consideration \nthreats and vulnerabilities.\n  While I am not completely satisfied with the formula--of course I \ncould not be, representing New York, which remains, by all the \nintelligence we are privy to, the No. 1 target of the terrorists in our \ncountry--I am pleased by the recognition of the President and Secretary \nChertoff that we are now called upon to look at threat-based funding. \nThat is indeed welcome news.\n  While this bill we are considering makes important steps toward \nsecuring our homeland, there are certainly some deficiencies that we \ncannot afford to ignore. Last week's tragic events in London \nhighlighted one of our Nation's most glaring homeland security \ndeficiencies--the vulnerability of our rail and transit systems.\n  We have seen these senseless, evil terrorist attacks in Japan, \nRussia, Spain, and now England. These attacks, like the one that struck \nour own country on 9/11, hit when innocent people were going about \ntheir everyday lives. All of these cowardly acts were not merely \nattacks on individuals but an attack on a way of life.\n  These attacks on the subway and transit systems around the world are \na clear signal to this Congress that we have to fill this glaring hole \nin our national security budget.\n  Now, our resolve to stand against these acts of terrorism will not \nwaiver. But courage and determination is not enough. We must also \ncommit, with equal force, to developing a comprehensive plan and \nallocating adequate resources to guard against similar attacks in our \nown cities and States.\n  I know there are some who argue against increasing the funding for \nhomeland security because they say: Well, we can't possibly guard \nagainst every risk and vulnerability. I read a comment by one think \ntank pundit who said: We can't childproof our Nation.\n  Well, childproofing a home when a new baby arrives is something I \ntake very seriously. I think most parents do as well. We go out and we \nbuy those little plugs to put into outlets. We move to a higher shelf \nhousehold cleaners and poisons. We go out and maybe buy one of those \nlittle gates to put at the top and bottom of stairs. We obviously take \nsteps to childproof our homes.\n  Starting in the 1970s, responsible parents got some help from the \nFederal Government, which, looking at the evidence, determined that a \nlot of children were getting into the prescription pills of their \nparents and suffering severe injury, even death. So along came the \nchildproof top that made it very difficult for little hands to open \nthose dangerous pill bottles. And other steps were taken so that \nresponsible parents could have some control over the circumstances in \ntheir homes and in their communities that their children would face.\n  Does that mean every risk facing every child was eliminated? Of \ncourse not. But we saved a lot of lives. We protected a lot of \nchildren. We provided a lot of peace of mind to many mothers and \nfathers.\n  So when somebody in a kind of offhand, critical way says, ``What do \nthese people expect when they call for more money for rail and transit \nsecurity or for border security or for chemical plant security? They \nare trying to childproof the Nation,'' I view that as an ignorant \ninsult. Of course we are trying to protect our Nation. That is our \nhighest obligation. We know we cannot protect against everything, but \nwe have to do all we can to make sure every community is as protected \nas we can make it.\n  We know from every expert who has looked at rail and transit security \nthat we are woefully underfunding it. In fact, based on the research \nand analysis I have seen, it would take approximately $7 billion to \nprotect across this country the tens of millions of people who use our \nmass transit systems--our subways, our buses, our trains, our ferries--\nevery single day to get back and forth to work, to go about their daily \nlives.\n  We know millions of Americans use this because they have to. It is \nconvenient. It is inexpensive. It fills their needs. In New York, we \nhave millions and millions of New Yorkers who ride the bus and the \nsubway and the ferries and the trains every single day. So when the \ntragedy struck in London, it was again a tragic wakeup call for our own \ncountry.\n  I know we cannot provide all the funding that many of us believe is \nnecessary to take the steps required to protect our transit systems. \nBut we certainly must do more than the $100 million currently in the \nSenate bill. I am grateful the Senate majority leader has recognized \nthe bill's reduction from last year's $150 million to $100 million was \na step in the wrong direction and that at a minimum we need to restore \nthe $50 million that was cut.\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\n  If we look at how much money has been spent on airline security, we \nfind it totals $18 billion. We all know that following the attacks of \n9/11, spending that money on airline security was absolutely necessary. \nSome of it went a little overboard--people who have no profile of \nfitting any kind of terrorist identity being strip-searched or being \nstopped or people going through all the security--but we spent that \nmoney because we knew we had to deter those people who might wish us \nill by using our air against us.\n  We simply cannot continue to shortchange rail and transit security. \nMore people are riding our transit systems than ride our airplanes and \ncommercial aviation.\n  Last October, the Senate passed the Rail Security Act of 2004. The \nbill was introduced by Senator McCain, and I was proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor. That bill would have authorized Amtrak and New York \nto receive over $570 million to upgrade the six tunnels for better \nventilation, electrical and fire safety technology upgrades, emergency \ncommunications and lighting systems, and emergency access and egress \nfor passengers.\n  A couple of years ago I stood right in this spot with pictures of \nwhat the tunnels in New York look like. We now know one of the \nexplosions in London took place in Kings Cross. The rescue workers have \nnot even been able to get there yet. They are not even sure they have \nrecovered all of the bodies.\n  We will learn from this horrible tragedy, and we will be able to do \nan even better job in what we need to do to protect tunnels and bridges \nand other essential infrastructure for our rail and transit systems. \nBut I am bewildered because the $150 million we appropriated last year \nfor rail and transit security has not yet been fully distributed by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to the cities and the States that need \nit. Instead of being put to work on behalf of improved safety in our \nrail and transit systems, it is sitting on the ledgers of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  We need to spend that money, and we need to be smart about how we \nspend it. But the plans that city and State transit systems have \ndeveloped can't be implemented if the Federal Government doesn't do its \npart.\n  I hope, as we consider the Homeland Security appropriations bill this \nweek, we will support the amendments that increase funding for securing \nour Nation's rail and transit systems. I hope we will do so because it \nis the right thing to do and because the bombings last Thursday in \nLondon were such a tragic reminder of what we still need to do to \nprotect our own homeland from senseless and barbaric actions of \nextremists.\n  I am proud to join Senators Shelby, Sarbanes, Inouye, Reed, and other \ncolleagues in an amendment to add over $1.3 billion in additional rail \nand transit security grants. I am absolutely confident that our Nation \nis up to the task of securing our mass transit systems. I am absolutely \nconfident that this body is capable of dedicating the resources \nnecessary to get this essential job done. I hope this week proves that \nwe are ready, we are willing, and we are able to do everything possible \nto protect our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to add a comment or two to our \ncolleague from New York. I believe in the fiscal year 2005 \nappropriations bill, which is currently in effect, there was about $150 \nmillion that could be used for improving transit and rail security. I \nbelieve, as of last week, none of that money had been allocated. I hope \nthat is not true, but that is what I have been briefed by my staff. \nNone of that $150 million has been allocated. One has to wonder what it \ntakes. I fear that it may take some tragedy to really get our \nattention, the attention of the executive branch to begin allocating \nthe money and putting it where it can do the most good most promptly.\n  As I understand it, the administration has asked for no appropriation \nin their budget proposal for fiscal 2006 for rail security and transit \nsecurity. The committee has put in $100 million for that purpose, and I \nbelieve the committee has agreed to raise it to the current level of \nappropriation of $150 million. But if the administration is not going \nto spend the money, what good does it do for us to allocate. It is very \ndisappointing. I hope it is not true, but I am afraid it probably is.\n  I thank my colleague for bringing this to our attention and join her \nin saying we can do a lot better and we have to.\n  Some time tomorrow, we are going to have the opportunity to vote on \nseveral options for allocating aid to first responders in our 50 \nStates, firefighters, police, paramedics, and others who are first on \nthe scene. When tragedy strikes and that tragedy happens to be a strike \nlaunched by terrorists, they will be the first to be there, whether it \nis Delaware, Missouri, New York, or any other State.\n  I rise to express my strong support for an amendment that is going to \nbe offered tomorrow by Senators Collins and Lieberman. That amendment \nseeks to streamline the system for distributing first responder aid to \nStates, tries to make the system more fair, and seeks to ensure that \nevery State, large or small, receives the funding that may be needed to \nrespond to terrorist attacks and to other disasters.\n  Senator Collins and I have been working with Senator Lieberman and \nother members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on this issue for some time. In fact, Senator Collins and I \nfirst introduced legislation on this topic more than 2 years ago. That \noriginal bill came after a series of hearings we held in our committee, \nhighlighting the fact that the way we help States prepare for disasters \nsimply makes little sense. The application process is lengthy and \nconfusing. More importantly, the funding formula simply isn't getting \nmoney to those who need it the most.\n  States, counties, cities, and first responders all told us in one \nvoice that we need to do something about it. Much of what Senator \nCollins and I and our colleagues did in that initial legislation a \ncouple years ago to respond to the concerns is reflected in the \namendment that will be offered tomorrow by Senators Collins and \nLieberman.\n  That amendment mirrors in many respects the bill that Senator Collins \nand I introduced 2 years ago. For example, the amendment streamlines \nthe grant application process. It creates a one-stop shop within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security where State officials and others can \nseek grant information. It also ensures that funds are distributed as \nquickly as possible and requires States to go through a planning \nprocess that would include both localities and first responders.\n\n  In addition, we take steps in this amendment to give States more \nflexibility in spending their first responder aid. Not every State is \nthe same. Missouri's needs may be different than Delaware's. This \namendment, as with our earlier bill, gives States the ability to ask \nfor a waiver from the Department. If they want to use a little more \nmoney for training or equipment or exercises or planning, they can go \nto the Department and ask for a waiver to do so. One size does not fit \nall. This amendment, such as our earlier bill, acknowledges that.\n  Funding formulas are akin to what they used to say about beauty. \nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder. The beauty of a funding formula \nis oftentimes in the eye of the particular State that is eyeing the \nformula. I believe we have gone a long way toward addressing the \nconcerns that some of our colleagues from more populous States have \nraised over the years. There were concerns among a number of Senators, \nboth on and off the Homeland Security Committee, that the current \nprogram in our original legislation directed too much aid to smaller \nStates, to less populated States, at the expense of larger States or \nmore populated States and high-threat urban areas. I believe we have \naddressed those concerns.\n  A version of this amendment that was added by a unanimous vote to the \nintelligence reform bill last year provide additional allocations to \nthe dozen or so largest States in the country. It also allowed the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to distribute a portion of the funding \nmade available for State grants directly to the most at-risk urban \nareas. We go even further this year, further than some of the \nsupporters of our original legislation might like to have gone. In an \neffort to shift even more funding to those parts\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\nof the country most at risk, Senator Collins, Senator Lieberman, and \nthe rest of us who support their amendment have negotiated a new \nfunding formula that actually reduces the baseline allocation or the \nso-called small State minimum guaranteed to every State.\n  Currently in the bill, it is 0.75-percent minimum for every State. \nThe amendment that will be offered tomorrow by Senators Collins and \nLieberman and myself and others would take that minimum down to 0.55 \npercent. We have also added language in this amendment that gives the \nSecretary the discretion to allocate up to half of the available funds \nto big cities. In total, these efforts have resulted in what I think is \na balanced formula that I am told allocates about twice as much aid on \nrisk as we did in last year's appropriations bill.\n  There will be some who will argue that the baseline allocation in \nthis amendment should be even smaller or that it should not exist at \nall. I respond to that argument by simply pointing out that my own home \nState of Delaware may be small. We may have a small population--about \n800,000 people, in fact. That is more than about six States that are, \nfrankly, bigger than us in size have. But Delaware is home to \nsignificant critical infrastructure such as chemical facilities, oil \nrefineries, and one of the most important ports in the country, and \nthose could be unfortunately on a terrorist target list.\n  Right across the Delaware River, about 15 miles from my home, are two \nnuclear powerplants. Up and down the northeast corridor we have I-95 \ncarrying, each day, hundreds of thousands of cars, trucks and vans, \nincluding trucks carrying some dangerous material. We have the \nnortheast rail corridor through which some of our largest freight \nrailroads pass, again carrying all kinds of cargo, goods, including \nsome which are hazardous, potentially a target to terrorists. We have \nthe Delaware River, the Delaware Bay. Every day dozens of ships go up \nand down the Delaware River, any number of which carry cargo that could \nbe considered hazardous.\n  My staff and I have talked to any number of public safety officials \nin Delaware. Here is what they tell us. They tell us that they are not \ngetting the resources they need to enable them to respond to incidents \nthat the Department of Homeland Security itself has told us have a real \npossibility of happening in our State. I am sure many of my colleagues \nfrom States large and small could share similar stories with us, and \nthey probably will during the course of this debate. That is one reason \nwhy we need to approve this amendment.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support this compromise amendment. It \ndoes the best job of any proposal that I have seen at getting the most \nat-risk parts of our country the first responder aid that they need \nwithout arbitrarily shortchanging smaller States like Delaware that may \nbe small in size but the risk profile belies the modest size in \npopulation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1129\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to address the VA health care \nsystem's funding crisis. I thank my colleague, the Democratic leader, \nSenator Reid, for his determination to ensure that $1.5 billion is \nprovided as soon as possible. At this point, it is widely known that VA \nis facing a tremendous funding shortfall this year. What we need to do \nnow is ensure that VA gets these funds as expeditiously as possible.\n  I am glad the administration has admitted that there is a shortfall. \nBut I point out that VA officials have proven themselves to be an \nunreliable source of information. And judging by the supplemental sent \nforward by the President, they are less than generous, and frankly, \nless than accurate. The $975 million now proposed by the \nadministration--and carried forward by the House--falls short of \naddressing all of VA's problems.\n  You need only look at the administration's own estimate for new costs \nassociated with returning service members. VA now believes that 103,000 \nmore veterans will be treated this year. The cost of treating this kind \nof patient is $5,437 a year, as documented by VA data. Yet, the \nadministration wants to now convince us that, in fact, the cost of \ntreating a patient is less than half of this amount. Again, using VA \ndata, the cost of caring for an additional 103,000 returning veterans \nis $560 million and not the $273 million suggested by the \nadministration. Other key programs such as readjustment counseling and \ndental care were also not sufficiently covered by the House in the VA \nsupplemental.\n  It is imperative that we make sure the funds we provide now are truly \nsufficient, so we do not face this situation again. It is simply not \nright to use out-of-date equipment to treat veterans or force them to \nwait months for care.\n  The Senate has already spoken in a very bipartisan manner on this \nissue. We are all very proud of our effort to arrive at the $1.5 \nbillion figure previously agreed to before the July Fourth recess. \nGiven the House's work to provide less than the full amount needed, it \nis clear that we have more work to do for this year.\n  The battle for next year's funding will be upon us shortly. During \nthe budget resolution debate in March, I offered an amendment to \nincrease VA's funding by $2.8 billion for next year. I stood before \nthis body and outlined the case for a significant increase for VA. But \nwe were rejected because the administration claimed VA needed far less. \nYet we are back to square one with regard to next year's funding.\n  Then, again, during the war supplemental debate in April--while VA \nremained silent as they were beginning to see warning signs--we were \ndefeated in our efforts to secure more funding for this year. Again, \nthis was because the administration failed to be forthcoming about the \nstruggles that VA providers and patients were facing.\n  Hopefully, we all learned a clear lesson from this experience, that \ncommunicating with health care providers in the field and with the \nVeterans Service Organizations is invaluable. They told us what was \nreally going on months ago.\n  I know my colleagues agree that we do not want to see this scenario \nrepeat itself yet again. We have pressed this issue, and now we have \nanother opportunity to finally fix the problem and fulfill our promise \nto this Nation's veterans. At the very least, this crisis has resulted \nin longer waiting times for care, hiring freezes, and delayed upgrading \nof medical equipment and facilities, to name a few.\n  This amendment is one way to fix the VA funding crisis. Providing \n$1.5 billion in supplemental funding would ensure that each region of \nthe country can get the funds needed to pull themselves out of the \ncurrent crisis.\n  But I continue to be open to any approach that ensures the highest \nquality health care for our Nation's veterans. Along those lines, I \nappreciate the work that Senators Craig and Hutchison and our other \ncolleagues are doing to tackle this problem. I believe we can find a \nsolution, together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak \ntherein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Sexual Predators\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a poster that shows what I \ndiscovered on the Internet in North Dakota. I discovered this in the \nmonth of April. I was going to have a meeting in Fargo and, just out of \ncuriosity, I called up the North Dakota registry of sex offenders, to \nfind out who was living within 2 miles of where I was having the \nmeeting, at city hall in Fargo, ND. In the briefing book I had, I \ndescribed this fellow to the people who came. His name is Joseph \nDuncan. The entire country knows of Joseph Duncan now. When I described \nMr. Duncan, many people in the area didn't know him.\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\n  This sheet from the North Dakota Attorney General's Office, Bureau of \nCriminal Investigation, shows that Joseph Duncan was living in Fargo, \nND. He was a sexual predator, and he had served a 20-year prison \nsentence for a first-degree rape. In 1980, he raped a 14-year-old boy \nat gunpoint, burned the victim, and made the victim believe he was \ngoing to be killed by firing the gun twice on empty chambers. And he \nwent to prison.\n  In 2000, he was released from prison. He completed his full sentence, \nand was released without probation or parole. He went to live in North \nDakota.\n  Again, I mentioned him in April of this year at a meeting simply \nbecause his name came up on an inquiry I did about who was living in \nFargo, ND.\n  What I didn't know in April, when I mentioned Mr. Duncan, was that 1 \nmonth earlier he had been charged with molesting a 6-year-old boy at a \nplayground in Detroit Lakes, MN. He appeared in court April 5 on those \ncharges, a county judge set the bail at $15,000, and Joseph Duncan was \nreleased, promising to stay in touch. Of course, he didn't. He promptly \ndisappeared.\n  As we know from substantial media coverage in recent weeks, Joseph \nDuncan was subsequently arrested in Idaho for kidnapping 8-year-old \nShasta Groene. Her brother, 9-year-old Dylan, was missing. Their family \nwas murdered upon the abduction of these two young children. The \nremains of Dylan have now been located. Duncan has been charged with \nabducting and molesting both children and is also under investigation \nfor the murder of Dylan and the parents.\n  It is so frustrating to be here talking about this. It is a breakdown \nin common sense. Martha Stewart was let out of a minimum security \nprison and was required to wear an electronic bracelet and, apparently, \nshe still wears one at her home under the disposition of the court. But \nwe have known violent sexual predators walking around this country with \nno such level of supervision.\n  I have been on the Senate floor many times talking about a bill I \nintroduced called Dru's law. I have shown colleagues a picture of a \nyoung woman named Dru Sjodin, who was brutally murdered and whose \nalleged assailant is a man named Mr. Rodriguez.\n  Mr. Rodriguez was in prison for 23 years. He is a violent sexual \npredator. He was let out, even when he was judged to be a high risk for \nreoffending. We know that 70 percent of the time high-risk sexual \npredators are going to reoffend. In most cases, their next offense will \nbe more violent. Mr. Rodriguez allegedly murdered Dru Sjodin. The \nevidence is very substantial. He was walking around with not much more \nthan a ``see you later'' at the prison door, much like Joseph Duncan. \nMr. Duncan had been convicted previously of violent sexual offenses, \nand then he was accused in April of molesting a 6-year-old boy. What \nhappens to him? He goes through a revolving door in the criminal \njustice system to be let out at $15,000 bail. Martha Stewart is wearing \nthat bracelet and this fellow is turned back out on $15,000. Then this \nyoung girl named Shasta Groene is kidnapped with her brother Dylan and \nthey were sexually molested. People are dead.\n  Dru's law, which I introduced well over a year ago, has been passed \nby the Senate once and didn't get through the House. Senator Specter \nand I and others have introduced it again, and my hope is very much \nthat in the month of July we can get it through this Chamber and \nthrough the House and get it to the President for signature. It has \nthree simple provisions: One, there should be a national registry of \nsex offenders, a national registry of sexual predators. This isn't \nrocket science. Somebody like this who rapes a 16-year-old boy at \ngunpoint needs to go on a sexual predator registry, and no matter where \nthis person showed up in the criminal justice system, regardless of \nstate lines, the public should be able to know that he is out there. We \nneed a national registry of sexual predators.\n  Two, before a high-risk sexual predator is about to be released from \nprison, the local State's attorney must be notified in the event that \nthey believe this person is so dangerous that they need to seek \nadditional civil commitment. That must be the case.\n\n  And three, if, in fact, a high-risk sexual predator is released at \nthe end of his term, there must be intensive monitoring by local \ngovernments. Once again, electronic monitoring bracelets are not just \nmeant for Martha Stewart. They ought to be meant for very violent \noffenders like this who abduct and brutalize young children at \ngunpoint.\n  We can do much better. It is not only about Dylan and Shasta and Dru \nSjodin; month after month, we read these stories.\n  Jessica Lunsford, 9 years old, Mark Lunsford's daughter, was abducted \nin February from her bedroom in her Florida home, and they found her \nbody a month later. The crime was committed by a 46-year-old convicted \nsex offender with a 30-year history.\n  We know who these people are. They have been in the system before.\n  Sarah Michelle Lunde disappeared April 9 in Ruskin, south of Tampa, \nFL. David Onstott, a convicted sex offender who once had a relationship \nwith the girl's mother, has confessed to killing her.\n  Jetseta Gage, of Cedar Rapids, IA, was abducted, sexually assaulted, \nand murdered. Roger Paul Bentley has been arrested for that crime. He \nis a convicted sex offender on Iowa's sex offender registry.\n  This has to stop. We know who these people are. Statistics tell us \nthat over 70 percent of the violent sexual predators, when let out of \nprison, are going to reoffend. I am talking about type 3 sex offenders, \njudged to be at highest risk, as Mr. Rodriguez was when he was let out \nof prison and then within 6 months allegedly murdered Dru Sjodin.\n  When psychologists and psychiatrists evaluate sexual predators to be \nthe highest risk, we cannot any longer say goodbye, so long, good luck \nat the prison door. We cannot let that happen again. We have to begin \nprotecting innocent people. There are too many children whose lives are \nbeing lost.\n  Again, this is not rocket science. We know what is happening here, \nand we know how to stop it. Mark Lunsford wrote to me after his \ndaughter was murdered. He said:\n\n       If my daughter's death is going to have any meaning, it \n     will be through your efforts strengthening existing laws, by \n     making our streets safe for all children. My heart continues \n     to break as I mourn the loss of my beautiful little girl. I \n     do not want other families to suffer as mine has, and I \n     believe your efforts will go far toward that important goal.\n\n  My hope is that Senator Specter and many others who have cosponsored \nthis bill that I have introduced will help to pass Dru's Law once again \nthrough the Senate, and then work hard to get it through the House and \nto the President's desk for signature. It is long past the time this \ncountry has a national registry of sexual predators, violent sexual \npredators who all too often are getting away with murder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/11/senate-section/article/S7980-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n              Death of Private First Class Eric Paul Woods\n\n  Mr. HAGEL, Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Eric Paul Woods of Omaha, NE, a Private First Class medic in the \nU.S. Army.

WANGARI MAATHAI\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I recently had the honor of meeting with \nNobel Peace Prize Winner, Dr. Wangari Maathai of Kenya.\n  Dr. Maathai began a program of planting trees in 1976. She developed \nit into a grassroots organization that emphasized tree planting by \nwomen and children in order to conserve the environment and improve \ntheir quality of life. This program, which became known as the Green \nBelt Movement, has assisted women in planting more than 20 million \ntrees throughout the world.\n  Dr. Maathai is internationally recognized for a lifelong dedication \nto democracy, human rights and environmental conservation. She has \naddressed the U.N. on several occasions and spoke on behalf of women at \nspecial sessions of the General Assembly for the 5-year review of the \nearth summit.\n  Earlier this year, Dr. Maathai gave an address inaugurating the World \nFood Law Institute's ``Distinguished Lecture Series.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of her remarks be printed in the Record for the \nbenefit of my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nInaugural World Food Law Distinguished Lecture, Howard University World \n              Food Law Lunch, Cosmos Club, Washington, DC,\n\n       May 10, 2005.--Thank you very much. Professor Marsha \n     Echols, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a unique \n     pleasure and privilege and indeed honor to be here and to be \n     received so warmly by you here in Washington, DC.\n       I think that one of the most humbling experiences I have is \n     that when you do these things you don't do them thinking that \n     other people are noticing and you don't do them so that one \n     day you may be a Nobel Peace Prize winner. So, it is always \n     very humbling to know that there were people who were \n     watching and there were people who were appreciative of what \n     we were doing. But we all now acknowledge that what the \n     Norwegian Nobel Committee did on the day they decided that \n     they wanted to focus on the environment for the very first \n     time was both historic and visionary. It was a way of urging \n     us to make a mind-shift in the way we think about security, \n     in the way we think about peace, and to understand that you \n     cannot achieve peace without looking at the environment.\n       Those of us who have been working on peace, \n     democratization, environment movements, in women's movements, \n     we always felt that indeed these issues are related, but \n     nobody could have said it so dramatically and with so much \n     persuasion as the Norwegian Nobel Committee. As I was trying \n     to explain from my own perspective how these issues are \n     related, I was inspired by a metaphor that I have been using. \n     The metaphor is an African, traditional stool with three \n     legs. A traditional African stool is actually made from one \n     log and then three legs are chiseled out and a seat is also \n     chiseled out in the middle so that when you sit, you sit on \n     this basin, which rests on three legs.\n       I compare the three legs to the three pillars that the \n     Norwegian Nobel Committee identified. One leg is that of \n     peace. The other is that of democratic space, where rights \n     are respected--women's rights, human rights, environmental \n     rights, children's rights, where there is space for \n     everybody, where minorities and the marginalized can find \n     space. The third leg is the environment, that needs to be \n     managed sustainably, equitably, and in a transparent way, the \n     resources of which also need to be shared equitably.\n       That word ``equitably'' is very important in the management \n     of those resources. If you look at many of the conflicts we \n     have in the world, they are often due to the fact that we do \n     manage our resources but we do not share them equitably. Or \n     we manage our resources so poorly that they become degraded, \n     depleted and so we start fighting over the little that is \n     left. That happens at the national level, at the regional \n     level, or even at the global level. So these three pillars, \n     the pillar of peace, the pillar of the environment, and the \n     pillar of democratic space, are extremely important for any \n     state that intends to be stable. For when a state rests on \n     these three pillars then the basin of the seat becomes the \n     space, the environment, the milieu in which we can do \n     development. Here we can meet as donors, as states, as \n     financiers. We feel secure, we feel safe, because we are \n     resting safely on those three pillars.\n       In many regions, not least my own, many countries are \n     resting on two legs, some are resting on one leg, and some \n     have no legs at all. We know how desperate the situation can \n     be when the basin is literally on the ground. No development \n     can take place. That to me is the main message that this \n     Prize has brought to the world. To urge us as human society \n     to rethink how we develop and to understand that we cannot \n     force development, we cannot keep that basin up, if those \n     three legs are not stable, and that we have to invest in \n     those three legs. We have to invest in the environment. We \n     have to invest in cultures of peace, continuously and \n     deliberately. We have to invest in cultures of \n     democratization, of democratic space. I prefer to call it \n     democratic space because if I say democracy some people might \n     feel like that's not exactly what they want to describe. But \n     democratic space gives us a space to be ourselves, a space to \n     be creative, a space to be self-respecting, a space to feel \n     good about ourselves, a space to dream, and a space to \n     aspire. We can do all that if the three pillars are safe.\n       That is true whether it's a small country like Kenya or a \n     big country like the United States of America. This is the \n     message that we have been challenged to embrace, to think \n     about. And for development agencies this is a real challenge, \n     because many development agencies think that what government \n     needs is money, that if you can give them as much money as \n     possible they will develop. Well, for the last forty years or \n     so in Africa we have seen that pouring money there doesn't \n     help. We need to strengthen those three pillars. Where you \n     see a stable state and a state where people are appreciated, \n     governments are investing in people rather than in weapons, \n     they are investing in education, quality education, giving \n     people the skills and the technology they need in order to \n     exploit the resources that are within their borders, that's a \n     state that feels stable, that doesn't feel threatened. Then \n     it is able and willing to invest in its people.\n       Otherwise, you have just a small group of people trying to \n     balance themselves in that basin, and because the legs are \n     either not there or they are wobbly, no development can take \n     place.\n       Today I was going to talk about food, essentially, and \n     development and peace. I thought that if I started with that \n     vision of the African traditional stool you would understand \n     that you cannot have security in food if you do not have that \n     pillar of the environment. I want to give you an example from \n     Kenya. I want to show you how you can be very food insecure \n     because you are interfering with a mountain.\n       Those of you who know Kenya know that we have five \n     mountains, but I'll talk about the two mountains on the \n     equator: Mount Kenya and the Aberdares. These two mountains, \n     their tributaries create the largest river in Kenya. Along \n     this river are millions of people and national parks, all the \n     way to the very precious marine national park at the coast. \n     The millions of people who live along the valley of this \n     river enjoy farming and pastoralism, and of course in the \n     national parks we have wildlife.\n       The people who live upstream are largely farmers, and they \n     grow coffee and tea. Coffee and tea are some of the most \n     basic and most important economic industries in the country. \n     Tea, coffee and tourism are the main powerhouses of the \n     economy in the country. Now, those three--tea, coffee, and \n     tourism--depend on rainfall and water coming from those \n     mountains. If you do not have enough water coming down the \n     streams, you will not be able to supply agriculture, \n     especially the irrigation schemes, along that river. And \n     there are literally thousands of people who depend on that.\n       One thing that we have been doing with our mountains for \n     many years, going on for about sixty years, is we decided to \n     go to the high mountains and clear cut these natural forests \n     and replace them with commercial plantations of trees we \n     brought from Australia and the Northern Hemisphere. From \n     Australia we brought the eucalyptus--I'm saying ``we'' but \n     it's really the British--and from the North, we brought the \n     pine. These are trees that are used to temperate zones, both \n     in the South and the Northern Hemisphere. They did very well \n     because Kenya has highlands; Mount Kenya alone is 17,000 feet \n     above sea level. So these trees do very well. Also they were \n     growing on what was then virgin soil.\n       We literally sacrificed the natural forests in order to \n     expand these plantations. And sixty years down the road we \n     are beginning to see the negative impact of those \n     plantations. For one, we have lost a lot of biodiversity, \n     because these trees do not tolerate local biodiversity. They \n     kill everything except themselves. The other thing that has \n     happened is that once you remove the natural forest, you are \n     left with a forest that does not give you the same services \n     as the natural forest. For example, the tree plantations do \n     not retain rain water and encourage the water to go into the \n     underground reservoirs. Most of the water runs off downstream \n     and causes massive soil erosion and flooding and eventually \n     ends up in the lakes and seas.\n       With it, the water carries the topsoil that the farmer \n     needs to produce food. When you interfere too much with the \n     natural system, you will also interfere with the rainfall \n     patterns, because the nature of the forest controls the \n     climate and controls the rainfall patterns. So when you \n     change the ecology of the forest you also interfere with the \n     rain pattern. We're now experiencing either no rain or, when \n     the rains come, they come like a bucket from heaven has been \n     opened and it pours and causes massive soil erosion. The cash \n     crops, especially tea, do not like heavy rain. Tea prefers \n     soft, drizzling rain. So with the change in the way the rain \n     falls, you lose the crop yield.\n       How can you then have food security in a country like that, \n     where the farmers depend on rainfall or on water from \n     irrigation? It is impossible, and indeed at the beginning of \n     last month the Minister for Agriculture said\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\n     that about three million people in Kenya would need food aid \n     because the rainfall had declined so badly that farmers would \n     not have adequate yield.\n       Of course, the immediate response to the crisis is the \n     rainfall has not come. ``The rains did not come.'' But very \n     few of us ask, ``Why didn't the rains come?'' That's the \n     challenge. We need to ask ourselves, and that's why we're \n     being challenged to think holistically. For if we only want \n     the rains to come but don't want to understand why rains may \n     not come, then of course we're going to fail. I could have \n     told the Minister that because of the damage that we have \n     done to the mountains, to the five forested mountains in \n     Kenya, because of the illegal logging that has been going on \n     for years, charcoal burning that has been going on for years, \n     because of the commercial plantations that have been expanded \n     in the mountains and allowing literally thousands of people \n     to go into the forests and cultivate in order to support this \n     commercial plantation of timber, rainfall patterns sooner or \n     later would be affected.\n       Now some people say it is climate change and they say, \n     ``Well, you know, even on Mount Kenya the glaciers are \n     receding.'' That's also quite possible. It's possible that it \n     is part of climate change. But climate change does not happen \n     at a global level at once. Climate change starts at a local \n     level. It is impacted by what we have done on these two \n     mountains. Multiply that several million times, because it is \n     happening in Kenya, it is happening in Africa, it is \n     happening in Europe, it's happening elsewhere. And sooner or \n     later, all these multiplied several million times create a \n     climate that in certain areas will become extremely harsh, \n     especially for people who don't have alternatives, such as \n     the people in our region.\n       In trying to solve the problem, the Minister will probably \n     say, ``We must go out and do two things: One, we must buy \n     food from those who have it, or we must seek food aid in the \n     world.'' I'm glad that United Nations Food and Agriculture \n     Organization (FAO) is represented here, because they are the \n     ones who are usually giving us food aid. That's a short-term \n     solution.\n       The long-term solution is for us to go back to the basics. \n     Go back to the basics and listen to what the Norwegian Nobel \n     Committee said: The environment is in an intricate way \n     joined, is related, is intertwined, in our lives on an \n     everyday basis. It is not something we think about or talk \n     about or learn about sometimes. The air we breathe, the water \n     we drink, the food we eat: Everything we do has to do with \n     the environment. We need to take this concept and make it \n     holistic, so that we can think in a holistic manner, and \n     learn to protect the base on which everything else depends. \n     Learn that if we destroy the mountain, the waters, when they \n     take the soil, they take away the soil in which the farmer \n     plants his seed.\n       If you ask an ordinary Kenyan woman why the rains do not \n     come, the farmer will probably say, ``God has not yet brought \n     the rain, and we must pray so that God brings us the rain.'' \n     In recent years I have seen the need to talk to the religion \n     leaders and tell them that it is very important for them to \n     see the connection between the book of Genesis and what is \n     happening to the environment, and to begin to tell the \n     faithful that they must take care of the Garden of Eden that \n     God created in the book of Genesis, and to encourage them not \n     to wait for God to bring rain, because the rains will come \n     anyway.\n       But if the rains don't come, it has nothing to do with God. \n     It has everything to do with the way they are managing their \n     environment. So that that faithful [person], whether he can \n     read the Bible or not, or maybe at best can only read the \n     Bible in his own language, is motivated to go out, dig a \n     hole, and plant a tree. Or, is motivated to go and create a \n     terrace, or a trench, so that the next time the rains come, \n     they do not take away his topsoil, so that when he plants a \n     seed it will germinate because there is water in the ground \n     and the fertile topsoil has not been carried away. And he \n     will be motivated to support those terraces with trees, with \n     vegetation. As we [the Green Belt Movement] are doing now, \n     [perhaps] he is willing to even go further and plant trees on \n     public land, including going to the forest and planting trees \n     in the forest.\n       If the farmer does that, then those of us who are in a more \n     responsible position can make sure that what he plants, if \n     he's going to export, he will get fair trade. He'll get a \n     fair price. Most of these farmers that I'm talking about grow \n     tea and coffee. But when they grow this tea and coffee and \n     they send it to the international market, there are some \n     rules of the game--I don't know whether the food law \n     [program] looks at that--there are some rules of the game \n     that do not allow this farmer to get enough for his labor. He \n     gets very little from the international market, and he has no \n     control over that. When he needs inputs for his coffee and \n     tea he has to buy [them] at a price that has been set by \n     somebody else, and he has no control over that. Somehow there \n     is a law that does not create justice for this farmer, and as \n     a result, because he doesn't get enough for his labor, he \n     continues to scrape, to scratch this land and get very little \n     out of it. So we call him poor, and we begin to say that it \n     is partly because of his poverty that the environment is \n     being degraded.\n       Well, it is not true. The farmer is doing his best. He \n     needs to be assisted to learn that he has to protect his \n     environment. But those of us at this level also need to \n     protect his interests. So when he brings his produce to the \n     market he gets a fair price. That is why we are saying that \n     perhaps what many of these poor countries need so that they \n     may protect the environment is fair trade, support for aid so \n     that they can support that farmer, and they can protect that \n     forest, and they can encourage the rehabilitation of these \n     forests and these mountains so that the rivers can continue \n     to flow and the rains will come back.\n       The only way we can do that is if we have governments that \n     operate in a free, democratic space, so that they can \n     encourage their people, and governments that are promoting \n     cultures of peace, so that people can find a peaceful \n     environment in which to do these activities.\n       That is the message that I'm trying to share with you. I \n     believe that's the message the Norwegian Nobel Committee was \n     delivering to the world. It is the challenge that we have \n     been given, so that we can rethink what security and peace \n     really mean for us, and to understand that at no time, either \n     at the national level or at the regional level, can we have \n     peace if we do not think holistically--think from the top to \n     the bottom and as wide as we can.\n       If we do so, then we are prepared to capture tat image of \n     the traditional African stool with its three legs: Democracy, \n     peace, and sustainable management of our resources. Then we \n     can have a peaceful, secure base upon which development can \n     take place.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/11/senate-section/article/S7982-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HANSBORO, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 7, \n2005, the residents of Hansboro celebrated their community's history \nand founding.\n  Hansboro is a community located in north central North Dakota only 4 \nmiles from the U.S./Canadian border. With a current population of 12, \nHansboro is a very small town. However, more than 500 people \ncongregated there for its centennial celebration this summer. It is \nclear that Hansboro possesses the characteristics that make smalltown \nAmerica so special and unique.\n  Founded in 1905 by railroad workers and farmers who were working to \nestablish a rail line to connect the area to the larger community of \nDevils Lake, ND, it was not long before several grain elevators were \nbuilt. Shortly after its founding, on November 11, 1905, a post office \nwas established in Hansboro at which Alexander Messer served as \npostmaster. The name of the community was meant to honor Henry Clay \nHansbrough. Hansbrough served as North Dakota's first representative in \nthe U.S. Congress after the State's creation in 1889. He later went on \nto serve three terms in the U.S. Senate from 1891 to 1909.\n  Today, Hansboro's small population consists mainly of individuals \ndevoted to farming and ranching. However, the town also possesses the \nunique characteristic and great responsibility of serving as a port of \nentry into Canada.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Hansboro, ND, and \nits residents on their first 100 years. By honoring Hansboro and all of \nthe other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations.

Kindred can trace its history to 1879 when a U.S. Post Office \nnamed Sibley was moved two miles north of its original location to the \npresent day site of Kindred. Following this, in 1880 the Great Northern \nRailroad established a\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\ntown-site and railroad station, naming the town Kindred after William \nS. Kindred, a Fargo real-estate pioneer. Kindred was incorporated in \n1920 and became a city in 1949. Today, Kindred is a rapidly growing \ncommunity bolstered by a variety of thriving businesses including, Cass \nCounty Electric Cooperative, Dakota Ag Cooperative, and Odegaard \nAviation.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Kindred, ND, and \nits residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well through \nthe next century.

Despite its small size, Dawson holds an \nimportant place in North Dakota's history. The Sibley Expedition helped \nbegin the settlement of this area, but it was the railroad's expansion \nthat was responsible for Dawson's birth. J. Dawson Thompson, along with \nFredrick D. Hager and Robert E. Wallace established the city of Dawson \nin 1880. This town started with a windmill and a water tower and later \ndeveloped into an important city. As a railroad center, it was \nresponsible for welcoming early settlers.\n  As the first established city of Kidder County, Dawson has \nexperienced many changes over the years. Today, Mayor Rand Loveness \nleads this great city. Known for its excellent hunting and fishing, \nDawson attracts a wide variety of sportsmen. Although small in size, \nDawson has found ways to touch the lives of many people. Dawson has \nserved thousands of children and adults through Camp Grassick. This \ncamp specializes in giving people with disabilities and special needs a \nwonderful summer camp experience. The Veterans Memorial Wall in Dawson \nis another example of how this town has given back to its community. \nThis wall honors 1,010 veterans serving from the Crimean War to the \ngulf war.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Dawson, ND, and \nits residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well through \nthe next century.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 8-\n10, the residents of Lankin, ND, celebrated their community's history \nand founding.\n  Lankin is a small town in the northeast part of North Dakota. Despite \nits small size, Lankin holds an important place in North Dakota's \nhistory. The site was originally named ``Young'' for G.W. Young, a Park \nRiver lawyer and former teacher. He established the post office on \nApril 7, 1898, and John Matajeck became the first postmaster. The name \nwas changed to Lankin on July 27, 1905, when John Lankin became \npostmaster and the townsite was established on the Soo Line Railroad. \nLankin was officially incorporated as a village in 1908. Among the \ntown's residents were Jack McDonald, a trumpet player with Philip \nSousa's famous band and Herman Witasek, a member of Lankin's 1930 State \nClass C High School basketball champions, who is considered to be North \nDakota's first professional player of the sport.\n  Today Lankin is a delightful community in which to live and work. \nLankin is home to a number of businesses, including a grain elevator, \npost office, bank, restaurant and an American Legion Club. There is \nalso an active volunteer fire department and EMS squad. The community \nhosted a variety of festivities during its centennial celebration. On \nFriday, it held an all-school reunion, banquet and dance. Saturday \nkicked off with a parade and that will be followed by a day of \nentertainment featuring games, music, a three-on-three basketball \ntournament and a fireworks display that evening.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 8-\n10, 2005, the residents of McClusky, ND, celebrated their community's \nhistory and founding.\n  The community of McClusky is located at the geographic center of \nNorth Dakota, approximately 65 miles northeast of the State capital, \nBismarck, and 50 miles east of beautiful Lake Sakakawea, a manmade lake \nformed by the Garrison Dam on the Missouri River. Within 45 miles of 18 \nlakes, McClusky is home to some of the world's premier hunting and \nfishing.\n  Founded in 1905 as the result of railroad expansion into the area, \nMcClusky became a bustling farming community. Farming was, and \ncontinues to be, the mainstay of McClusky. In fact, the community \nreceived its name from William Henderson McClusky, a local farmer \nresponsible for the town's establishment. In addition to farming, \nhowever, at this time McClusky's 500 residents are also vital to the \ncontinued existence of numerous organizations and businesses, including \n6 churches and a bed and breakfast.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating McClusky, ND, and \nits residents on their first 100 years. By honoring McClusky and all of \nthe other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations.

Mr. President, I would like to extend my best \nwishes to LTC Vernon Simmons who recently retired as deputy to the \nDirector of Budget and Appropriations Liaison in the Office of the \nAssistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and \nComptroller. Vern's career as an Air Force officer defines service to \none's country, and I know that Vern's dedication and leadership will be \nsorely missed by me and my staff, as well as his colleagues at the Air \nForce and the Department of Defense.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Simmons' career exemplifies hard work and \ncommitment to excellence. In 1983, he graduated with honors from \nNortheastern University in Boston with a bachelor of science degree in \nbusiness administration. It was there that he also completed his 4-year \nROTC program, prior to entering active duty. He also earned a master of \narts degree in economics from the University of Oklahoma in 1994.\n  Vern's first assignment was in Air Force Systems Command at Wright-\nPatterson Air Force Base, OH. He was assigned to the program control \noffice as a program control integrator on the F-15E aircraft. It was \nthere that he\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\nalso met his wonderful wife the former Celeste Aida Adams of Dayton, \nOH.\n  Next up for Vern was an assignment at Misawa Air Base Japan where he \nworked in the 432nd Tactical Fighter Wing. Vern's leadership abilities \nshined through as he performed a wide variety of cost and management \nanalyses while also serving as the wing's budget officer. For his \nefforts he was named Best Base Level Cost Officer of 1986 and in 1988 \nwas the Pacific Air Force's nominee to Ten Outstanding Young Men of \nAmerica.\n  Upon completing 4 years in Japan, Vern once again answered the call \nto duty and moved to Hickam Air Force Base, HI, in June of 1990. There \nhe joined the Pacific Air Force Headquarters staff as lead analyst for \nthe command's flying hours, ranges and training programs. He also \nserved there as Chief of the mission support section, overseeing \ncivilian pay, civil engineering, and communications and base support \nprograms.\n  Following subsequent assignments at the Pentagon, Seymour Johnson AFB \nand Headquarters AFMC, Lieutenant Colonel Simmons returned to \nWashington, DC, where he assumed the duties in the Budget and \nAppropriations Liaison Division for congressional matters. It was \nduring this assignment that my staff and I came to know and rely on \nVern. As a Senator from a State with three diverse Air Force bases, it \nis critical that I have the most current and reliable information about \npolicies affecting the airmen and women from my State. Vern always came \nthrough for me and my staff. Whether sacrificing his own time to travel \nwith us to Cannon, Holloman or Kirtland Air Force Base, or providing us \nwith important answers to questions concerning the Air Force budget, \nVern was always extremely professional, courteous and responsive. \nIndeed, LTC Vern Simmons has been a friend to my office, and I consider \nhim a credit to the uniform of the U.S. Air Force.\n  Now, as Vern moves on to a new career, I wish the best for him, \nCeleste and their two children, Alessandra and Chad. It is with great \npleasure that I recognize him and his accomplishments. LTC Vernon \nSimmons, I thank you for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/11/senate-section/article/S7984-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RETIREMENT OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL LON PRIBBLE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to LTC Lon Pribble, Deputy Chief of the Army Senate Liaison \nDivision, Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison who will retire on \n30 August 2005. Lieutenant Colonel Pribble's career spans over 22 years \nduring which he has distinguished himself as a soldier, leader and \nfriend of the U.S. Senate.\n  A native of Kansas, Lieutenant Colonel Pribble graduated from the \nU.S. Military Academy in 1983 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in \nthe Armor Branch of the U.S. Army. During his career he commanded at \nthe platoon and company levels where he ably trained and led America's \nsoldiers at home and overseas. In Kirchgoens, Germany he commanded D \nCompany and Headquarters and Headquarters Company 2nd Battalion 32nd \nArmor Regiment. He served in Southwest Asia as an Intelligence and \nOperations Officer with the 503rd Forward Support Battalion during \nDesert Shield/Desert Storm. Lieutenant Colonel Pribble also served in \nstaff and instructor positions in the United States at the National \nTraining Center at Fort Irwin, CA, and the Army Staff Management \nCollege at Fort Belvoir, VA. Prior to assuming his current duties he \nserved as a U.S. Army Military fellow for the U.S. Senate and a \ncongressional liaison for the House of Representatives. Since January \n2003 Lon Pribble has served with distinction as the Deputy Chief, Army \nSenate Liaison Division where he has superbly represented the Chief of \nLegislative Liaison, the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Secretary \nof the Army, as well as promoting the interests of soldiers, their \nfamilies and civilians of the Army. His professionalism, mature \njudgment, sage advice and interpersonal skills have earned him the \nrespect and confidence of Members of Congress and congressional \nstaffers with whom he has worked on a multitude of issues. In over 5 \nyears on Capitol Hill, Lon Pribble has been a true friend of the U.S. \nSenate and the Congress. Serving as one the Army's primary points of \ncontact for Senators and their staff he has assisted the Congress in \nunderstanding Army policies, actions and requirements. As a result he \nand the Army Senate Liaison staff have been extremely successful in \nproviding prompt, coordinated and factual replies to all inquiries and \nmatters involving Army issues. In addition he has provided invaluable \nassistance to Members and their staff while planning, coordinating and \naccompanying Senate delegations on official travel to numerous \ncountries worldwide. His substantive knowledge of the key issues, keen \nlegislative insight and ability to effectively advise senior members of \nthe Army leadership directly contributed to the successful \nrepresentation of the Army's interests before Congress.\n  Throughout his career, LTC Lon Pribble has demonstrated his profound \ncommitment to our Nation, his selfless service to the Army, a deep \nconcern for soldiers and their families and dedication to excellence. \nLieutenant Colonel Pribble is a consummate professional whose \nperformance in over 22 years of service has personified those traits of \ncourage, competency and integrity that our Nation has come to expect \nfrom its professional Army officers.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Lieutenant Colonel Pribble \nfor his honorable service to the people and the Army of the United \nStates. We wish him and his family Godspeed and all the best in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/11/senate-section/article/S7984-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BRIDGEWATER, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide \nfor a border preparedness pilot program on Indian land; read the first \ntime.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill that \nauthorizes the Secretary or Homeland Security to establish a pilot \nprogram to enhance an Indian tribe's response to border activity. I am \npleased to be joined by the vice chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Byron Dorgan, and my good friend and colleague from \nArizona, Senator Jon Kyl, as original cosponsors of this bill.\n  This bill establishes a pilot program to enhance tribal first \nresponder capabilities, provide assistance for surveillance \ntechnologies and communication capabilities and to facilitate \ncoordination and cooperation with Federal, State, local and tribal \ngovernments along the international border. The criteria for \nparticipation in the pilot program is to be prescribed by the Secretary \ntaking into consideration the tribes' proximity to the border and the \nextent to which border crossing activity impacts existing tribal \nresources.\n  This bill is substantially similar to Section 132 of S. 536, the \nNative American Omnibus Act of 2005, which was unanimously passed out \nof the Committee on Indian Affairs earlier this year. It has been \nmodified to address several concerns including to clarify that it does \nnot alter the original jurisdiction or traditional role of the Federal \nagencies responding to border crimes or any Indian tribe.\n  Several Indian tribes inhabit land on or easily accessible to the \nUnited States and Canada and Mexico. This bill recognizes that these \ntribes are exceptionally vulnerable to border crimes. And, although \nenforcement of our immigration laws and border security is a Federal \nresponsibility, these tribes continue to bear extraordinary costs in \nresponding to border crimes and almost always divert funds intended for \nlocal police and welfare services to do so. For example, a tribal \npolice officer may see suspicious drug or immigrant smuggling activity \noccurring within the Indian tribes boundaries or come upon an accident \nscene or death involving illegal immigrants or drug smugglers. The \ntribal officer is required to notify Federal officials and render aid \nto the injured. The Federal official may be hours away and the tribal \npolice are usually asked to detain the suspects or possibly transport \nthem to medical aid. Meanwhile, the tribal police agency is unable to \nrespond to community calls for service. Additionally, tribal police are \nintimately familiar with their territory and are able to provide \nFederal agencies with information that is useful in fulfilling their \nresponsibilities.\n  I recognize that Federal and State agencies play the primary role in \nthese efforts. However, in specific areas of this Nation, tribal \ngovernment police, fire and emergency services often provide the first \nand often only response because of their access to the border. A \ntribe's proximity to the border and its responsibility for public \nsafety and welfare of their members requires that they respond. Simply \nput, Indian tribes situated close to the international border are \nvulnerable and greatly impacted and we must acknowledge their daily \nrole in responding to border crimes. This bill gives them added tools \nto do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks and the full text of the bill \nbe included in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 to \nmodify provisions relating to criminal proceedings and civil actions, \nand for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a much needed \namendment to the Indian Arts and Crafts Act. I am pleased to be joined \nby the vice chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Byron \nDorgan, and my good friend and colleague from Arizona, Senator Jon Kyl \nas original cosponsors of this bill.\n  This bill expands the existing Federal investigative authority by \nauthorizing other Federal investigative bodies, such as the BIA Office \nof Law Enforcement, in addition to the FBI, to investigate cases of \nmisrepresentation of Indian arts and crafts. This bill is substantially \nthe same as Section 111 of the Native American Omnibus Act, S. 536, \nwhich passed out of the Committee on Indian Affairs earlier this year. \nThis bill also addresses concerns that were raised by the \nadministration.\n  A major source of tribal and individual Indian income is derived from \nthe sale of handmade Indian arts and crafts. Yet, today, millions of \ndollars are diverted each year from these original artists and Indian \ntribes by those who reproduce and sell counterfeit Indian goods. \nHowever, it is my understanding that few, if any, criminal prosecutions \nhave been brought in Federal court for such violations. It is \nunderstandable that enforcing the criminal law that prohibits the sale \nof Indian arts and crafts misrepresented as an Indian product is often \nstalled by the other responsibilities of the FBI including \ninvestigating terrorism activity and violent crimes in Indian country. \nTherefore, expanding the investigative authority to include other \nFederal agencies is intended to promote the active investigation of \nalleged misconduct. It is my hope that with this much needed change \nwill deter those who dare to violate the act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1375\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain to introduce the Indian Arts and Crafts Amendments Act of 2005. \nThis legislation strengthens the investigative and enforcement \nauthorities of the underlying Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990.\n  Native arts and crafts are the only indigenous art of America. \nUnauthentic reproductions and mass produced knock offs undercut sales \nof genuine articles, discouraging young Native Americans from learning \ntraditional artisans' techniques and their decisions to pursue jobs in \nother industries. The end result is that if less Native people are \npracticing their arts, those traditions risk extinction. It would be a \ntremendous loss to the entire country's cultural heritage to lose these \ntraditions.\n  The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, which I coauthored with now \nretired Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell when we were both Members of \nthe House of Representatives, was enacted in response to growing sales \nof arts and crafts products misrepresented as being produced by \nIndians. It is a truth-in-advertising law, with civil and criminal \nprovisions, that prohibits the marketing of products as ``Indian made'' \nwhen such products are not made by Indians as defined by the act. It is \nintended to protect Indian artists and craftspeople, businesses, \ntribes, consumers and our cultural heritage.\n  Since the passage of the 1990 Act, we have had an opportunity to \nassess its effectiveness and make changes as necessary through the \nlegislative process. Last year, now retired Senator Campbell and I, on \nthe recommendation of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, agreed to \nconsider amending the act to strengthen its investigative authority and \nenforcement provisions. The Board was becoming concerned that the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, charged with investigating violations \nof the act, needed some help. Fewer complaints that had been referred \nfor investigation were receiving the attention they deserved and \nmeritorious cases were not making it to the Attorney General for \nprosecution. During the last Congress, we proposed amending the act to \nstrengthen the investigative and enforcement authorities, but these \namendments were not enacted prior to adjournment.\n  I am happy to say, the new Indian Affairs Committee chairman, Senator \nMcCain, recognized these concerns still existed, and we agreed to work \ntogether to address them. The Amendments we are introducing today build \nupon the work in the last Congress. When enacted, they will make the \nact even more effective. The amendments expand the investigative \nauthority under the act to include all Federal law enforcement officers \nas defined in 18 U.S.C. Section 115 (c)(1). Expanding the investigative \nauthority to include other Federal law enforcement beyond the Federal \nBureau of Investigation will permit agencies with expertise in Indian \nissues and cultural resources, such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs law \nenforcement and the Department of Interior Cultural Resources, to \nthoroughly investigate complaints and work with Department of Justice \nattorneys to enforce these cases. The FBI will still have the ability \nto conduct such investigations should it choose to do so. I hope it \nwill.\n  These amendments also recognize the important role of the Attorney \nGeneral in enforcement. The amendments require the transmission of all \ninvestigation reports from Federal investigators to the Attorney \nGeneral. The Attorney General can work directly with the investigators, \nand prosecute cases that warrant prosecution without waiting for the \nreport to be referred by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board. This is an \nefficiency measure and is not designed to take away any authority the \nBoard has to refer cases to the Attorney General. The Board will \ncontinue to receive all investigative reports and make referrals.\n  I believe these amendments to the act will strengthen the \ninvestigative and enforcement authority under the act and increase the \nnumber of complaints that are investigated and prosecuted. These \nviolations are serious, and we need to provide the necessary federal \nresources to put an end to these crimes and preserve the cultural \nheritage of our Native people. I look forward to swift passage of these \namendments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Warner, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1376. A bill to improve and expand geographic literacy among \nkindergarten through grade 12 students in the United States by \nimproving professional development programs for kindergarten through \ngrade 12 teachers offered through institutions of higher education; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nStevens, Dodd, Warner, Burns, and Akaka. The Act's purpose is to \nimprove geographic literacy among K-12 students in the United States by \nimproving professional development programs for K-12 teachers offered \nthrough institutions of higher education. The bill also assists States \nin measuring the impact of education in geography.\n  To begin to understand other people, we need to understand ourselves. \nEudora Welty said that understanding begins with a sense of place. When \nwe understand our own environment, we can better understand the \ndifferences in other places, and the people who live\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\nin them. The diversity of cultures, land, and distances between states \nwithin our nation is the first evidence we have that a good \nunderstanding of geography is necessary. According to the National \nGeographic Society, home is where the knowledge of geography begins.\n  The 2005 publication, What Works in Geography, reported that \nelementary school geography instruction significantly improves student \nachievement. And, the 2002 National Geographic-Roper Global Geographic \nLiteracy Survey shows that more than half of American adults best able \nto read a map had taken a high school geography course. That's the good \nnews. Unfortunately, other recent studies show us that nearly one third \nof our elementary schools have reduced the number of geography courses \nin the last few years, and only 7 percent of our Nation's fourth \ngraders are taught by teachers with specific undergraduate or graduate \nexperience in geography. Geography is taught by less than 9 percent of \nK-12 social studies teachers and not even one quarter of high school \nstudents graduate with a geography class.\n  To expect that Americans will be able to work economically and \ndiplomatically with the other people in this world, we need to be able \nto communicate and understand each other. It is a fact that we have a \nglobal marketplace, and that will continue to be the case. We need to \nbe preparing our younger generations for global competition and \nensuring that they have a strong base to be able to participate in \nfuture industry. Geography knowledge improves those job opportunities.\n  Approximately 20 percent of the U.S. GDP, that's $2.3 trillion \nannually, results from international trade. According to the CIA World \nFactbook of 2005, many U.S. workers need geographic knowledge for this \nglobal economy. Geographic knowledge is increasingly needed for U.S. \nbusinesses in international markets. For example, the inadvertent \nplacing of Kashmir outside of Indian territory on a time zone map in a \nwidely used computer operating system forced a costly recall, fix, and \nreissue of the software.\n  A comprehensive geography education provides training in geospatial \ntechnologies, such as remote sensing and geographic information \nsystems. This high-growth industry is expected to reach $30 billion in \nannual revenues by the end of 2005, up from $5 billion in 2002. \nGeospatial technologies are one of the three biggest emerging fields \nidentified by the Department of Labor, and they are providing 75,000 \nnew jobs annually. A strong geographic education system is a necessity \nfor this industry's continuing advancement.\n  Geography literacy is essential to a well prepared citizenry in the \n21st Century. Last year, then Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \n``To solve most of the major problems facing our county today--from \nwiping out terrorism, to minimizing global environmental problems, to \neliminating the scourge of AIDS--will require every young person to \nlearn more about other regions, cultures, and languages.''\n  We need to do more to ensure that the teachers responsible for the \neducation of our students, from kindergarten through high school \ngraduation, are prepared to participate constructively in solving those \nproblems. Over the last 15 years, the National Geographic Society has \nawarded more than $100 million in grants to educators, universities, \ngeography alliances, and others for the purposes of advancing and \nimproving the teaching of geography. Their models are successful and \nresearch shows that students who have benefitted from this teaching out \nperform other students. State geography alliances exist in 19 States, \nincluding Mississippi, endowed by grants from the society. It is clear \nthat their efforts alone are not enough. My bill establishes a Federal \ncommitment to enhance the education of our teachers, focus on geography \neducation research, and develop reliable, advanced technology based \nclassroom materials.\n  I hope the Senate will consider the seriousness of the need to invest \nin geography and I invite other Senators to cosponsor the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1379. A bill to provide increased rail transportation security; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are all deeply saddened by the tragic \nloss of life caused by the terrorist attacks in London last week. Those \nincidents are a painful reminder of the cruel nature of our enemies in \nthis war, and of what we must do to fight and win against those who \nwish to eradicate our way of life.\n  I have said on many occasions that we cannot just play defense in \nthis war, that instead we must take the fight to the enemy. Still, we \nmust do what is possible to protect Americans at home. To that end, the \nSenate passed by unanimous consent last year the Rail Security Act of \n2004, rail security legislation that, unfortunately, was not approved \nby the House of Representatives. The London bombings and the attacks on \nMadrid's commuter rail system last year demonstrate all too vividly the \ncontinuing need for this legislation.\n  Our Nation's transit system, Amtrak, and the freight railroads, I am \nsad to say, remain vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Though we have \nincreased dramatically our security capabilities since 9/11, we have \nmore to do. For example, since 9/11, only modest resources have been \ndedicated to rail security, and efforts to address rail security remain \nfragmented despite the constant and tragic reminders abroad that we are \nin desperate need of deliberate action. In fact, the Department of \nHomeland Security has not yet completed a vulnerability assessment for \nthe rail system, nor is there an integrated security plan that reflects \nthe unique characteristics of passenger and freight rail operations.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, which is nearly identical to \nthe Rail Security Act of 2004, would authorize resources to ensure rail \ntransportation security receives a high priority in our efforts to \nsecure our country from terrorism. The legislation directs DHS to \ncomplete a vulnerability assessment for the rail system and make \nrecommendations for addressing security weaknesses within 180 days of \nenactment. It would also authorize funding to address long-standing \nfire and life-safety needs for several tunnels along the Northeast \nCorridor, and would authorize appropriations to meet immediate security \nneeds for intercity and freight rail transportation. Further, as \nrecommended by the Government Accountability Office, the bill would \nrequire DHS to sign a memorandum of agreement with the Department of \nTransportation to add clarity to each department's roles and \nresponsibilities with respect to rail security. It is my expectation \nthat this memorandum would supplement and add detail to the memorandum \nof understanding between the two departments signed on September 28, \n2004.\n  The freight railroads, individual commuter authorities, and Amtrak \nhave, on their own initiative, completed risk assessments and taken \nsteps to safeguard passengers, facilities, and cargo. These efforts, \naccomplished at a very small cost to the Federal Government, have \nhelped make our rail system safer. The legislation introduced today \nwill augment these efforts and bring these individual initiatives \ntogether in a coordinated rail security program.\n  I trust that the Senate will move quickly to once again pass this \nessential legislation. We owe at least that much to the American people \nas we continue our struggle against an enemy that wants nothing less \nthan to destroy everything we stand for and believe in.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Protecting the homeland against nuclear, radiological, \n     biological, or chemical terrorism requires a layered defense \n     drawing upon a full spectrum of capabilities and tools, \n     beginning with a national strategy for an international and \n     domestic effort to prevent the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction (WMD) before it affects Americans at home, \n     as well as to harden America and manage the consequences of \n     attacks while preserving fundamental liberties and economic \n     activity.\n       (2) The National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction was published in December 2002.\n       (3) Since the development of the National Strategy--\n       (A) the nature of the weapons of mass destruction threats \n     to the United States has evolved significantly;\n       (B) the understanding of likely future weapons of mass \n     destruction threats has also progressed; and\n       (C) United States capabilities for detecting, preventing, \n     and responding to weapons of mass destruction threats have \n     also evolved.\n       (4) President George W. Bush enumerated in a speech on \n     February 11, 2004, a number of new actions the United States \n     would call for to address weaknesses in efforts to combat the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destnlction. Some of the \n     most in July 11, 2005 important of these actions have not yet \n     been undertaken or have met international resistance.\n       (5) Since the National Strategy ,vas developed, a \n     significant intelligence failure has occurred with respect to \n     the assessment of the weapons of mass destruction \n     capabilities of Iraq, which failure has precipitated several \n     efforts to identify systemic deficiencies in intelligence and \n     identify recommended improvements.\n       (6) As required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458), and as \n     recommended by the Commission on the Intelligence \n     Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction, President George W. Bush announced in June 2005 \n     the intent to establish a National Counter Proliferation \n     Center (NCPC). The Center will exercise strategic oversight \n     of the work of the intelligence community on threats posed by \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and will \n     playa unique leading role within the United States Government \n     in addressing such threats.\n       (7) A number of other significant changes to United States \n     policies, capabilities, and tools to combat the proliferation \n     of weapons of mass destruction have been recommended, and in \n     some cases, implemented since December 2002, in the absence \n     of an updated national strategy on combatting the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (b) Update of National Strategy To Combat Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction.--(1) Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall develop and \n     submit to Congress an update to the National Strategy to \n     Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction of December 2002.\n       (2) The update of the National Strategy shall take into \n     account developments since the publication of the National \n     Strategy.\n       (3) The update of the National Strategy shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) Intelligence-based assessment.--An intelligence-based \n     assessment of the threat to United States territory, \n     citizens, and interests from the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction and the threat of terrorist acquisition and \n     use of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (B) Objectives.--A review of the objectives of United \n     States policy, both domestically and internationally, \n     regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n     and the threat of terrorist acquisition and use of weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (C) Capabilities, roles, missions, concepts of \n     operations.--A review of the full spectrum of capabilities \n     necessary, whether domestically or internationally, to \n     address the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     the threat of terrorist acquisition and use of weapons of \n     mass destruction, and a description of the roles, missions, \n     and concepts of operations for each of the organizations and \n     programs responsible for providing such capabilities.\n       (D) Policy, program and operational coordination.--A review \n     of the mechanisms for planning, coordinating, and \n     implementing policy, programs, and operations, including \n     government-wide strategic operational planning, across all \n     agencies and entities undertaking work to combat the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to protect \n     the homeland against weapons of mass destruction attacks.\n       (4) The update of the National Strategy shall address \n     specific areas key to a successful national strategy to \n     combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \n     including, but not limited to the following:\n       (A) National counter proliferation center.--A description \n     of the roles, missions,\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\n     and concepts of operations for the National Counter \n     Proliferation Center, including a plan and schedule for \n     establishing the Center and developing it to full working \n     capacity.\n       (B) International nonproliferation regimes.--A review of \n     how the United States will seek to strengthen the \n     international nonproliferation regimes, including, but not \n     limited to, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and \n     associated entities (such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group) in \n     the wake of the 2005 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty review \n     conference, the Missile Technology Control Regime, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention and associated entities (such as the Australia \n     Group).\n       (C) Security of nuclear materials.--A review of how the \n     United States will enhance programs to secure weapons-grade \n     nuclear materials globally.\n       (D) Detection and characterization capabilities.--A review \n     of how the United States will improve the array of weapons of \n     mass destruction detection devices to ensure the homeland is \n     protected from any means by which weapons of mass destruction \n     could be delivered against the United States.\n       (E) Interdiction capabilities.--An assessment of the \n     ability of the United States and the international community \n     to interdict in transit illicit materials and personnel \n     related to weapons of mass destruction, including--\n       (i) an assessment of the number and impact of interdictions \n     under the Proliferation Security Initiative; and\n       (ii) an assessment of how the Initiative can be \n     strengthened to achieve more concrete results.\n       (F) Nuclear inspections and safeguards.--A review of how \n     the United States will strengthen the ability of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to monitor peaceful \n     nuclear energy programs to ensure that such programs are not \n     used as a cover for nuclear weapons development, including, \n     but not limited to--\n       (i) how the United States will encourage the adoption and \n     ratification by each non-nuclear weapon state of the Model \n     Additional Protocol with the Agency;

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Homeland Security Advisory System had been raised \n     to threat level Code Orange, a level which indicates a high \n     risk of terrorist attack, on six occasions since the Advisory \n     System was created in March 2002, prior to the rasing of the \n     threat level to Code Orange following the bombings that \n     occurred in London on July 7, 2005.\n       (2) The Code Orange threat level remained in place for an \n     average of 13 days on each of the first five occasions that \n     it was raised to that level.\n       (3) The sixth elevation of the threat level to Code Orange \n     occurred in August 2004 and ended 98 days later, making it \n     four times longer than any other such alert and constituting \n     half of the days that the United States has been under a high \n     risk of terrorist attack.\n       (4) The Conference of Mayors estimates that cities in the \n     United States spend some $70,000,000 per week to implement \n     security measures associated with the Code Orange threat \n     level.\n       (5) The recommendation to elevate the threat level is made \n     by the Homeland Security Council, a group of Cabinet \n     officials and senior advisors to the President and Vice \n     President, (in this section referred to as the ``Council'').\n       (6) In May 2005, Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge \n     revealed that there was often considerable disagreement among \n     the members of the Council as to whether or not the threat \n     level should be raised.\n       (7) There remains considerable confusion among the public \n     and State and local government officials as to the decision-\n     making process and criteria used by the Council in deciding \n     whether the threat level should be raised to Code Orange.\n       (b) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall conduct a study examining the six occasions in which \n     the Homeland Security Advisory System was raised to Code \n     Orange prior to July 2005 and submit to Congress a report on \n     such study.\n       (c) The report required by subsection (b) shall include an \n     explanation and analysis of the decision-making process used \n     by the Council to raise the threat level to Code Orange in \n     each of the six instances prior to July 2005, including--\n       (1) the criteria and standards used by the Council in \n     reaching its decision;\n       (2) a description of deliberations and votes of the Council \n     were conducted, and whether any of the deliberations and \n     votes have been transcribed or were otherwise recorded in \n     some manner;\n       (3) a description of the specific intelligence that led to \n     the decision to raise the threat level to Code Orange on each \n     of the six occasions, and what, if any, common factors or \n     trends in the intelligence reporting were present in each of \n     the previous decisions;\n       (4) an explanation for the decision, on the sixth occasion, \n     for the threat level to remain elevated for 98 days, and what \n     role, if any, staff of the White House played in the decision \n     to raise the level on that occasion;\n       (5) a description of the direct and indirect costs incurred \n     by cities, States, or the Federal Government after the threat \n     level was raised to Code Orange on each of the six occasions; \n     and\n       (6) the recommendations of the Comptroller General of the \n     United States, if any, for improving the Homeland Security \n     Advisory System, including recommendations regarding--\n       (A) measures that could be carried out to build greater \n     public awareness and confidence in the work of the Council;\n       (B) whether the Council and the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security could benefit from greater transparency and the \n     development of more clearly articulated public standards in \n     the threat level decision-making process;\n       (C) whether the current composition of the Council should \n     be modified to include representatives from the States; and\n       (D) the measures that could be carried out to minimize the \n     costs to States and municipalities during periods when the \n     Homeland Security Advisory System is raised to level to Code \n     Orange.\n       (d) The report required by subsection (b) shall be \n     submitted in an unclassified form and may include a \n     classified annex, if necessary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1161.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the United States has an obligation \n     to its citizens to secure its borders and ensure the rule of \n     law in its communities.\n       (2) The Government of the United States must strengthen \n     international border security efforts by dedicating adequate \n     and significant resources for technology, personnel, and \n     training for border region enforcement.\n       (3) Federal immigration policies must adhere to the United \n     States tradition as a nation of immigrants and reaffirm this \n     Nation's commitment to family unity, economic opportunity, \n     and humane treatment.\n       (4) Immigrants have contributed significantly to the \n     strength and economic prosperity of the United States and \n     action must be taken to ensure their fair treatment by \n     employers and protection against fraud and abuse.\n       (5) Current immigration laws and the enforcement of such \n     laws are ineffective and do not serve the people of the \n     United States, the national security interests of the United \n     States, or the economic prosperity of the United States.\n       (6) The United States cannot effectively carry out its \n     national security policies unless the United States \n     identifies undocumented immigrants and encourages them to \n     come forward and participate legally in the economy of the \n     United States.\n       (7) Illegal immigration fosters other illegal activity, \n     including human smuggling, trafficking, and document fraud, \n     all of which undermine the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (8) Illegal immigration burdens States and local \n     communities with hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     uncompensated expenses for law enforcement, health care, and \n     other essential services.\n       (9) Illegal immigration creates an underclass of workers \n     who are vulnerable to fraud and exploitation.\n       (10) Fixing the broken immigration system requires a \n     comprehensive approach that provides for adequate legal \n     channels for immigration and strong enforcement of \n     immigration laws which will serve the economic, social, and \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (11) Foreign governments, particularly those that share an \n     international border with the United States, must play a \n     critical role in securing international borders and deterring \n     illegal entry of foreign nationals into the United States.\n       (12) Federal immigration policy should foster economic \n     growth by allowing willing workers to be matched with willing \n     employers when no United States worker is available to take a \n     job.\n       (13) Immigration reform is a key component to achieving \n     effective enforcement and\n\n[[Page S8049]]\n\n     will allow for the best use of security and enforcement \n     resources to be focused on the greatest risks.\n       (14) Comprehensive immigration reform and strong \n     enforcement of immigration laws will encourage legal \n     immigration, deter illegal immigration, and promote the \n     economic and national security interests of the United \n     States.\n\n                        TITLE I--BORDER SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

and\n       (C) extend financing for alternative rural economic \n     activities beyond direct agricultural production;\n       (4) expanding efforts to reduce the transaction costs of \n     remittance flows in order to increase the pool of savings \n     available to help finance domestic investment in Mexico;\n       (5) encouraging Mexican corporations to adopt \n     internationally recognized corporate governance practices, \n     including anti-corruption and transparency principles;\n       (6) enhancing Mexican efforts to strengthen governance at \n     all levels, including efforts to improve transparency and \n     accountability, and to eliminate corruption, which is the \n     single biggest obstacle to development;\n       (7) assisting the Government of Mexico in implementing all \n     provisions of the Inter-American Convention Against \n     Corruption (ratified by Mexico on May 27, 1997) and urging \n     the Government of Mexico to participate fully in the \n     Convention's formal implementation monitoring mechanism;\n       (8) helping the Government of Mexico to strengthen \n     education and training opportunities throughout the country, \n     with a particular emphasis on improving rural education; and\n       (9) encouraging the Government of Mexico to create \n     incentives for persons who have migrated to the United States \n     to return to Mexico.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Regarding Bilateral Partnership on \n     Health Care.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government \n     of the United States and the Government of Mexico should \n     enter into a partnership to examine uncompensated and \n     burdensome health care costs incurred by the United States \n     due to legal and illegal immigration, including--\n       (1) increasing health care access for poor and under served \n     populations in Mexico;\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\n       (2) assisting Mexico in increasing its emergency and trauma \n     health care facilities along the border, with emphasis on \n     expanding prenatal care in the United States-Mexico border \n     region;\n       (3) facilitating the return of stable, incapacitated \n     workers temporarily employed in the United States to Mexico \n     in order to receive extended, long-term care in their home \n     country; and\n       (4) helping the Government of Mexico to establish a program \n     with the private sector to cover the health care needs of \n     Mexican nationals temporarily employed in the United States.\n\n              TITLE VI--FAMILY UNITY AND BACKLOG REDUCTION\n\n     SEC. 601.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the \n     ``Hazardous Materials Vulnerability Reduction Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress has specifically given the Department of \n     Homeland Security, working in conjunction with the Department \n     of Transportation and other Federal agencies, the primary \n     authority for the security of the United States \n     transportation sector, including passenger and freight rail.\n       (2) This authority includes the responsibility to protect \n     American citizens from terrorist incidents related to the \n     transport by rail of extremely hazardous materials.\n       (3) Federal agencies have determined that hazardous \n     materials can be used as tools of destruction and terror and \n     that extremely hazardous materials are particularly \n     vulnerable to sabotage or misuse during transport.\n       (4) The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency have found evidence suggesting that \n     chemical tankers used to transport and store extremely \n     hazardous chemicals have been targeted by terrorist groups.\n       (5) Rail shipments of extremely hazardous materials are \n     often routed through highly attractive targets and densely \n     populated areas, including within a few miles of the White \n     House and United States Capitol.\n       (6) According to security experts, certain extremely \n     hazardous materials present a mass casualty terrorist \n     potential rivaled only by improvised nuclear devices, certain \n     acts of bioterrorism, and the collapse of large occupied \n     buildings.\n       (7) A report by the Chlorine Institute found that a 90-ton \n     rail tanker, if successfully targeted by an explosive device, \n     could cause a catastrophic release of an extremely hazardous \n     material, creating a toxic cloud 40 miles long and 10 miles \n     wide.\n       (8) The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that in \n     an urban area a toxic cloud could extend for 14 miles.\n       (9) The United States Naval Research Laboratories concluded \n     that a toxic plume of this type, created while there was a \n     public event on the National Mall, could kill or injure up to \n     100,000 people in less than 30 minutes.\n       (10) According to security experts, rail shipments of \n     extremely hazardous materials are particularly vulnerable and \n     dangerous, however the Federal Government has made no \n     material reduction in the inherent vulnerability of hazardous \n     chemical targets inside the United States.\n       (11) While the safety record related to rail shipments of \n     hazardous materials is very good, recent accidental releases \n     of extremely hazardous materials in rural South Carolina and \n     San Antonio, Texas, demonstrate the fatal danger posed by \n     extremely hazardous materials.\n       (12) Security experts have determined that re-routing these \n     rail shipments is the only way to immediately eliminate this \n     danger in high threat areas, which currently puts hundreds of \n     thousands of people at risk.\n       (13) Security experts have determined that the primary \n     benefit of re-routing the shipment of extremely hazardous \n     materials is a reduction in the number of people that would \n     be exposed to the deadly impact of the release due to an \n     attack, and the principal cost would be the additional \n     operating expense associated with possible increase inhaul \n     for the shipment of extremely hazardous materials.\n       (14) Less than 5 percent of all hazardous materials shipped \n     by rail will meet the definition of extremely hazardous \n     materials under this title.\n\n     SEC. 602. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title, the following definitions apply:\n       (1) Extremely hazardous material.--The term ``extremely \n     hazardous material'' means any chemical, toxin, or other \n     material being shipped or stored in sufficient quantities to \n     represent an acute health threat or have a high likelihood of \n     causing injuries, casualties, or economic damage if \n     successfully targeted by a terrorist attack, including \n     materials that--\n       (A) are--\n       (i) toxic by inhalation;\n       (ii) extremely flammable; or\n       (iii) highly explosive;\n       (B) contain high level nuclear waste; or\n       (C) are otherwise designated by the Secretary as extremely \n     hazardous.\n       (2) High threat corridor.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``high threat corridor'' means a \n     geographic area that has been designated by the Secretary as \n     particularly vulnerable to damage from the release of \n     extremely hazardous materials, including--\n       (i) large populations centers;\n       (ii) areas important to national security;\n       (iii) areas that terrorists may be particularly likely to \n     attack; or\n       (iv) any other area designated by the Secretary as \n     vulnerable to damage from the rail shipment or storage of \n     extremely hazardous materials.\n       (B) Other areas.--\n       (i) In general.--Any city that is not designated as a high \n     threat corridor under subparagraph (A) may file a petition \n     with the Secretary to be so designated.\n       (ii) Procedure.--The Secretary shall establish, by rule, \n     regulation, or order, procedures for petitions under clause \n     (i), including--\n\n       (I) designating the local official eligible to file a \n     petition;\n       (II) establishing the criteria a city shall include in a \n     petition;\n       (III) allowing a city to submit evidence supporting its \n     petition; and\n       (IV) requiring the Secretary to rule on the petition not \n     later than 60 days after the date of submission of the \n     petition.\n\n       (iii) Notice.--The Secretary's decision regarding any \n     petition under clause (i) shall be communicated to the \n     requesting city, the Governor of the State in which the city \n     is located, and the Senators and Members of the House of \n     Representatives that represent the State in which the city is \n     located.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security or the Secretary's designee.\n       (4) Storage.--The term ``storage'' means any temporary or \n     long-term storage of extremely hazardous materials in rail \n     tankers or any other medium utilized to transport extremely \n     hazardous materials by rail.\n\n     SEC. 603.

Mr. CORZINE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill H.R. 2360, making appropriations for the Department \nof Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and \nfor other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) On February 6, 2002, Director of Central Intelligence \n     George Tenet testified that ``[A]l Qaeda or other terrorist \n     groups might also try to launch conventional attacks against \n     the chemical or nuclear industrial infrastructure of the \n     United States to cause widespread toxic or radiological \n     damage.''\n       (2) On April 27, 2005, the GAO found that ``Experts agree \n     that the nation's chemical facilities present an attractive \n     target for terrorists intent on causing massive damage. For \n     example, the Department of Justice has concluded that the \n     risk of an attempt in the foreseeable future to cause an \n     industrial chemical release is both real and credible. \n     Terrorist attacks involving the theft or release of certain \n     chemicals could significantly impact the health and safety of \n     millions of Americans, disrupt the local or regional economy, \n     or impact other critical infrastructures that rely on \n     chemicals, such as drinking water and wastewater treatment \n     systems.''\n       (3) As of May 2005, according to data collected pursuant to \n     the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA), a worst-case release of chemicals \n     from 2237 facilities would potentially affect between 10,000 \n     and 99,999 people, a release from 493 facilities would \n     potentially affect between 100,000 and 999,000, and a release \n     from 111 facilities would potentially affect over one \n     million.\n       (4) On April 27, 2005, the GAO found that EPA RMP data was \n     based on a release from a single vessel or pipe rather than \n     the entire quantity on site and that ``[A]n attack that \n     breached multiple chemical vessels simultaneously could \n     result in a larger release with potentially more severe \n     consequences than those outlined in 'worst-case' scenarios.''\n       (5) On April 27, 2005, the GAO found that ``Despite efforts \n     by DHS to assess facility vulnerabilities and suggest \n     security improvements, no one has comprehensively assessed \n     security at facilities that house chemicals nationwide.'' GAO \n     further testified that ``EPA officials estimated in 2003, \n     that voluntary initiatives led by industry associations only \n     reach a portion of the 15,000 RMP facilities. Further, EPA \n     and DHS have stated publicly that voluntary efforts alone are \n     not sufficient to assure the public of the industry's \n     preparedness.''\n       (6) On June 15, 2005, Thomas P. Dunne, Deputy Assistant \n     Administrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency \n     Response of the EPA testified that ``[O]n1y a fraction of \n     U.S. hazardous chemical facilities are currently subject to \n     Federal security requirements'' and that ``we cannot be sure \n     that every high-risk chemical facility has taken voluntary \n     action to secure itself against terrorism.''\n       (7) On June 15, 2005, Robert Stephan, Acting Undersecretary \n     for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection and \n     Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection at the \n     Department of Homeland Security testified that that the \n     Department ``has concluded that from the regulatory \n     perspective, the existing patchwork of authorities does not \n     permit us to regulate the industry effectively.'' Stephen \n     further testified that ``[I]t has become clear that the \n     entirely voluntary efforts of [chemical facility] companies \n     alone will not sufficiently address security for the entire \n     sector'' and that ``The Department should develop enforceable \n     performance standards . . .''\n       (8) The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, through a series of valuable and wide-\n     ranging hearings, has demonstrated bipartisan commitment to \n     effective Congressional action to protect Americans against a \n     possible terrorist attack against chemical facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the Congress should pass legislation establishing \n     enforceable federal standards to protect against a terrorist \n     attack on chemical facilities within the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1209.

NELSON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 194, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 194) relative to the death of Gaylord \n     A. Nelson, a former United States Senator from the State of \n     Wisconsin.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a resolution \nsubmitted by Senator Frist and Senator Reid to commemorate the life and \nwork of Senator Gaylord Nelson. It is with mixed emotions that I make \nthis statement honoring Senator Nelson.\n  I am proud--proud to have known Gaylord Nelson, proud to be from the \nsame State as him, and proud to occupy his Senate seat. I am also \ndeeply saddened--saddened by the loss to his family, especially to his \nwife of 58 years, Carrie Lee; saddened by the loss to our Nation; and \nsaddened that a personal hero and dear friend of mine is gone. I am \nalso thankful--thankful for Senator Nelson's long life, thankful for \nthe example he set of how to make a difference in this world, and \nthankful to his family for sharing this good and decent man with the \nNation. We mourn his death, but we also celebrate his remarkable \nlegacy.\n  Gaylord Anton Nelson was born on June 4, 1916, in Clear Lake, WI. \nGaylord's parents were always interested in politics, and in true \nWisconsin tradition, they were La Follette Progressive Republicans at \nthe State level and Democrats at the national level. Their Wisconsin-\nstyle progressive politics rubbed off on young Gaylord.\n  When he was 10, Gaylord traveled with his dad to hear a campaign \nspeech by Senator Bob La Follette, Jr., who succeeded his father in the \nSenate in 1925. Gaylord recalls in his biography:\n\n       On the way back home to Clear Lake, my dad asked if I \n     wanted to be a senator. I said I'd love to be a senator, but \n     I'm afraid that Bob La Follette will solve all of our \n     problems before I get a chance to serve.\n\n  Thirty-three years later, Gaylord was nominated to be the Democrat \ncandidate for Governor of Wisconsin. At the 1958 Democrat convention in \nLaCrosse, Gaylord's father had a heart attack. When Gaylord went to see \nhim in the hospital, the elder Nelson smiled and then said to his son, \n``Do you think Bob La Follette left enough problems behind for you to \nsolve?'' Gaylord's father died 10 days later.\n  Unfortunately, Gaylord's father did not get to see his son's rise to \nthe national political level. If he had, he would have seen Gaylord \nattack those ``remaining problems left to solve'' with La Follette-like \ndogged determination and commitment to Progressive politics. From \nconsumer protection to employee rights, Senator Nelson fought doggedly \nto address problems affecting countless Americans.\n  Gaylord Nelson was also willing to take a tough stand. When President \nJohnson requested money to escalate the war in Vietnam, for example, \nNelson was one of three senators to vote against the proposal. In a \nspeech on this floor, he said:\n\n       At a time in history when the Senate should be vindicating \n     its historic reputation as the greatest deliberative body in \n     the world, we are stumbling over each other to see who can \n     say `yea' the quickest and the loudest. I regret it, and I \n     think some day we shall all regret it. . . . Reluctantly, I \n     express my opposition . . . here by voting `nay.' The support \n     in the Congress for this measure is clearly overwhelming. \n     Obviously, you need my vote less than I need my conscience.\n\n  Whether it was issues of war and foreign affairs, worker safety and \nhealth, or access to affordable healthcare, Gaylord Nelson was guided \nby his conscience, and by the wellbeing of Wisconsinites. Out of his \nimpressive record, however, one issue stands out as central to his \nlegacy--Gaylord Nelson's passion and commitment to protecting our \nenvironment.\n  Not many people who have served in this distinguished body can lay \nclaim to a day, but Gaylord Nelson can. On April 22, 1970, Gaylord \nNelson created a day to celebrate the glory of the Earth. Where did \nNelson get his lifelong interest and dedication to the environment? \n``By osmosis,'' Nelson would say, ``while growing up in Clear Lake, \nWI.''\n  It's true that Wisconsin has a tradition of great conservationists--\nAldo Leopold, author of A Sand County Almanac; Sigurd Olson, one of the \nfounders of the Wilderness Society; and John Muir, founder of the \nSierra Club. The people of Wisconsin, living in such a beautiful and \necologically diverse State, feel a special connection to our natural \nresources. We share a long tradition of our State government achieving \nexcellence in its conservation policies. Many Wisconsinites would agree \nwith Senator Nelson that our conservation ethic comes ``by osmosis'' \nfrom the intense natural beauty of our State. Every year I hold a town \nhall meeting in each one of Wisconsin's 72 counties, and protecting the \nenvironment is always one of the top issues raised at these forums.\n  Senator Nelson's vision and determination helped crystallize this \nWisconsin conservation ethic into an international phenomenon. Thanks \nto Gaylord Nelson, Wisconsin can lay claim to the genesis of Earth Day, \na day of national and international reflection on the importance of our \nnatural resources and a clean environment. Thanks to him, for the past \n35\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\nyears, people around the world have taken time out of our lives to \nthink about, learn about and dedicate themselves to conservation. An \nastonishing 20 million Americans--10 percent of the U.S. population at \nthe time--participated in the first observance of Earth Day on April \n22, 1970. American Heritage magazine described the event as ``one of \nthe most remarkable happenings in the history of democracy.'' The day \nwas marked by marches, rallies, teach-ins, and concerts. Fifth Avenue \nwas closed for two hours and over 100,000 people celebrated Earth Day \non Union Square in New York City.\n  Earth Day has become an important part of who we are. From Milwaukee, \nWI to Mumbai, India, millions of people across the world have taken \nSenator Nelson's legacy to heart. People have dedicated thousands of \nhours to volunteer to conserve the environment--whether it's in their \nbackyard, local river, or park.\n  During his 18 years of service in the Senate, Gaylord Nelson brought \nabout significant change for the ``greener'' in both our Nation's laws \nand the institution of the Senate itself. He was the co-author of the \nEnvironmental Education Act, which he sponsored with the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, \nand he sponsored the amendment to give the St. Croix and the Namekagon \nRivers scenic protection.\n  In the wake of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, Gaylord Nelson, \nalong with Senator Philip Hart of Michigan, directed national attention \nto the documented persistent bioaccumulative effects of organochlorine \npesticides used in the Great Lakes by authoring the ban on DDT in 1972. \nHe was the primary sponsor of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore \nAct, protecting one of Northern Wisconsin's most beautiful areas.\n  It is to Gaylord's lasting credit that he was able to fight \ntenaciously for environmental and other causes without alienating or \nantagonizing a soul. His decency, modesty and charm won over even those \nwho didn't share his goals. By all accounts, he was one of the most \nbeloved members this body has seen and, at a time when partisan \ntensions are running high, his willingness to reach out to people \nacross the political spectrum should remind all of us that political \ndisagreement does not have to be personal.\n  As we honor Senator Nelson and his legacy, I hope Congress will re-\ndedicate itself to achieving the bipartisan consensus on protecting the \nenvironment that existed for nearly two decades.\n  This April, Senator Nelson issued a statement to mark the 35th \nanniversary of Earth Day and calling Earth Day 2005 ``a wake up call.'' \nSenator Nelson said:\n\n       On environmental issues, our intelligence is reliable. Our \n     scientists have the facts, if we will only listen. It is a \n     ``slam dunk'' that we cannot continue on our present course. \n     But without Presidential and Congressional leadership, even \n     an enlightened public cannot cope with the greatest challenge \n     of our time.\n\n  As always, Gaylord was right. I know that Wisconsinites value a clean \nenvironment, not just for purely aesthetic or philosophical purposes, \nbut because a clean environment ensures that Wisconsin and the United \nStates as a whole remains a good place to raise a family, to start a \nbusiness, or to buy a home. People across this country share those \nvalues, and we in this body owe it to them and to Gaylord's memory to \nprotect our natural resources.\n  Gaylord Nelson changed the consciousness of a nation. He was a \ndistinguished Governor and Senator, a recipient of the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom, and a personal hero of mine. And he was the \nembodiment of the principle that one person can change the world. But \nSenator Nelson's biographer may have said it best:\n\n       He was always the boy from Clear Lake, Wisconsin, off on \n     adventure.\n\n  Clear Lake is where he will return, but future generations will carry \non his adventure, and his example and principles will show them the \nway.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWisconsin for that beautiful tribute to Gaylord Nelson. He was a hero \nto many of us, and I actually remember the first Earth Day, which \ncertainly does date me. We need more and more people who would follow \nhis example and heed his words about what our obligation to the Earth \nis. So I thank my friend.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nachievements of Senator Gaylord Nelson. The people of Wisconsin owe him \na debt a gratitude for his years of service to the State. And the \nNation owes him honor as the founder of Earth Day and the driving force \nbehind the way the American people and the world view the environment \nand environmental conservation.\n  Gaylord Nelson was born the third of four children on June 4, 1916 in \nClear Lake, WI, a community of about 700 people in the northwest corner \nof the State. Nelson's parents were deeply involved in Clear Lake civic \nactivities and his first lessons in political discourse were around his \nboyhood kitchen table. Those early days were a foundation on which \nSenator Nelson built a lifetime of public service.\n  Senator Nelson first won elected office in 1948, after 4 years in the \nmilitary during World War II. He served as a Wisconsin State Senator, \nGovernor, and then as a U.S. Senator for 18 years. As Governor, he \nfought to preserve Wisconsin's forests and wetlands long before those \ncauses became popular nationally. As a Senator, he built on his \nenvironmentalist legacy working to protect the Appalachian Trail \ncorridor and to create the national trail system. He fought for \nconsumer protection and was one of only three Senators to vote against \nthe $700 million appropriation that signaled the start of the ground \nwar in Vietnam.\n  However, Gaylord Nelson's greatest gift was his vision of a national \nday to protect and celebrate our environment. What started out as an \nidea in the early 1960's blossomed into a national day of observance \nwith an estimated 20 million demonstrators participating in the first \nEarth Day in 1970. Earth Day is still celebrated. This year 500 million \npeople in 167 countries took part.\n  Earth Day publicized in an unprecedented manner the dangers of \npoisons in our water and air, pesticides in our drinking water, and \nchemicals in our soil. Armed with information and a spirit of activism, \nAmericans turned their Earth Day celebrations into a movement \npressuring Congress and the President to pass the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and \nSuperfund legislation. These are the foundation of our environmental \nlaw today, and they would not have been possible without the work and \nvision of Senator Gaylord Nelson.\n  Though Gaylord Nelson left the Senate in 1981, he never stopped \nworking for the Earth and environment, going on to lead the Wilderness \nSociety's important work on environmental conservation. In 1990, he \nreceived the Ansel Adams Conservation Award, given to a Federal \nofficial who has shown tireless commitment to the cause of conservation \nand the fostering of an American land ethic. In 1992, the United \nNations Environment Programme presented Gaylord Nelson with the Only \nOne World Award. And in 1995, Senator Nelson received the Nation's \nhighest civilian award: the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On that day, \nPresident Clinton proclaimed: ``As the father of Earth Day, he is the \ngrandfather of all that grew out of that event: the Environmental \nProtection Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act.''\n  Senator Gaylord Nelson worked not just for our State, or even just \nour country. His gift was to the Earth and his legacy, a cleaner, \nhealthier world. And though Gaylord is gone, he lives on--for us and \ninto the future--in every clear stream, breath of fresh air and virgin \ntrail. We honor him by thinking as he did, globally and responsibly. We \nhonor him by--on every day, not just Earth day--taking seriously our \nresponsibility to the air, land and water that sustain us.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
