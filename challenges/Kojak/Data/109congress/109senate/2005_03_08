Madam President, we have made tremendous progress on the \nbankruptcy bill over the last 2 weeks. Republicans and Democrats have \nstood together to support a bankruptcy reform package that the House \nwill pass and the President will sign into law. The Senate has resisted \nattempts to renegotiate hard-fought compromises and legislate on \nunrelated issues. I do thank my colleagues, our colleagues, for staying \nfocused on the bankruptcy bill.\n  There have been many attempts to sidetrack the Senate on this bill. \nBut let me just take a moment to reiterate why we need bankruptcy \nreform and what this bill really does.\n  The bill before us establishes a means test based on a simple, fair \nprinciple: those who have the means should repay their debts. Personal \nbankruptcies are skyrocketing, and wealthy debtors are walking away \nfrom debts that they had the ability to repay. Opportunistic debtors \nwho have the means to repay use the law to evade personal \nresponsibility.\n  This abuse does not hurt the creditor only, it hurts all who pay \nhigher fees and prices as a result. Every bill that you and I pay, that \nour families pay, includes a ``bankruptcy tax'' of about $400 a year \nper household. That tax is figured into every bill, every phone bill, \nevery electric bill, every mortgage payment, every furniture purchase \nor car loan we pay. Interest rates are higher, downpayment requirements \nare larger, grace periods become shorter, late payment penalties become \nastronomical--all because some people are shirking their debt \nobligations.\n\n  This legislation is targeted to ensure that wealthy debtors who can \npay their debts do so. It specifically exempts anyone who earns less \nthan the median income in their State, and it also allows every \nconsumer to show special circumstances if they cannot handle a \nrepayment plan.\n  We know that one reason people file for bankruptcy is because of \nunexpected medical emergencies. Consequently, this legislation allows \nevery filer to deduct 100 percent of their medical costs. We also know \nthat education is a big outlay for many families. Under bankruptcy \nreform, parents can deduct private school tuition to protect their \nchildren's educational opportunities.\n  In addition, the bankruptcy bill strengthens protections for child \nsupport and alimony payments. It protects\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\npatient privacy and care during bankruptcy proceedings that involve \nhealth care facilities. It protects consumers from deceptive credit \npractice that can lead to financial distress, and it protects the \nsystem that allows America to be one of the most generous countries \nwhen it comes to bankruptcy.\n  There remain, however, some misconceptions about this bill that \nshould be dispelled. The first regards our protections for Active-Duty \nmilitary personnel and veterans. Some opponents of the bill charge that \nwe do not adequately address the needs of our combat men and women who \nsuffer financially.\n  Madam President, it should go without saying that the Senate and the \nAmerican people deeply honor our men and women in uniform. Every day, \nthese young soldiers sacrifice to protect us and to defend the freedom \nwe enjoy. We are indebted to them for the dangers they face on the \nfield, and we are indebted to their families they leave in order to \nfight for that freedom.\n  That is why last Tuesday we passed the Sessions amendment to help \nclarify protections for our military and others under a safe harbor in \nthe bill. This provision, which passed with 63 votes, makes explicitly \nclear that Active-Duty military and low-income veterans are protected \nby the safe harbor. In addition, it also protects debtors with serious \nmedical conditions.\n  On this issue, the other side has created a red herring designed to \nscore political points and shift the debate away from bankruptcy abuse. \nAnother red herring is the charge that the bankruptcy bill sacrifices \nconsumers to benefit credit card companies. The truth is that the bill \nbefore us includes several carefully negotiated amendments that \nexpressly protect credit card holders.\n  Among its beefed-up consumer protections are increased disclosure \nrequirements for credit card statements and mandates that credit card \ncompanies assist borrowers in determining how long it will take to pay \noff their credit card balances, additional disclosures to borrowers \nbuying and refinancing their homes, and additional disclosures \nregarding credit card introductory rates and new disclosures related to \ncredit card late fees.\n  These protections are the result of lengthy and careful negotiation. \nAdditional measures should be properly addressed in the Banking \nCommittee. As Senator Sessions has pointed out, we are debating a \nbankruptcy bill designed to create a fair and commonsense process in \nthe Federal courts.\n  Moreover, the bill before us has passed this body three times, with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. In the 105th Congress, it passed by a \nvote of 97 to 1. In the 106th Congress, it passed 83 to 14. And again \nin the 107th Congress, it passed by a vote of 82 to 16.\n  It is time to take action on this much needed reform that is \nsupported by both sides of the aisle.\n  I am confident that by working together we can get this done in this \nCongress, this week, and see bankruptcy reform signed into law. I \nencourage our Members, this afternoon, to vote for cloture so we can \nbring this bill to fruition, to make it the reality we know the \nAmerican people deserve.\n  It is long past time to stop the abuses of the Bankruptcy Code. The \nlegislation before us is thoughtful. It is built on common sense. It \noffers the opportunity to give the system, and the people it is \ndesigned to help, a fresh start. In short, it promises to deliver \nmeaningful solutions that will keep America moving forward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2200-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I understand that at 10:15, the Senator \nfrom New York is to be recognized to offer an amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this bankruptcy bill is mean-spirited \nand unfair. In anything like its present form, it should and will be an \nembarrassment to anyone who votes for it. It is a bonanza for the \ncredit card companies, which made $30 billion in profits\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\nlast year, and a nightmare for the poorest of the poor and the weakest \nof the weak.\n  It favors the credit card companies, the giant banks, and the big car \nloan companies at every turn. It favors the worst of the credit \nindustry--the interest rate gougers, the payday lenders, and the \nabusive collection agencies. It hurts real people who lose their \nsavings because of a medical crisis or lose their jobs because of \noutsourcing or suffer major loss of income because they were called up \nfor duty in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  It protects corporate interests at the expense of the needs of real \npeople. It does absolutely nothing about the glaring abuses of the \nbankruptcy system by the executives of giant companies such as Enron, \nWorldCom, and Polaroid, who lined their own pockets but left thousands \nof employees and retirees out in the cold.\n  It favors companies like MBNA, a top credit card issuer, with over \n$80 billion in loans, which has contributed $7 million to Federal \ncandidates, a half a million dollars to President Bush alone, and spent \nover $20 million in lobbying, since 1997, when their lobbyists wrote \nthis bill.\n  On the other side are people like special ed teacher Fatemeh Hosseini \non the front page of Sunday's Washington Post. She fell on hard times \nwhen her husband left her and their three children. After her credit \ncard debt reached $25,000, she stopped using the cards and took a \nsecond job to try to pay down that debt. She paid $2,000 a month but \nwas hit with very high interest rates, which were raised even higher \nbecause of missed payments, heavy late fees, and over-limit penalties.\n  She made no new purchases, but by last June her $25,000 debt had \nnearly doubled to almost $50,000. The longer she tried to pay what her \nstatements told her were her minimum payments, the more her debt went \nup. When all of her salary was going for payments, she had no choice: \nshe was forced into bankruptcy, in the hope of getting the ``fresh \nstart'' the Nation has long provided to its working people when they \nhit bottom.\n  This bill says to companies like MBNA: We'll help you scare that \nteacher out of going into bankruptcy by making the bankruptcy process \nexpensive and burdensome to people like her. If we can't scare her \naway, we will help you squeeze your high interest rates out of her for \na few years longer, even though she can't possibly pay off the amount \nshe owes. We will take sides with companies like you and against people \nlike her.\n  That is what this bill says. We all know that is wrong. How could the \nSenate possibly do something so immoral and unreasonable and unfair to \nour constituents when they are most in need of our help? Where are the \nvaunted values our colleagues talk about so much? Why didn't the \nJudiciary Committee do something about this travesty before it reached \nthe floor? Why haven't we fixed it on the floor after more than a week \nof debate?\n  This bill was bulldozed through the committee on the pretense that we \nshould not deal with its serious problems there but should wait until \nit reached the full Senate for serious negotiations and basic \nimprovements. We were assured that there would be good-faith \ndiscussions and compromises and that all reasonable amendments would be \ngiven fair consideration.\n  But now there has been no good faith at all--no meaningful \ndiscussions, no negotiation, no real consideration of any of the very \nreasonable amendments that have been proposed to give this bill some \nshred of balance and fairness. On the contrary, the Republican \nleadership has invoked the strictest possible party discipline. When \nindividual Republicans say they want to support or offer constructive \namendments, they are ordered not to do so. Even when a Republican \nidentifies a serious gap in the bill, such as the very basic \njurisdiction outrage pointed out by Senator Cornyn, an outrage that has \nprejudiced workers and retirees in almost every State, the Republican \nleadership said no and refused to let the amendment be called up.\n  The excuse for this bad faith and breach of promise is itself \nbizarre. The Republican leaders say they cannot upset the delicate \ncompromise reached two Congresses ago, but the only real compromise was \nthe one that had the Schumer amendment in it, and this year's bill \ndoesn't have that amendment in it. In committee Senator Schumer \ndiscussed his amendment, but I didn't see the other side jumping up to \nadopt it in order to restore and preserve the so-called compromise. The \nfloor leaders have not indicated that they plan to accept this \namendment to restore and preserve the supposed compromise.\n  Let's be clear--any pretense of protecting a previous compromise \ndisappeared when the bill's sponsors unilaterally took the Schumer \namendment out of the bill before introducing it this year. So there is \nno compromise before us in the first place. What's more, even the 2001 \nbill is now totally obsolete.\n  A great deal has happened in the past 4 years that helps us \nunderstand the real issues in this bill and shows that abuse of the \nsystem by consumers is not the real problem. We have now felt the full \nimpact of the Bush economic decline, the broad record levels of \nsustained unemployment.\n  We have seen an explosion of medical costs, prescription drug costs, \nand health insurance costs. We have seen job after job eliminated or \ndowngraded or outsourced.\n  A half million guardsmen and reservists have been called to active \nduty in Afghanistan or Iraq, leaving their families and their jobs and \ntheir small businesses behind to suffer the economic consequences, but \nthis Senate said no to the Durbin amendment.\n  We have seen the enormous harm caused to employees and retirees by \ncorporate mismanagement and fraud at major companies like Enron and \nWorldCom and Polaroid, which abused the bankruptcy laws to avoid their \nobligation to their own loyal workers. We have seen credit card rates \ngo higher and higher and higher, as high as 30 percent or more, plus \nfees and penalties and charges, raising credit card profits by another \n$10 billion, even as general interest rates remain low.\n  We have seen the credit card companies use a self-help remedy for the \nproblems they create by their own indiscriminate and predatory \nmarketing practices. They charge still higher risk-based rates to the \nvery same people who can't even afford the lower bait-and-switch rates.\n  We now know a lot more about the abuse of bankruptcy this bill was \nsupposedly designed to address. Four years ago we were told we were a \nnation of bankruptcy abusers. But now, thanks to the careful study of \nactual bankruptcy case files, we know the truth. We know that 50 \npercent of the families who go bankrupt have suffered from serious \nmedical problems and have exhausted their savings. Most of those \nfamilies had paid for health insurance, but it still left them with no \nfinancial protection from serious illness or accidents.\n  If the family is impacted by cancer, you know right at the outset, \neven if they have health insurance, they are going to have a $35,000 \nbill. If it is the heart or stroke, it may be $20,000. If they have a \nchild, spina bifida, autism, other kinds of serious children's \ndiseases, it is going to be $15,000 to $20,000. We know that right at \nthe start. And in too many instances, that is just enough to throw \nhard-working Americans into the bankruptcy system and the harsh \nprovisions of this legislation. Most of these families tried in every \npossible way to avoid bankruptcy for years. They gave up food and \nmedicine and utilities and other necessities of life and even \ntransferred their elderly parents into less adequate nursing homes in \norder to try and avoid bankruptcy. But facts like these don't bother \nthe sponsors of this bill. They just make it up as they go along.\n\n  In the past week, for example, some of us offered amendments that \nwould exempt people from the burdensome procedures in this bill if \ntheir finances were devastated by medical problems or because they were \ncalled up for military duty, and they were voted down. Instead the \nbill's sponsors introduced and adopted a devious amendment that they \nsaid would do what our amendment did. But, of course, it did nothing of \nthe kind. It simply added some words about medical costs and military \ncallups in a way that did not change the real substance of the \ncommittee's bill.\n  The sponsors also said our amendments exempting those below the \nmedian income from the means test were\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\nunnecessary because low-income filers were already exempt. If they \nreally mean what they say about no means testing for people below the \nmedian income, then they should not be refusing to accept our amendment \nwhich makes that exemption absolutely clear.\n  Another Democratic amendment would have placed a generous limit of 30 \npercent on the interest rates any credit card company could charge. It \nvery carefully stated that it would not change the status quo in States \nwhich already had lower limits. That didn't stop the bill's supporters \nfrom claiming that the bill would be an intrusion on States rights \nbecause it would lift the limit in States with a lower limit.\n  And perhaps the most outrageous claim of all, one which I thought was \ndead and buried after it was dragged out in 2001, was dragged out \nagain--a big blue chart and all--and further inflated in their debate. \nThe sponsors repeated the old chestnut that every American family is \npaying $400 a year in a hidden bankruptcy tax for abuses that this bill \nwould stop. Only now they say this mysterious tax has risen to $550 per \nperson per year.\n  How is the original $400 number calculated? The debts discharged from \nall consumer bankruptcies each year are about $40 billion. There are \n100 million families in the United States. Therefore, those consumer \nbankruptcies must be costing each family $400 per family. But this \nphony math assumes that every dollar discharged in bankruptcy, 100 \npercent, could have been collected in full, if not for the massive \nabuse of the system by every consumer who goes bankrupt.\n  It assumes that the credit card companies and payday lenders and \nother lenders who collect this debt under the bill would somehow \ndistribute it to all 100 million American families instead of keeping \nit for themselves. Obviously, neither of these assumptions is true. \nEven the bill's supporters have long ago conceded that the maximum \nconceivable amount recoverable from the consumer bankruptcies is about \n10 percent of the total. Other estimates conclude that the real number \nis a small fraction of that.\n  We don't have to guess what a responsible lender's loss from \nbankruptcy abuse might be. The lead-off pro-bill witness at our hearing \non the bill was the head of the Wisconsin community credit union, \ntestifying for the national credit union lobby. He told us in the last \n9 years his credit union has had an average of 10 bankruptcies a year \nfrom 11,000 members. He estimated that the 9-year loss from abusive \ncases was $15,000 to $75,000, with the higher figure based on an \nunlikely assumption of 15 percent abuse. His credit union's loss from \npossible abuse spread across its entire membership was 15 to 74 cents a \nyear per member--not per every family in his county or state, but just \nhis members. Yes, a real 15 cents instead of the mythical $400 dollars \nwe have heard about for years on this floor.\n  Why is that lender's loss from abuse so low? Because that credit \nunion cares about its members, who are also its owners. It gives them a \ncredit level appropriate to their finances, and does not promote \nacross-the-board increases in credit limits. It routinely monitors \ncredit card debt for signs of trouble. When members hit hard times, the \ncredit union does not pounce on them. It looks for ways to help them \nout. In short, it is a careful and responsible lender, not a predatory \nlender.\n  Hello? Could this tell us something about the real problem here? \nPerhaps the credit card companies who are really pushing this bill \nshould think again about having solicitation desks every fifty feet in \nthe airport, offering gifts to anyone who signs up for a card. Perhaps \nthey should think twice about offering multiple cards to young college \nstudents. Perhaps they should not encourage people to raise their card \nlimits recklessly or send them pre-printed checks against their \naccounts in junk mailings. Perhaps they should not send monthly \nstatements urging their customers to pay only the monthly minimum and \npile up their debt.\n  This bill does nothing to prevent the enticements that the credit \ncard companies use to run up their profits. It does nothing to prevent \nthe real abuses of the system by those who use unlimited homestead \nexemptions or ``protective'' trusts to hide tens of millions of dollars \nfrom the bankruptcy process.\n  We still have time for common sense amendments on all of these \nissues, but unless there is a change in direction, Republican party \ndiscipline will be invoked to defeat them.\n  In fact, the present bankruptcy system has an effective way of \ndealing with real abusers. Bankruptcy judges can and do deny the \npetitions of those who have defrauded or abused the bankruptcy process. \nThe corporate sponsors of this bill know that, but their real \nmotivation is only partly to squeeze millions more dollars from the \npeople who do get into the bankruptcy system.\n  The more insidious purpose of this bill is to frighten people away \nfrom the system altogether, by making it so burdensome and expensive, \nthat they delay filing for bankruptcy or never file. That way, the \npredatory lenders can continue to collect excessive interest and fees \nand penalties month after month from people who cannot afford to pay \nthem.\n  What this bill does to catch the very small number of potential \nabusers--most of whom can be caught and screened out under the existing \nsystem--is to impose huge new paperwork and filing and counseling and \nother barriers on all those who seek to enter the system, whether they \nare above or below the median income level, and whether or not there is \nthe slightest indication that they are trying to game the system.\n  Why else would the bill place such strict and intolerable personal \nliability on the bankruptcy lawyer for mistakes made in the detailed \ninformation provided by the client? In Boston and throughout the \ncountry, pro-bono lawyers from leading firms now lend a hand with \nbankruptcy filings to people down on their luck. The sponsors know that \nif this bill passes, those firms will not let their lawyers do that \npublic interest work, because the risk will be too high.\n  There is so much wrong with this bill that we must take the time to \nget it right. That is why we must have a serious discussion and \nnegotiation and amendment process.\n  That is why we must defeat tomorrow's cloture vote and continue to \nseek a bill that is not an embarrassment to the Senate and the \nfundamental principle of fairness and simple justice for all. It's \nwrong, deeply wrong, for the Senate to rubber-stamp the greed of the \ncredit card industry.\n  In a few moments, the Senator from New York will be recognized. I \nwanted to add a word of support for his amendment. His amendment is not \nabout abortion. It is about violence. Those who promote the culture of \nlife should not be encouraging acts of violence against any members of \nour society. There is no legitimate reason to oppose this amendment. \nThose who break the law through violence and intimidation should not \nhave bankruptcy as a shield.\n  Finally, in a vote later this afternoon, the Senate will declare its \ntrue loyalties. Do we stand with low- and middle-income families who \nfall on hard times, or do we stand with the credit card companies \nlooking for higher and higher profits at any cost? If we are true to \nour values, we will stand with America's families and defeat this bill \nbecause above all else, America stands for freedom and fairness and \nopportunity. There is nothing fair about a single parent struggling to \nmake ends meet only to be gouged by credit card companies with double-\ndigit rates. There is no freedom in falling ill with cancer and facing \na mountain of medical bills only to be hounded by credit card companies \nto pay them first.\n  And what is fair when an average American who has done everything \nright still has to go alone into bankruptcy court and stand up against \nthe big credit card companies and all their might and try to make a \nfresh start?\n  I am reminded of the words of Leviticus in the 25th chapter which \nreads: If one of your brethren becomes poor and falls into poverty \namong you, then you shall help him, like a stranger or a sojourner, \nthat he may live with you. Take no usury or interest from him, but fear \nyour God that your brother may live with you. You shall not lend him \nyour money for usury nor lend him your food at a profit.\n  One glance at the story of Fatemeh Hosseini shows that even when you \ntry your hardest to repay your debts, you are met by the cold, cruel \nworld of the credit card companies. With our vote\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\nthis afternoon, we have an opportunity to live up to the words of \nLeviticus and our basic values as Americans and vote against this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis leadership on this legislation. The bill we are considering today, \nS. 256, is the bankruptcy reform bill. For American families who have \nbeen absolutely devastated by medical bills, by loss of jobs from \noutsourcing of jobs overseas, by family circumstances beyond their \ncontrol, this bill makes it more difficult to go to bankruptcy court to \nput whatever they have on the table and to try to start anew. It was \nwritten by the financial industry, by credit card companies, and big \nbanks in an effort to make certain that people in debt never get out of \ndebt. They want to make certain that debt will hound you and trail you \nfor a lifetime.\n  When Senator Kennedy offers an amendment and says should we not at \nleast say to people who have been devastated by a medical crisis in \ntheir family and go through bankruptcy that they will have a roof over \ntheir heads, that we will protect their home for $150,000 worth of \nvalue, the Republicans on this side of the aisle said no. They should \nput that home up, lose it if necessary, if they want to file for \nbankruptcy.\n  I offered an amendment that said what about the Guard and Reserve \nunits, men and women who are serving overseas leaving behind businesses \nthat go bankrupt? Should we not give them some consideration in this \nbill? Should not the harshest aspects of this bill not apply to men and \nwomen in uniform serving our country? The Republican side of the aisle \nsaid no; apply the law as harshly as possible to these soldiers as you \nwould to everyone else.\n  Time and again, as we have offered amendments to try to stand up for \nthose who were struggling in America to get by in a tough economy, in \ndifficult times, facing family disasters, the Republican side of the \naisle said it is more important that the credit card companies get \nanother dollar from those families. It is more important that the banks \nprevail. Even if the loans they offered in the first place are illegal, \nwe have to stand by the credit industry.\n  The credit industry will win this battle. American families, American \nsoldiers, and those struggling with medical bills will be the losers.\n  I hope before this bill is completed that a few basic amendments that \nshow common decency and common sense will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 10:15 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of \namendment No. 47 to be offered by the Senator from New York. The time \nuntil 12:15 p.m. will be equally divided for debate.\n  Does the Senator offer the amendment?\n\n\n                            amendment no. 47\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I offer the amendment, and I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be added as a cosponsor to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Reid, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 47.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the discharge, in bankruptcy, of a debt resulting \n from the debtor's unlawful interference with the provision of lawful \ngoods or services or damage to property used to provide lawful goods or \n                               services)\n\n       On page 205, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 332. NONDISCHARGEABILITY OF DEBTS INCURRED THROUGH \n                   VIOLATIONS OF LAWS RELATING TO THE PROVISION OF \n                   LAWFUL GOODS AND SERVICES.\n\n       Section 523(a) of title 11, United States Code, as amended \n     by this Act, is further amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (18), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (19), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (19) the following:\n       ``(20) that results from any judgment, order, consent \n     order, or decree entered in any Federal or State court, or \n     contained in any settlement agreement entered into by the \n     debtor, including any court ordered damages, fine, penalty, \n     citation, or attorney fee or cost owed by the debtor, arising \n     from--\n       ``(A) an action alleging the violation of any Federal, \n     State, or local statute, including but not limited to a \n     violation of section 247 or 248 of title 18, that results \n     from the debtor's--\n       ``(i) harassment of, intimidation of, interference with, \n     obstruction of, injury to, threat to, or violence against, \n     any person--\n\n       ``(I) because that person provides, or has provided, lawful \n     goods or services;\n       ``(II) because that person is, or has been, obtaining \n     lawful goods or services; or\n       ``(III) to deter that person, any other person, or a class \n     of persons, from obtaining or providing lawful goods or \n     services; or\n\n       ``(ii) damage to, or destruction of, property of a facility \n     providing lawful goods or services; or\n       ``(B) a violation of a court order or injunction that \n     protects access to--\n       ``(i) a facility that provides lawful goods or services; or\n       ``(ii) the provision of lawful goods or services.\n\n     Nothing in paragraph (20) shall be construed to affect any \n     expressive conduct (including peaceful picketing or other \n     peaceful demonstration) protected from legal prohibition by \n     the first amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States.''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I hope everybody will pay attention to \nthis debate, which has been going on intermittently in the Chamber for \nthe last 4 or 5 years. Not much has changed, except the votes of some \nof my colleagues, if you can believe the press reports.\n  Let me start by saying I believe in bankruptcy reform. It is very \nwrong for people to abuse the code. But reform should be across the \nboard, it should be applied fairly. It should not be just for some \ninterests. When some interests are abused, we legislate on that, but \nwhen other interests are abused, we do not. It should not sweep under \nthe rug people who have real needs, as the amendments of some of my \ncolleagues--the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from \nIllinois--have tried to address. A reform bill should not contain a \ntrove of treats for some supposed victims of the system, such as banks \nand credit card companies, but leave others shivering in the cold.\n  For this reason, the bankruptcy bill before us today does not do the \ntrick. It has many deficiencies and, to my mind, a glaring, gaping \nhole. While the bill supporters give lipservice to fairness, they have \ncarved out a loophole for those who use violence, for those who seek to \nuse bankruptcy for a purpose it was never intended. It is a loophole \nthat I cannot live with, and, once upon a time, in a different world, \nthe vast majority of Senators agreed with me and voted to close this \nloophole.\n  Most of you are already familiar with this provision. After all, most \nof you have voted for it before. Indeed, this is identical language; \nthere is not a single word change in this amendment, the Schumer-Reid \namendment, from the amendment that was added to the bill a few years \nago. This identical language was contained in the compromise bill we \nhave heard so much about this past week.\n  Along with Senator Reid, I am reintroducing the provision that would \nclose this loophole once and for all. I am pleased that Senators Leahy, \nFeinstein, and Murray are also cosponsors of the amendment.\n  Put simply, the Schumer-Reid amendment would end the ability of \nviolent extremists to hide behind bankruptcy laws to escape court-\nimposed debts. The amendment is very simple: If you use violence or the \nthreat of violence to achieve a goal, a political goal, and you are \nsuccessfully sued--as you should be--by the person or persons you have \nused violence against, you cannot then go back home to a bankruptcy \ncourt and say, protect me. Has anyone who ever envisioned the \nbankruptcy law felt that it should be used to protect those who use \nviolence or threats of violence? I doubt it.\n  There is talk by some of ``peaceful protests.'' As I will talk about \nlater, the bill explicitly protects peaceful protests but not violence \nor the threat of violence. It doesn't matter if you are\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nan extremist in the pro-life movement or the animal rights movement or \nany other movement; if you believe you are so right that you have the \nability to take the law into your own hands and threaten others and do \nviolence to others because your knowledge and feelings are superior to \neverybody else's, you are wrong. That is not American. Again, you \nshould not be allowed to use the Bankruptcy Code to protect yourself \nfrom a rightfully imposed civil remedy.\n  This amendment could really be called the Schumer-Reid-Hatch \namendment because in 2001 Senator Hatch sat down with me and together \nwe worked out this compromise. We worked out this precise language in a \nbipartisan fashion over 4 years ago. There is only one difference--that \nsince we worked out this compromise, which a large number of colleagues \non the other side of the aisle supported, including those who disagree \nwith me on the issue of choice, we have found that a small group in the \nHouse has been able to block the bill if it had this amendment in it. \nThere is no reconsideration of the merits of the amendment. There is no \nargument made against the amendment that hasn't been made before and \nrejected overwhelmingly by this body. It is simply allowing a small few \nin the other body to dictate what we are doing here.\n\n  If reason and logic prevail, this amendment would be considered among \nthe least controversial and most sensible fixes to the current bill. If \nbipartisanship and consistency were the order of the day, this \nprovision, which was unceremoniously stripped from the current bill, \nwould pass again overwhelmingly. The bill is intended to curb abuses of \nthe Bankruptcy Code. But why are we curbing abuses when the victim is a \ncredit card company or a bank but not anybody else? Why not also when \nthe victim is a woman pursuing her constitutional rights? Does that \nwoman have any less rights than a bank or credit card company, or a \ndoctor pursuing a living, doing what he believes is right and what is \nallowed by law, according to the Supreme Court and enshrined in the \nConstitution, and this doctor tries to prevent people from hounding his \nchildren, from threatening them with violence, and then you say, no, we \nare going to protect the credit card companies and the banks but not \nthat doctor, not that woman; is that fair? Is this bill fair and \nbalanced?\n  We want to reform bankruptcy; there are abuses. But why are we only \nreforming the abuses that affect some and not others? Why are we only \nreforming the abuses that affect some of the most powerful interests \nand not those who are weaker or more helpless?\n  In the current climate, I am sad to say that there appears to be an \nedict from the leadership on the other side to vote down every \namendment, no matter what its wisdom for efficacy. That is not what the \nSenate is about, that is not what America is all about, and that is not \nwhat our constituents sent us here to do. It would be a tragedy if that \nsort of marching-in-lockstep attitude affected the Schumer-Reid \namendment.\n  Let me take a minute to describe the history of this amendment, to \nrefresh the recollection of many of my colleagues who may have \nforgotten it. Let me tell you what happened. Of course, Roe v. Wade was \npassed by the Supreme Court in 1973. Many opposed Roe v. Wade; they \nfelt it was against their religious beliefs. I respect those religious \nbeliefs. A large movement of protests developed, the vast majority of \nwhich was peaceful. The former bishop in my home of Brooklyn would \nstand in front of a clinic every week and pray the rosary. That is an \nAmerican thing to do. That is a peaceful protest. But there were some--\nan extreme few--who decided that they were so right, that what they \nheard from God prevailed over what anybody else heard from God, and \nthat they should take the issue into their own hands. Some used the \nmethods of blockade, passive resistance. Others went further. They \nwould put acid on clinics that would render them useless--a destruction \nof personal and private property, if there ever was. They would \nthreaten doctors. They would follow their children going home from \nschool and harass them. Inhumane. They would even encourage people to \nkill doctors. We know doctors who were killed.\n\n  This protest movement was largely successful. It shut down about 80 \npercent of the clinics in America. There were some States and many \ncounties where a woman who was seeking her own right to choose would \nnot get that right, and, as a result, a number of us worked on a law--I \nwas a sponsor in the House, and I believe Senator Boxer was a sponsor \nin the Senate--that would give the clinics that offered people a way to \neffect their right to choose some help. The law made it a Federal crime \nto use violence or the threat of violence against clinics. That was \nnecessary because you had large jurisdictions where the elected sheriff \nsaid, I will not enforce the law, taking matters into his own hands.\n  As we were discussing what to do with this bill, I remember a meeting \nin New York, and a young woman from one of the defense funds that \nrepresent women said: Why don't you include the right to sue, so if the \nFederal Government is unwilling or slow and cumbersome in protecting \nthis Federal right, the clinic could sue. We put it in the bill as an \nafterthought, but it really proved to be the hope and the salvation of \nthe clinics because they began to sue those who would blockade them \nwhen police forces would not enforce the law.\n  There was Dobbs Ferry in New York, where they wanted to enforce the \nlaw. They had a police force of three, and hundreds of people were \nprotesting violently and blockading--not peacefully--and the police \nforce was overwhelmed. But the right to sue opened up these clinics \nand, once again, the constitutional right, available voluntarily to \nwomen.\n  No woman is forced to avail herself of this right; it is choice. That \nis what it is all about--choice. Your beliefs may be different from \nmine, but I respect yours; I hope you respect mine. I am not imposing \nmine on you, and you should not impose yours on me, particularly when \nthey are deeply held religious beliefs. That is America.\n  So the clinics were open again. Many of these violent protesters sort \nof faded away. They realized the legislatures were going to keep the \nRoe v. Wade law, that they could not succeed in overturning it. If you \nbelieve the polls, over 60 percent of Americans support the right to \nchoose. They had turned to violence and threats of violence, and now \nthe FACE law had stymied them in that decidedly un-American way to \nenforce your views or effect your views. So we offered an amendment.\n  I skipped one point. Some of the more militant of these groups--the \nmilitant of the militant--came up with a new way to avoid these civil \nsuits that the FACE law allowed. They said: Go back and declare \nbankruptcy once you are sued, and then they cannot pursue the money \njudgment used against you. This was made particularly difficult because \nmost of the groups that used violence or threats of violence were not \nindigenous. They were not from the local community. There were a lot of \npeople against the clinics in the legal community, but they, like most \nAmericans, effected their views peacefully. But these were sort of \nroving bands of groups from across the country. They would be sued \nsuccessfully, and then they would each go back to their home \njurisdiction and file for bankruptcy.\n\n  It was impossible for these clinics, most of which were small and not \nterribly well funded, to then file after they won the first suit--a \nburden enough to them. They should not have had to do it. It should \nhave been the Federal Government or the local government enforcing the \nlaw. But they went back home, declared bankruptcy, and the clinics were \nnot able to pursue each of those suits in their home States.\n  An example is that of the notorious Nuremberg files case that took \nplace in Portland, OR. The defendants created, in that case, a Web site \nthat collected personal information about providers of abortion, clinic \nstaff, law enforcement officials, judges, and even Senators. The site \nlisted the names of those wounded in gray type and for those who had \nbeen killed--including Dr. Barnett Slepian in my State who was murdered \nin front of his family in 1998--they crossed out the names, as if they \nhad achieved something good.\n  Doctors and their families targeted by this Web site had to wear \nbulletproof vests, install security systems, and take other \nprecautions. As one witness testified before the Judiciary\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\nCommittee, speaking of the targeted doctors:\n\n       They are not secure in their homes or in their offices. \n     They do not sit by windows in restaurants, and they even \n     refrain from hugging their children in front of open windows.\n\n  Can you imagine? Under the FACE law, the victimized doctors sued \nthese violent radicals who would threaten them. Judges and juries sided \nwith the victims and issued verdicts. For example, there was a $109 \nmillion verdict against the Nuremberg defendants. In another case, \nOperation Rescue President Randall Terry ran up $1.6 million in fines \non account of his acts of clinic violence. But did these violent \nextremists pay up? No. They instead filed for bankruptcy to avoid \nresponsibility for their heinous acts. In fact, many of these public \ndefendants publicly bragged about being judgment proof and thumbed \ntheir noses at their victims, forcing years of protracted litigation.\n  Randall Terry, for example, blithely filed for bankruptcy to avoid \npaying his debts. And the Nuremberg file defendants forced bankruptcy \nlitigation for years in six different jurisdictions to avoid their \ndebts. Some of the extremist groups even recruited people and had as a \ncriteria for admission to the group that you make yourself judgment \nproof. One radical group, for instance, the American Coalition of Life \nActivists, drafted its Constitution to state that members of the \norganization ``must have their assets protected from possible civil \nlawsuits (judgment proof).''\n  As one can imagine, with these tactics, it took years to enforce the \njudgments against these violent radicals, and victimized doctors, \nfamilies, and clinics could not get the justice they deserved. We all \nknow that the wheels of justice are sometimes too slow, but tactics \nsuch as this made a mockery of our system.\n  So when the bankruptcy bill came before the Senate back in 1999, I \noffered an amendment to stop this awful abuse of the system. It made \nsense. It was not adding a new issue to the bill. The bill was supposed \nto deal with abuses of bankruptcy, and if there was ever an abuse of \nbankruptcy, what these violent extremists did was an abuse of the \nbankruptcy law. No one, when they wrote the bankruptcy law, thought the \nRandall Terrys of the world deserved protection.\n\n  When I offered the amendment, Senator Hatch and others--some pro-\nchoice, some pro-life--came to me and said: Why are we singling out \npro-life activists who engage in violence and take the law into their \nown hands? What about other extremists who abuse the Bankruptcy Code by \nusing violence or the threat of violence?\n  They were right. So we sat down. We had a fruitful discussion. From \nthis, Senator Hatch and I worked out a compromise with which everyone \ncould live. We hammered out an amendment that was not particular to the \nissue of the clinics but dealt with anybody who would use violence or \nthe threat of violence in the same way--blockades, arson, whatever. \nThey, too, if they had a judgment against them, could not go to \nbankruptcy court and successfully ask for protection.\n  The amendment we have does not mention the word ``abortion'' or \n``choice.'' It simply talks about anyone who uses violence. It would be \napplied with equal force and vigor to animal rights activists, to the \nenvironmental extremists in the ELF movement. It only affects, frankly, \nthose on the far right or the far left who believe they are so morally \nsuperior to all of us that they can avoid this constitutional democracy \nand, with violence, take actions into their own hands. Anyone who \nviolently or misguidedly blocks access to services, whether in the name \nof the pro-life movement, the animal rights movement, the environmental \nmovement, or any other movement, would lose the ability to hide behind \nthe Bankruptcy Code.\n  It would apply equally. It did apply equally to pro-life extremists \nand ecoterrorists, one on the far right and one on the far left. \nIndeed, if militants in the pro-choice movement should block a facility \nthat was pushing abstinence, it would apply to them, too. If violent \natheists blocked access or burned down a church, it would apply to \nthem. It applies to anybody who uses violence and then seeks protection \nof the Bankruptcy Code.\n  This amendment is not about abortion, as its critics attack it. It \ndid have its origins there because that is where violence was used, but \nnow, after the Schumer-Hatch compromise, it is an amendment simply \nabout the rule of law, something everyone of any political party, of \nany political belief who is an American--when you swear your loyalty to \nthe Constitution of the United States, you are basically swearing \nloyalty to the rule of law.\n  Let me underscore this: It does no harm, none, not 2-percent harm, \nnot 1-percent harm, not .1-percent harm; it does zero harm to \nlegitimate protesters who do not engage in violence or threats of \nviolence. The amendment expressly states that ``nothing in this \nprovision shall be construed to affect any expressive conduct, \nincluding peaceful picketing or peaceful demonstration, protected from \nlegal prohibition by the first amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States.'' If you protest peacefully, you are protected. If you \nuse violence or the threat of violence, you are not. That is the \nAmerican way, and we made it clear.\n  People who are against this amendment say it stands in the way of \npeaceful protests. I ask them to cite me a single example where that \nhas happened. It has not.\n  This was a fair amendment. It applied to anyone who used violence to \neffect their means and, in overwhelming numbers, Democrats and \nRepublicans supported it. Virtually all of my Republican colleagues now \non the Judiciary Committee, including some leading pro-life Senators, \nsupported it--Senators Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, and Sessions. I take off \nmy hat to them. They were being fair. I am sure they received a little \npressure: Don't do this. Maybe there were some winks: Hey, maybe this \nviolence is OK because we feel so passionately about an issue. But they \nstood up. To their credit, these Senators, even though they are \nstaunchly pro-life, were reasonable and sensible about the issue.\n  Then on March 15, 2001, a bankruptcy bill, largely identical to the \none before us today, except that it had the Schumer-Reid-Hatch language \nin it, passed in the Senate by a vote of 83 to 15. Only two Republicans \nvoted against it, and that was for reasons other than this amendment.\n  Then, of course, the bill was sent to the House. It looked like as if \nwould pass. I supported the bill with this amendment in it. I have \nalways said I will be for the bill with this amendment because I think \nthis amendment is so important, even though I am not happy with other \nprovisions in the bill. I am, frankly, less happy today with the other \nprovisions in the bill.\n  The bill was sent to the other body, and a fight ensued within the \nRepublican caucus. A large number, probably a majority of the \nRepublican caucus, wanted to support the bill, but a small number who \nwere the most fervent in their pro-life beliefs said no bill. The \nRepublican leadership in the House said since this divides our caucus, \neven though a vast majority of the House would have supported the \nlegislation, in my judgment, they pulled the bill.\n  So now we are back to where we are today. We have basically the same \ncompromise as last year but without the Schumer-Hatch compromise. All I \nam doing today is adding that compromise word for word. Again, not a \ncomma, jot, or tittle has been changed in the bill.\n  I have watched while amendment after amendment offered by Democratic \nSenators to end abuses and close loopholes has been beaten back because \nof an edict that this ``negotiated compromise''--not negotiated \ncertainly with many of us on this side--should be delivered pristine to \nthe House.\n  Republicans defeated an amendment to protect veterans because it was \nnot part of the compromise. That was offered by the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin. For example, a National Guard man or woman, a \nreservist sent overseas does not make the same money they made before, \nand maybe they have to go into bankruptcy. Do we want to come down like \na hammer on these people the same as we would come down on somebody who \nsquandered whatever money they had in Las Vegas gambling? Absolutely \nnot. But the amendment was defeated.\n  There was an amendment that was defeated to protect victims of \nidentity\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\ntheft. I believe that was done by my colleague from Florida, Senator \nNelson, because it was not part of the compromise.\n  Senator Kennedy has eloquently spoken of those who have to go into \nbankruptcy because they do not have adequate health insurance or any \nhealth insurance, and they are putting their every last nickel to save \ntheir husband or their wife or their mother or their father or their \nchild. Again, no protection.\n  An amendment I offered which said millionaires could not abuse the \ncode by setting up a trust and putting all their assets in this trust \nand then declaring bankruptcy and shedding themselves of debt also was \nnot allowed because of the compromise.\n  Mr. President, do you know what was part of the original compromise? \nThe Schumer-Reid amendment or, more correctly, the Schumer-Reid-Hatch \namendment. Yet this provision was stripped from the current bankruptcy \nbill.\n  If Senator Hatch continues to suggest we should honor the grand \ncompromise from last time and not change it, then let's do it for \neverybody. Let's not just take out this provision.\n  What, I ask, has changed since the bill of this language passed by a \nvote of 85 to 13? Absolutely nothing. It was a good law then, it is a \ngood law now. On what basis can my colleagues now oppose the Schumer-\nReid amendment because it targets, among others, those who take the law \ninto their own hands to oppose a woman's right to choose? That is \nnonsense. Senator Reid is the lead cosponsor of the amendment, and he \nis pro-life. And as I have said, the language is not particular to \nabortion.\n  Let me ask my Republican colleagues a question. I hope they are \nlistening: Would my Republican colleagues oppose a broadly worded \nmurder statute because, among other things, prosecutors could bring \ncharges against someone who killed a doctor who would provide abortion \nservices? Would they oppose a neutrally drafted arson statute because \nmen and women who burn down health clinics might come under its ambit?\n  There is no moral reason, no legal reason, no logical reason, for \nSenators who once overwhelmingly supported this language to now oppose \nthe Schumer-Reid amendment. Some of my colleagues have said they are \nstill in favor of this amendment but do not want the entire bankruptcy \nbill to be held up because of it. My purpose is not to hold up the \nbankruptcy bill, and I think my colleagues on the other side who worked \nwith me over the years on this bill understand that. My purpose is to \npreserve the rights of those who seek to do constitutionally protected \nacts in the face of violence.\n  So I ask my colleagues to please think about what they are doing. If \nthey vote against this amendment, they are voting against the rule of \nlaw. If they vote against this amendment, they are voting against the \nfundamental way we do things in America. If they vote against this \namendment, many of my colleagues are voting exactly the opposite of \nwhat they did a few years ago. I ask my colleagues not to change their \nvote because of political expediency. If my colleagues turn their back \non this amendment now, it will be a turnaround, an about-face, on \nfairness, on reform, and on bipartisanship.\n  As I have said, this is not pro-choice or pro-life. It is pro rule of \nlaw and it is antiviolence. No matter how strongly people feel--and I \nrespect people's passions; I respect their passions whether they come \nfrom religion or politics or anything else--the greatest danger our \nRepublic faces is apathy, so people who feel passionately are good. \nBecause someone feels passionately, they should not be allowed to take \nthe law into their own hands and then hide like a coward behind the \nbankruptcy law.\n  Just as we are trying to end the abuses of the bankruptcy law when it \naffects banks, we should also end abuses of that law when it affects \nvictims of violence. It is vital that we make the law perfectly clear \nthat debts incurred by violent extremists who take the law into their \nown hands are nondischargeable, and that is all this amendment does, no \nmore or no less. If we do not, individuals and organizations seeking to \nshut down public facilities, whether they be clinics, powerplants or \nanimal laboratories, will continue to force victims of clinics and \nother violence into a world of perpetual litigation by using the \nBankruptcy Code as it was never intended.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. Most of them did once \nand they should do so again.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, my colleague from Alabama is in the \nChamber. I was going to ask that the time be equally divided as we were \nin the quorum call and not charged to myself, but if my colleague from \nAlabama is taking the time, then that is moot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from New York. As someone who has \nworked hard on this bankruptcy legislation for the 8 years I have been \nin the Senate, I have learned a political lesson that no matter how \nmuch bipartisan support a bill has, how much momentum it has, how \nneeded it is, things can go awry.\n\n  In the last passage of this bill, Senator Schumer offered, and \naggressively argued, for the amendment that we are debating today. The \nleadership on this side of the aisle said, OK, we will accept it. I \nrealized that it was problematic for a number of reasons. I opposed the \namendment, but it passed, and without a whole lot of objection, I \nsuppose, from this side. The truth is it then became the single factor \nin the House's rejection of the bankruptcy bill, a bill that passed \nthis body by a vote of 83 to 15. It was really a remarkable sort of \nevent.\n  Let me just say a few things about the bankruptcy procedure. It has \nlong been a fundamental principle of bankruptcy that while a bankrupt \nindividual may bankrupt against their lawful debts, wipe them all out, \nand pay none of those debts, it has always been the law that a bankrupt \nmay not discharge, may not wipe out, erase the debts that they incur as \na result of intentional or willful misconduct.\n  If a debtor lists debts that arise from an intentional wrong against \nsomeone, the trustee in bankruptcy or a creditor or any of the \ncreditors can object to that discharge, and they would note that it \nshould not be wiped out, it should not be discharged, because it is a \ndebt that arises from a willful, wrongful act.\n  The court then considers that and determines whether or not the debt \nshould be wiped out and whether or not it was a debt that arose from a \nnondischargeable reason like willfulness.\n  Senator Schumer's amendment says that willful violators of abortion \nclinic protest prohibitions, and really a lot of other protestors, it \nappears to me--maybe unions, civil rights, environmental, I think he \nhas said that they are covered here--he says that if willful violators \nof abortion clinics and these others included in his bill are sued and \na judgment is rendered against this protestor under Federal law, then \nautomatically those judgments are not subject to discharge; the court \ndoes not review it; they remain a debt of the protestor for their life, \nand they can be pursued by collection attempts for as long as that debt \nexists, and it can be for some time.\n  What we do know is this: Abortion clinic protestors have been sued \nfor misbehavior at abortion clinics under the FACE Act. Some of these \npeople have been relentless in their actions and have acted repeatedly \nin violation of law, and they have been sued. Judgments have been \nrendered against them. Most of them do not violate the law. As the \nSenator has said, the archbishop prays the rosary and conducts lawful \nacts, demonstrating his concern over the taking of what I consider to \nbe life by the abortion act, and this is a free country and they are \nallowed to do that. But there are certain things that one cannot do in \nthat protest, and a number of people in the past, a lot more than is \ncurrently happening, frankly, violated those prohibitions of the FACE \nAct. They have been sued and judgments have been rendered against them.\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\n  We also know that some of those protestors who had judgments rendered \nagainst them went to bankruptcy court and sought to wipe out their \ndebts and not pay these debts for their protests, to discharge them \nfrom bankruptcy.\n  Finally, we know that under the current law, and under the law that \nis in the bankruptcy bill that is moving forward today, it has not \nchanged on this point. That law prohibits the discharge of debts \narising from willful acts. In every single case that the courts have \nconsidered petitions for discharge, in these abortion FACE Act \nviolation cases, the bankruptcy court has refused to discharge the \ndebt. They say, no, it was a willful act and you cannot discharge it; \nyou still owe it. And the abortion clinic plaintiff or doctors or \nwhoever is victimized can continue to pursue collection wherever they \ngo. They can file garnishments against people's wages, file judgments \nagainst their property and pursue them aggressively and steadfastly to \ncollect that debt. That is what the law has said every single time, and \nthere is not much dispute about that. I do not think the Senator from \nNew York would dispute that.\n\n  By his amendment, the Senator from New York, because of his concern \nover these very few cases, frankly, but he is concerned about it and \nhas raised the issue a number of times, has managed, as a result of his \nsuccessful passing of that amendment on this Senate floor 2 years ago, \nto cause the bankruptcy bill and all of its important parts to actually \ndie and not become law because the House refused to accept it. Because \nof his concern, I know he has offered this again.\n  What he would want to say, and what his amendment says, I think \nfairly stated, is that a protestor and not just abortion clinics but \nany number of protestors who are sued under Federal law, and a judgment \nis rendered against them, Senator Schumer would want to make that \njudgment automatically not dischargeable, automatically without review \nby the court or any examination of the facts of the situation, to say \nit should not be discharged and will remain a permanent debt of the \nprotestor.\n  I know the Senator said we all voted for this and there was some sort \nof agreement. I really do not think there was an agreement about this. \nAs I recall, it came up in the Judiciary Committee. Chairman Hatch was \ntrying to move the bill forward, as he frequently does, and allowed it \nto become accepted by a voice vote without any big to-do. It came up to \nthe floor and was debated again, and a decision was made that we would \njust allow it to pass. It was not that big a deal as people saw it at \nthe time.\n  I opposed it. I did not feel good about targeting these kinds of \ncases. I thought that the current law was acceptable and we should not \ngo in this direction, but it passed and I voted for final passage of \nthe overall bankruptcy bill. So I think that is why the Senator says I \nand others voted for it. A lot of people voted for the bill on final \npassage that may not have voted for the amendment on the floor.\n  Regardless of that, the question is, now what should we do? I would \njust note that there are a number of reasons why I think this should \nnot be a part of the bill. First, as I have noted, these protestors \nhave lost every single case in which they have sought to discharge \ndebts arising from judgments under the FACE Act. The current bankruptcy \nlaw and this bill will say flatly that such debts are not dischargeable \nif the injury is the result of a willful, malicious act, as these \nviolations for the most part are.\n  So, first, it is not necessary, and I would again note that the bill \ncovers more than just abortion protestors. There could be any number of \nprotestors. I think about the situation where maybe somebody from \nAlabama goes up to the southern district of New York and gets sued up \nthere and a big judgment is rendered against them for taking a position \nunpopular in New York or maybe, as has happened in the past, people \nfrom New York have come down to Alabama and have been involved in \nprotests and could have judgments rendered against them in local \ncourts. So the Senator would say that under no circumstances, when that \njudgment were to appear on a discharge petition in bankruptcy court, \nwould the court have any authority to look behind it. This Federal \nbankruptcy judge would have no authority to look behind this judgment \nto see if it was willful or intentional as the current law and the law \nhas always been in bankruptcy, to my recollection, pretty much from the \nhistory of bankruptcy law. He would not look behind it and he would \ndecide automatically it is a judgment not dischargeable. I am not sure \nthat is good policy. I am not sure we want to do that. As a matter of \nfact, I do not think it is. I think the current law works. We should \nnot do this. The Schumer amendment is bad policy. I disagree with it. I \ndo not think it is the biggest deal in the entire world, but I think \nunder the legal system and the principles of this bill, we would be \nbetter off allowing the bankruptcy court to consider these debts and \nexamine them to make sure they meet the standards of discharge.\n\n  There is a big practical reason. This bill has passed the Senate four \ntimes by an overwhelming vote. One time I think it was 97 to 1. It has \nbeen marked up in the Senate Judiciary Committee four times, and it has \nnot been lightly considered on the floor of the Senate. It has been the \nsubject of hours and hours and days of debate. We are already into the \nsecond week on this bill. After all the debate and all the hoopla we \nhave had, and so many other issues, we continue to pound away at this \nlegislation for reasons that I am unable to fathom. But we are moving \nforward. I believe we will pass it again.\n  What is the practical reason? The House of Representatives rejected \nthis bill the last time for the sole reason of the Schumer amendment. \nIt is unbelievable. As much as we had in this bill, all the pages of \nthis legislation, one little amendment killed this legislation, an \namendment that I believe is bad policy, certainly not necessary, and I \nsubmit could result in killing this legislation again if we move it \nforward.\n  So let's not do it. Let's not do this. Let's not go beyond the bill \nthat we have now, that came out of the Judiciary Committee with a \nbipartisan vote, an overwhelming vote out of the Judiciary Committee to \ncome to the floor without the Schumer amendment in it. Let's not add \nthis amendment and jeopardize the passage of the bill.\n  Let's not add this amendment and perhaps take a step, I submit with \nall seriousness, that could curtail protests and freedom of expression \nin America. Sure the protesters have lost every time. I believe they \nshould have lost every time under the law. But there may be some times, \nunder some of these provisions of Federal law, that could result in \njudgments that legitimate protesters were simply standing up under \nhostile circumstances in a hostile jurisdiction for what they truly \nbelieve in, and then the bankruptcy judge has no ability whatsoever to \nprohibit this judgment from sticking against them perhaps for the rest \nof their lives.\n  I don't know.\n  I don't think the law is failing in this regard, and I do not think \nthe law is being abused in this regard. I think it is being handled \nwell. We do not need this amendment for the reasons I stated, and for \nother reasons, frankly, that I will not state at this time.\n  I urge the rejection of the Schumer amendment and note with pleasure \nthat Senator Hatch, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, now \na senior Republican member of it who has worked on this legislation \nsince the beginning, is on the Senate floor. I am pleased to yield to \nhim.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague. \nAs usual, he has done a very good job in outlining what is involved in \nthis bankruptcy bill, and I believe he deserves a lot of credit for the \nhard work he has done on the floor.\n  Mr. President, comes now the Schumer amendment or, should I say, \ncomes again the Schumer amendment. I rise to speak in opposition to \nthis amendment. Been there. Done that. In fact, I have been there and \ndone that a few times.\n  I have been around here long enough to know a poison pill when I see \none. And make no mistake about it, this has become a classic poison \npill amendment.\n  I have worked in good faith for several years to attempt to \nneutralize the\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\ncounterproductive effects of this amendment. But no matter how we try \nto adjust the language, we cannot overcome the basic flaw in the \namendment: The Schumer amendment is a solution in search of a problem.\n  I oppose this amendment. It is no secret that I am genuinely fond of \nthe senior Senator from New York. While I frequently disagree with him \non issues, I respect enormously his political skills.\n  Even when from my perspective he is wrong--such as the leadership \nrole he has played in organizing the first permanent filibusters of \nmajority-supported judicial nominations--I know that he always tries to \nact in a heartfelt manner that advances his political agenda.\n  We have been able to achieve compromises on many issues over the \nyears. Senator Schumer and I have worked together on many crime issues. \nFor example, we have worked on language pertaining to the designation \nof high-intensity drug trafficking areas.\n  Over a period of years we have tried to work together on the subject \nmatter of the pending amendment to the bankruptcy bill. I have always \nbeen willing to work with him and others in the interest of passing the \nbankruptcy reform bill.\n  From the beginning of this debate, many others and I have long \ncontended that his amendment is unnecessary on its own merits. The \namendment which we consider today appears to seek to guarantee the \ncollection of civil and criminal penalties arising from \ncriminal violations of the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances \nAct. The purpose of the Schumer amendment is to make clear that those \nwho are fined due to attacks on abortion clinics are prevented from \nbeing able to discharge these fines and civil judgments resulting from \nsuch attacks through bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n  My friend from New York has pushed a hot button. He must know that. \nInjecting the polarizing politics of abortion into the bankruptcy bill, \nmost would have to agree, does not appear to be calculated to help the \npassage of the bankruptcy bill. Quite the opposite, the Schumer \namendment has become a wedge issue that has stopped the bill in the \npast and, today, can threaten the passage of this important bipartisan \nbill that enjoys broad bicameral support.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Schumer amendment. Let me \nfirst explain my substantive objections and then I will describe my \nprocedural, pragmatic, and political concerns with the Schumer \namendment.\n  At the outset, it should be understood that in its best light the \nSchumer amendment is a belts-and-suspender proposition that attempts to \nsolve a problem which, as far as I can tell, has never actually \noccurred.\n  We have been debating this bill for 8 years, and I am still unaware \nof any actual case in which a person who has been fined for harming a \nperson or property in connection with any unlawful protests against, or \nattacks on, abortion clinics, has had any subsequent fines or financial \npenalties discharged through bankruptcy. At our markup of this \nlegislation in February of 2001--more than 4 years ago, Senator Schumer \nsaid in justification of the amendment:\n\n       . . . this is a vital amendment. I am not going into all \n     the details . . . I will not catalogue them except to tell \n     you that when Maria Vullo testified and anyone else did, they \n     said without the Schumer Amendment we would go back to the \n     days before 1994 when the clinics were closed by some who had \n     felt . . . that they were more moral than the rest of us. . . \n     .\n\n  Certainly that prophesy has not come to pass in the 4 years \nsubsequent to the time that Senator Schumer made that statement back in \n2001.\n\n  I am unaware of a systemic shutdown of the network of abortion \nclinics in this country over the past four years. Nor am I aware of any \nevidence of the use of the bankruptcy code as a mechanism of escaping \nfinancial responsibility for acts of violence against abortion clinics \nor their personnel, or for that matter, any other criminal enterprise.\n  The reason for this outcome is simple: Current law prevents such an \noutcome. Section 523(a)(6) of the bankruptcy code already prohibits the \ndischarge of debts through willful or malicious injury to a person or \nproperty, and section 523(a)(12) makes restitution orders resulting \nfrom a criminal conviction nondischargeable through bankruptcy.\n  Nothing in this bill changes these provisions in the law. Moreover, a \ngrowing body of case law confirms the adequacy of these provisions when \nit comes to enforcing judgments arising from FACE Act violations.\n  In Behn v. Buffalo GYN Womenservices, a 1999 decision in Federal \nbankruptcy court in Senator Schumer's home State, the court rejected an \nattempt to discharge a civil award debt resulting from an abortion \nprotest.\n  So it was rejected.\n  In Bray v. Planned Parenthood of Columbia/Willamette, decided in \n2000, a bankruptcy court in Maryland rejected the attempt to discharge \ndebts resulting from an Oregon case in which a Web site produced by \nanti-abortion extremists threatened the lives of those working in these \nclinics. The 2001 Treshman decision in a Maryland bankruptcy court \nconfirmed that such actions will not be tolerated by permitting \ndischarge of restitution or judgment through bankruptcy.\n  Randall Terry, the founder of Operation Rescue, is living proof of \nthe adequacy of these laws. His Web site now solicits contributions \nafter he was completely bankrupted as a result of actions found to be \nviolative of the FACE Act.\n  From a purely legal perspective, it seems fair to say that what we \nhave here is a solution in search of a problem. This is actually \nconfirmed by the most recent testimony of my colleague from New York's \nstar witness on this subject, Maria Vullo.\n  Way back when this amendment was first suggested back in 1998 or \n1999, several cases were still pending. But now these cases have been \nresolved. And in every instance, the courts have refused a discharge of \nthese debts.\n  In answer to a question of Chairman Specter in connection with the \nJudiciary Committee's last hearing on bankruptcy reform, held only 3 \nweeks ago, Ms. Maria Vullo acknowledged that she was ultimately \nsuccessful under current law in all six bankruptcy courts where she \nacted to help prevent such improper bankruptcy discharges of abortion \nclinic-related fines.\n  There you have it. The primary litigator in these cases testified \nthat she has won in all of her cases under existing law. This should \nhelp lead us to the conclusion that there is no compelling legal reason \nto change the law. There is an old saying: If it ain't broke, don't fix \nit.\n  We are not talking just belts and suspenders, we are talking belts, \nsuspenders, and an elastic waist band. Discharges related to FACE Act \nviolations have not been permitted under current law.\n  Our laws are clear. We discourage, prevent, and punish abusive \nfilings, including those related to those offenses that occur in \nconnection with abortion clinics. Again, to my knowledge, there is a \ncomplete absence of cases demonstrating the problem that this amendment \nseeks to address. This is not surprising.\n  Our bankruptcy laws already act to prevent, have prevented, and will \nact in the future to prevent precisely the problem that Senator Schumer \nis worried about, but cannot, it appears, document. The truth of the \nmatter is that, on the merits, this is just an unnecessary amendment. \nYet this amendment has already scuttled bankruptcy reform on two \noccasions.\n  In 2000 essentially the same bankruptcy bill passed this body with 83 \nvotes and then 70 votes. It was vetoed by President Clinton in the \nwaning days of his second term for failing to include this amendment. \nThen in the 107th Congress, the House of Representatives rejected even \na twice-amended--and moderated--Schumer amendment.\n  Now that it is clear that the courts will not discharge these debts, \nthe proponents of this amendment have slightly but subtly changed their \ntune. Now the alleged issue of concern is that some will nevertheless \ncontinue to attempt to discharge such fines and penalties--that is, \nsometime, some place, someone will try to use the bankruptcy code to \nshield illicit acts involving attacks on abortion clinics.\n  Some argue the amendment is justified on the supposed need to codify \nthe general prohibition of section 523(a)(6) against discharging debts \naccrued in\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\nconnection with willful or malicious injury to a person or property \nwith a special provision of law geared solely toward abortion clinic-\nrelated violence. The fact is, however, current bankruptcy law, along \nwith the ever growing body of precedents on this subject, make it clear \nthat attorneys will not be inclined to make these frivolous and abusive \nfilings in the future.\n  Rule 9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure already allows \nsanctions against attorneys who participate in submissions to delay \nproceedings and needlessly increase the cost of litigation. It says a \nfrivolous action without evidentiary support can be punished. I guess \nit is true that particular bankruptcy courts may sometime in the future \neventually be faced with a filing by someone asking for improper \ndischarge of debts, but that is just the nature of litigation within \nthe bankruptcy system and the American system of justice.\n  Having the right to bring a claim in our system is very different \nfrom winning that claim. For each case that goes to trial, there is a \nwinner and a loser. Trying to get around the bankruptcy code and case \nlaw precedents in the manner feared by supporters of the Schumer \namendment is a losing case under current law.\n  Courts decide cases on the basis of the law and the particular facts \nin front of them. That bankruptcy courts will have to undertake their \nnormal and traditional role of reviewing all relevant aspects of \nindividual filings that may, or may not, include these improper and \nunsustainable claims related to abortion clinic damages is hardly a \ngrave injustice.\n  And for what it is worth, the success of the FACE Act and the \ndecisions of bankruptcy courts that hold those debtors to account \nappears to have resulted in an ever dwindling number of judgments that \nmust be litigated.\n  This is an issue that is being overhyped.\n  The current statutes are clear.\n  The case law is clear.\n  The paucity of evidence of such claims for abortion clinic-related \nviolence and injuries being routinely, or even infrequently, made in \nbankruptcy proceedings, reflects the fact that the word is out that the \nstatutes and case law already prevent the problem that the Schumer \namendment allegedly solves.\n  Moreover, I would like to add that section 319 of this bill expresses \nthe sense of the Senate that all signed and unsigned documents \nsubmitted to a bankruptcy court must be preceded by a reasonable \ninquiry to verify that this information is well grounded in fact and \nwarranted by existing law or based on a good faith argument for an \nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\n  I am hopeful that this sense-of-the-Senate provision will help spread \nthe word even further.\n  When the Schumer amendment burst upon the floor in 2000, I worked in \ngood faith to make this questionably meritorious issue more palatable \nto Members on my side of the aisle.\n  In particular, I wanted to help alleviate the concerns of those who, \nas I, hold strong pro-life views. We are sensitive to the fact that the \noriginal Schumer amendment could reasonably be interpreted as affecting \nfirst amendment rights to protest against what we believe is the \nunjustifiable practice of abortion.\n  It is my recollection that the original Schumer language back in 2000 \nalso addressed attempted or alleged harassment, interference, and \nobstruction. Many believed that this language was way too broad and \ncould have potentially implicated the actions of peaceful anti-abortion \nprotestors who were simply exercising their freedom of speech.\n  Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons, mostly political rather than \nlegal or policy, the Schumer amendment was accepted. One of the key \nfactors was that it appeared to some at the time that the amendment was \noffered in part to give then-Vice President Gore an opportunity to \npossibly cast a tie breaking abortion vote during the Presidential \nelection year of 2000.\n  I cannot say for certain that this was the case. But if it was, it \nprobably would not have been the first time that Presidential politics \nplayed out on the floor of the Senate.\n  Before the February 2, 2000, vote on the Schumer amendment, I said \nthe following on the Senate floor:\n\n       Although I believe this amendment to be tremendously \n     flawed, the majority leader, Senator Grassley, and I \n     recommend that Members on both sides vote for this amendment. \n     We will, in good faith, in conference correct the amendment \n     and resolve these problems at that time. With this amendment \n     accepted, nobody will be able to demagogue this issue \n     politically in the context of true bankruptcy reform. We \n     pledge to work with our friends on both sides of the aisle \n     who are interested in this issue during conference to make \n     sure the law is clear, that the due respect for the first \n     amendment, and debts arising from violent acts cannot be \n     discharged in bankruptcy.\n\n  This is hardly a ringing endorsement and certainly nothing near an \nabsolute commitment to retain this language at any cost or contingency.\n  Nevertheless, in the 106th Congress the bankruptcy bill, with this \nflawed language, passed the Senate with 83 votes.\n  Eventually during the House-Senate conference committee the Schumer \nabortion clinic-specific amendment was not contained in the conference \nreport. The bankruptcy legislation, without the Schumer language still \npassed the Senate with a strong bipartisan 70 votes.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton then pocket vetoed the bill passed \nby both the House and Senate.\n  Early in the 107th Congress, I worked with Senator Schumer on \ncompromise language that moved away from the incendiary abortion \nclinics-specific language to a more general and neutrally-phrased \nprovision related to ``lawful good and services.'' This provision was \nadopted by a unanimous voice vote of the Judiciary Committee on \nFebruary 28, 2001.\n  I would note for the record that despite this compromise, Senator \nSchumer voted against the bill on final approval in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  On July 17 , 2001, this bill passed the Senate by a vote of 82-16.\n  The House-passed version of the bankruptcy bill in the 107th Congress \nonce again did not contain comparable language. I might add that the \nHouse passed its bill by a strong bipartisan vote of 306-108 on \nFebruary 26, 2001.\n  At this point Senator Schumer and I worked with Representatives Henry \nHyde and John Conyers and others to fashion an acceptable compromise.\n  This compromise was rejected.\n  Frankly, at the time, I would have preferred that the compromise be \naccepted and this already overdue bill be signed into law.\n  However, I can well understand the frustration of many of my \ncolleagues in the House being asked to adopt a watered-down version of \nan amendment without meaningful legal effect derived from the \ninflammatory original version of the Schumer amendment that addresses a \nproblem that apparently does not exist in the first place.\n  Rather than go down this fruitless road again, I ask my colleagues to \nvote down the Schumer amendment for once and all.\n  Not only is it unlikely that the House will accept it, the Senate \nshould not accept it either.\n  One important difference from the situation of 3 and 4 years ago is \nthat we now have, as I discussed earlier, a more definitive picture of \nhow the courts will interpret the application of section 523(a)(6) in \nthe context of abortion-clinic related claims.\n  In short, the courts have not and will not allow fines or judgments \nstemming from the willful or malicious injury to a person or property \nto be discharged in bankruptcy whether they arise out of illicit \nactions against abortion clinics that violate the FACE Act, or, for \nthat matter, any other of the literally dozens of other injuries that \ncan be conjured up relating to willful or malicious injury to a person \nor property.\n  No one would, or should, take seriously any amendment that purported \nto state explicitly that fines or judgments incurred from yelling fire \nin a crowded theater could not be discharged through bankruptcy.\n  Nor should we support the Schumer amendment when we know it is both \nunnecessary and divisive.\n  You do not have to be pro-life to be against the Schumer amendment. \nYou just have to conclude that 8 years is enough time to have worked on \none bill that has repeatedly engendered broad bipartisan support.\n  And to hold up this legislation once again over an incendiary, \nextraneous,\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nredundant poison pill amendment is just not right.\n  I always try to seek a compromise or accommodation with my colleagues \nwhenever it is productive to do so and consistent with my principles.\n  In this case it is simply not possible to do so in a productive \nmanner absent any sign from the House that its Members are receptive to \nsuch a compromise.\n  Having worked on this issue for several years, I have reached the \nconclusion that the inherent volatility of the subject matter of the \noriginal Schumer amendment has made it nearly impossible to arrive at a \nneutral language resolution to this undocumented problem at this time.\n  Moreover, the well-known by now impasse over the acceptability of \ncompromise language is compounded by the simple fact that there is, to \nmy knowledge, no compelling evidence that there is a problem requiring \na legislative fix.\n  To a certain extent, this is an exercise that demonstrates why it can \nbe harder to fix a hypothetical problem than a real problem.\n  Frankly, that we would even be considering an amendment based on the \n2001 Judiciary Committee markup language, rather than the revised 2001 \nconference report language, hardly seems like a step in the right \ndirection. To use an expression that my friend from New York sometimes \nuses himself, reverting to the earlier language may seem to some a bit \nlike a poke in the eye.\n  I suspect that this is unintentional on the part of my friend from \nNew York. I wish we could have worked this out, and I thought we did \nwork it out.\n  But as I look at all the facts and circumstances, including the \ndevelopments in the actual cases brought and decided over the last few \nyears, I can only conclude that there is even stronger evidence today \nthan there was in 2000 and 2001 that this amendment is simply \nunnecessary.\n  While I attempted in good faith to resolve this problem 4 years ago, \ntime seems to have proven that those I who looked askance at this \ncompromise in the first place were correct in their assessment of the \nlack of necessity for this amendment.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment of my distinguished \nfriend from New York for these reasons. It is important that we get \nthis bankruptcy bill finished. It is extremely important that we get it \ndone. If this amendment is added, it isn't going to get done again, and \nwe will be in the ninth year next year, frankly, probably 2 years from \nnow because we will never get what really has to be done in the best \ninterests of bankruptcy reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleague a \nquestion, but, first, I will make a couple of points.\n  First of all, nothing has changed since we all supported the Schumer-\nReid-Hatch amendment of a few years ago. The basic purpose then was not \nto make sure that cases in bankruptcy court did not come out on the \nside of those who were victims of violence. It was just impossible to \npursue the claims of bankruptcy.\n  My good friend from Utah cites Maria Vullo. She is a successful \nlawyer in New York who donated her own time which she estimated at one \nof our hearings to be worth over $1 million. She believed passionately \nthat those who used violence should be stopped. Not every clinic has \nit. And, of course, if you go through the bankruptcy proceedings, you \nwill win. Clinics don't have the ability to do that; first, to fight in \ncourt on the issue of violence and then to go back to the bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  I say in all due respect to my good friend from Utah, he knew that \nthen, and he knows it now. It is the same issue. The very issue that he \nsays we don't need this law was brought up in 2000 and 2001. My good \ncolleague was then good enough to admit we did need the law even though \nwe couldn't find cases, and even though there were no cases in \nbankruptcy court where the Randall Terrys of the world prevailed. You \nwould never have the successful suit.\n  That is why these fanatical groups are insisting that bankruptcy be \nused.\n  I make another point to my colleague. If the amendment is unnecessary \nnow, why wasn't it unnecessary then?\n  I make this point to my colleagues: The merits have not changed. \nExactly the situation that prevailed in 2000 and 2001 prevails in 2005.\n  What has happened is people have done a 180-degree about-face because \nof a small group in the House who do not represent the mainstream views \nof the House or of even the Republican Party in the House but who have \ninsisted on not going forward with a bill with this worthy amendment in \nit. An amendment that was praised, a compromise that was hailed a few \nyears ago is every bit as valid today as it was then.\n  I know it is difficult and awkward for people to say, well, never \nmind, but we cannot let this issue just die. The rule of law is too \nimportant. Fairness is too important. What is good and beautiful about \nAmerica is too important.\n  We will ask our colleagues to stick with their convictions that they \nhave had over the last few years and not do an about-face simply \nbecause a small group of industry leaders says we must have this bill \nno matter what.\n  Senator Hatch spoke for a long period of time. I wanted to rebut him. \nHe did not want to do it on his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York does control time. \nThe Senator can yield time to the Senator from California, but in doing \nso the Senator will lose his right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 10 minutes to my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia, and cosponsor of this legislation, Senator Feinstein.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew York.\n  We are both members of the Judiciary Committee. We had an opportunity \nto discuss and debate this amendment in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Senator Schumer's amendment is a critical amendment. Essentially, \nwhen this body in 1994 passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances \nAct, we said that individuals should be able to go into clinics without \nbeing obstructed. The law was very clear.\n  The law also has led to successful criminal and civil judgments \nagainst groups that use intimidation and outright violence to prevent \npeople from obtaining or providing reproductive health services.\n  This law would be seriously damaged if we do not close this loophole \nthat has allowed some antiabortion extremists to use bankruptcy to \nshield their assets. The Senator from New York mentioned the founder of \nOperation Rescue, Randall Terry, who said in 1998 after filing for \nbankruptcy:\n\n       I have filed a chapter 7 petition to discharge my debts to \n     those who would use my money to promote the killing of the \n     unborn.\n\n  In my home State of California there was a similar incident involving \na man by the name of John Stoos and several other people in 1989 who \nwere sued by the operators of a Sacramento abortion clinic for \nallegedly blocking the clinic's entrance and harassing patients. A \njudge ordered Stoos and others to pay nearly $100,000 in attorney's \nfees incurred by the clinic. As a result, Stoos filed for personal \nbankruptcy, listing that debt among many he could not pay. These \nactions are clear evidence of abuse of the bankruptcy system. This \nbankruptcy bill should stop them.\n  I hope the Schumer amendment would be accepted by this Senate.\n  Let me use this time to speak a bit more generally about this bill. I \nvoted for this bill when it left committee. I have decided to vote \nagainst this bill in the Senate. I want to say why. In committee, we \nwere asked to withhold all amendments to the floor. We knew the bill \nwas not a perfect bill. We have seen it improved over the years. We \nknew it was better than the House bill. And with all complicated, \ndifficult bills, the tradition of the Senate has always been the floor \ndebate and discussion. In a majority of times as a product of floor \ndebate and discussion, problems in the bill can be remedied.\n  We knew there were problems in the bill. For example, I have an \namendment which I have withdrawn which says that the credit card \ncompanies should, in fact, notify a minimum payer how long it would \ntake that payer of a credit card, if he only paid the minimum amount of \ninterest, to pay off the debt. Senator Akaka had a similar amendment. \nIt was summarily\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\ndefeated. I had an amendment; I had two Republican cosponsors. I \nlearned it would also be summarily defeated. Thanks to Senator Shelby \nand Senator Sarbanes, the Banking Committee has taken an interest in \nthis and in the future and will take a look at it.\n  Nonetheless, the fact of the matter is this bill is all for the \ncredit card companies. I know there is credit card fraud. I know that \nhas to be met. I felt the bill was important to pass. However, I also \nfelt the bill should be balanced and that we should see that the \nconsumer is also protected in this process, protected with notice of \nwhat a minimum payment means, and also, frankly, protected against high \ninterest rates.\n  Senator Dayton moved an amendment which would limit interest rates on \ncredit cards to 30 percent. The amendment was summarily defeated. The \nfact is with penalties, with other charges, with high interest rates--\nand many companies have interest rates, believe it or not, well in \nexcess of 30 percent--a minimum payer cannot ever pay the full debt \nbecause the interest on the debt, if combined with certain penalties \nand/or fixed payments, becomes such that it overwhelms the principal. \nMany people do not know that.\n\n  The fact is 40 percent of credit card holders pay off their debt \nevery month; 40 percent make only the minimum payment; and 20 percent \nare kind of 50/50 in that category. For those 60 percent who are \ngenerally people who are not as informed, not as able to pay back their \nbill, who may have one, two, three, four, five, six different credit \ncards, because this is a credit economy, credit card companies have \nbeen able, with very little interest to the payer of the debt, to \nsolicit huge fees, penalties, and interest rates. This is plain wrong.\n  If we are unable to correct it, which I had hoped would be corrected \nby these amendments that have been presented, I cannot vote for this \nbill as long as these gross injustices remain.\n  Let's for a moment look at the 30-percent interest rate. It is very \nhigh. Inflation is about 2 percent. The interest rate on 3-month \nTreasury bills is 2.75 percent. The national average lending rate on a \n30-year mortgage is 5.59 percent. Yet an amendment to limit interest \nrates on credit cards to 30 percent went down dramatically.\n  I mention there are companies that are charging high annual interest \nrates. Some charge 384 percent, 535 percent. Amazingly, one Delaware-\nbased company has charged 1,095 percent, according to the Minnesota \nchapter of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys.\n  The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, other major newspapers \nhave pointed out where fees, rates, and charges have buried debtors. \nThey have pointed out a multitude of cases. A special education teacher \nfrom my home State worked a second job to keep up with $2,000 in \nmonthly payments. She collectively went to five banks to try to pay \n$25,000 in credit card debt. Even though she did not use her cards to \nbuy anything else, her debt doubled to $49,574 by the time she filed \nfor bankruptcy last June. Effectively, interest payments are half of \nthe debt. She will never be able to pay that off.\n  To push people like this from chapter 7 into chapter 13, when what is \nthe problem is interest rates and penalty fees that truly do victimize \nan unsuspecting individual--how could this Senate do that, if someone \nis going to charge a 100-percent interest rate?\n  One of my own staff members found that simply getting a credit card \ncash advance resulted in an immediate 3 percent fee which was simply \nadded to the interest rate.\n  The result is even the most careful credit card users find themselves \noften swamped, particularly those who can only afford to make a minimum \npayment, and the fees, charges, and interests pile up, making it \nvirtually impossible to ever pay off the debt.\n  This amendment would have been a meaningful addition to the bill. It \ncertainly would have added fairness. It certainly would have sent a \nsignal to credit card companies that the sky is not the limit. Yet it \nwas defeated.\n  Senator Schumer's asset protection trust, of which I was a cosponsor, \nwas another indication of where wealthy people could shelter assets and \nnot have to pay back in chapter 13. These are some of the inequities.\n  In recent years a number of financial and bankruptcy planners have \ntaken advantage of the law of a few States to create what is called an \n``asset protection trust.'' These trusts are basically mechanisms for \nrich people to keep money despite declaring bankruptcy.\n  They are unfair, and violate the basic principle of this underlying \nlegislation--that bankruptcy should be used judiciously to deal with \nthe economic reality that sometimes people cannot pay their debts, but \nto prevent abuse of the system.\n  This loophole is an example of where the law, if not changed, \npermits, or even encourages, such abuse.\n  The amendment was simple. It set an upper limit on the amount of \nmoney that could be shielded in these asset protection trusts, capping \nthe amount at $125,000.\n  The bottom line: Without this amendment, wealthy people will be able \nto preserve significant sums of money in an asset protection trust, \neffectively retaining their assets while wiping away their debts.\n  The proposed cap amount, $125,000, is not a small sum. It is more \nthan enough to ensure that the debtor is not left destitute. I believe \nit is a reasonable amount--it is deliberately based on the now-accepted \n$125,000 limit for the homestead exemption, which will also remain \navailable to a debtor.\n  I would also like to say a few words about my concerns about what \nappears to be a new policy in the Senate.\n  It appears that the Republican leadership has decided that rather \nthan honoring the 200 plus year tradition of the Senate as a \ndeliberative body, the Senate should be run like the House of \nRepresentatives. There appears to be a new process being implemented in \nwhich the Senate should no longer seriously consider amendments on the \nfloor to improve bills.\n  We are now in the middle of the second major piece of legislation \nwhere the majority has decided that amendments by the minority will be \nrejected wholesale regardless of the merits.\n  It appears that even when serious problems in the underlying \nlegislation are raised and even when the Republican leadership agrees \nthat the problem exists, amendments offered by the minority will be \nrejected.\n  In fact, when the Judiciary Committee was marking up the bill, \nSenators were asked not to offer amendments and instead offer them on \nthe floor. Statements were made by the Acting-Chairman like, ``I know \nwe are going to go through this on the floor and I don't see any reason \nto keep us here all day and all night''; and, ``[You will] have every \nopportunity to present these amendments on the floor.''\n  Yet, upon reaching the floor, Senators have found that their \namendments are not being considered on the merits.\n  It is the Senate's job to carefully debate, carefully consider, and \npass the very best laws we can. But now the Senate is being asked to \nsimply pass legislation as drafted, regardless of its content.\n  This lack consideration and care does a disservice to the Senate and \nto the Senators who work hard to reach compromises and find common \nground. But more importantly, it does a disservice to the American \npeople.\n  We are here to develop the best policy we can, not to simply play \npolitical games and jam through legislation for the sake of expediency.\n  As I began, I want to be clear. I support bankruptcy reform \nlegislation, and I support many of the provisions in the underlying \nbill. However, throughout this process many important issues have been \nraised that identify serious problems that must be addressed. The \nSenate has been and should remain a deliberative body that seeks to \ndraft the best legislation we can. Unfortunately, that is not what we \nare doing.\n  And unfortunately, based on these concerns, I regret that I am no \nlonger able to support the bankruptcy legislation. I do not believe the \nbill before us is balanced. There remain many serious problems that \nmust be addressed before I am ready to support the legislation. I have \ndecided because of the summary disposition of amendments by the other \nside, this Democrat Member is going to vote ``no'' in the Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask the time be charged equally on \nboth sides during the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time during the quorum \ncall will be charged evenly to both sides.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume from the Republican side of the agenda.\n  I thank my colleagues for this good debate on an important issue that \ndoes not belong on this bill. There are several key reasons, clear \nreasons why this amendment of the Senator from New York should be \nrejected. This is an important piece of legislation, the bankruptcy \nlegislation. This amendment brings the most difficult social issue we \nhave of our day into this debate. It does not belong here. It is not \nthe right place to do this. We have plenty of pro-life issues to come \nbefore this Senate, and not to tie the bankruptcy bill up would be an \nimportant thing to do.\n  The membership opposes this amendment because, as we learned in \nprevious Congresses, it is a poison pill.\n  The amendment is meant to kill the overall bankruptcy reform bill. I \nwould hope that is not what the author's intent is. But that is the \neffect of this amendment. It kills the bill.\n  If the author of this amendment wants bankruptcy reform to move \nforward, it is something that needs to move forward. I have voted \nagainst bankruptcy reform in the past because I didn't think it was \nproper. I thought particularly we have problems on homestead provisions \nthat we have been able to get worked out over the years we have been \nconsidering this legislation. Now we have that worked out as many other \npieces have been refined over the 6 years this has been considered.\n  Now is not the time to add this most contentious issue into the \ndebate. It is not the proper place, and it is time that we move the \nbill forward, move it to the House and to the President for signature.\n  Bankruptcy reform is an important matter. It would be my desire for \nmy colleague not to offer the amendment so that we can focus on the \nparticular critical issue facing our Nation in the form of the need for \nfundamental bankruptcy reform.\n  Aside from the abortion issue, I am deeply concerned about what I \nbelieve to be a lack of fairness and justice embodied in this \namendment. There is a fundamental fairness issue involved with this \namendment. No one in this Chamber condones violent crime. I am certain \nthat everyone believes violent crime should be prosecuted to the \nfullest extent of the law. While the pending amendment is presented as \na way to address violent crime, it would primarily and inappropriately \nintimidate and harm peaceful protesters. In fact, were the Schumer \namendment to become law, no crime would even be necessary to trigger \nits sanctions. Merely violating a Federal or State civil statute, such \nas a minor trespass, would be enough to place a violator in financial \njeopardy.\n  Historically this legislative body has fashioned criminal and \nbankruptcy penalties in a manner proportional to the gravity of the \noffense and the degree of injury and culpability. If enacted, this \namendment would be a radical break with this tradition of prudence and \nfairness. For example, under current law, there are only a few extreme \ncases where a debtor is prevented from seeking discharge of his or her \ndebts through bankruptcy protection. For example, instances in which \ndischarge of debt is prohibited include intentional financial \nwrongdoing, such as fraud and embezzlement, or cases where the debtor \nhas created a grave unjustifiable risk to human life, such as injury \ncaused by drunk driving. Those are appropriate.\n  The Schumer amendment would put a peaceful pro-life protester who, in \nthe course of exercising his or her first amendment rights, simply \nsteps in the wrong place--trespassing--on a par with embezzlers or \ndrunk drivers. Should the price of constitutional freedom be the risk \nof financial ruin? Amazingly, this amendment says yes. The amendment \nsays that people who protest and who do no physical harm, have no \nmalicious intent should be singled out for harsh treatment.\n  While I make no excuse for violations of the law, I have to ask \nagain: Should not the gravity of the punishment correspond with the \noffense? I don't think that is at all the case in this particular \namendment.\n  A literal reading of the Schumer amendment would strip a peaceful \nprotester of bankruptcy protection should he or she simply step in the \nwrong place while leafleting or even praying the rosary. Whether the \nfine involved is $10 or $1 million, we are talking about a peaceful \nindividual and families with young children who should not be forced to \nrisk paying this price simply for doing what the Constitution permits.\n  Fairness and the great tradition of our first amendment freedoms \ncounsel against the adoption of this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against it. It kills the bankruptcy \nbill. It is against fundamental fairness and freedom for people to \nexercise their right of free speech.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Schumer \namendment to the bankruptcy legislation presently before the Senate.\n  The amendment provides that debts or judgments arising from acts of \nviolence and threats of violence cannot be discharged in bankruptcy \nproceedings. While this provision was drafted in previous Congresses to \nspecifically apply to reproductive health service providers and \nabortion clinics, it has been expanded this year with the help of some \nof our Republican colleagues.\n  The amendment now addresses violence and intimidation aimed at \nblocking access to any type of lawful good or service. The Schumer \namendment now applies to anyone who threatens, intimidates, or harms \nanother person in the course of a lawful practice in places like houses \nof worship, the workplace and restaurants.\n  Supporters of the bankruptcy bill argue that this amendment should be \ndefeated because any amendment to so-called compromise bankruptcy \nlegislation would upset the apple cart, causing the House of \nRepresentatives to reject it.\n  I cannot understand how this Senate could could fail to pass an \namendment that would simply prevent perpetrators of violence from \nhiding behind our bankruptcy laws. Where is the justice in permitting \nsuch a practice?\n  For the past week, supporters of the bankruptcy legislation have \nconsistently talked about personal responsibility and the need to \nprevent people from abusing the bankruptcy process.\n  In fact, the centerpiece of this legislation is a means test that \npresumes chapter 7 filers are abusing the bankruptcy laws because their \nmonthly income increases by as little as $100.\n  The Schumer amendment is intended to prevent extremists and fanatics \nfrom abusing our bankruptcy laws to shield themselves from paying fines \nand fees imposed by a court of law after they have endangered someone's \nlivelihood.\n  These attacks are more common that one might imagine. Since 1977, \nthere have been 7 murders, 17 attempted murders, 41 bombings, 171 \narsons, 100 butyric acid attacks, and 655 threats targeting abortion \nproviders alone.\n  In total, there have been more than 4,000 cases of stalking, \nburglaries, kidnappings, assaults, anthrax threats, invasions, \nattempting bombing and acts of vandalism, perpetrated against people \nwho were performing or offering a legal procedure. And in case after \ncase, after the perpetrators of these acts of intimidation and violence \nare\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\nbrought to justice, they hide behind the bankruptcy code to shield \nthemselves from assuming responsibility for their actions.\n  As Senator Schumer has said, this issue is neither pro-choice nor \npro-life; it is ``pro-rule-of-law and anti-violence.''\n  While we have a right to disagree with the law in this country, and a \nright to try to change the law, no person has the right to take the law \ninto his own hands.\n  I have followed this issue for a long time. The first blockade of an \nabortion clinic occurred in Cherry Hill, NJ, in 1987.\n  The first murder of an abortion provider occurred 12 years ago, on \nMarch 10, 1993, when Dr. David Gunn was slain during an antiabortion \nprotest at a Pensacola, FL clinic. Since then, there have been six more \nmurders.\n  In 1994, responding to a rash of violence against abortion providers \naround the country, I asked the United States attorney to convene a \ntask force to ensure that all appropriate measures were being taken to \nprotect women and doctors and to prosecute those who threatened them \nwith violence.\n  Later that year, Congress enacted the Freedom of Access to Clinic \nEntrances, FACE, Act, which established Federal criminal and financial \npenalties for those who employ violence and intimidation to prevent \npersons from obtaining or providing reproductive health services.\n  Unfortunately, the perpetrators of violence have used our bankruptcy \nlaws to evade responsibility and escape the financial penalties that \nwere part of the FACE Act. For example, former Operation Rescue \npresident Randall Terry has filed for bankruptcy to avoid paying more \nthan $1.6 million in fines and fees that he owes as a result of his \nillegal actions.\n  We must not allow those who would take the law into their own hands \nand commit acts of violence against their fellow citizens to hide \nbehind our laws when it suits their purposes. We must not allow our \nbankruptcy laws to be abused as a shield for violence.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Schumer amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we have 11 minutes on our side. How much \ntime remains left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). There is 10 minutes remaining on \nthe minority side and 15 minutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the last 5 \nminutes be reserved for me and the previous 5 minutes to whoever wants \nto speak for the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, 5 minutes will be reserved \non each side to be allocated from that side's time remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I will use a minute and a half of that now.\n  Mr. President, I am happy today to rise as a cosponsor of the Schumer \namendment. This amendment would ensure that debts arising from unlawful \nacts of violence cannot be discharged from bankruptcy.\n  America is a nation of laws. One might not always agree with the law \nor how it is interpreted, but that does not entitle you to willfully \nviolate the law. The right to express disagreement is to seek change \nthrough peaceful means. It is never appropriate to resort to violence \nor intimidation in violation of the law. Here in the Senate we express \npolicy differences through civil discourse and resolve them through the \npolitical process, not through violence. We debate in this body \npassionately but in a manner of respect and civility in an attempt to \npersuade others of the merits of our position, and that is the purpose \nof the debate. Those who resort to violence are violating not only our \nlaws but our American principles and values. They are violating what we \ncall the rule of law on which this country was founded.\n\n  Unfortunately, some who break the law are using a loophole in the \nBankruptcy Code to avoid paying the fines and penalties assessed \nagainst them as a result of their illegal activities. This amendment \nwill ensure that individuals who engage in such acts of violence, \nintimidation, or threats, cannot hide in bankruptcy from the penalties \nimposed on them from violating the law.\n  I emphasize that this amendment is not about the right to abortion, \nnor does it single out anti-abortion protestors. This amendment applies \nto anyone who violates a law related to the provision of lawful goods \nand services. It applies to any extremist who will turn to violence to \nprotest lawful activities.\n  For example, this amendment would apply to animal rights activists \nwho engage in illegal tactics to shut down a lawful animal research \ncenter. There are many people who think that using animals for medical \nresearch is immoral and wrong, but this does not entitle those people \nto come in and trash one of those facilities, as has been happening. It \nwould apply to an ecoterrorist who engages in illegal tactics to \nintimidate car dealerships or timber companies from doing business with \npeople they think they should not do business with. It would apply to \nan arsonist who starts a fire at a church to deprive worshippers of the \nright to practice their religion. All of these extremists must be held \naccountable for their actions, and none should be permitted to \ndischarge their debts in bankruptcy.\n  It is true that some of the worst abuses of this kind have been anti-\nabortion extremists who have terrorized reproductive health care \nworkers. They have directed thousands of acts of violence against \nabortion providers, including bombings, arson, death threats, \nkidnappings, assaults, and murders. When a man by the name of Barnett \nSlepian, who was a father of four, a husband, was a victim, I was the \nfirst person to come to the Senate floor and say that is wrong. When \nviolence occurred at a Planned Parenthood clinic--I believe that is \nwhere it was--someplace in the South, I came to the floor immediately \nto say that one cannot violate the law because they disagree with what \na lawful business is doing.\n  Dr. Slepian was an obstetrician/gynecologist. He provided health care \nto women and delivered babies and, on occasion, he performed abortions. \nHe was at a downtown clinic, and he worked there specifically because \nhe believed it was important he give his expert advice to people who \nwere poor. Because of this, one night he was in his living room, and \nsomeone with a high-powered rifle shot and killed him while he was \nthere with his family.\n  I did not know this doctor, but I learned after his death that he was \nan uncle of a woman who worked for me. The woman was from Reno. She was \na good employee. Of course, she was heartbroken over the fact that her \nuncle had been murdered. The person who did this was not only a \nmurderer but should be seen as a terrorist.\n  What is going on in Iraq today? We have these extremists, these \nterrorists, who do not like what is going on there, and so they are \ncommitting these criminal acts. They are taking the law into their own \nhands.\n  The man responsible for killing Dr. Slepian was extradited from \nFrance a few years ago where he had fled. His name was James Kopp. Kopp \nwas part of an organized network of violent extremists, including a \ngroup that called itself the Army of God. The group and others similar \nto it have engaged in a long campaign of violence.\n  In 1994, we passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances, called \nFACE, which established Federal criminal and financial penalties for \nthose who employed violence to prevent persons from obtaining or \nproviding reproductive health services. The FACE Act is essential to \nprotecting the lives of women and health care providers.\n\n  Unfortunately, some of the people charged under this act are filing \nfor bankruptcy to avoid accountability for their illegal acts of \nterrorism. As an example, defendants in the so-called Nuremburg files \ncase have tried to nullify years of court proceedings by filing a \nchapter 7 proceedings.\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\n  What are the Nuremburg files? Listen to this one: They posted on a \nWeb site the names, addresses, and license plate numbers of people who \nworked in these health care facilities. They even posted pictures of \ntheir target's families, all members, and they would list them--father, \nson, mother, brother, whatever it might be--and places where their \nchildren waited for the school bus. Doctors who still worked appeared \nin plain text on the Web site, a person who had been wounded was grayed \nout; and those who had been murdered, including Dr. Slepian, had a line \nthrough their names.\n  It is intolerable that the groups which incite these heinous acts of \nviolence can discharge their civil penalties in bankruptcy, but that is \nexactly what happened. If we want to prevent future acts of violence, \nincluding clinic violence, it seems to me that we need to have a \nspecific provision in the bankruptcy law to prevent discharge of \nviolence-related debts. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  I do not support abortion, but this amendment is not about abortion. \nIt is about holding responsible those who commit illegal acts and \nbelieve that they are above the law. This amendment is about preserving \nthe rule of law.\n  I cannot imagine how this amendment is causing a concern or a \nproblem. Are we now to believe that there are people who are telling \nmembers of the majority, do not do this, we want to go and commit acts \nof violence, we want to commit crimes, and do not vote against us \nbecause you will prevent us from filing bankruptcy? That is what this \nis all about. Should not we as a body say that if one goes out and does \nthese terrible acts, where they kill people, they maim people--one of \ntheir latest tricks is they figured out this acid which is some kind of \na chemical compound, and they walk into these facilities and they throw \nit all over. It cannot be washed out. It cannot be steamed out. The \nonly thing one can do is tear the facility down. Should they not be \nheld responsible?\n  I cannot believe we are going to have a bill as important as this \nbankruptcy bill jeopardized because of the terrorists who are out there \nwaiting to file bankruptcy. That is what this is all about. People are \nout there wanting to commit crimes, waiting to commit crimes, saying, \ndo not pass this because if you pass it I will not be able to file \nbankruptcy. I just think it is beyond my ability to comprehend that \npeople who know they are violating the law, they are killing people, \nthey have this Web site that they are soliciting murder.\n  And we are going to condone this activity under the guise that this \nis a choice, this is a pro-life/pro-choice issue and we cannot get \ninvolved. This is not about abortion. It is about maintaining the law.\n  I am so disappointed that the majority is going to go along with the \nability of people to commit crimes and terror and discharge them in \nbankruptcy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, what is the status of the time on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 11 minutes remaining. The \nSenator from New York has the last 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nSchumer amendment which would make debts incurred in connection with \nviolations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act \nnondischargeable in bankruptcy. This amendment has been a poison pill \nto enactment of the bankruptcy bill and must be defeated.\n  On two previous occasions, CRS performed research for us and told us \nthat FACE debts had never been discharged in bankruptcy. Just recently, \nI asked CRS to perform an updated search on reported decisions \nconsidering the dischargeability of liability incurred in connection \nwith violence at reproductive health clinics by abortion protesters. \nCRS confirmed that this amendment is not necessary. The CRS memo \nidentified only one reported case, which found the debt to be \nnondischargeable under the bankruptcy law's discharge exception for \nwillful and malicious injury. So this amendment is not necessary. Even \nSenator Schumer's own witness at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing \non the bankruptcy bill testified that in all the cases that she had \nlitigated, the court had always found that the debts incurred under the \nFACE Act were nondischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  My colleagues make a big deal out of the fact that some of us on this \nside have supported amendments similar to this one before. The truth \nis, when the Schumer abortion amendment was offered in 1999 to the \ncomprehensive bankruptcy bill, Vice President Gore was campaigning for \nthe Democrat nomination. His opponent, Senator Bradley, was alleging \nthat Vice President Gore was not sufficiently pro-choice. Vice \nPresident Gore's allies in the Senate were maneuvering to create a tie \nvote on the Schumer amendment so Gore could ``break the tie'' to \nimprove his political standing.\n  To avoid this, most Republicans voted in favor for the Schumer \namendment. Thus, that vote in the 106th Congress was not a vote on the \nmerits of the Schumer amendment.\n  The Schumer amendment was included in the 107th Congress bankruptcy \nbill. But the fact is that in the 107th Congress, the Schumer amendment \nkilled the bankruptcy conference report because the House would not \ntake it. Thus, the Schumer amendment is a poison pill and must be \ndefeated.\n  Let me reiterate that in two previous memos, CRS concluded that the \nSchumer amendment is unnecessary because abortion protester debts are \nalready not dischargeable in bankruptcy. We have just updated this \nresearch and CRS has confirmed that FACE Act violations are not \ndischargeable in bankruptcy. The proponent's own witness testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee that none of these debts have ever been \ndischarged in bankruptcy. The reality is that the Schumer amendment is \njust a political ploy designed to generate opposition to the bankruptcy \nbill. The Schumer amendment is a poison pill which will kill the \nbankruptcy bill. This amendment must be defeated, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa ask unanimous \nconsent to yield back the remaining time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for \nhis final 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in conclusion, I would like to rebut some \nof the comments of my colleague from Utah who said this amendment was \nnot necessary, and he talked about Maria Vullo, the lawyer who \nrepresented the clinic in the Nuremberg files case.\n  Here is the major point. She did not collect any money in that case. \nDespite spending $1 million of her own money, pro bono, despite \nrelitigating in six bankruptcy courts, she was unable to collect any \ndollars. This is the point we are making. Perhaps at the end of the day \nyou will get a nominal victory if you go all around the country chasing \nthese fanatics in bankruptcy court, but you cannot collect. That is why \nthe American Coalition of Life Activists, a violent fringe anti-choice \ngroup, actually requires its leaders to be judgment proof.\n  Here is the bottom line: This amendment, which was supported by so \nmany on the other side, is being dropped, not because it is wrong but \nfor expediency, so there will not have to be a bloody battle in the \nHouse between those who are on the Republican side, between those who \nare more probusiness and those who are vehemently opposed to this \namendment. I will not denigrate the pro-life movement by labeling them \nthat way because the pro-life movement cannot be for these violent \ngroups.\n  This amendment is for the rule of law. This amendment says you cannot \nuse violence against any group to achieve a political end and then, \nwhen you are sued civilly, use the bankruptcy courts for protection. \nThat has never been what the bankruptcy courts were intended to be. It \nis neutral on terms of what issue. Yes, it might be extremists who are \nagainst abortion. It also might be extremists on the left side, on the \nenvironmental side who burn buildings or houses or cars. Are we going \nto, as a society, condone that type of activity?\n  I will tell you, if we defeat this amendment, that is what we are \ndoing. Make no mistake about it, make no mistake about any of the \nsubterfuges. To me, this amendment and the rule of\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\nlaw and the American way of life that this amendment stands for are \nmore important than the rest of the bankruptcy bill.\n  The bankruptcy bill, whether you are for it or not, twists the dials \na little bit with regard to the balance between creditors and debtors. \nI assure you that was not on the Founding Fathers' minds when they \nwrote the Constitution and created the Republic.\n  What this amendment does goes right to the heart of what America is \nall about. It says those who use violence to achieve their political \ngoals cannot get a benefit, in this case bankruptcy. It, in my \njudgment, as I said, is more important than the rest of the bill.\n  So I ask my colleagues on the other side to rise to the occasion. Do \nnot let arguments of expediency persuade you. That is the slow road to \noblivion. That is the tortured path to undoing step by step, bit by \nbit, as the river creates a canyon, the way of life that we love. No \nmatter how strongly one feels about something, their job is to persuade \nothers to their viewpoint, not to take the law into their own hands and \nuse violence. And if they do, they should not be allowed to use the \nBankruptcy Code or anything else to prevent just civil or criminal \naction against them.\n  I ask my colleagues to look into their hearts, to examine what this \namendment does, and to have the same courage--courage of conviction and \ncourage of a fair compromise--that we showed a few years ago. I urge \nsupport of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 47 offered by the \nSenator from New York.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in a few hours we will be voting on cloture \nfor this bill. I would just like to take a minute or two and remind \neveryone why it is time to end the debate on this bill.\n\n  It has been 8 long years of consideration on this legislation. We \nhave all compromised a great deal. Not everyone got their preferred \nlanguage or amendments. Not everyone is happy with the current \nlegislation.\n  But I think everyone would have to agree that we have given \nthoughtful consideration and fair opportunity to all suggestions on the \nbill throughout the years of debate.\n  Over the years, we modified the homestead exemption.\n  We modified the means test.\n  We provided for sanctioning attorneys who file abusive claims.\n  And we hindered creditors who would try to collect through predatory \nlending practices.\n  All of these changes, among scores of others, came from my Democratic \ncolleagues.\n  After all this, just 2 weeks ago, we took 5 more Democratic \namendments in the Judiciary Committee markup.\n  And yet almost everyone of the pending amendments today touches upon \nthe areas where we have previously compromised.\n  At a certain point, the time comes to move forward with what we have. \nGiven how far we have come on this bill already over the last 8 years, \nand considering all the compromises that have been made, we may get no \nbankruptcy bill at all if we try to take more amendments.\n  The lopsided votes in favor of this bill in the past--with 70, 83, \nand even 97 votes in this Chamber--reveal that we are left with only a \nsmall minority of opposition. The fact is that a large majority of this \nbody recognizes that we are not doing anything radical in this bill.\n  We simply ask that higher-income filers who can pay their bills, \nshould pay their bills. It is as simple as that. There is no reason to \nask the vast majority of bill-paying consumers to pickup the tab when \nthose with means do not repay their obligations.\n  After 8 long years, we have compromised every which way we can. The \nremaining amendments being proposed are just further adjustments of \nadjustments to adjustments that were already made during this process.\n  There is simply no reason to continue to holdup this bill through the \namendment process. The longer we delay, the greater the chances for \nmischief. The more we stall this measure, the more likely we open it to \npolitical, message amendments that can only act to stall work on this \nbill.\n  A time comes when you just have to say enough is enough. Eight years \nshould be long enough to pass one bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for cloture.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to explain my decision to oppose \nclosure on the Bankruptcy bill. I have offered an amendment to this \nbill modeled on legislation I have introduced to set up a permanent \nhealth care trust fund for current and former Libby residents, and \nformer workers at the W.R. Grace vermiculite mine in Libby, MT. The \ntrust fund will help pay for medical costs associated with treating \nasbestos-related disease or illness caused by exposure to deadly \ntremolite asbestos and other fibers released by Grace's mining \noperations.\n  I offered this amendment to this bill because it presented an \nopportunity to make whole the people of Libby, who have suffered, while \npreventing a company like W.R. Grace, which has filed for bankruptcy, \nfrom emerging from that bankruptcy without setting up a health-care \ntrust fund for its victims.\n  I have worked very hard to make sure the people of Libby, MT, are \nprotected in any asbestos legislation to come before Congress; to \ninclude special provisions in an asbestos bill for Libby residents that \ntake into account the unique kind of health impacts associated with \nexposure to the deadly asbestos fibers from the W.R. Grace vermiculite \nmine.\n  For years, I have been committed to securing a common sense solution \nfor the residents of Libby. I strongly believe that too many people \nhave suffered, and they deserve fair compensation. I will do everything \nin my power to help Libby make their community whole again and to make \nsure their long-term health care needs are met. Passing bankruptcy \nlegislation, with consideration of my asbestos amendment is essential. \nI will fight to get additional protections for Libby residents and then \nwork to pass the bill.\n  Unfortunately, we have not had an opportunity to vote on this \namendment, and it has been judged to be non-germane. The bankruptcy \nbill is all about responsibility and accountability. This amendment \ntries to hold W.R. Grace accountable for its actions.\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\nBecause we were not able to vote on this amendment, I can not support \nlimiting debate on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2216-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, now that we are postcloture, the number of \namendments is limited, and the type of amendments will be limited. I \nhave three pending amendments before the Senate relative to the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  For those of you who have not followed the debate on this bill, this \nbill will change the bankruptcy law in America. Today, many people go \ninto bankruptcy court because they have no place to turn. They have \nmore debt than they can possibly pay.\n  One of the major reasons people reach this point in life, the No. 1 \nreason people go to bankruptcy court is medical bills. Three-fourths of \nthe people in bankruptcy court with medical bill problems had health \ninsurance when they were diagnosed with their illness. If you think, I \ndon't have to worry about bankruptcy court because I have health \ninsurance, so do these people. What happened? They got sick. The bills \nstarted piling up. Maybe they lost their job and their health insurance \nand couldn't afford to pay the COBRA premium, which people have to pay \nonce they have lost a job and health insurance. They gave up on their \nhealth insurance, and the bills started stacking up. It reached the \npoint for these folks where they had nowhere to turn. They faced \n$50,000, $100,000, or $200,000 in medical bills they could never pay \noff for the rest of their lives. In desperation, and with some \nembarrassment, people then went to bankruptcy court and said: I have no \nplace to turn. I just can't do it.\n  A court says: What do you owe? Give us all our assets. What do you \nhave in checking and savings? How much is your home and your car worth? \nFurniture, everything--what is it all worth? Where are your debts? We \nwill let you walk out of bankruptcy court with very little left, but \nyour debts will be gone.\n  That happens to people. More often than not, medical bills drive them \nthere.\n  There are other reasons. You lose your job. How many people have you \nmet in their fifties in America--I have met many in Illinois--who had a \ngreat career and a great job and lost it, then went out looking for a \ncomparable job only to learn they were ``too old for the market''? \nThere they sat, taking a job that paid less, trying to maintain a \nfamily and household that was basically financed with a higher salary \nnot that long ago. In desperation, they try to keep things together, \nand it starts to fall apart. The debts they incurred when they had a \ngood job they cannot handle anymore.\n  What else happens to people? Some people live on the margins already. \nSome single mothers trying to raise kids are in a situation where \nfinally something happens to them--a medical bill, an unforeseen \ncircumstance--and they are stuck in bankruptcy court.\n  The credit industry comes in and says: We have to do something about \nthese payments. We have to make it more difficult for them to walk out \nof that bankruptcy court having given up their assets with their debts \nbasically behind them. So the law is changed here in this 500-page bill \nwritten by the credit card industry, written by the financial industry, \nto make it more difficult for a person to walk out of court with their \ndebts behind them. They make sure in this bill that it is more likely \nfor many that they will walk out of court still paying, on and on. As \nlittle as $165 a month is enough to say that you will never be forgiven \nin bankruptcy. You will just keep paying and paying. The creditors will \nkeep calling and calling. That is what the credit industry wanted. They \nworked hard for 9 years. They are going to win this battle.\n\n  We came to the Senate floor and said, at least let us carve out some \npeople who really should be treated differently. I am sorry that the \nmarines who were here earlier didn't stick around. I wish they could \nhave, I wish they could have heard the debate on the floor of the \nSenate when I offered an amendment and said: If you activate a \nguardsman or a reservist for a year or a year and a half and they go \nover to serve their country as they promised, leaving behind a \nrestaurant or a small business which falls into bankruptcy while they \nare gone--and it has happened--shouldn't we give them a break in \nbankruptcy court? For goodness'\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\nsakes, these people aren't morally deficient; they are our best, and \nthey are serving our country. They are protecting you, me, and everyone \nelse.\n  I put in an amendment that said, at least for the men and women in \nthe military who face this kind of bankruptcy--and it happens--let us \ngive them a break in this bill. Let us not put them through the \nharshest parts of this bill. I lost the amendment 58 to 38. Many of the \nSenators who go back home and cheer the troops and how much we love \nthem and how much we want to stand behind them couldn't wait to vote \nwith Visa and MasterCard and against the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air \nForce, and Coast Guard. That is what it came to. We lost that \namendment.\n  Senator Kennedy came to the Senate floor and said: If you get swamped \nwith a medical crisis in your family and go into bankruptcy court \ntrying to get out from under something you will never pay off, \nshouldn't you, when it is all over, at least be able to go home? \nShouldn't you have a roof over your head when it is all over if it is \nmedical bills that put you in bankruptcy court? He offered an amendment \nand said: Let us at least protect $150,000 in equity in your home that \nyou can go back to after bankruptcy.\n  Think about that. What will $150,000 buy you? In Springfield, IL, it \nbuys you a nice little house. What does it buy you in Washington, \nBoston, New York, and California? Not much. But when we offered that \namendment, only 40 Senators voted for it and 58 or 59 voted against it.\n  The argument behind this bill originally was that too many people \nwent to bankruptcy court because of their moral failure. They didn't \nunderstand that they can't game the system, they can't use it in a way \nthat is fundamentally unjust and immoral by going to bankruptcy court \nwhen you shouldn't go. But in the two examples I have given you, does \nthat argument apply? Is there something fundamentally wrong with the \nvalues of men and women in uniform serving our country who can't keep \nthat business afloat back home? Of course not. Is there something \nfundamentally wrong with a person who feels as if he is on top of the \nworld, goes in for a diagnosis at the doctor, and ends up with a life-\nthreatening disease which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars where \nhis health insurance fails him? Is that a moral failure? It is a \nfailing of Congress. It is a failing of your Government to deal with \nthe realities of the challenges of life, whether it is health care or \nservice in the military.\n\n  We went in and argued: What if you were the victim of an identity \ntheft? And it happens; it happened to me. What if someone steals your \nidentity and runs up bills in your name? It can happen to anyone \nlistening to this debate. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said, in that \nsituation; if all the bills that have swamped you are not even bills of \nyour creation, shouldn't we give you a break under this tough new \nbankruptcy bill? Overwhelmingly, on a partisan rollcall, the answer \nwas, no. No. Ultimately you shouldn't be discharged from bankruptcy \neven if those weren't your debts.\n  We said: What if the people lending the money to you break the law \nwhile they are lending it to you? What if they take--and you know this \nstory; it happens in every community. What if they take advantage of an \nelderly widow or widower living in that little home they have always \nhad? They knock on the door: Boy, you sure could use a new roof, Ma'am. \nLuckily, I have a company out here that will do it if you just sign a \nfew papers.\n  The next thing you know, you have one of these phony, predatory \nlenders coming in with a subprime mortgage with a balloon clause, and \ngrandma's little house disappears. He looked so trustworthy. He seemed \nlike such a nice man. He told me this was a standard contract. Yes, I \nsigned it. I should have called you, but I just signed it.\n  What about those people? Should they be able to take away her home; \ngo to bankruptcy court and stand in line with all the other creditors \nand say, Treat me like another legal creditor? I didn't think so.\n  So I offered an amendment saying those people should not have the \nadvantage of going to court if they have broken the law in the way they \nmake the loan. I didn't have a chance on that amendment. Those who are \nsupporting this bill did not want to talk about that. One Republican \nSenator supported me. Just one.\n  Time and again, whether we are talking about victims of bankruptcy \nwho deserve a little help, or whether we are talking about those gaming \nthe system from the creditor's side, we found this stone wall that \nseparates this Chamber. The Republican side does not want to consider \nany changes to this bill. The credit card industry has written it, and \nthey are sticking with it.\n  The only perfect laws ever written were written by God and Moses, as \nfar as I am concerned. All of the rest are amendable. All the rest can \nbe improved. Here we assume that if it was generated by the largest \ncredit card companies in America, we cannot argue with them.\n  One of the best arguments that has been made is, this bill does not \napply to people who make less than the median income. That has been a \npoint made over and over and over again during the course of this \ndebate. Why is it important? Because this new law imposes a brandnew \nset of requirements in bankruptcy court for those who are above the \nmedian income. At least that is the argument.\n  Let me show this listing of all the documents that now have to be \nfiled in bankruptcy court. It is pretty long. I used to practice law. I \nknow it takes time to fill these out. You sit down with your client. \nYou say: Get your income tax returns. Get all the checks you can find. \nLet's sit down. This will take some time. This is the current \nrequirement under the law. So it is not as if you walk into bankruptcy \ncourt, sign your name, and wave and leave out the other door. It is a \nlong process.\n\n  During the course of the process, your creditors and the trustee in \nbankruptcy decide whether you are telling the truth. If you aren't, \nthey will throw you out of court on your ear. That is the way it ought \nto be.\n  Now comes this bill which says these papers are not enough. Here we \nhave the new means test. This is an example of what you have to do in \naddition to all the current requirements to file bankruptcy. This is \nthe means test in this bill. It not only adds to the complexity of this \nprocess, it adds to the cost. So here you are without enough money to \npay your bills, trying to figure out how to come up with a filing fee \nof $200, how to pay that lawyer who is going to represent you in \nbankruptcy, and along comes this bill which says let me give you some \nmore paperwork to fill out before you can qualify for bankruptcy.\n  The argument has been made over and over again in the Senate that \npeople below the median income do not have to go through this. My \namendment will clarify that, amendment No. 110. We want to make it \nclear that if you have below the median income, you do not have to go \nthrough the means test. In other words, on the first line up here, \n``current monthly income,'' if you have proof your current monthly \nincome is in the lower income categories, supposedly protected from \nthis bill, that ought to be the end of the story.\n  It is not now. I want to clarify that. I want to make sure that \nMembers of the Senate who have come to the Senate and said people below \na median income could not have to worry about this bill, really mean \nwhat they say. I emphasize and underscore my amendment does not in any \nway relieve those filing for bankruptcy from meeting all the other \nrequisite steps. They still need to complete a lot of forms and \nschedules outlining assets and liability. We add language that makes it \nabundantly clear that a court may not dismiss a case based on any \nformal means testing if the current monthly income of the debtor falls \nat or below the median family income of the applicable State. The \nlanguage I offered merely reinforces what Members of the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle, particularly on the Republican side of the aisle, \nhave said over and over and over again from the beginning of the \ndebate.\n  Let's look at the statement of my friend and colleague, Senator Orrin \nHatch. Here is what Senator Hatch said in the Senate:\n\n       It is possible that during this debate some may falsely \n     suggest that this bill unfairly treats low-income persons. \n     Let me tell you at the outset that the poor are not affected \n     by the means test. The legislation provides a\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\n     safe harbor for those who fall below the median income, so \n     they are not subjected to the means test at all.\n\n  But they are. Under the current language of this bill, it is not \nclear that they are exempt from the means test, as Senator Hatch has \nargued.\n  Now, let's take a statement from Senator Frist, the Republican leader \nof the Senate. Senator Frist, on March 1, last week, said:\n\n       It [the Bankruptcy Reform Act] establishes a means test \n     that is based on fair principle, a simple principle, and that \n     is this, that those who have a means should repay their \n     debts. A simple principle: Those who have the means should \n     repay their debts. It specifically exempts anyone who \n     earns less than the median income in their State.\n\n  That is what my amendment says. If you earn less than the median \nincome, finish the forms that are already provided in bankruptcy court, \nthe new law does not affect you. But if you earn over the median \nincome, you have to fill out more forms. So it means the lower income \npeople, just as Senator Hatch and Senator Frist have said, will not \nhave to go through the extra expense and the extra time of going \nthrough mountains of paperwork.\n  Let me also take a quote from Senator Sessions from Alabama who has \nbeen on the Senate floor in support of this bill. Here is what he said:\n\n       Chairman Sensenbrenner pointed out that the means-based \n     test only applies to people with incomes above the median \n     state average. Anyone below the state median income does not \n     qualify on the means-based test and their bankruptcy petition \n     cannot be tossed out of chapter 7 and put into chapter 13 \n     where some debts are paid back.\n\n  That is as clear as can be. Senator Sessions told us that. Now we \nhave another statement from Senator Sessions:\n\n       I remind all of my colleagues that people who are \n     economically distressed and if the income is below the median \n     income already will be exempt from the means test.\n\n  So my challenge to all those who made those statements is, prove it. \nProve it by voting for this amendment. Prove it that if you establish \nthat you have an income below the median income in your area, that you \ndo not have to go through this means test. They have all said it. Now \nthey will have a chance to vote on it.\n  Let me speak to one of my other amendments. I tried earlier in my \nfirst amendment to protect the soldiers activated and fighting overseas \nwho lost their businesses. I failed, 58 to 38. I was surprised by that \nrollcall, but I watched what happens. Virtually every amendment has \nfailed. As I said, some view this as holy writ. I just view it as a \nproduct of the credit industry, their best hope of something they want \nto pass in the Senate.\n  So I will offer amendment No. 111 to exempt certain veterans and \ncurrent members of the Armed Forces from the onerous administrative \nburdens resulting from the means test. We say in this amendment it \napplies to members and spouses of members of the Armed Forces on active \nduty performing a homeland defense activity under title 32, veterans or \ntheir spouses whose indebtedness occurred primarily during a 6-month or \nlonger period of active duty or performance of a homeland defense, \nreservists of the Armed Forces or their spouses, same situation, \nsurviving spouses of those who died while serving as a member of the \nArmed Forces.\n\n  We take a category of Americans to whom we all owe such a great debt \nof gratitude and say if their debts overwhelm them because they are \nserving our country, we are going to give them a break, a chance to \navoid this lengthy, expensive means test in this bill. I hope my \ncolleagues will reconsider their earlier vote against this amendment. \nThis is a much more compact, succinct, and limited break for those who \nare serving.\n  The last amendment I will offer, amendment No. 112, is if I fail on \nthe previous amendment. Let me tell you what it says. It provides an \nexemption from the means test only for disabled veterans who incurred \ntheir indebtedness primarily during a period of service. It covers \nservice on active duty or during a National Guard homeland security \noperation. Certainly we can give something of a break to these \nAmericans who have given so much to us.\n  I go out to Walter Reed Hospital. Many of the men and women who have \nbeen injured are amputees. I remember one in particular. I said: How \nare you?\n  He said: My rehab is coming along just fine. I think I will be great. \nI have my new leg. I am learning how to walk on it. I would like to go \nback to my unit, but I am going to go back home. I am a little bit \nconcerned. I had a job back home. I was an automobile mechanic. I don't \nknow if I will be able to return to that job.\n  That situation for that man and for so many others reflects this \nchange in their life. Yes, they will receive disability payments, but \nsome of them, because of the serious injuries they have faced--head \ninjuries, the loss of both hands, the loss of both legs--will not be \nable to return to the life they had before. Some of them may find they \ncan't keep up with the debts that have been incurred while they have \nserved our country. Is it possible the Members of the Senate, for \ndisabled veterans, would give them a break if they are forced into \nbankruptcy because of debts incurred while they served our country? \nThat is my last amendment.\n  I hope it doesn't reach that point. I hope all of us who come to the \nfloor to give important speeches in tribute to the men and women in \nuniform will cast important votes on behalf of those men and women.\n  The credit card industry is important to America. I think they can do \na better job in the business in which they are involved. They ought to \ntake care, with the flood of credit cards that they send to everybody \nunder the sun--the 3-and-a-half-year-old little boy of an attorney on \nmy staff, a 9-month-old daughter of a friend of mine, all receiving \ncredit card applications. They are throwing them at America. Many \nAmericans, without thinking twice, are signing up, going more deeply in \ndebt than they should.\n  The monthly statement from the credit card company--I am telling you \nthis as a lawyer--flip that over and try to read the fine print. \nSenator Akaka of Hawaii said: Shouldn't they tell you at least if you \nmake a minimum monthly payment how much it is going to cost you over \nthe period of time it will take to pay it off? Simple enough. The \ncredit card industry opposed it. It was defeated on the floor. The idea \nof giving Americans more information so they can make the right credit \ndecisions was defeated on the floor.\n\n  You have to believe the industry that opposed providing that \ninformation is an industry that doesn't care if you go head over heels \nin debt. They think they are going to win. They are certainly going to \nwin if this bill passes because that credit card debt is going to hang \non for a lifetime. You won't be able to shake it. When we hear the \nstories of people who are going to be victimized, I hope we will think \ntwice about the wisdom of this legislation.\n  The trustees in bankruptcy were asked to take a look at what \npercentage of people filing for bankruptcy were fraudulent, had no \nbusiness in court. They came up with the number 3 percent, 3 out of 100 \nare fraudulent and should not be in court. Most of them are discovered. \nThe credit card industry said, no, it is much larger. It is 10 percent, \n1 out of 10. This bill doesn't apply to the 10 percent of fraudulent \nfilers. This bill applies to every filer in bankruptcy. That is why \nmany of us think it is fundamentally unfair.\n  I can read the votes. I have been around Congress to know this is \ngoing to pass. I certainly hope with these three amendments that my \ncolleagues will take some time and consider whether they want to live \nup to what they have said. If they want to exempt lower income families \nfrom the means test, my amendment lets them do it. If they do believe \nwe owe something to the men and women in uniform, my amendment gives \nthem a chance to vote that way. And if for no other reason they want to \nshow some sympathy and concern for disabled veterans who have given so \nmuch to our country, they will have a chance with amendment No. 112.\n  I hope the solid wall of opposition to every single amendment will \nbreak down. I hope my colleagues will take the time to read and \nconsider these amendments. It will be a lot easier to face the people \nback home if we at least give some flexibility to this bill when it \ncomes to these important exceptions.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am proud of the bipartisan bankruptcy \nbill moving forward. We were excited over the strong vote for cloture \nto bring this debate to an end, 66 or more votes for cloture. That was \na tremendous bipartisan show of support. I know my friend, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, opposes the bill. He has offered a lot of amendments. \nFundamentally he doesn't like the bankruptcy bill. At one point he did. \nAt one point he was a sponsor of it. For whatever reason he is now not \nsupporting the bill. That is all right.\n  Our goal with regard to the bankruptcy bill was to continue the \nhistoric privilege that Americans can wipe out debts and have a fresh \nstart. However, since the new bankruptcy bill was passed in 1978--that \nis the new one we are now under, a big bankruptcy reform--then we had \nabout 200,000 filers in bankruptcy. Now there are 1.6 million filers in \nbankruptcy. A lot of people are using bankruptcy as a way to avoid \npaying their just debts. We wrestled with that. There was a lot of \nconcern that something is out of sync, that the classic American moral \nvalue that you ought to pay your debts if you can ought to be honored.\n  At the same time we ought to create a circumstance in which people \ncan start over. As many Americans have learned, if they fall behind in \npayment of debts, creditors call. You can have lawsuits filed against \nyou. Families get embarrassed. Court orders get issued. Those kinds of \nthings can be upsetting to a family. Sometimes you get so far behind \nthere is no way you can get out of it. That is what bankruptcy is for. \nSo we looked at it and tried to figure how we could reach the right \nbalance.\n  How do we crack down on those who want to get off scot-free, not pay \ntheir debts, when they have the money to pay them, and do we protect \nthose who need a fresh start? First, let me tell you the power of \nbankruptcy. A person making $200,000 a year, who owes maybe $150,000 in \nvarious debts, can go into bankruptcy court and file bankruptcy today \nand get all those debts discharged, when he or she could easily have \npaid back most of them. That is the way the system works. You read one \nof those ads and call one of those guys or ladies who advertises in the \nfree newspaper at the checkout counter, and they tell you to call your \nbankruptcy lawyer and wipe out your debts. People do it--sometimes only \nafter talking to that lawyer who only gets paid, frankly, if the client \nretains him to file a bankruptcy. They may have other alternatives to \nget out of that financial difficulty and they may not understand that.\n  What I want to emphasize is that we decided to create a bright line, \na rule that would apply easily across the country in bankruptcy court, \nand that is what we are doing--amending the law of bankruptcy court, \nwhich is a Federal court, under Federal law. All bankruptcies are done \nin Federal bankruptcy court, so it is our responsibility to deal with \nthe problems in that court. So we created a bright line rule.\n  If you make below median income and you owe debts, you can wipe them \nout, as you always have. You don't have to pay your doctor, your \nhospital, the automobile mechanic down the street who fixed your car, \nyour brother-in-law back for his loan, the credit card company, or \nanybody else you owe--the bank, the credit union, wipe them out. So if \nyou make below median income, the law is basically still the same for \nthe debtor; he wipes it out. We had expert testimony in the Judiciary \nCommittee, of which I am a member, that said 80 percent of the people \nwho file bankruptcy make below median income, only 20 percent above. We \nsaid what about people who make above median income, but they might \nhave special circumstances? Maybe they have a child who has a high \nmonthly expense. Maybe the debtor himself is disabled, with \nextraordinary medical expenses, or things of that nature. We said we \nwould make an exception for those people who have extraordinary \nexpenses, and the estimates show that would add another 7 to 10 percent \nwho would be able to automatically file under the median income and, \ntherefore, would not have to pay any of their debts back under this \nother provision of bankruptcy law, chapter 13. So we agreed on that.\n  That is the bill that passed. That means test philosophy passed this \nSenate, one time, 97 to 1. It passed three times in this body. The last \ntime we voted on it, it was 83 to 15 to pass the bankruptcy bill. We \nhad the Schumer amendment on it--which we voted down recently--at that \ntime, and the House of Representatives refused to take the bill and \npass it. It died because of the Schumer amendment, which was a \nmaddening thing for those of us who had been working on it for 4 years. \nI thought it was unbelievable that such a small but poison pill could \nkill the legislation. I have heard a lot of times about how a poison \npill can kill a piece of legislation. Since I have been in the Senate, \nI have never seen a more perfect example of a poison pill. It came back \nup. Senator Schumer offered it and we voted it down earlier today.\n  This bill will not have the poison pill in it. We sent it over there \nwith bipartisan support every time and, for one reason or another, it \ndidn't become law. The House supports it. I am confident if we pass \nthis legislation, without the Schumer amendment, it will pass the House \nof Representatives and go to the President for signature. I emphasize \nall this to say there is nothing wrong with the means test. People who \nmake high incomes--lawyers, doctors and accountants are examples--and \nfile bankruptcy, wiping out all their debts, who don't care who \ngot hurt by their failure to pay and they care only about themselves, \nthis will crack down on those people who are abusing this system. I \ndon't think there is anything wrong with it. I believe it is the right \nthing to do.\n\n  As a matter of fact, I hear even those who oppose the bill say they \ndon't oppose the bill, but they have spent all the time trying to \nconfuse this, suggesting that poor people are going to have to pay \nsomething back. The chances are, if they are poor and are making below \nmedian income in America, they won't have to pay back anything. What if \nthey make above median income? Perhaps they will have to pay back a \nportion of their debts. The bankruptcy judge, under certain \ncircumstances, may order that they pay back a certain percentage. They \ncan be made to pay a certain percentage of those debts back through the \ncourt, and it is distributed on a fair basis to the creditors who have \nclaims against the debtor for a period not to exceed 5 years. That is \nwhat is commonly and legally known as chapter 13.\n  A lot of people all over America choose chapter 13 and agree to pay \nback their debts because they think it is the right thing to do, and it \nhas some personal advantages. A lot of people find it hard to believe, \nbut in my home State of Alabama, about one-half of the filers in \nbankruptcy court choose to file under chapter 13. What happens when you \ngo into chapter 13? All the phone calls have to stop. You cannot be \nsued. If a lawyer tries to execute a judgment against your property \nafter you filed in bankruptcy under either chapter 7 or 13, they are in \ncontempt of court immediately. The family gets to calm down. The court \nhelps set up a repayment schedule for a part of the debts the debtor \nowes, and their paycheck may go to the bankruptcy court and they parcel \nit out to the various creditors, and the debtor gets to keep a certain \namount to live on, whatever he or she needs. That is the way chapter 13 \nworks. It is not oppression to go into chapter 13. Almost half of the \npeople in my State who file bankruptcy choose to file under chapter 13.\n  Well, Senator Durbin quoted me. I was impressed that out of all those \nout here, he quoted me. I suppose he quoted me correctly, but maybe he \nwas a little bit incorrect in interpreting what I had to say, or \nperhaps I spoke in a way he did not understand. I thought I was clear. \nI said in my remarks that if you make below median income, you are not \nsubject to the means test. I guess that technically may be a \nmisspeaking. What I meant was you are not required to pay anything back \nunder chapter 13. He said, well, why fill out the forms? Well, you fill \nout the forms to see whether your income falls below the median income \nin America; that is why\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\nyou fill out the forms. Surely, people would expect you, if you want to \nask a U.S. bankruptcy court in whatever State in America you are in and \nyou want to ask them to discharge your debts, and you want them to \norder that you do not owe anybody you have been owing for the last 10 \nyears, and your debts are built up and you don't want to pay any of \nthem a dime, surely it is not too much to ask somebody to show what \ntheir income is, to bring in a payroll stub to see what your paycheck \nis, and bring in an income tax return to see what you have been showing \non your income tax. What is wrong with that? They say, oh, we have all \nthese documents. I am telling you, I don't think we ought to be shocked \nthat before a court wipes out maybe hundreds of thousands or tens of \nthousands of dollars in debt, they at least find out how much income \nthe guy has and how much property. What if they own 500 acres of land \nout in the country? Should they not have to declare their assets?\n  Why should they keep property, stocks, bonds, or anything else of \nvalue and not pay the people they solemnly committed to pay? If they \nhave assets, let's find out what they are. That is all we are talking \nabout.\n  How are you going to tell whether a person qualifies for a means test \nif you do not have them produce some information about their income? I \ndo not think that is oppression, and I do not think people are being \noppressed if a credit card company lets them have $5,000 and they do \nnot pay a dime of it back. I do not think a person is being oppressed. \nThis is not some sort of anti-capitalist body. People get money all the \ntime. They borrow money. They promise to pay it back. If nobody pays \nback their debts, everybody who uses a credit card will find their \ncosts going up. Every bank loan will go up; every housing loan will go \nup. We have to have integrity, but we are going to give people--1.6 \nmillion of them a year last I heard--the ability to wipe out their \ndebts. For probably 90 percent of them, they can wipe out all of them \nif they choose, and for the remaining 10 percent, they may have to pay \nsome back. Some of those people absolutely ought to be paying back some \nof their debts.\n  We are all just victims here. It is so discouraging to me to hear \nskilled Members of this body talk about the American people as if they \nare just victims and pawns. I have seen the polls. Overwhelmingly, the \nAmerican people believe you ought to pay your credit card debt back \nrather than pay other things because they know their interest rates are \nhigher there. Frankly, I think everybody ought to reduce their credit \ncard debt. They ought to chop them up and throw them away.\n  I was glad that my children--my two daughters and son--when they were \noff at college had a credit card. I told them not to use it unless they \nhad to, but if they were out on the road and the car broke down, or \nsomething happened, I trusted them to use that credit card. What a \nwonderful thing. Anywhere in America--actually anywhere in the world--\nyou can stick that card in a machine and out pops money. And if you pay \nit on time, you hardly pay any interest.\n  I am not here to condemn the credit card companies, and I reject and \nam offended by the repeated suggestion that this bill is supposed to do \nnothing but protect credit card companies. That is false. It demeans \nthe integrity of the Members of this Senate, in my view, who have \nworked hard on a bipartisan basis, 85 to 15, the last time we passed \nthis legislation. I guess that is all they have to say when they \ncomplain about the bill.\n  We talked about the military, and I am concerned about our military. \nI offered--and I was pleased that the President made part of his \nsupplemental appropriations bill--an amendment to increase the death \nbenefits of our soldiers, raising the basic death benefit from $12,000 \nto $100,000 and increasing the SGLI, Servicemen's Group Life Insurance, \nto $400,000 from $250,000, retroactive to the beginning of the war on \nterrorism. It will help all those families.\n  I, like other Senators, visited soldiers in the hospital at Walter \nReed. I visited them in Germany. I have been in Iraq three times. I \nhave talked with all the families from Alabama who have lost soldiers \nin the war. I served in the Army Reserve for 10 years, missing by \nseveral years being activated in the first Gulf War. Some of my best \nfriends are still in the Army Reserve. I understand what they are going \nthrough. I talked with them in Iraq in January of this year. Some have \nsuffered financial difficulties as a result. We know that.\n  I offered the amendment that would make clear and explicit that a \nservice man or service woman who has been activated and is not able to \npay their debts would, in fact, be a special circumstance that could \nkeep them from having to pay back their debts under chapter 13, and \nthey would be able to wipe out all their debts. No matter what their \ndebts are, if their income is below median income, they get to wipe \nthem out anyway. It is just in that top 20 percent, they may need \nspecial circumstances.\n\n  I defined it, and we passed--at the same time, Senator Durbin's \namendment was voted down--to give them that special protection. I think \nthat was the right way to do it. Senator Durbin had an automatic \nguaranteed set-aside for them in a way that I think was not as \nappropriate as the route the Senate chose to take. But he got a vote on \nhis amendment and I got a vote on my amendment.\n  I also recall, for those who are listening, that we do have a \npowerful Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act that has been updated. That is \nthe new title. The old, classical Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act says \nif you are off on active duty serving your country, you cannot be sued, \nthey cannot take a judgment against you, they cannot foreclose on your \nhome, and there are a host of other protections for them.\n  They have those protections. Plus, when you come back, you can \nbankrupt against any of the debts you may have. If you make above \nmedian income, the judge can consider and should consider military \nservice as a special circumstance. I think that is the right way to do \nit. I believe we did the right thing on that issue.\n  It really hurts me to hear people suggest, because they are unhappy \nwith this bill and they filed an amendment that was not adopted exactly \nlike they wanted it, that we who adopted the amendment to deal with \nthis issue are insensitive to military men and women serving America.\n  Those are some of my thoughts, Mr. President. I think the bill does a \nlot of good. There are some things about which we have not talked. We \nhad the critics dominate the debate and point out everything they think \nis wrong and offer amendments. Senator Feingold has 15 amendments. \nRemember now, this is the fourth time this bill has been on this floor. \nThe last time, we debated over 2 weeks on the legislation with \namendment after amendment. This time we are going to be 2 weeks on it. \nI think we debated 2 weeks the other two times. There has been \nextensive debate. We have had debate and amendments offered in the \nJudiciary Committee likewise on these issues where Senator Feingold, \nSenator Durbin, and others serve.\n  We have tried to be fair and open. Everybody has had a chance to \nraise their concerns, but it is time to vote and get this bill in the \nbarn and move on to other issues.\n  I want to mention a couple points that are so important for people in \nAmerica who are having a hard time. Women and children who are victims \nof divorce and separation, deadbeat dads--what about that issue?\n  In the course of our deliberations, we made a bipartisan commitment \nto raise the top debts that arise from alimony or child support to the \nhighest level of a bankruptcy court. In other words, when there is a \nlimited amount of money, the bankruptcy judge decides who gets paid \nfirst. In the past, they have always paid the lawyers and the court \nfees, and then they had some other things, and then women and children \ncame along. We raised women and children to the top of the list. Of \ncourse, that is one reason they are unhappy with the bill--trust me. We \nalso put some other provisions in it to reduce some of the litigation \nthat goes on in bankruptcy court.\n  We raised women and children to the top of the list. The National \nChild Support Group and the National District Attorneys Association \nthat handles child support issues said it is absolutely a fact that \nwomen and children have a substantial benefit under this\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\nact. One person said it is a veritable wish list for helping women and \nchildren who are owed child support and alimony to collect those debts. \nAnd they get paid even above so many other people.\n  Also, I note that secured creditors are next, and the unsecured \ncreditors, such as the credit card people, and those with personal \nnotes and bills, such as your local gas station. Those debts come in as \nunsecured debts, and they are further down the list.\n  We do not raise credit cards above people. We actually raised women \nand children up to the highest group. So I think there are a lot of \ngood things in it, including a requirement that people who want to pay \ntheir debts, cannot handle their money and manage it well, must attend \na financial management course before being discharged from bankruptcy. \nWe want to see people manage their money well, get rid of those credit \ncards, contain their spending and manage their money wisely. That is \nwhat we would like to see them do. That is what the bill requires.\n  It also says a person at least ought to talk with a credit counselor. \nThese exist all over America. Many times they can help people manage \ntheir money. They get the whole family around the table, they talk \nhonestly about what their financial situation is, what their debts are, \nand how they would have to be paid back. They have the ability to call \nthe bank, the credit card company, or the mortgage company and say: We \nbelieve this client could file bankruptcy, but if you will allow them \nto reduce their payment to you for the next year and pay down some of \nthese critical debts they owe, we will get back to you in full speed. \nWe will help them achieve that. We will work out a budget with them.\n  Many creditors agree to extend--some even forgive a part of their \ndebts in order to help debtors so they do not have to file bankruptcy, \nand they learn something in the process. They do not have to go into \ncredit counseling. They can go straight to the lawyers and file \nbankruptcy in the traditional way. I think some may decide that maybe \nthis is the better alternative for them.\n  If they go in response to one of those late night ads on television, \nor one of those newspaper ads to the bankruptcy mill, they are not \ngoing to get that information in most instances, although some lawyers, \nI am sure, do give them advice.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We are having an exchange, and maybe since we are both in \nthe Chamber we can at least come to an agreement on our disagreement. \nAnd I will yield some of my own time if it reaches the point where the \nSenator thinks it is taking advantage of his time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was about to yield the floor, but, please, go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would stay for a few moments, I would like \nto see if we can get to an agreement on our disagreement.\n  Right now, under current law, when I go into chapter 7 filing for \nbankruptcy, I am bound by the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code under \nsection 521 to file a list of my creditors, unless the court orders \notherwise, a schedule of assets, liability, current income, current \nexpenditures, and statement of debtor's financial affairs and more when \nit comes to consumer debt currently. That is what happens when one goes \ninto bankruptcy court--and that is this sheath of paper--they have to \nfill these things out. These are the documents that get one into court.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would just add, one has to list those debts, and if \nthey do not list them they are not discharged and they can still be \nliable for them. So the debtor has to list his or her debts.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So one has to be careful. They better put all of their \ndebts down if they want to have them discharged.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In comes the new law, and the new law says if one is \nbelow median income, that is the end of the story. They continue as \ncurrently required under chapter 7. They do not have to go through and \nprepare and file this means test which is required here because they \nare not required to.\n  Page 18 of the bill, no one can challenge a person if in the case of \na debtor in a household of one person, the median family income of the \napplicable State is applicable. So this is the point that has been made \nover and over, again that having filed the basic documents in \nbankruptcy, if it is then established that one is below the median \nincome, end of the story. This bill does not apply. That is the way I \nunderstood it.\n\n  My amendment is trying to clarify it to make sure that is the way the \nSenator understands it. In other words, if I have done all of the basic \nfiling and I disclose my monthly income and I am below median income, \nthen I do not have to fill out the forms for the means test; it does \nnot apply to me.\n  I quoted the Senator earlier, Senator Frist, and Senator Hatch, who \nhave all said that on the Senate floor. My amendment clarifies that and \nsays that unequivocally, after someone has filed their basic documents, \nif they demonstrate their monthly income is below the median income, \nthey do not have to fill out the forms for the means test as to what \nthey can pay over the next 10 years. They are not covered by that.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding of what this law says?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is my understanding of it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, my amendment is only trying to clarify that. That \nis all it is doing. What I just described to the Senator is to say \nunequivocally, if someone files the initial documents currently \nrequired under chapter 7 and demonstrates to the court that their \nmonthly income is below a median income, they do not have to fill out \nall of the additional paperwork required in the means test, which is \nsubstantial and expensive. If the Senator feels as I do, that that is \nwhat the law says or should say, I hope the Senator will look at my \namendment. It is not a trick amendment. It is just trying to clarify \nthat point.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be glad to review the amendment. It would \nappear clear to me that one does need to meet certain basic filing \nrequirements.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So the income can be determined, and we did step that \nrequirement up to require more in connection with income tax return \nfilings and things of that nature.\n  I know the Senator is a member of the Judiciary Committee and has \nworked hard on this bill, so I respect his concern over this issue. I \nam not one who believes we have a problem, but I will be willing to \nlook at it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would be kind enough to review my \namendment, I would appreciate it very much.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 89\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 89 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is once again \npending.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKerry, who is the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, be \nadded as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we have spent a great deal of time \ndebating and trying to improve provisions of this bill that affect \nconsumer bankruptcies. Most of my colleagues may not even be aware that \nthis bill actually contains provisions that make significant changes to \nportions of the Bankruptcy Code that relate to small businesses. They \nmay not realize it, but it does. Subtitle B of title IV of the bill is \nentitled ``Small Business Bankruptcy Provisions,'' and I doubt more \nthan a handful of people in this body have any idea what is in the \nsubtitle.\n  The subtitle includes a number of new restrictions and requirements \nfor small businesses that want to reorganize under chapter 11. That is \nright, these are requirements and restrictions for small businesses \nthat do not apply\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\nto large companies. I was shocked when this came to my attention, but \nthere it is in black and white, subtitle B, ``Small Business Bankruptcy \nProvisions.''\n  These are not provisions to help small businesses, as one might \nexpect from a bill that is going through the Senate. No, these \nprovisions penalize small businesses. They make it harder for small \nbusinesses to reorganize in order to survive.\n  Here is an example. Section 434 would require regular reports on the \nsmall business's profitability. They will have to report all kinds of \nthings: profitability, cash receipts and disbursement, requirements to \nbe in compliance with postpetition requirements, timely filing of tax \nreturns, and ``such other matters as are in the best interests of the \ndebtor and creditors.''\n  This is a mountain of information. Mom-and-pop operations will have \nto spend a great deal of time pulling these reports together, and the \nreports probably will not even be useful. Creditors and judges \nexamining a debtor's profitability rely on cash disbursements and \nreceipts, not self-reporting, because they are more informative and \nless subject to manipulation. It seems to me these reports will not be \nof much use to anyone, but they will be quite burdensome for a small \nbusiness to produce on a regular basis.\n  What is the penalty for failure to jump through this bureaucratic \nhoop? Dismissal. Again, not for large corporations, mind you, which \nhave armies of accountants to handle paperwork like this, but for the \nsmall entrepreneurs who could be spending that time keeping their \nbusinesses afloat instead of producing these piles of paper for some \ngovernment file which basically no one will ever use.\n  I do not want to have to go back to Wisconsin and have to explain to \na grocery store owner who is already working late into the night, \ntrying to pull her business through a financial crisis, that the \nFederal Government has decided to keep her even longer to put together \na report that nobody even plans to read. I am very concerned, almost \nashamed of this Chamber to think I would have to tell her that if she \nwere a big corporation, if she were the big chain of huge grocery \nstores, then the law would not require this of her. It would not treat \nher this way.\n  Professor Elizabeth Warren wrote, when the same language was proposed \nduring the 107th Congress:\n\n       A decision by Congress in 2001 that small businesses should \n     bear greater costs, face shorter deadlines, file more papers \n     and lose any flexibility that a supervising judge might \n     provide is a decision to shut down small businesses simply \n     because they are small.\n\n  That is what Professor Warren wrote.\n  I can see no justification for imposing burdens on small business in \nthe bankruptcy code that will not be imposed on large corporations. It \nhas always been our responsibility as legislators to protect small \nbusinesses. My amendment calls on us to fulfill that responsibility in \na very significant way. It would simply strike a number of the \nprovisions in title IV, subtitle B of the bill.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. According \nto the Small Business Administration, small firms represent 99.7 \npercent of all employers and pay 44 percent of the total U.S. private \npayroll. Small businesses have generated from 60 to 80 percent of the \nnet new jobs created annually over the last decade. I can't figure out \nwhy, for the life of me, we are trying to make life harder for small \nbusinesses.\n  What is particularly puzzling is that I have heard a number of my \ncolleagues complain about the burdens that they believe federal \nregulations impose on small businesses. The head of the Small Business \nAdministration recently testified before the Small Business Committee \nthat ``[s]ome of the heaviest burdens borne by small business in \nAmerica are the result of unnecessary federal regulation and redtape.'' \nIf my colleagues share that belief--and even if they don't--why would \nwe want to impose further Federal regulations and red tape on small \nbusiness chapter 11 bankruptcies?\n  The worst thing about this attack on small business is that it is \nutterly unprovoked. Another provision of this bill would impose harsh \ndeadlines on small businesses seeking to reorganize under chapter 11, \nbut these deadlines are apparently designed to solve a problem that \ndoesn't exist. The bill's drafters perhaps believed, back in 1998, that \nchapter 11 offers a shelter for failing small businesses, allowing them \nto delay the inevitable and die a lingering death to the detriment of \ntheir creditors. But this is just not the case.\n  The bill would impose an arbitrary 300-day hard deadline for a small \nbusiness to file its reorganization plan. But a recent study of small \nbusiness bankruptcy cases by Professor Douglas Baird of the University \nof Chicago Law School and Professor Edward Morrison of Columbia Law \nSchool shows that this deadline is completely counterproductive. \nAccording to this study, more than half of small business chapter 11 \ncases that fail--in other words, those that are dismissed, or converted \nto chapter 7 liquidations--are terminated within 4 months of filing. \nOver 70 percent are terminated within 6 months. By 300 days more than \n90 percent have already left the system. In other words, the 300-day \ndeadline imposed by this bill will affect a very small percentage of \nsmall business plans that are actually bound for failure. It constrains \nthe discretion of bankruptcy judges, without any apparent justification \nfor doing so, since reorganization cases without merit are already \nbeing terminated in a timely manner.\n  Instead of protecting the system against abuse by small businesses \ndoomed to eventual failure, this bill will punish primarily small \nbusinesses that would otherwise succeed. Professors Baird and Morrison \nfound that of the small businesses that successfully reorganize under \nchapter 11, nearly 40 percent need more than 300 days to do so. In \nother words, the facts show that by 300 days, most failing small \nbusinesses have already failed but many viable small businesses are \nstill struggling. We should be helping them, not terminating them. \nForcing small businesses capable of successfully reorganizing into \nchapter 7 liquidation proceedings is bad for their creditors, and \ntragic for the entrepreneurs who will see their livelihoods and their \nhard work over years or even generations needlessly destroyed.\n  Compare the hard deadline in the bill to what happens in the \nbankruptcies of large corporations. United Airlines filed for chapter \n11 protection in December 2002. That is over 2 years ago. And the court \nhas continually allowed the effort to come up with a reorganization \nplan that the creditors can accept to continue rather than force the \nairline to liquidate. We still don't know what will happen in that \ncase, but clearly it is worth trying to save that company, with all its \nemployees and devoted customers. Why don't we want to allow the courts \nto exercise the same flexibility for small businesses? Are they just \nnot as important as the big corporations like United? Is that the \nmessage the Senate is trying to send with this bill? I can hardly \nbelieve that my colleagues want to send that message. But this could \nhave a big impact on the ability of small businesses across the country \nto survive, so I urge my colleagues to take a close look at this \namendment.\n  These new burdens on small businesses are simply wrong. Congress \nsimply should not be in the business of forcing viable small businesses \ninto liquidation. And why are large corporations seeking to reorganize \nnot similarly burdened? Do the bill's drafters think that large \nbusinesses are more important than small businesses, so we should give \nthem extra time to reorganize?\n\n  There is an additional irony here when you compare the requirements \nwe put on large and small businesses in bankruptcy that my colleagues \nshould consider. Large companies are often subject to a variety of \nreporting requirements by the federal securities laws that are not \napplicable to small businesses. But the SEC often exempts companies in \nchapter 11 from those requirements. At the same time that large \ncompanies are often excused from onerous reporting because of their \nbankruptcy, this bill puts additional reporting requirements on small \nbusinesses. Where is the fairness in that?\n  If there is a crisis with small business bankruptcies, I am not aware \nof it. Professor Warren, one of the country's leading bankruptcy \nexperts, was one of the authors of a 1999 Small Business Administration \nstudy. That study\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\nfound that one-third of bankrupt businesses had less than $100,000 in \ndebts and almost four out of five had less than half a million dollars \nin debts. What is more, almost half--45 percent--of the small \nbusinesses had one or no employees when they filed for bankruptcy. \nThese numbers don't give me any reason to think that small business \nbankruptcies are such a serious problem that we need to enact special \nprovisions targeting them.\n  Bankruptcy experts tell me that these small business provisions are \njust crazy. But they have been in the bill forever, and most of the \nfocus is on the consumer provisions when we debate this bill. Someone \nneeds to stand up and say, ``Wait a second. Why are we discriminating \nagainst small businesses in the bankruptcy laws?'' I can't think of a \nsingle bill in my entire time in the Congress--over 12 years--where a \nsingle law on the books treats small businesses worse than big \ncorporations. That is the opposite of what we usually do in this body. \nWe always protect small businesses. Why is this bill any different?\n  When I offered this amendment in the Judiciary Committee, I heard two \narguments against it. The first was that the provisions were \nrecommended by the National Bankruptcy Commission. This is a very odd \nargument, coming from the same people who completely ignored the \ncommission's work on consumer bankruptcy issues and drafted a bill \nlargely in response to the credit industry's recommendations. But more \nimportantly, I have been told that the commission provisions were \ncreated by certain commissioners who wanted to reform chapter 11 for \nall companies, large and small. The big companies came in and said: \n``No, don't do that to us. Those deadlines are too restrictive.'' Here \nis what happened. The recommendation was amended to apply only to small \nbusinesses. There was no showing that there are more abuses in small \nbusiness bankruptcies than in chapter 11 filings for large companies. \nSmall businesses apparently just didn't have the right lobbyists \nwatching the process. So they got stung by these wrongheaded provisions \nthat live on year after year in this bill without anyone coming forward \nto explain why they are necessary or useful.\n\n  The second argument that came up in the committee was that small \nbusinesses support this bill. That is true, at least for some small \nbusinesses. But they don't necessarily support the particular \nprovisions that I am talking about. They may not even know about these \nprovisions. Small businesses, like large businesses, support the bill \nbecause it makes it harder for consumers to file for bankruptcy. But I \ndoubt very much that they want the law changed to make it harder for \nstruggling small businesses to reorganize under chapter 11.\n  This is an important example of how this bill fails to reflect \nlessons we have learned in the years since it was first proposed. Given \nthe recent history of large-scale corporate bankruptcies and scandals, \nthe way this bill cracks down on small businesses is not only \nmisguided, it is shocking. We should be focusing our energies on the \nreal problem, not penalizing small businesses.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment, and I hope that small businesses \nall across this country will be watching this debate. Those people who \nthink the Senate is devoted to the interests of small businesses may be \nin for a rude awakening if this amendment is not agreed to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business and I also ask unanimous consent that the time be \ncounted as postcloture time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine and Mr. Dodd are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 67.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment--we have checked with the \nParliamentarian--is a germane amendment to the bill. It was filed prior \nto the appropriate time, at the hour of 2:30 p.m. yesterday. Let me \nexplain what this amendment does and why I am offering it this \nafternoon.\n  I am offering this amendment to enable parents to meet the needs of \ntheir children. We just heard our good friend and colleague from Ohio \ntalk about Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the problems that occur \nwith underage drinking. It is appropriate, after that discussion, that \nI offer this amendment because it is not unrelated, we know the \ndifficulty of single parenthood, of how hard it is for single parents, \nthe overwhelming majority of whom are women, to try to raise children \non their own, all of the pressures of holding down jobs and managing a \nfamily. It will not come as any great surprise to my colleagues to know \nthat a significant percentage of underage drinking and children who \nhave problems with the juvenile justice system and other related issues \ncome from broken homes, unfortunately. The tremendous pressures of a \nsingle head of household holding down a job and keeping their family \ntogether is not easy.\n\n  This amendment I am offering today on this bankruptcy bill relates to \nthese familial circumstances, and it comes in several parts. I am going \nto take a few minutes and explain this amendment and why I believe it \nis important.\n  Very simply, during the financial crisis of living through a \nbankruptcy, children should be protected to the maximum extent \npossible. That is my strong belief. I believe it is the belief of all \nof us. Regardless of one's politics or ideology, I think we all \nunderstand that when a family is going through bankruptcy, we ought to \ndo what we can to protect the innocent. Whatever one's feelings may \nhave been about the parents, about their responsibility or \nirresponsibility, children should not be penalized because of the sins \nor the faults of their parents. This amendment is designed to at least \nattempt, under those trying circumstances of a family going through \nbankruptcy, to protect those who are innocent--the children--to the \nmaximum extent possible.\n  About 39 percent of those filing bankruptcy in the United States are \nsingle women raising children, almost 40 percent. About 29 percent, \nalmost 30 percent of those filing for bankruptcy are men, and 32 \npercent of households filing for bankruptcy are married couples. So we \nare talking about 70 percent of those who are filing fall into the area \nof single parents and their problems related to it. While there may be \nsome people who are trying to scam the system--and there certainly are, \nand I do not argue with that point at all--I believe most people do not \nfile bankruptcy lightly. It is a highly emotional time and one of \nfinancial crisis.\n  The most common reasons for 90 percent of women filing for bankruptcy \ninclude medical emergencies, job loss, and divorce. Women are \nespecially vulnerable because they tend to have lower incomes and fewer \nassets and are more likely to be caring for children on their own.\n  If my colleagues truly cared, and I believe they do, about protecting \nmothers and the innocent children who are caught up in the tremendously \ndisruptive time of bankruptcy, I think they will end up supporting this \namendment. At least I hope they do. If our colleagues truly care about \nmarriage and strengthening marriages, they also would support this \namendment. I cannot think of many more things more stressful on a \nmarriage than filing bankruptcy.\n  My amendment covers four main areas to protect children during this \nturbulent and emotional time. The amendment would modify the means test \nto provide greater flexibility and reasonableness when calculating a\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\ndebtor's ability to pay. Allowable expenses are broadened to ensure \nthat parents, whether married or divorced, can still support their \nchildren as they live through a bankruptcy.\n  For example, the amendment would allow a single mother, recently \ndeserted by her husband, raising children who has filed for bankruptcy \nto continue paying education expenses for her child. Let us say that \nthe mother, being a religious person and from a family that had used \nparochial schools for generations, is struggling to keep her child in \none of these parochial schools. In this case, her 10 year old son has \ngone to a parochial school since kindergarten. It is where his friends \ngo. After being fairly shy and withdrawn, he has begun to thrive there, \nhas developed close relationships with several of his teachers. \nThe mother was able to obtain a hardship reduction in tuition from the \narchdiocese, reducing the tuition to $3,500 a year.\n\n  Under the means test in the pending legislation, under our bankruptcy \nbill, this mother could not file chapter 7 or chapter 13 if she \ncontinued to send her son to parochial school. The means test allows \nonly $1,500 for tuition and any other education expenses--not enough \nfor any religious school. We are not talking about some fancy prep \nschool or boarding school; we are talking about a basic parochial \nschool education, which in many areas of the country costs around \n$5,000 per year, sometimes even slightly more. One of my neighbors told \nme that the parochial high school his son attends costs roughly $8,000 \na year.\n  The child did not file for bankruptcy. Why during this turbulent time \nshould the child be ripped away from his circle of friends and moral \nmentors? This should be a time when the child needs his friends and \ntrusted teachers the most, his circle of security, particularly during \na time of separation by parents and a bankruptcy.\n  The amendment would allow expenses associated with employment, such \nas child care, and it would allow alimony and child support to be used \nas intended to cover the needs of children in the household. \nParticularly with children, there are emergency expenses that arise, \nand any means test ought to reflect that reality.\n  Second, this amendment would ensure that support payments and other \nfunds, such as refunds from the earned income tax credit or child tax \ncredit, intended for the current needs of children do not become the \nproperty of the bankruptcy estate with the corollary potential of being \ndistributed to creditors. Money intended to support children and their \nneeds should go to children who need it, not creditors, in my view. Why \nshould the earned income tax credit or the refundable child credit be \nyanked away from supporting children so that the depth of poverty in \nwhich they may live becomes even greater?\n  Thirdly, the amendment enables debtors going through bankruptcy to \nkeep personal property normally found in or around the home, excluding \nautomobiles. This would ensure that in bankruptcy situations, families \nwith children are able to keep, without fear of repossession, household \ngoods that typically have no resale value.\n  Fourth, the amendment would ensure that debtors are not forced into \nbankruptcy court to seek to prove that some of these items have any \nvalue for resale and would necessarily have to be added, forced into \nbankruptcy court to prove these items were not luxury goods.\n  This amendment, which I had hoped the managers of the bill would \nagree to, it is more technical than anything else. I am sorry it is not \nbeing accepted, because it goes to the very heart of what many of us \nhave talked about and tried to accomplish over the years since \nbankruptcy laws were first modernized and adopted over a century ago in \n1903. This amendment deals with families and spouses, with child \nsupport issues and where they come into context of priorities when it \ncomes to discharging responsibilities under the Bankruptcy Act.\n  In 2003, as much as $95 billion in child support payments remained \nuncollected in the United States. It is a staggering sum of money and \nmakes a huge difference to children growing up under adverse \ncircumstances. It is estimated that one out of every other child living \nin poverty could be taken out of poverty if we were able to collect \nchild support. Forget about appropriations or tax provisions we may \nadopt. if we could just collect the $95 billion in unpaid child \nsupport, we could virtually eliminate poverty in one out of every two \nchildren growing up under those circumstances in the United States.\n  The bankruptcy bill before us is going to make it more difficult in \nmany ways for those families out trying to find those spouses who owe \nthis child support to make it available. Thus, I believe we are going \nto exacerbate the problem of children who rely on child support and \nfamilies who rely on alimony being able to get those resources to \nminimize the effects that a divorce and separation can cause.\n\n  When one excludes the ability to receive the financial support \nnecessary to make ends meet, the problem becomes, obviously, even more \npronounced, and children bear the price. Again, I repeat, whatever one \nmay feel about the parents and their irresponsibility, putting \nthemselves and their families in jeopardy, we ought to be highly \nsensitive to what happens to children. It is not their fault that their \nparents are filing bankruptcy. I do not believe necessarily it is the \nparents' fault either in many instances, with medical expenses, with \ndivorce and job loss being the reason a large percentage of \nbankruptcies occur.\n  Putting aside that for a moment, whether one agrees with those \nnumbers, I do not know of a single person in this Chamber who would \ndisagree with what I am about to say. Children should not have to pay \nthe price of their parents' mistakes, and yet that is what we are going \nto do with this bill if we do not take some steps to try to correct the \nsituation.\n  Since 1903, our Nation's bankruptcy laws have been guided by the firm \nprinciple that women and children must be first in the distribution \nline of available assets during a bankruptcy proceeding. For over a \ncentury, debt owed to children and families has been nondischargeable. \nThus, if a head of a household fails financially, whatever remaining \nassets he has could be used to spare his spouse or ex-spouse and his \nchildren from impoverishment. We do this because those who are most \nvulnerable in our society deserve the most protection.\n  Today's bill, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection \nAct, would fundamentally alter this delicate balance achieved after a \ncentury of jurisprudence. We are altering the bankruptcy landscape for \nthe benefit of credit card industry without understanding or \nrecognizing what the consequences for families will be. Women and \nchildren will be disproportionately affected by this legislation unless \nit is amended, which is what I am trying to do with the amendment now \nbefore us.\n\n  Whether as debtors filing for bankruptcy themselves or as creditors, \nthree-quarters of a million women will be affected this year by the \nbankruptcy system, and it is estimated that as many as 1 million women \nwill be affected in the coming year. I agree with those of my \ncolleagues who think the bankruptcy law needs to be reformed and \ntightened. I do not disagree at all with that. But in my view it is \npossible to enact legislation that tightens the laws without depriving \ndebtors and their families of reasonably necessary living expenses to \ncare for their children.\n  As this legislation is currently drafted, however, the credit card \nindustry is protected, more protected than they have ever been. \nUnfortunately, families are not, in my view. This bill could turn the \nlives of children and families literally upside-down.\n  I think it is enough of an emotional roller coaster for a parent to \nfile bankruptcy, but I think to elevate the needs of the credit card \ncompanies over the needs of children is simply wrong. I am greatly \nconcerned about the means test, which requires the trustee in \nbankruptcy to review all chapter 7 cases for ability to pay debts under \na rigid IRS formula devised originally for delinquent taxpayers, now to \nbe applied to bankruptcies. These standards neither take into \nconsideration differences in the cost of living from region to region, \nnor do they ascribe rational expenses for the use of individual \nfamilies. In my view, these rigid standards will deprive children and \nfamilies of reasonably necessary living expenses.\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\n  While moving child support to a first priority among unsecured \ncreditors in chapter 7 sounds good, it is virtually meaningless, \nhowever.\n  Listen to this. Fewer than 4 percent of chapter 7 debtors have \nanything to distribute to unsecured creditors. Listen to that again. \nFewer than 4 percent of chapter 7 debtors have anything to distribute \nto unsecured creditors. That is to say 96 percent of these debtors have \nnothing to give out. So saying under chapter 7, ``you are first in \nline,'' means absolutely nothing except to 4 percent of those debtors. \nFirst in line when there is nothing means nothing. This is not a \nprotection for women and families. It sounds good, but it is totally \nhollow when it comes to seeing to these children and these families \nwhom, for 100 years, we have done a better job of protecting.\n  Additionally, because the means test increases the potential for \ndismissing chapter 7 cases, this bill channels many debtors into the 5-\nyear, chapter 13 repayment plans, even though we know for a fact that \ntwo-thirds of such plans fail today. What will families live on during \nthis time? What are proponents of this legislation going to do, go back \nto the time of Charles Dickens or debtors prisons?\n  Under chapter 13, the bill would require that larger payments be made \nto credit card companies. As a result, payments of past-due child \nsupport would be made in smaller amounts and over a longer period of \ntime, thus increasing the risk that children will not receive the \nsupport they need and the full debt would never be paid.\n  Mothers and children would be in direct competition with credit card \ncompanies employing well-financed collection departments. How do you \nthink mothers and children will fare when it comes down to competing? \nIt is hard enough under the present system for these people to collect \nthe $95 billion they are owed in one single year in child support, when \nthey now are going to also have to compete, under chapter 13, with \ncredit card companies who are well heeled and in a far better position \nfinancially, with teams of lawyers, to go after these debtors. I do not \nbelieve anybody could rationally conclude that a mother raising two or \nthree children on her own, with limited resources, is going to be able \nto hire the lawyers to compete with the credit card companies going \nafter the debtor husbands in these cases.\n  Those are the practical realities. So for children and families, this \nbill makes life a lot worse because of exactly what I have explained: \nwe are moving people out of chapter 7, where there was nothing much to \ngive anyway, into chapter 13, where it becomes far easier for larger \namounts of these resources, larger payments, to be made to the credit \ncard companies.\n  I am very concerned about the provisions of the legislation that make \ncertain credit card debt nondischargeable. While the family support \nprovisions added to this legislation are positive improvements, they \nhave not cured the problems caused by the other provisions of the bill. \nIn fact, they are negated by them, in my view. These are provisions \nthat give far greater collection rights to the credit card lenders and \nfewer, in my view, to families and children.\n  This bill elevates credit card debt to a presumed nondischargeable \nstatus. If a debtor purchases items or services on credit from a single \ncreditor within 90 days of bankruptcy, and such items exceed $500 in \nvalue, these items would be presumed luxuries.\n  Listen to that again. Within 90 days, if you make purchases from a \nsingle creditor exceeding $500, they are presumed luxuries--in 90 \ndays--3 months.\n  Again, if you are a single parent with two or three kids, over 90 \ndays $500 is not a huge amount when you are talking about groceries or \nother essentials. Over a 3-month period--stretch it out and do the \nmath--$500 over 90 days is really, in 21st century dollars, even if you \ngo to the best discount stores, not going to be enough to make it. \nCurrent law allows up to $1,225 to be discharged within 60 days of \nbankruptcy. The bill as reported would limit it to $500 within 90 days, \nas I have said. The amendment I will offer when the time comes to vote \non it will allow not $500 but less than $1,200 to $1,000 within 70 \ndays. So it is less than 90, a bit more than 60. It is less than $1,200 \nunder current law but certainly more than $500 to get you to $1,000.\n  Again, I don't think this is any great luxury. You are trying to meet \nthe needs of your family. To declare them to be luxuries--it doesn't \nseem a lot to me. Over a 90-day period it is not that hard to spend \n$501 at Wal-Mart to meet kids' needs. Most would agree such purchases \nare not luxuries. In 90 days alone, a family with children could exceed \n$500 on other expenses that arise with children.\n  My amendment requires creditors to prove at a hearing that such items \nwere not reasonably necessary for the maintenance and support of the \ndebtor and her dependents, shifting the burden to creditors rather than \nthe parents. If the creditor wants to make the case, let them do it, \nbut don't lay the burden for $501 on a single mother with young kids to \nhire lawyers to go in and make the case these are not luxury items. I \nshift the burden over to the creditors. If they want to make the case, \nthey can do so.\n  I don't know what the proponents of this legislation are intending \nhere, other than to protect the credit card companies at the expense of \nchildren. If you have $501 of food, medicine, and clothing expenses, \nand it is incurred within the last 90 days, then you have to go to \ncourt and spend money to prove these are not luxuries--food, medicine, \nand clothing. This point is one I find stunning in its potential \nimplications. By the very fact that you are in bankruptcy court, how \nare you going to hire a lawyer to go in and prove that $501 was for \nnecessities and not luxuries? We need to be far more practical than \nthat, it seems. To go to Wal-Mart and buy food and clothes for your \nchildren, necessities they may need, that is considered a luxury if it \nis more than $500.\n  If you are a single woman as a creditor, then you must wait until \nyour ex-husband tries, or does not try, to defend a similar purchase. \nIf he is unsuccessful, there will be less money for him to pay child \nsupport.\n  So on either side of the equation, if you are the woman raising \nchildren on your own, either as a debtor or a creditor, this places \ntremendous burdens on your family. If this section is sustained in the \nbill, then I urge the President to veto it, which I am told he would \nnot do, but I hope he would. This legislation, regardless of what else \nis here, I think putting credit card debt ahead of kids is just wrong.\n  I think all my colleagues are probably familiar with the popular TV \nad where a father takes his son to a baseball game, they rack up maybe \n$100 in costs--tickets, parking, hot dogs, sodas, maybe a popcorn to \nshare and a small souvenir. The tag line in the commercial says: ``Cost \nof the memory--priceless.''\n  What the commercial doesn't tell you about is the memory may be \npriceless, but if the next day that dad is unlucky enough to lose his \njob, have a heart attack, incur enormous hospital expenses without \nhealth insurance, and can't make his minimum payments on time, the \ncredit card companies are only too happy to turn priceless into pricey. \nUnfortunately, pricey for the family with finance charges, overcharges, \npenalty fees, and other means, can turn a dream into a nightmare.\n  This bill allows families to take a backseat to lenders, if lenders \nsay their claims are secured by the debtors' property. For the first \ntime in over 100 years, we have allowed these heretofore unsecured \ncreditors to get into the bankruptcy courthouse. Currently, child and \nfamily support, taxes, and student loans are not dischargeable debts. \nFor the first time in a century, the proposed legislation before us \nwould bring into this unique category these other creditors--i.e., \ncredit card companies--which will make the competition for scarce \nassets that much more fierce. These creditors have historically been \nunsecured because they have received the benefit of high interest and \nfinance charges. Now they are becoming effectively secured creditors.\n  With all of these concerns in mind, the amendment I am offering this \nafternoon seeks to address some of these problems. I hope these efforts \nwill win broad bipartisan support. I have been terribly disappointed \nthat there has been no willingness to even talk about some of these \namendments. I don't know why we can't do this. This is not the end of \nthe session. We are only in the month of March.\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\n  This is an important bill. I understand that. But it is going to have \nhuge implications for years to come if we don't sit down and listen to \neach other carefully to try to work out some of these matters so we can \nput a bill together. Yes, it may require a conference; it may require \nsome negotiation. But isn't that a wiser course to follow than to \nrubberstamp a proposal because the other body doesn't want to sit down \nin conference on the bankruptcy bill, particularly when we are talking \nagain about the most vulnerable in our society; that is, our children?\n  Again, I emphasize what I said at the outset. We are talking about \nthe innocents here. I don't want them to fall prey to the claim that \npeople taking bankruptcy are guilty of something somehow.\n  Again, if you accept the notion that most people who file bankruptcy \nare not doing so lightly, I don't know of anyone who likes to admit \nthey are so messed up in every way possible that they put themselves in \nthat situation. Are there people who take advantage? Yes. I know that \nis true. As we try to cure that problem, let us not create more \nproblems for those who through no fault of their own find themselves in \nthat situation; and, even worse yet, those who are completely innocent \nwho find themselves so disadvantaged that the ability of parents--\nparticularly single women raising children--to find it harder and \nharder to collect those child support payments they desperately need to \nlift these children out of poverty, to make ends meet in the 21st \ncentury, with companies going bankrupt every day. We must see to it \nthat those families who are already going through an awful lot don't \nfind themselves going through even more.\n  This amendment is a modest attempt to readjust this section of the \nbill, to inject some practicalities, to say that as we consider the \nrights of credit card companies we are not going to forget the rights \nof children, so we will put some reasonable ceiling in here to make it \npossible for everyone to be a winner, so people can go to bankruptcy \ncourt to get themselves out of debt, get on their feet again, see to it \nthat creditors are going to have an opportunity to collect the \nobligations that are owed them, and not penalize those who ought not be \na part of this debate in any consideration.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about these amendments. I know it means \nchanging the bill. I know it may mean going to a conference for a day \nor two. But I urge my colleagues to at least look at these proposals. \nIf they make some sense, as some of them do, can't we sit down and try \nto resolve some before we go ahead and pass a bill that I think many \nmay regret down the road when we consider the implications for those \nwho are going to be adversely affected by this legislation?\n  I also would like to add as part of the Record a couple of pieces of \ncorrespondence that speak to these particular issues. One is from the \nNational Women's Law Center, a letter dated February 23, 2005. I will \nnot read the whole letter. Let me read a couple of paragraphs, because \nthey go to the heart of what I am talking about here.\n  The letter reads:\n\n       S. 256 would make it harder for women to access the \n     bankruptcy system because the means test requires additional \n     paperwork of even the poorest filers, harder for women to \n     save their homes, cars and essential household items through \n     the bankruptcy process and harder for women to meet their \n     children's needs after bankruptcy because many more debts \n     would survive. The bill also would put women owed child or \n     spousal support who are bankruptcy creditors at a \n     disadvantage by increasing the rights of many other \n     creditors, including credit card companies, finance \n     companies, auto lenders and others. The bill would set up an \n     intense competition for scarce resources between mothers and \n     children owed support and these commercial creditors during \n     and after bankruptcy.\n\n  The letter goes on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the National Women's Law \nCenter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  National Women's Law Center,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 2005.\n     Re oppose S. 256, the Bankruptcy Act of 2005.\n\n       Dear Senator: The National Women's Law Center is writing to \n     urge you to oppose S. 256, a bankruptcy bill that is harsh on \n     economically vulnerable women and their families, but that \n     fails to address serious abuses of the bankruptcy system by \n     perpetrators of violence against patients and health care \n     professionals at women's health care clinics.\n       This bill would inflict additional hardship on over one \n     million economically vulnerable women and families who are \n     affected by the bankruptcy system each year: those forced \n     into bankruptcy because of job loss, medical emergency, or \n     family breakup--factors which account for nine out of ten \n     filings--and women who are owed child or spousal support by \n     men who file for bankruptcy. Contrary to the claims of some \n     proponents of the bill, low- and moderate-income filers--who \n     are disproportionately women--are not protected from most of \n     its harsh provisions, and mothers owed child or spousal \n     support are not protected from increased competition from \n     credit card companies and other commercial creditors during \n     and after bankruptcy that will make it harder for them to \n     collect support.\n       The bill would make it more difficult for women facing \n     financial crises to regain their economic stability through \n     the bankruptcy process. S. 256 would make it harder for women \n     to access the bankruptcy system, because the means test \n     requires additional paperwork of even the poorest filers; \n     harder for women to save their homes, cars, and essential \n     household items through the bankruptcy process; and harder \n     for women to meet their children's needs after bankruptcy \n     because many more debts would survive.\n       The bill also would put women owed child or spousal support \n     who are bankruptcy creditors at a disadvantage. By increasing \n     the rights of many other creditors, including credit card \n     companies, finance companies, auto lenders and others, the \n     bill would set up an intensified competition for scarce \n     resources between mothers and children owed support and these \n     commercial creditors during and after bankruptcy. The \n     domestic support provisions in the bill may have been \n     intended to protect the interests of mothers and children; \n     unfortunately, they fail to do so.\n       Moving child support to first priority among unsecured \n     creditors in Chapter 7 sounds good, but is virtually \n     meaningless; even today, with no means test limiting access \n     to Chapter 7, fewer than four percent of Chapter 7 debtors \n     have anything to distribute to unsecured creditors. In \n     Chapter 13, the bill would require that larger payments be \n     made to many commercial creditors; as a result, payments of \n     past-due child support would have to be made in smaller \n     amounts and over a longer period of time, increasing the risk \n     that child support debts will not be paid in full. And, when \n     the bankruptcy process is over, women and children owed \n     support would face increased competition from commercial \n     creditors. Under current law, child and spousal support are \n     among the few debts that survive bankruptcy; under this bill, \n     many additional debts would survive. But once the bankruptcy \n     process is over, the priorities that apply during bankruptcy \n     have no meaning or effect. Women and children owed support \n     would be in direct competition with the sophisticated \n     collection departments of commercial creditors whose \n     surviving claims would be increased.\n       At the same time, the bill fails to address real abuses of \n     the bankruptcy system. Perpetrators of violence against \n     patients and health care professionals at women's health \n     clinics have engaged in concerted efforts to use the \n     bankruptcy system to evade responsibility for their illegal \n     actions. This bill does nothing to curb this abuse.\n       The bill is profoundly unfair and unbalanced. Unless there \n     are major changes to S. 256, we urge you to oppose it.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Nancy Duff Campbell,\n        Co-President.\n     Marcia Greenberger,\n       Co-President.\n     Joan Entmacher,\n       Vice President and Diretor, Family Economic Security.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to quote a letter from the Children's \nDefense Fund, again expressing their concern about these sections of \nthe bill. I will read from this letter as well.\n\n       The Children's Defense Fund is writing to urge you to \n     oppose S. 256, the bankruptcy bill, that would hurt many \n     Americans facing financial problems through job loss, \n     divorce, child rearing, lack of medical insurance, or \n     predatory lending practices. This bill would inflict hardship \n     on more than 1 million economically vulnerable women and \n     families who are affected by the bankruptcy system each year. \n     Medical emergency, job loss and family breakup are important \n     factors which account for nine out of ten filing for \n     bankruptcy. The bill would also hurt women who are owed child \n     or spousal support by men who file bankruptcy. The bill would \n     make it far more difficult for women to collect support \n     because credit card companies and other commercial creditors \n     will have greater claims to the debtor's resources during and \n     after bankruptcy. Being first among unsecured creditors in \n     chapter 7 bankruptcy is meaningless when over 95 percent of \n     debtors have no resources to pay unsecured creditors.\n       In chapter 13, the bill would require larger payments to be \n     made to many commercial creditors resulting in smaller \n     payments to past-due child support over longer periods of \n     time increasing the risk that child support debts will not be \n     paid in full. And after the\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\n     bankruptcy is over, more and more debts owed to commercial \n     creditors will survive, and mothers and children owed support \n     are not a match for the collection departments of the \n     commercial credit industry.\n       S. 256 contains a number of provisions which would have a \n     severe impact on families trying to regain their economic \n     stability through the bankruptcy process.\n\n  The letter goes on. Those are pertinent paragraphs when it comes to \nthe amendment which I am offering here today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                                                     March 3, 2005\n     Re Oppose S. 256, The Bankruptcy Act of 2005.\n       Dear Senators: The Children's Defense Fund is writing to \n     urge you to oppose S. 256, a bankruptcy bill that would hurt \n     many Americans facing financial problems due to job loss, \n     divorce, child-rearing, lack of medical insurance, or \n     predatory lending practices. This bill would inflict hardship \n     on more than one million economically vulnerable women and \n     families who are affected by the bankruptcy system each year. \n     Medical emergency, job loss or family breakups are factors \n     which account for nine out of ten filings.\n       The bill would also hurt women who are owed child or \n     spousal support by men who file for bankruptcy. The bill \n     would make it more difficult for mothers to collect support \n     because credit card companies and other commercial creditors \n     will have greater claims to the debtor's resources during and \n     after bankruptcy. Being first among unsecured creditors in \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcy is meaningless when over 95 percent of \n     debtors have no resources to pay unsecured creditors. In \n     Chapter 13, the bill would require larger payments to be made \n     to many commercial creditors, resulting in smaller payments \n     of past-due child support over a longer period of time, \n     increasing the risk that child support debts will not be paid \n     in full. And after the bankruptcy is over, more more debts \n     owed to commercial creditors will survive--and mothers and \n     children owed support are not a match for the collection \n     departments of the commercial credit industry.\n       S. 256 contains a number of provisions which would have a \n     severe impact on families trying to regain their economic \n     stability through the bankruptcy process. S. 256 would make \n     it harder for women to access the bankruptcy system. Low and \n     moderate income families are not protected from many of the \n     bill's harsh provisions. Parents who desperately need to \n     preserve their homes from foreclosure or prevent their \n     families from being evicted, or keep a car to get a work, \n     would find it more difficult to do so. And, when the \n     bankruptcy process was over, parents already facing economic \n     disadvantage would find it harder to focus their income on \n     reasonable and necessary support for dependent children \n     because many more debts would survive.\n       Passage of the bankruptcy bill would make it harder for \n     families struck by financial misfortune to get back on track. \n     It would benefit the very profitable credit card industry at \n     the expense of the modest-income families who represent the \n     great majority of these who declare bankruptcy. Congress \n     should not enact reform that puts women and children at \n     greater risk. The bill is profoundly unfair and unbalanced. \n     Unless there are major changes to S. 256, we urge you to \n     oppose it.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                             Deborah Cutler Ortiz,\n                               Director of Family Income and Jobs.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Association for Children for Enforcement \nof Support is supporting this amendment and opposes the legislation. \nThe American Association of University Women, American Medical Women's \nAssociation, the Business and Professional Women of the United States, \nthe Center for Law and Social Policy, the Center for the Childcare \nWorkforce, Child Welfare League of America, the National Council of \nJewish Women, the National Organization for Women, the National \nPartnership for Women and Families, the YWCA of the United States--all \nare groups which support the amendment and oppose this legislation.\n  Again, I realize the hour is late. We are getting closer to passage \nof this bill. I don't think it is so late, however, not to try to make \nsome modest changes in this legislation that I think would go a long \nway to providing some relief for families.\n  Again, this is one of the areas of law that is written into our \nConstitution. Article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, drafted \nback in the 18th century, specifically provided and called upon the \nCongress of the United States to enact bankruptcy laws. To understand \nwhy they did so, go back and look at the Federalist Papers. They talked \nabout doing it as an opportunity for people to get back on their feet \nagain. That was the idea--to see to it that creditors could be \ncompensated to the maximum extent possible, but that also those filing \nfor bankruptcy would begin a new chapter in their lives, to get on \ntheir feet again.\n  It seems to me we ought to be trying to do that with this \nlegislation, not only helping the creditors collect what is due them, \nbut simultaneously making it possible for good people to get a fresh \nstart.\n  If in the process of helping the creditors get paid we make it more \ndifficult for people to get on their feet again, we are lacking the \nbalance which I think we ought to be striking with this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues not to necessarily rely on what I have said here \ntoday, but to review these sections of the bill and ask yourself \nrealistically whether in this day and age the kind of caps we are \nputting on, kind of forcing people into the chapter 13 category, if we \nare not exactly undoing what we have done for 100 years to modern \nbankruptcy laws.\n  The modern bankruptcy laws put not only families first but they also \nleft them alone. If you were dealing with child support and alimony, \nonce you paid those, or set up a payment schedule, whatever is left \nover, you dispensed to your creditors, you were not only the first in \nline, you were the only one in line. This changes that. You can be \nfirst in line under this bill, but you are not the only one in line, \nand other people in line have far more resources and strength to be \nable to compete for those debtors' funds to compensate these creditors. \nIt puts families at a disadvantage.\n  There are a lot of other reasons to be concerned about this bill. I \nknow my colleagues care about children. I know they care about \nfamilies. They want to see these innocents have a chance for a decent \nlife. This bankruptcy bill, if not amended, will make it far more \ndifficult to achieve those goals.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask consent that at 5:45 today the \nSenate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Feingold amendment \nNo. 89, with the time equally divided in the usual form until the vote; \nprovided further that no amendments be in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the action we just took be vitiated. I will wait \nuntil Senator Durbin gets to the floor and I will reoffer the consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:45 \ntoday the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to Feingold \namendment No. 89, with the time equally divided in the usual form until \nthe vote; provided further that no amendments be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the majority whip would yield for a question, I have \nthree germane amendments pending. I think others are in the same \nposition, including Senator Feingold. It is my hope to move as quickly \nas possible to a quick, limited debate, for just very short periods of \ntime, and then to vote on these amendments in an effort to keep the \nbill moving forward. I ask the Republican whip whether or not there are \nplans to call any other votes today or early tomorrow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I might say to my friend from Illinois, \nwe have been reviewing amendments. I am hopeful we can have some \ndiscussion between now and the vote about how we proceed from here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 89\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold have 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, we are about to vote on an amendment that will tell \nthis Nation's small businesses whether we stand with them. This bill \nincludes a number of new restrictions and requirements for small \nbusinesses that want to reorganize under chapter 11. These requirements \nand restrictions for small businesses don't apply to large companies. I \nwas shocked when this came to my attention, but there it is in black \nand white: Subtitle B, Small Business Bankruptcy Provisions. And these \nare not provisions to help small businesses as one might expect from a \nbill that is going through the United States Senate. No, these \nprovisions penalize small businesses. They make it harder to reorganize \nin order to survive.\n  These new provisions are entirely unnecessary. There is no crisis in \nsmall business bankruptcies. And a new study shows. that most failed \nattempts at chapter 11 reorganization are concluded within 300 days, \nwhich is the hard deadline in the bill. But 40 percent of \nreorganizations that succeed take longer than 300 days. That means that \nthis bill is going to make some small businesses fail that don't have \nto. That is an absurd result. Remember the United Air Lines Chapter 11 \nreorganization is over two years old and it is still going on. Why \nshouldn't small businesses get that kind of leeway if there is a chance \nthey can pull through?\n  These provisions haven't received nearly the attention in this body \nthat the portions of the bill that deal with consumer bankruptcies have \nreceived. We need to take these provisions out. Doing so won't have any \neffect on the core provisions of this bill. But it will prevent a real \ninjustice from being done to small businesses. Forcing a small business \nto liquidate rather than reorganize is bad for creditors, bad for \nconsumers, and bad for small businesses. I urge the adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Chairman Grassley would ask for a no vote, \nas would Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Feingold \namendment No. 89.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson.)

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my amendment, cosponsored by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Cantwell, would greatly assist the many victims of \ndomestic violence whose physical well-being or whose children's \nphysical well-being would be threatened by summary eviction as a result \nof filing or bankruptcy. I ask unanimous consent that the text of our \namendment be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The connection between domestic violence, economic abuse, \nand housing is overwhelming. Women and children who are fleeing \ndomestic violence make up a significant portion of the homeless \npopulation. According to the United States Conference of Mayors, 57 \npercent of cities surveyed identified domestic violence as a primary \ncause of homelessness.\n  These women and children are homeless because in their desperate \nattempt to leave their abusers they find themselves with few, if any, \nfunds with which they can support themselves. Victims of domestic \nviolence have a tough time finding room at emergency homeless or \ndomestic violence shelters, and often fail to find adequate housing \nbecause affordable, long-term housing is not available in so many \ncommunities. If housing is available there are often long waiting \nlists. Victims face unique causes of their financial hardships due to \nthe fact that batterers frequently harass their victims at work, and \nsurvivors are often fired or cannot maintain steady employment \nresulting in losing the ability to pay for housing. Faced with the lack \nof stable housing, finances and services, victims must choose between \nlife with an abusive partner and life on the streets.\n  Our amendment would provide leniency for women and children who are \naffected by domestic violence and would, in fact, help victims to move \nforward and start new lives. Without the threat of losing their \nhousing, women and children who are survivors of domestic violence will \nnot be forced to a situation where they are homeless or returning to \ntheir abuser.\n  This amendment would modify the bankruptcy code to ensure better \nprotection for victims of domestic violence by granting them relief \nfrom summary eviction from their rental housing. Relief may be granted \nonly under the condition that the debtors certify under penalty of \nperjury that they are victims of domestic violence whose physical well-\nbeing or whose children's physical well-being would be threatened \nthrough eviction. our amendment would not allow families to take \nadvantage of the system, but it will be a life-saver for those who \nwould face danger if they lost their homes.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Coalition Against \nDomestic Violence, the National Network To End Domestic Violent and the \nFamily Violence Prevention Fund. I ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record letters from those groups voicing that support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 7, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: As national organizations working to address \n     the varied needs of victims of domestic violence, we urge you \n     to support Senator Leahy's proposed amendment to the \n     Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of \n     2005, S. 256. This provision is essential for the many \n     victims of domestic violence whose physical well-being or \n     whose children's physical well-being would be threatened by \n     summary eviction as a result of filing for bankruptcy.\n       Economic abuse is an integral part of domestic violence. \n     Abusers often assert economic control by forbidding their \n     victims from working, giving them little or no access to \n     family finances, or destroying their credit. Many battered \n     women have current or former partners who actively interfere \n     with their efforts to work, harass them at work, threaten \n     them and their children, withhold transportation or \n     childcare, or beat them so severely that they cannot work. \n     These victims are sometimes pushed into filing for bankruptcy \n     as a result of this abuse.\n       Evicting these victims from their homes not only \n     exacerbates an already difficult situation, but also puts \n     many families in direct danger. On average, it takes six to \n     ten months to secure housing. During this time, victims would \n     be forced to stay at emergency homeless or domestic violence \n     shelters. Unfortunately, those shelters are often full; in \n     2003, 32% of the requests for shelter by homeless families \n     went unmet due to the lack of emergency shelter beds \n     available. Even when space is available, most shelters limit \n     the length of stay to 30 days.\n       Faced with this lack of housing and services, victims must \n     choose between life with an abusive partner or life on the \n     streets. Studies indicate that victims of domestic violence \n     often return to their abusers because they cannot find long-\n     term or transitional housing. At the other extreme, more than \n     50% of homeless women and children are homeless because they \n     are fleeing domestic violence. Once homeless, women are at \n     high risk for experiencing further violence. Many studies \n     have found that 90-100% of homeless women have been \n     physically or sexually assaulted.\n       The tremendously negative impact of such evictions becomes \n     greater when victims with children are forced out of their \n     homes. Children without a home are in fair or poor health \n     twice as often as other children, and\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\n     have higher rates of asthma, ear infections, stomach \n     problems, and speech problems. Homeless children are also \n     more likely to experience mental health problems, such as \n     anxiety, depression, and withdrawal. They are twice as likely \n     to experience hunger, and four times as likely to have \n     delayed development. School-age homeless children face \n     barriers to enrolling and attending school, including \n     transportation problems, residency requirements, inability to \n     obtain previous school records, and lack of clothing and \n     school supplies.\n       Individuals claiming relief under this provision would be \n     required to testify, under penalty of perjury, that they were \n     victims of domestic violence and that they or their children \n     would be in physical jeopardy if they were evicted. Thus, \n     this amendment will not allow families to take advantage of \n     the system, but will be life-saving for those who would be in \n     danger if they lost their homes.\n       We urge you to support Senator Leahy's amendment and \n     provide this much needed assistance to domestic violence \n     victims.\n           Sincerely,\n     Allison Randall,\n       National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n     Jill Morris,\n       National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\n     Kiersten Stewart,\n       Family Violence Prevention Fund.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        National Coalition Against\n\n\n                                            Domestic Violence,\n\n                                                  February 28,2005\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: It is with great support that I write \n     to you on behalf of the National Coalition Against Domestic \n     Violence and the more than 3,000 local shelter programs that \n     we represent to thank you for your efforts to assist those \n     individuals that are or have been impacted by the vast \n     epidemic of domestic violence. '\n       Women fleeing domestic violence make up a significant \n     portion of the homeless population. According to The United \n     States Conference of Mayors (December, 1999) 57 percent of \n     cities surveyed identified domestic violence as a primary \n     cause of homelessness. Therefore, amending the bankruptcy \n     code, as proposed in S. 256, with a provision that provides \n     leniency on persons who are affected by domestic violence \n     would, in fact, help victims to move forward and start new \n     lives. Without the threat of losing their housing victims \n     will not be forced to a situation where they are homeless or \n     returning to their abuser.\n       Victims of domestic violence often cannot find adequate \n     housing. One very important--reason is that affordable, long \n     term housing is not available in their communities. If \n     housing is available there are often long waiting lists or \n     the abuser is able to quickly locate and begin abusing the \n     survivor at her new residence. Secondly, due to the fact that \n     batterers frequently harass their victims at work, survivors \n     are often fired or cannot maintain steady employment \n     resulting in loss ability to pay for housing. Lastly victims \n     of domestic violence are forced to remain in abusive \n     relationships because of financial dependency and the lack of \n     stable housing. The amendment to S. 256 recognizes that \n     victims of domestic violence are in a dangerous situation and \n     should not be forced from housing due their financial \n     difficulties.\n       We commend you on your efforts to ensure that those who are \n     affected by domestic violence are taken into consideration \n     when the Senate reviews this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jill Morris,\n                                           Public Policy Director.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Congress must recognize that victims of domestic violence \nface dangerous situations and should not be forced from housing due to \ntheir financial difficulties. We cannot force women and children who \nhave endured domestic violence from safe spaces that provide the \nstability needed to make a new life.\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    (Purpose: To protect victims of domestic violence who file for \n   bankruptcy from summary eviction if their physical well-being is \n                              threatened)\n\n       On page 156, line 18, insert ``, unless the debtor \n     certifies under penalty of perjury that the debtor is a \n     victim of domestic violence whose physical well-being or \n     whose children's physical well-being would be threatened if \n     relief from the stay is granted'' before the semicolon.\n\n                        regulating credit cards\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the willingness of the chairman and \nranking member of the Banking Committee to work with Senators Kyl, \nBrownback, and me on this important issue. And I understand that the \nBanking Committee has an interest in regulating credit cards.\n  I would like to state here, for the record, the key points of the \nagreement that we have arrived at:\n  Senators Shelby and Sarbanes have agreed to hold a hearing within 6 \nmonths on the substance of the amendment to the Bankruptcy Bill that \nSenator Kyl, Brownback, and I offered, on increasing notice to credit \ncard holders who pay only their minimum monthly payments. I understand \nthat this hearing will address a set of issues relating to credit cards \nand consumer rights. However, I also understand that Senators Shelby \nand Sarbanes will ensure that the substance of agreement, will be \ndirectly considered, and will be an area of focus, during that hearing, \nand that I will be afforded the opportunity to testify.\n  I understand that Senators Shelby and Sarbanes will work with me, \nwith Senator Kyl, and with members of the Banking Committee to ensure \nthat this issue and my bill are carefully considered. My bill would \ngive those consumers who make only the minimum required payments for 6 \nmonths detailed notice about the interest and length of time that it \nwill take them to pay their own individual debt and interest.\n  Because the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee \nagree to take these actions, I will agree to withdraw my amendment. Do \nSenators Shelby and Sarbanes agree?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I absolutely agree with Senator Feinstein and look \nforward to working with the Senator.\n  I say to Senator Sarbanes, through the course of the debate on the \nbankruptcy bill it has become clear that there are many Senators who \nhave concerns about numerous aspects of the credit card industry.\n  I want to indicate for the record that I share many of these \nconcerns. Furthermore, I want to point out that I am aware of his \nparticular concerns as well as those of Senators Kyl and Feinstein.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank Chairman Shelby and Senator Feinstein. I \nappreciate their interest in this matter and believe these are serious \nissues that merit further attention.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I fully agree and therefore I am willing to commit to \nholding a hearing in the Banking Committee to examine the practices \nwithin the credit card industry. I believe it is our responsibility to \ndevelop a complete record on these matters so that we can make informed \njudgments as to whether we need to take any specific actions.\n  I look forward to obtaining input from Senator Sarbanes and from \nSenators Kyl and Feinstein in putting together this hearing.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank Chairman Shelby for his leadership on this \nissue. I look forward to working with the Senator on developing a \nhearing at which the Banking Committee will receive testimony on credit \ncare disclosures and other practices. A number of Senators have raised \nsignificant issues regarding the credit card industry and I appreciate \nthe Senator's willingness to examine them and hear all interested \nSenators.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I agree.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will support the Chairman's efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2230-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President; this month marks the 60th anniversary of \nthe victory at Iwo Jima. That battle is remembered as one of the \nbloodiest in Marine Corps history. Approximately 70,000 American and \n22,000 Japanese troops engaged in a month long battle for the Pacific \nIsland that was critical to the air bombardment of mainland Japan. The \nheroic achievements of our nation's warriors throughout this \ntreacherous battle attest to the courage and character not only of the \nbrave men who fought there, but of our nation as a whole.\n  The island of Iwo Jima consists of coarse volcanic sand that impeded \nthe movement of men and machines as they struggled up the beach. Unable \nto dig fighting holes, the Marines were\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\nsitting ducks for the Japanese gunners hiding in a network of caves. \nSuribachi, the 550-foot volcanic mountain at the island's southern end, \nallowed Japanese gunners to zero in on every inch of the landing beach. \nBlockhouses and pillboxes flanked the landing areas, leading historians \nto describe the attack as ``throwing human flesh against reinforced \nconcrete.'' The 36-day assault on Iwo Jima resulted in more than 23,200 \nAmericans wounded, and another 6,800 who paid the ultimate price.\n  The battle, which involved the largest number of Marines committed to \na single operation during World War II, featured superior service \ncooperation. The Navy-Marine Corps team functioned as a model of \nefficiency. To make victory possible, more than 450 ships massed in the \nsurrounding waters. Among those ships was the aircraft carrier USS \nSaratoga, and on board that ship was my brother, John Hanford. Having \ngraduated from Duke University and joined the Navy at 19, he became an \naviation supply officer. John's battle station was a 20 millimeter gun \nbattery, where he led a 15-man team. Tasked with laying an impenetrable \ncurtain of anti-aircraft fire, the 20 millimeter batteries provided the \nship's last line of defense from attacking Japanese Zeros and \nkamikazes.\n  The Saratoga was part of the legendary Task Force 58, commanded by \nthe superb strategist, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher, who executed a \ndiversionary air bombardment of Japan on the initial days of the Iwo \nJima assault. On February 21st, the Saratoga and three destroyers moved \nsouth, to provide direct air support for the Marines on Iwo Jima. \nAlthough the 20 millimeter batteries were effective out to a mile, the \nlow cloud layer that day as the Saratoga came on station, forced my \nbrother and the rest of the crew to mount a desperate, close-in defense \nof the ship.\n  In full view of Mt. Suribachi, the Saratoga was subjected to two \nwaves of Japanese air attacks. During the first wave, her radar picked \nup a large threat, estimated at 20 to 25 planes. Despite the deadly \nanti-aircraft fire, within 3 minutes three bombs plunged into the \nSaratoga, immediately followed by four kamikaze hits.\n  Her crew fought fires blazing in the hangar deck, and her planes were \ndirected to land on the nearby escort carriers. Roughly 2 hours later, \nfive kamikazes targeted her again. Four were shot down but one dropped \na bomb, which exploded over her flight deck before the plane itself \nbounced over the side. During the air attacks, the crew could see the \nUSS Bismarck being struck by a kamikaze and minutes later sinking with \na crew of 218 aboard. The Saratoga's losses were 192 sailors and \nMarines wounded, 123 killed or missing. And, as a youngster growing up \nin Salisbury, NC, I well remember my revered big brother coming home on \nwhat was called ``survivor's leave.''\n  Though extremely costly, the ability to launch and recover aircraft \non Iwo Jima was critical to the strategic bombing campaign and \nultimately to the American victory in the Japanese theater. The \nisland's capture served to increase the operating range, payload, and \nsurvival rate of the big bombers. While the monthly tonnage of high \nexplosives dropped on Imperial Japan increased eleven-fold during March \nalone, the greatest value of Iwo Jima was to serve as an emergency \nlanding field for crippled B-29s returning from bombing runs. By war's \nend, a total of 2,400 bombers carrying over 27,000 crewmen made forced \nlandings on the island. Without control of Iwo Jima, many of these men \nwould have been lost at sea. Noted one B-29 pilot, ``whenever I landed \non the island, I thanked God for the men who fought for it.''\n  One of the many heroes of the fierce land battle was PFC Jack Lucas, \nborn and raised in North Carolina. He is the Nation's youngest Medal of \nHonor recipient of the 20th century and the youngest Marine ever to \nreceive that award. Anxious to fight for his country, this son of a \ntobacco farmer forged his mother's signature and enlisted in the Marine \nCorps at age 14. Frustrated with an assignment to a training command, \nhe stowed away on a ship bound for Iwo Jima. Six days after his 17th \nbirthday, he and three other men were attacked by grenades. The men \njumped into a shallow hole; as a grenade landed next to them, Private \nLucas threw his body over it. When another grenade landed close by, \nPrivate Lucas pulled it under him and absorbed the blasts of both \ngrenades with his body, saving his fellow Marines from certain injury \nand possible death. Miraculously, he survived. Bob and I have had the \nprivilege of several visits with Jack and his wonderful wife.\n  Private Lucas is a representative of what has been hailed as ``The \nGreatest Generation.'' As evidenced by America's triumphs in numerous \nconflicts since World War II, the traits, the spirit of the Greatest \nGeneration have certainly been passed on. Today, approximately 14,000 \nMarines of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force, based in North \nCarolina, are in the process of deploying to Iraq to continue fighting \nfor freedom. I am very proud to recognize 41 Marine lieutenants who are \nsitting in the gallery today. These young men and women are the newest \nbearers of the torch of freedom so proudly carried by the Iwo Jima \nveterans. This platoon of recently commissioned officers is about to \nfinish training, and in a few short months many of them will find \nthemselves in direct combat supporting the global war against \nterrorism.\n  I applaud their selfless act, volunteering to serve our Nation during \nthis time of war; they represent our Nation's best. I have no doubt \nthat these young officers will have the privilege of leading many men \nand women who possess the same qualities of tenacity and valor \ndisplayed by Private Lucas.\n  I could not agree more with Jack Lucas who recently said, ``I am so \nproud of the people who serve today, whether in peacetime or in war. \nYou can't do anything better than serve America . . . I love our \ngovernment and our military and I think it's the most honorable thing a \nman or woman can do''.\n  The battle of Iwo Jima resulted in 27 Medals of Honor being awarded \nto Marines and sailors, many posthumously, more than awarded for any \nother operation during World War II. Commander of the Pacific Fleet, \nADM Chester Nimitz, immortalized the spirit of the battle noting that \n``among the Americans who served on Iwo Island, uncommon valor was a \ncommon virtue.'' The Marines present here today, as well as all of our \nmilitary members serving around the globe, are continuously making \nsacrifices to protect our freedoms. I am certain that they, too, \npossess the uncommon valor which has made our Nation so strong in the \npast, and will keep her strong well into the future.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At the outset, I thank my colleague from North Carolina \nfor coming to the floor and reminding us of this wonderful chapter in \nAmerican history, where the men who were on Iwo Jima and all the men \nand women who fought in World War II demonstrated such uncommon valor \nthat inspires us even to this day. The story the Senator has told us of \nMr. Lucas is nothing short of incredible: This 14-year-old boy \nperformed feats of courage which are almost unparalleled. In fact, as \nthe Senator noted, he is the youngest recipient of the Congressional \nMedal of Honor, which I am sure is a great source of pride.\n  The first job I ever had as a college intern in the Senate was for \nSenator Paul Douglas of Illinois, who enlisted in the Marine Corps at \nthe age of 50 and went through training at Parris Island, fought in \nOkinawa and was injured, as Senator Bob Dole was injured, with a \nserious injury to his left arm.\n  I have always had a special spot in my heart for the men and women \nwho serve in the Marine Corps, and I just want to join the Senator from \nNorth Carolina in making certain that this is bipartisan and \nnonpartisan in our salute to the Marine Corps, all the men and women in \nuniform, and particularly the great veterans of World War II and Iowa \nGermany.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I, too, want to commend Senator Dole for her \nstirring comments about the valiant Marines on Iwo Jima. My brother was \na Marine officer.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nabout the direction that the President is taking the country in terms \nof our Nation's commitment to providing retirement security to the \nelderly and income security to the disabled, widows, and survivors. I \nam speaking, of course, about the President's plan for privatizing \nSocial Security.\n  President Bush writes in his recently released Economic Report of the \nPresident, ``The greatest fiscal challenges we face arise from the \naging of our society.'' Yet his annual Economic Report devotes little \nmore than a page and a half to this important subject.\n  As his Economic Report reveals, the President has no real plan to \naddress the fiscal challenges arising from the retirement of the baby \nboom generation, let alone a plan to fix Social Security. All the \nPresident has is an unaffordable plan to create private retirement \naccounts, with few specifics and many unanswered questions.\n  That is not stopping the President from barnstorming the country \ntelling the American people that Social Security is a sinking ship and \nprivate accounts are the lifeboats into which we should jump. But the \nadministration is manufacturing a crisis that does not exist in order \nto dismantle Social Security.\n  Despite the administration's claims, Social Security will remain \nsolvent for nearly 50 more years. Even after that, Social Security \nwould still be able to pay 70 to 80 percent of benefits. Modest changes \nto the system would enable Social Security to pay full benefits well \nbeyond the next 50 years.\n  No other retirement system or Fortune 500 company in the United \nStates can make that same claim. In fact, the weakness of traditional \npensions makes Social Security look like the most secure part of our \nretirement system right now.\n  To put the problem into perspective, making the Bush administration's \nfour enacted tax cuts permanent would cost three to five times more \nthan the Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.\n  For over 60 years, Social Security has provided a dependable and \npredictable stream of income to retired or disabled workers, their \ndependents and their survivors. Forty-eight million men, women, and \nchildren rely on Social Security benefits each month to help them live \nwith dignity. The benefits are protected from inflation and one cannot \noutlive them.\n  Social Security is an insurance program, not an investment plan, and \nprivate accounts would destroy much of the insurance value of the \nprogram. More than one-quarter of Social Security benefits go to \nsurvivors and disabled workers and their families, and these benefits \nwould be at risk under the President's proposal.\n  We all acknowledge the long-term fiscal imbalance of the Social \nSecurity trust fund. However, it is equally critical to recognize that \nthe President's private accounts do absolutely nothing to address this \nimbalance, as a senior administration official recently acknowledged. \nIn fact, diverting payroll tax revenues exacerbates insolvency and \naccelerates the date of trust fund imbalance.\n  For obvious reasons, the President has not mentioned this or other \nfacts that are so critical to the Social Security trust fund. His \nprivatization scheme requires cutting benefits by more than 40 percent, \neven for those who choose not to invest in privatized accounts.\n  Those choosing a private account could be hit with an additional \n``privatization tax'' of 70 percent or more of the value of their \naccount, which would be deducted from their Social Security benefits \nupon retirement.\n  President Bush has urged Congress to fix Social Security for younger \nworkers and not pass on the problem to future generations. However, the \nPresident's plan for private accounts would place a huge burden on our \nchildren and grandchildren by increasing Federal debt by over $750 \nbillion in just the next 10 years. This debt would rise to nearly $5 \ntrillion over the first 20 years that the plan is in place.\n  The President's private accounts would cut Social Security's funding, \nweaken the program, and make its financial problems worse, not better. \nIn short, private accounts pose a serious threat to the future economic \nsecurity of all Americans, particularly the most vulnerable members of \nour society.\n  This is why last week I joined 41 of my fellow Democratic senators in \ncalling on the President to publicly and unambiguously abandon his \nsupport for private accounts funded with Social Security dollars or \ncuts in guaranteed benefits.\n  At a time when our country is saving so little and fewer employers \nare offering traditional pension plans, Social Security's predictable, \ninflation-protected benefits that can't be outlived occupy a critical \nrole in ensuring our retirement security.\n  Before we can roll up our sleeves and delve into the very serious \nquestion of shoring up Social Security for all, we must set aside \nideology and acknowledge the demographic and fiscal challenges facing \nthis bedrock retirement security program.\n  I want to work with President Bush to promote personal wealth and \nsaving through investment, but not at the cost of Social Security. I \nurge the President to take private accounts off the table so that we \nmight achieve bipartisan agreement to strengthen Social Security for \nthe long-term and enhance the retirement security of all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2232-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2232-S2234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ``MADD AT GM'' CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the Senate this afternoon in \ndisbelief and sadness and a little anger. I am angry, sad, at the \nblatant disregard for common sense in a new ad campaign being promoted \nby a prominent trade association.\n  The American Beverage Licensees, or ABL, has launched a campaign \nentitled ``MADD at GM''--MADD referencing Mothers Against Driving \nDrunk, with the aim of stopping the charitable donations General Motors \ngives to Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\n  ABL claims that MADD has a ``neoprohibitionist agenda.'' Yes, the \nneoprohibitionist agenda is what they claim.\n  They claim that MADD ``wants to criminalize social drinking by \npreventing designated drivers from drinking before they get behind the \nwheel.'' Apparently in their world, designated drivers ought to be able \nto have a few drinks before getting on the road. In most people's \nworld, that defies all common sense.\n  In honor of MADD's 20th anniversary in 2000, General Motors made a \ncommitment to contribute $2.5 million over 5 years to MADD to combat \nunderage drinking, for underage drinking prevention, and drunk driving \nvictim assistance, a very laudable goal. I applaud General Motors for \ndoing this. But what has happened is, with General Motors' funding \ncommitment now expired, ABL has seen this as the perfect opportunity to \nattack General Motors. They are attacking a noble cause, and their \nattack makes no sense.\n  ABL's smear campaign against General Motors and MADD has taken many \nforms--an Internet Web site, print advertisements, TV ads during NASCAR \nevents, and through promotional materials distributed at bars, \nrestaurants, and other ABL member locations throughout the country. I \nhave brought two of these ads with me to the Senate floor this \nafternoon. Let me show the first ad.\n  This first advertisement plays off the well-known board game \nMonopoly. It explicitly states that by purchasing a General Motors car, \nany American is funding his or her own arrest. How absurd. It suggests \nthat because General Motors supports MADD and MADD is against drinking \nand driving that somehow General Motors is to blame if you get arrested \nfor being over the legal drinking limit. But last time I checked, in \nthis country we arrest people who have broken the law. And in this case \nthat is drinking too much before you get behind the wheel.\n  Let me show the second ad, just as outrageous. This advertisement, \nagain from the MADD at GM campaign, contradicts common sense as much as \nthe first one did. As you can see here, the man in the ad is posing for \nhis mug shot. But instead of holding his arrest number, he is holding a \nsign stating that his arrest was sponsored by General Motors. That is \nwhat it says.\n  General Motors didn't get this man arrested. Drinking and driving \ndid. The ad further states that General Motors\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\nsupports the arrest of social drinkers through its charitable donations \nto MADD. But that isn't the case at all. The simple fact is that if you \ndrink too much and you get in a car and drive, you break the law. It \ndoesn't matter if you label it as social drinking or not; what is wrong \nis wrong.\n  This ad says that ``MADD spends millions provided by GM to fund their \nroadblock promotion campaign. They're using your money to arrest you.''\n  That roadblock campaign is a program I strongly support and I know \nmany Members of the Senate support as well. It is also a program that \nthe Traffic Safety and Law Enforcement Campaign bill that Senator \nLautenberg and I are introducing today would help fund.\n  Let me show a third ad. This ad, however, is from MADD. In it you can \nsee a note from LT Carl McDonald about his daughter Carlie. It reads:\n\n       This is my precious little girl, Carlie. I always told her, \n     ``I will love you as long as there are stars in the sky.'' \n     She would always smile, look up at me and say, ``I love you \n     more than there are stars in the universe.'' These words are \n     now inscribed on her tombstone. At the tender age of five she \n     was killed by a drunk driver--her mother. If you think it \n     can't happen to you--think again. Please don't drink and \n     drive.\n\n  This was an ad brought to us by MADD.\n  The ad has more teeth in it than the other two ads combined. We all \nknow the truth; that is, drinking and driving is deadly. MADD is doing \nall it can do to help save lives and get drunk drivers off the road.\n  I think what is so alarming and irritating and makes us all so mad is \nthis campaign that is targeted against MADD, Mothers Against Drunk \nDrivers, an organization that has done so much good in this country in \nall 50 States.\n  I first came in contact with MADD when I was a State senator back in \nthe early 1980s. We had a little boy, a 7-year-old boy by the name of \nJustin Beason, who was tragically killed by a drunken driver in my home \ncounty. As a result, I introduced a bill in our State legislature, a \ntough drunk-driving bill. I can truthfully say it was through the \nsupport of MADD and MADD's members who went to the legislature, lobbied \nthe legislature, testified in front of the State legislature, wrote \nletters--if it wasn't for MADD, that bill would not have become law.\n  It is an organization that reminds us every day of the horrible \ntragedies and about people like Carlie--little children who lose their \nlives on highways every week because of drivers who were drinking. This \norganization has been so viciously attacked by this trade organization. \nIt is an organization made up of many parents who have lost children, \nand many times husbands who have lost wives, and wives who have lost \nhusbands--all to drunk drivers. It is a good organization. It is an \norganization we should all support. It is an organization of which we \nshould all be proud. Anyone who attacks it, I just don't understand.\n  Here are some statistics to think about: 69 percent of our youth died \nin alcohol-related fatalities in the year 2000 involved young drinking \ndrivers. Of the 42,000 people killed in all of the traffic accidents in \n2003, 40 percent--well over one-third--were due to alcohol. Further, \nsince MADD's founding in 1980, drunk-driving deaths have dramatically \ndecreased from 26,179 in 1982 to 17,013 in the year 2003. Clearly, MADD \nand other anti-drunk-driving campaigns are having an impact. We have \nbegun to change the culture in this country. In part, we have \ncorporations such as General Motors to thank having helped MADD in \ntheir cause. While deaths due to drunk driving have decreased in large \npart through the great work of MADD, the job is certainly not finished. \nAs long as people are put into danger because someone got behind the \nwheel after drinking alcohol, we have work to do. General Motors and \nMADD are not criminalizing social drinkers, they are working together \nto simply save lives.\n  Today, I am introducing six transportation safety bills. I introduced \nthem last year and am doing so again because I want to see them get \npassed and signed into law and see lives saved. They are commonsense \nbills that will, in fact, save lives. I think all of us care about \nkeeping our roads safe. That is also why I again commend MADD and \nGeneral Motors. I also commend the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration for its efforts to keep drunk drivers off the road and \nits prosafety agenda. They are all doing what is right and what needs \nto be done to protect our children and our families when they get into \na car and get on the road.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague goes, I want to once \nagain say to my good friend from Ohio how much I appreciate his \nleadership. I am a principal cosponsor with my colleague on this very \nimportant bill dealing with underage drinking. We have wonderful \nsponsors in the House as well, in a bipartisan way, to try to make a \ndifference.\n  The Senator has laid out very categorically what the facts are, which \nis that this is a massive problem in this country, and a growing one, \nunfortunately, with the age of people who are becoming regular users of \nalcohol dropping all the time. While certainly parents have to do more \nat the local level, more efforts need to be made. We also think it is \nincumbent upon us at a national level to be supportive of those \nefforts, to help provide resources and guidance to try to reverse this \ntrend.\n  I didn't want my friend to leave the floor without expressing to him \nmy deep sense of gratitude--not only on this issue but on countless \nother issues affecting families and children. Mike DeWine of Ohio has \nbeen as good a champion as this body has seen in a long time on these \nissues. There are very few issues that have given me as much pleasure \nto work on as issues with children. On behalf of all of us in this \ncountry--he represents Ohio well, but in this regard he is making a \ndifference all across the country. On their behalf, I thank him.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the very kind \nremarks. Senator Dodd has been a real partner on so many issues \naffecting children. He and I have worked together. Whenever we want to \nfind someone to advocate for children, Chris Dodd is there. My \ncolleague is always a great champion for children.\n  On the issue of drinking and driving, underage drinking and highway \nsafety, Senator Dodd has been a true champion. I thank my colleague for \ncoming to the floor. Again, I look forward to continuing to work with \nhim in the years ahead.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Ohio, Senator \nDeWine, and call attention to an unseemly lobbying effort to discredit \none of our Nation's most revered public safety organizations, the \nMothers Against Drunk Driving, MADD, and one of our Nation's largest \nautomakers, General Motors.\n  Each year, General Motors donates money to MADD to support its \ncampaign against drunk driving. In response to this, the alcohol \nspecial interest lobby is spending $10 million to finance a lobbying \ncampaign--or as some might call it, a smear campaign.\n  This campaign is aimed at scaring and intimidating corporate donors \nlike GM so they will stop giving money to safety organizations like \nMADD. Apparently the alcohol lobby thinks it is bad for its business to \ncrack down on drunk driving, which kills 17,000 Americans each year and \ninjures over 500,000.\n  Ten million dollars is not an insignificant amount of money. After \nall, the Federal Government only spends $30 million each year on public \nlaw enforcement campaigns to educate people on drunk driving awareness \nand prevention.\n  What a shame. Imagine if the alcohol lobby would spend $10 million to \neducate people and prevent drunk driving, instead of bullying GM. Many \nof the customers they lose each year to drunk driving crashes could \nprobably be saved, along with thousands of innocent Americans. That \nsounds like a much better investment than financing a smear campaign \nthat will cost lives.\n  I am one of the most ardent opponents of drunk driving in the Senate, \nand I see the results of the good work we do here to help save the \nlives of our constituents from the scourge of drunk driving. Over the \nyears, I have battled against the alcohol lobby to pass effective laws \nto reduce drunk driving.\n  In 1986 I authored legislation and worked with Senator Elizabeth \nDole, who was Secretary of the Department of Transportation at the \ntime, to raise the minimum drinking age from 18 to 21. President Reagan \nsigned my bill\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\ninto law, and MADD officials were there with us. In 2000 Senator DeWine \nand I teamed up to get a bill passed establishing .08 blood alcohol \nconcentration level as the nationwide threshold for drunk driving.\n  These are the kind of smart, common-sense initiatives that MADD \nsupports. And these are the kind of initiatives that save lives. \nCombined, these two measures are estimated to save some 1,500 lives a \nyear.\n  Federal public awareness campaigns against drunk driving are also \nhaving a tangible impact. We need to step up these program, which is \nwhy Senator DeWine and I will soon introduce a bill to increase funding \nfor this effort. What we don't need is a $10 million misinformation \nprogram from the alcohol industry.\n  Drunk driving is no joke. It kills and maims thousands of people in \nAmerican each year, and costs $9 billion in additional health care and \nother costs. MADD is trying to stanch the flow of blood on our \nhighways, and they are doing a good job of it. GM, to its credit, \nsupports MADD. They deserve our encouragement, and they deserve for us \nto stand up against this vicious smear campaign.\n  I intend to work with Senator DeWine to let Americans know the truth \nabout the alcohol lobby's smear campaign, to counter the alcohol \nlobby's lies with the truth, and to fight for legislation that reduces \ndrunk driving and saves lives across our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2234-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2234-S2238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AMENDMENTS TO VARIOUS REGULATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON RULES AND \n                            ADMINISTRATION:\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 174c, furnishings for offices in \n     the Senate Office Buildings are supplied and maintained by \n     the Architect of the Capitol through his representative, the \n     Superintendent of the Senate Office Buildings. Matters of \n     general policy are subject to the approval of the Senate \n     Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       2. Effective on the date of adoption of this policy by the \n     Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, the \n     Superintendent of the Senate Office Buildings shall undertake \n     to survey the physical quality of all furnishings presently \n     assigned to offices. Thereafter, a survey will be conducted \n     on an annual basis. Office heads, as defined in the Senate \n     Equipment Regulations, should work with the Superintendent's \n     Office to identify furnishings that do not meet an acceptable \n     level of quality.\n       3. When the survey is completed, all items on the Standard \n     Furniture and Accessories list that are in disrepair will be \n     declared ``surplus'' and/or repaired. This does not preclude \n     repairs as needed irrespective of survey timing. No \n     furnishings will be delivered to an office unless they are \n     functional and in quality condition.\n       4. The Superintendent's Office will maintain a full \n     inventory of all furnishings assigned to designated suites, \n     including documentation of furnishings provided from the \n     Standard Furniture and Accessories list, and items purchased \n     from the Senators' special furniture and accessory allowance.\n       5. Senators with suites in the Russell or Dirksen Buildings \n     shall have the option of using traditional or modular \n     furniture to create an effective office environment. \n     [However, once modular is chosen for a suite, it shall remain \n     a part of that suite regardless of which Senator occupies the \n     space.] A Senator electing to use modular furniture in \n     Russell or Dirksen shall use the modular system in the suite \n     except for the Senator's personal office, reception room, and \n     conference room.\n       [A.] Modular furniture will be offered to Senators in \n     Russell and Dirksen based upon the availability and the order \n     in which the request is received. [of funding for this \n     program.]\n       [B. Modular furniture will be offered to Senators with \n     suites in the Russell and Dirksen Buildings on a seniority \n     basis until all Senators have had the opportunity to elect to \n     use modular furniture.\n       [C. Senators not electing initially to use modular \n     furniture in Russell or Dirksen must wait until all other \n     Senators on the current list have been offered modular \n     furniture and have elected to accept or have declined. The \n     updated seniority list shall apply after Senate moves.]\n       6. Senators in the Hart Building shall utilize modular \n     furniture as the basic system of furnishing. The actual \n     system of furniture in place in a suite in the Hart Building \n     shall remain in the same suite regardless of which Senator \n     occupies the space.\n       In the Hart Building, traditional furniture may be chosen \n     for the Senator's personal office, the Chief of Staff's \n     office, the reception area and the conference room.\n       [7. Modular panels shall not be provided in any private \n     offices.]\n       8. Only a Senator or the designated office head of each \n     Senate office will have the authority to request furniture \n     and furnishings in an office. Such requests may be made by \n     submitting a ``Request for Service'', letter or through the \n     Senate Furniture web system. Written confirmation of a \n     telephone request to the Superintendent of the Senate Office \n     Buildings also will be accepted. Office heads should be \n     designated in writing and a file of these names will be \n     maintained by the Superintendent's Office.\n       The transfer of furniture from one official office \n     inventory to another may be authorized based upon the \n     following:\n       A. All furniture items to be transferred from one Senate \n     office or Committee to another Senate office or Committee \n     must be authorized by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration prior the transfer. [to be transferred to the \n     intended office.]\n       B. The Senator, Committee Chairman or designated office \n     head must agree to the release of the furniture on a Request \n     for Furniture form providing for the removal of those items \n     from their office inventory. Additional furniture intended to \n     replace the furniture proposed for transfer shall be \n     requested simultaneously on a Request for Furniture form.\n       C. The Senator, Committee Chairman or designated office \n     head receiving the transferred furniture must agree to its \n     receipt on a Request for Furniture form so that the furniture \n     can be incorporated into their office inventory.\n       The Superintendent shall adjust the official office \n     inventories based upon completion of the issuance or return \n     of furniture items.\n       9. The Architect of the Capitol will maintain in stock an \n     inventory of the following items, referred to hereafter as \n     the Standard Furniture and Accessories list, available for \n     viewing through the Senate Furniture web system (http:///\nsenate.aoc.gov):\n\n\n          Standard Furniture and Accessories--Senators' Suites\n\n       Bookcase--See Shelves; Chair Mats; [Chairs--Ergonomic (with \n     or without arms); [Chairs--Folding Chairs]; Chairs--\n     Conference (with or without arms); Chairs--Desk [Reception] \n     (with or without arms); [Chairs--Reception--without arms]; \n     Chairs--Executive; [Chairs--Secretary]; Coats--Tree; [Coats--\n     Rack]; Credenza--(Conference room & Front office only); \n     Desk--Computer; Desk--Half size; Desk--Flat Top \n     Executive; Desk--[Secretary] L-Shape.\n       Fans & Heaters; File Cabinets--Lateral 2-Drawer; File \n     Cabinets--Lateral 5-Drawer; File Cabinets--2-Drawer; File \n     Cabinets--5-Drawer; Fireplace--Screens (Russell SOB only); \n     Fireplace--Tools (Russell SOB only); Footrests--Furniture or \n     Computer; Lighting--Ceiling (Chandelier) [Fixtures (Reception \n     and Conference Rooms in Russell SOB only, no more than 2 \n     total)] in Russell SOB only (Reception Rooms, Conference \n     Rooms and Senator's Personal Office, limited to 3 total); \n     Lighting--Floor Lamps (2 per office); [Lighting--Reading \n     Lamps]; Lighting--Desk/Table Lamps; [Magazine Rack]; \n     [Microfilm Cabinets]; Mirrors--(One per suite standard); \n     [Modular Furniture--(Limited to Hart SOB for now).\n       [Partitions--Textured (i.e. wood)]; Partitions--Acoustical; \n     Racks--Pamphlets; Refrigerator--Medium (Not to exceed 3 \n     total); Shelves--Open Shelves (Book); Shelves--Desk \n     Organizers; Shelves--Cabinets (with doors); Sofa--Love seat; \n     Sofa--Couch; [Stand--Smoke (Ashtray)]; Stand--Telephone; \n     Stand--Plant; Tables--Conference; Tables--Round; Tables--\n     Computer; Tables--Coffee; Tables--End; [Tables--Folding]; \n     Tables--Other (assorted sizes); TV Stand; [Window--Venetian \n     Blinds (2-inch, Russell and Dirksen SOBs only); [Window--Mini \n     Blinds (Hart SOB only)].\n\n\n                       Senators' Personal Offices\n\n       [(Bathroom)--(Vanity-under sink*); [(Bathroom)--(Cabinet-\n     over/next to sink)*]; Cabinet--Telephone; Chairs--High Back \n     (Desk); Chairs--Side [Reception]-(with arms or without arms); \n     [Chairs--Reception-without arms]; Chairs--Wingback; Chairs--\n     Overstuffed (Historic); Credenza; Desk; Lighting--Table Lamp; \n     Lighting--Floor Lamp; [Lighting--Reading Light]; Lighting--\n     Ceiling (Chandelier) [Fixture (Russell SOB only)] in Russell \n     SOB only, (Reception Rooms, Conference Rooms and Senator's \n     Personal Office, limited to 3 total); Lighting--Mantle \n     Fixtures (Russell SOB only); Lighting--Wall (Sconce) Fixtures \n     (Russell SOB only); Lighting--Rheostat.\n       Mirror; Refrigerator--Compact; Shelves--Bookcases; \n     Shelves--Cabinet; Sofa--Love seat; Sofa--Couch; Table--\n     Coffee; Table--End; TV/VCR Cabinet; [VCR Cabinet; [Upholstery \n     Fabric; [Wardrober; [Window--Curtains or Draperies; [Window--\n     Venetian Blinds (wood or metal); [Window--Mini Blinds.\n       [*Standard part of building structure]\n\n       For Loan (for Meetings and Related Functions)\n\n       Blackboards, Easels, Folding Tables, Piano (small charge \n     for tuning), Podiums, Stacking Chairs.\n       10. A Special Furniture and Accessory Allowance will be \n     authorized to the Architect of the Capitol for the purpose of \n     furnishing a Senator's personal office, reception room and \n     conference room when a Senator is elected/reelected for a \n     term of office. This will be in addition to the furnishings \n     requested from the Standard Furniture and Accessories list \n     and only will be authorized during the first year of each \n     Senator's new term of office. Such amount will be determined \n     by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration as a \n     recommendation for appropriation to the Architect of the \n     Capitol to become available for the Senator's term of office. \n     Provisions will be made for Senators to purchase through this \n     special allowance furniture and accessory items which are \n     unique to their offices and/or home state. All acquisitions \n     from this allowance will be made by the Architect of the \n     Capitol in consultation with the office head.\n       11. A ``Request for Service'' or other written request for \n     furnishings will be acknowledged within five working days \n     reflecting appropriate disposition of the request. If \n     requests are made for items critical to the function of the \n     office which are not on the Standard Furniture and Accessory \n     list or are out of stock, and delivery/restock is not \n     anticipated for three months or greater, an office head may \n     submit a request in writing to the Chairman of the Senate \n     Committee on Rules and Administration. If requests are made \n     for special items, as part of the Special Furniture and \n     Accessory Allowance, appropriate information should be \n     attached from a\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\n     commercial supplier or a catalogue from which the items are \n     available. If favorably acted upon by the Rules Committee, an \n     approval to purchase will be forwarded to the Architect's \n     Office.\n       12. Certain furniture and accessory items may be built to \n     published plans, including typewriter racks and table \n     platforms for computer work stations, open shelves and \n     sorting racks for desks and tables, and bookshelves, in \n     accordance with a standard catalogue provided by the \n     Superintendent. An office head may submit a written \n     request for an item by identifying it from the \n     Superintendent's catalogue of sketches.\n       13. Office heads may submit to the Senate Committee on \n     Rules and Administration at any time a request to add items \n     to the Standard Furniture and Accessory list. The Committee, \n     in consultation with the Architect of the Capitol, will \n     review the list annually to ensure that items continue to \n     meet the needs of Senate offices acknowledging changing \n     technology and staff environments.\n       14. Furnishings secured through the Architect of the \n     Capitol from the Senators' Special Furniture and Accessory \n     Allowance may be returned at the request of the office head \n     to the Architect's inventory. They then may be purchased at a \n     depreciated price with a Senator's personal funds or as a \n     charge to the Special Furniture and Accessory Allowance. All \n     returns will be made without credit to the original \n     purchaser's Special Furniture and Accessory Allowance.\n       15. The Committee on Rules and Administration, in \n     consultation with the Architect of the Capitol, will monitor \n     requests for non-standard items to preserve the architectural \n     conformity of the Senate Office Buildings.\n       16. Furniture is not authorized by statute to be purchased \n     through a Senator's Official Personnel and Office Expense \n     Account. However, T.V. stands and V.C.R. stands are \n     considered accessories to equipment and may be purchased in a \n     manner consistent with the statutes and regulations governing \n     the purchase of standard and non-standard equipment.\n       17. All furniture and accessories, whether chosen from the \n     Standard list or purchased from the Senators' Special \n     Furniture and Accessory Allowance, remain the property of the \n     Architect of the Capitol. Senators will be responsible for \n     any furniture stolen, lost, or otherwise unaccounted for, and \n     reimbursement for all losses will be made in an amount equal \n     to the fair market value of such furniture after applying an \n     appropriate depreciation.\n       18. The implementation of this policy is subject to the \n     availability of appropriated funds to the Architect of the \n     Capitol.\n       Approved: Committee on Rules and Administration.\n     Christopher J.

Transportation Expenses\n\n\n          (a) common carrier transportation and accommodations\n\n       Transportation includes all necessary official travel on \n     railroads, airlines, helicopters, steamboats, buses, \n     streetcars, taxicabs, and other usual means of conveyance. \n     Transportation may include fares and such expenses incidental \n     to transportation such as baggage transfer; official \n     telegraph, telephone, radio, and cable messages in connection \n     with items classed as transportation; steamer chairs, steamer \n     cushions, and steamer rugs at customary rates actually \n     charged; staterooms on steamers.\n\n\n                        1. train accommodations\n\n       (a) Sleeping-car accommodations: The lowest first class \n     sleeping accommodations available shall be allowed when night \n     travel is involved. When practicable, through sleeping \n     accommodations should be obtained in all cases where more \n     economical to the Senate.\n       (b) Parlor-car and coach accommodations: One seat in a \n     sleeping or parlor car will be allowed. Where adequate coach \n     accommodations are available, coach accommodations should be \n     used to the maximum extent possible, on the basis of \n     advantage to the Senate, suitability and convenience to the \n     traveler, and nature of the business involved.\n\n\n                       2. steamer accommodations\n\n       Staterooms: First-class accommodation will be allowed when \n     stateroom is included in cost of passage or is a separate \n     charge.\n\n\n                       3. airplane accommodations\n\n       (a) First-class and air-coach accommodations: It is the \n     policy of the Senate that persons who use commercial air \n     carriers for transportation on official business shall use \n     less than first-class accommodations instead of those \n     designated first-class with due regard to efficient conduct \n     of Senate business and the travelers' convenience, safety, \n     and comfort.\n       (b) Use of United States-flag air carriers: All official \n     air travel shall be performed on United States-flag air \n     carriers except where travel on other aircraft (1) is \n     essential to the official business concerned, or (2) is \n     necessary to avoid unreasonable delay, expense, or \n     inconvenience.\n       When a traveler finds he/she will not use accommodations \n     which have been reserved for him/her, he/she must release \n     them within the time limits specified by the carriers. \n     Likewise, where transportation service furnished is inferior \n     to that called for by a ticket or where a journey \n     is terminated short of the destination specified, the \n     traveler must report such facts to the proper official. \n     Failure of travelers to take such action may subject them \n     to liability for any resulting losses. ``No show'' \n     charges, if incurred by Members or staff personnel in \n     connection with official Senate travel, shall not be \n     considered payable or reimbursable from the contingent \n     fund of the Senate. Senate travelers exercising proper \n     prudence can make timely cancellations when necessary in \n     order to avoid ``no show'' assessments. Service fees for \n     preparation or mailing of passenger coupons shall not be \n     reimbursable.\n       In the event that a Senate traveler is denied passage on a \n     flight for which he/she held a reservation and this results \n     in a payment of any rebate, this payment shall not be \n     considered as a personal receipt by the traveler, but rather \n     as a payment to the Senate, the agency for which and at whose \n     expense the travel is being performed. Such payments shall be \n     submitted to the appropriate individual for the proper \n     disposition when the traveler submits his/her expense \n     account. Through fares, special fares, commutation fares, \n     excursion, and reduced-rate round trip fares should be used \n     for official travel when it can be determined prior to the \n     start of a trip that any such type of service is practical \n     and economical to the Senate. Round-trip tickets should be \n     secured only when, on the basis of the journey as planned, it \n     is known or can be reasonably anticipated that such tickets \n     will be utilized.\n       Each Chairman, Senator, or Officer of the Senate may, at \n     his/her discretion, authorize in extenuating circumstances \n     the reimbursement of penalty fees associated with the \n     cancellation of through fares, special fares, commutation \n     fares, excursion, and reduced-rate round trip fares.\n       [Discount coupons, frequent flyer mileage, or other \n     evidence of reduced fares, obtained on official travel, shall \n     be turned in to the office for which the travel was performed \n     so that they may be utilized for future official travel. \n     ``Any travel award that accrues by reason of official travel \n     of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate shall be \n     considered the property of the office for which the travel \n     was performed and may not be converted to personal use (2 \n     U.S.C. 1436(a), as amended).'' However, this shall not apply \n     to any travel awards relating to air transportation for a \n     Member of the Senate, or their spouse, son, or daughter, \n     between the Washington metropolitan area and the Home State \n     of that Member. It should be noted that any fees assessed in \n     connection with the use of travel awards for a spouse, son, \n     or daughter of a Member, shall be considered a personal \n     expense of the traveler and shall not be reimbursed from \n     official funds.\n       [It is the traveler's responsibility to turn in to the \n     appropriate individual all promotional materials which would \n     provide free or reduced costs for future travel. These should \n     be integrated into the office's plans for future official \n     travel. Even in those instances when the coupons are non-\n     transferable or carry an impending expiration date, and it \n     appears that the office will not be able to use them, they \n     are still Senate property and should not be converted to \n     personal use, except in the case of separating Members, \n     Officers and employees as provided in Appendix A. The \n     administrator of each office shall account for all bonuses \n     acquired for travel from official appropriated funds.]\n       Travel promotional awards (e.g. free travel, travel \n     discounts, upgrade certificates, coupons, frequent flyer \n     miles, access to carrier club facilities, and other similar \n     travel promotional items (``Travel Awards'')) obtained by a \n     Member, officer or employee of the Senate while on official \n     travel may be utilized for personal use at the discretion of \n     the Member or officer pursuant to this section. Travel Awards \n     may be retained and used at the sole discretion of the Member \n     or officer only if the Travel Awards are obtained under the \n     same terms and conditions as those offered to the general \n     public and no favorable treatment is extended on the basis of \n     the Member, officer or employee's position with the Federal \n     Government. Members, officers and employees may only retain \n     Travel Awards for personal use when such Travel Awards have \n     been obtained at no additional cost to the Federal \n     Government. It should be noted that any fees assessed in \n     connection with the use of Travel Awards shall be considered \n     a personal expense of the Member, officer or employee and \n     under no circumstances shall be paid for or reimbursed from \n     official funds. Although this paragraph permits Members, \n     officers and employees of the Senate to use Travel Awards at \n     the discretion of the Member or officer, the Committee \n     encourages the use of such Travel Awards (whenever \n     practicable) to offset the cost of future official travel.\n       In case a person, for his/her own convenience, travels by \n     an indirect route or interrupts travel by direct route, the \n     extra expense will be borne by the traveler. Reimbursement \n     for expenses shall be allowed only on such charges as would \n     have been incurred by the official direct route.\n       Transportation by bus, streetcar, subway, or taxicab, when \n     used in connection with official travel, will be allowed as \n     an official transportation expense.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              [APPENDIX A\n\n[Purchase of Bonus Airline Mileage by Separating Members, Officers and \n                        Employees of the Senate\n\n       [In Opinion B-24607, the General Counsel of the General \n     Accounting Office made the following determination:\n       [``Frequent flyer points are usually nontransferable and of \n     no value to the government after the departure of the Member \n     or\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\n     staff person. Therefore, if the Senate determines as a matter \n     of sound administration that its travel regulations should \n     provide for disposing of frequent flyer mileage in exchange \n     for payment of a reasonable sum of money from a departing \n     Member or staff person, we see no objection to such a \n     regulation.''\n       [Although Senate Travel Regulations prohibit the personal \n     use of bonus mileage accrued at government expense, the \n     Senate also recognizes that when Members, Officers, and \n     employees separate from Senate service, any frequent flyer \n     mileage remaining in their name is no longer of any value to \n     the Senate. However, the Government would recoup at least \n     some of the value of the lost bonus mileage if separating \n     Members, Officers, and employees are permitted to purchase \n     such mileage upon their separation from Senate service. \n     Permitting such an exception to the general prohibition on \n     use of frequent flyer mileage would make good administrative \n     sense.\n       [Therefore, Members, Officers, and employees, upon their \n     separation from Senate service, may obtain permission from \n     the Committee on Rules and Administration to convert to \n     personal use any remaining airline bonus mileage accrued in \n     their name at Senate expense, provided that the separating \n     Member, Officer, or employee reimburses the Senate a \n     reasonable sum of money for all mileage they wish to use. For \n     purposes of this provision, a ``reasonable sum of money'' \n     shall be determined by the Committee based upon: (1) the \n     number of tickets which may be obtained from the unused \n     mileage; and (2) valuation of such tickets at the applicable \n     government rate. The determination of the Committee regarding \n     reasonable reimbursement shall be final.

SENATE HEALTH AND FITNESS FACILITY.\n\n       1. There is hereby established the Senate Health and \n     Fitness Facility which shall be operated under the \n     supervision and management of the Architect of the Capitol, \n     subject to rules, regulations, and policies approved by the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rev. William Webb, \na strong and compassionate leader in the Reno-Sparks community.\n  Throughout his life, Reverend Webb has demonstrated tremendous \nperseverance, dedication, and generosity. Born and raised in a small, \npoor town in southern Arkansas, he was the only student in his eighth \ngrade class to continue on to high school. Despite facing racism and \nsegregation, Reverend Webb remained strongly committed to his \neducation, attending Philander Smith College and receiving his master's \ndegree at Virginia Union University.\n  Reverend Webb first came to Reno-Sparks area 40 years ago to serve as \na minister at Second Baptist Church. His strong and energetic \nleadership has helped grow Second Baptist Church from a congregation of \nfifty church members to more than three hundred. Reverend Webb has also \nchallenged his ministry and his community to serve those in need, \norganizing food drives and other charitable activities throughout his \ntime in Northern Nevada. He has also served as president of the Nevada-\nCalifornia Interstate Missionary Baptist Convention for 22 years.\n  I am pleased to say that the City of Reno recently honored Reverend \nWebb's contributions to the community by renaming the roundabout at \nClear Acre and Wedekin Road, William C. Webb Circle. Reverend Webb has \nled a distinguished life and career, and please join me in thanking him \nfor his tremendous service to the Reno-Sparks community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2238-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2238-S2239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SPARKS, NV\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to celebrate the \nfounding of Sparks, NV 100 years ago this week.\n  In 1904, the Southern Pacific Railroad wanted to straighten its route \nthrough northern Nevada. This required them to move from their \nswitching yard at Wadsworth to another location, a hamlet originally \nknown as Harriman. Many residents moved with the railroad, and they \nbrought most of Wadsworth's buildings with them.\n  Shortly thereafter, the city changed its name to Sparks, in honor of \nJohn Sparks, who served as Nevada governor from 1903 to 1908 and who \nowned a ranch near the city.\n  Unlike many cities of the day, Sparks was a planned community with \nwide streets, ample parks, and impressive buildings. As the railroad's \npower waned in the 1950s, these traits allowed Sparks to become a \npicturesque, residential community.\n  Ground was broken for the first hotel in Sparks in 1903. The building \nwas named after its first owner, Charles Walstab, and was the only \nhotel in Sparks until 1911. In 1920, the hotel was purchased by Frank \nGardella and Frank Pasutti who changed the hotel's name to the Lincoln. \nPeople came from far and wide for the Lincoln's home-style meals, \nincluding chicken and ravioli. Many old-time patrons remember when it \nserved free lunches and\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\nbeer cost only a nickel. The building still stands on Victorian Avenue, \nand today is home to several small businesses.\n  The Soroptimist Club International was founded in Sparks in 1958. The \nSparks' Soroptimist club was formed to make a difference for women, \nfocusing their extensive efforts on volunteer service in the community. \nThey sponsored the Miss Nevada Pageant and Nevada Girl's State. \nAdditionally, the Soroptimists awarded scholarships to young women \ngraduating from Sparks High School, raised money for books at the \nSparks Library, and donated to the Gray Ladies Indigent Fund for the \nState Hospital.\n  However, no history of Sparks would be complete without mentioning \nJohn Ascuaga, a developer and entrepreneur who built Sparks' first \ncasino: the Nugget. In May of 1958, the Nugget's ambassador became a \npart of the town's fabric. The ``Tall Cowboy'' appropriately arrived on \nthe railroad, in pieces. When assembled, Last Chance Joe, stood thirty-\ntwo feet tall at the entrance to the Nugget.\n  I would also like to recognize Tony Armstrong, the former mayor of \nSparks who died in January of this year. Tony's personality, his vision \nfor the city, his management skills, and his deep humanity made him a \nterrific mayor and an outstanding man. It was Tony who first contacted \nme about the Sparks' centennial. I miss Tony and it is fitting to \nrecognize him on this day, which he would have enjoyed so much. I wish \nhis successor, Gino Martini, all the best and look forward to working \nwith him on projects important to Sparks.\n  Finally, it is remarkable that Sparks has retained its Victorian \narchitecture and charm. The city beckons to us as a relic of a gentler \nand more beautiful time. It is truly one of the jewels of northern \nNevada.\n  A century has passed since the City of Sparks was founded. I hope you \nwill join me in celebrating this lovely Nevada community's centennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2239-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  According to the San Francisco Chronicle, a participant in a Davis, \nCA, gay-pride parade was assaulted last summer. The apparent motivation \nfor the attack was the sexual orientation of the victim.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2239-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 NOPEC\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I, again, join in the introduction of our \nNOPEC bill. I am sincerely sorry that this bill has not yet become law, \nand I hope that the situation we face as a nation will lead the Senate \nto recognize the toll that the OPEC producers are exacting from the \nAmerican people. As gasoline prices continue to skyrocket, exceeding $2 \na gallon in many communities, we must have a real correction. As \nheating oil prices have soared, the President needs to take notice. \nWithout correction and containment, consumers across the nation will \ncontinue to suffer.\n  The relentless increases in gasoline prices are not the result of \nnatural supply issues. Rather, they are largely due to market \nmanipulation by OPEC, a cartel of those controlling production and \nsupply of oil from the Middle East. When the Antitrust Subcommittee of \nthe Committee on the Judiciary held its hearing on gas prices last \nyear, experts from several fields, both in and out of government, \nconfirmed for us what we already suspected: The higher prices are due \nto the OPEC cartel that sets production quotas for it members and \nprevents the free market from setting crude oil prices. The testimony \nat that hearing revealed that most of the gasoline price increase can \nbe explained by OPEC's unfair production quotas.\n  The artificial pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us, not \nthe least of whom are hardworking Vermont farmers. As USDA's \nCooperative Extension Office in New Hampshire recently found, the \nincreasing energy costs may add $5,000 or more to the total costs of \noperating a 100-head dairy operation in the Northeast. In addition, \nsoaring prices have affected a variety of industries across the United \nStates, and will likely force many Americans to make tough choices \nabout family travel.\n  Over the last year, I have expressed concern that gasoline prices \nwould simply continue to rise. I have hardly been alone in that belief, \nand I am sorry to say that my prediction has borne fruit. Sadly, that \nfruit is bitter for those forced to pay ever higher prices to go about \ntheir daily lives. This week, the average price for regular gasoline \nreached $2.00 per gallon. Our economy, our farmers, and our families \nneed relief now. They also need good policy. In the absence of White \nHouse leadership, Congress should provide law enforcement the tools \nneeded to fight anticompetitive practices.\n  If OPEC were simply a foreign business engaged in this type of \nbehavior, it would already be subject to American antitrust law. It is \nwrong to let OPEC producers off the hook just because their \nanticompetitive practices come with the seal of approval of the member \nnations. I urge the Senate to support this bill and to say ``No'' to \nOPEC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2239-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SAVING THE IRRAWADDY DOLPHIN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue which, \nwhile not one that you would likely read about on the front page of the \nnewspapers, is important nonetheless. It concerns the alarming rate of \ndeterioration of the habitat of the Irrawaddy Dolphin in Southeast \nAsia. Recent statistics indicate that there are fewer than 100 \nIrrawaddy left in the world.\n  The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has placed the \nIrrawaddy Dolphin on its list of critically endangered species. The \nprimary reasons for this sharp decline include destructive fishing \npractices, such as the use of dynamite or electric current, and mercury \nrunoff from gold mines. These practices are leading to the extinction \nof an entire species.\n  Why should we care? Perhaps a quote from President John Kennedy \nprovides the best answers to this question. In a 1963 address at \nAmerican University, President Kennedy said ``. . . in the final \nanalysis, our most basic common link, is that we all inhabit this small \nplanet, we all breathe the same air, we all cherish our children's \nfutures, and we are all mortal.''\n  I know every Member of the Senate wants to make the world a better \nplace for our children and grandchildren. I am almost as certain that \nensuring the survival of the Irrawaddy dolphin, an extraordinary \nspecies, would be something that we could do to help achieve this goal.\n  Congress has spoken on this issue. In the Senate report that \naccompanied last year's Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, Congress \ndirected the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, to \ndevise a strategy to help reverse the habitat decline of the Irrawaddy \ndolphin.\n  Some important nongovernmental organizations are already working on \nthis issue, including the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Bronx \nZoo in their Species Survival Program partnership. I hope USAID's \nstrategy, which is due shortly, will be a first step in forming a \npublic-private partnership that will prevent the Irrawaddy dolphin from \ngoing the way of the dodo and the passenger pigeon.\n  Once a species is gone, it is gone forever. We need to be sure this \ndoes not happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2239-4", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2239-S2240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MANHATTAN PROJECT NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK STUDY ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I briefly would like to say how pleased \nI am that the Manhattan Project National Historical Park Study Act was \nenacted in the last Congress. That Act,\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\nPublic Law 108-340, directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nspecial resource study to assess the national significance, \nsuitability, and feasibility of designating one or more of the \nhistorically significant sites associated with the Manhattan Project as \na unit of the National Park System. The significance of the Manhattan \nProject to this Nation--and indeed the world--would be difficult to \noverstate, and I believe that passing this bill was an important step \nin fulfilling our responsibility to ensure that society neither forgets \nnor misunderstands it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Bingaman, for sponsoring that measure, and I appreciated the \nsupport of Senator Domenici and our colleagues from Tennessee and \nWashington.\n  The Manhattan Project stands as one of the great technological \nachievements of the 20th century. Therefore, it is appropriate to \nrecognize the historical importance of the sites most closely \nassociated with the development of the atomic bomb. This legislation \nhas begun a process for the Secretary of the Interior to provide that \nrecognition.\n  I want to call attention to the critical contributions made in \nDayton, OH, toward the Manhattan Project, under what became known as \nthe ``Dayton Project.'' Because the Dayton Project was shrouded in \nsecrecy, its contribution has long been overlooked. Yet, the \ntechnological achievements of the Dayton Project were among the most \nimportant to the completion of the Manhattan Project. It was in Dayton \nthat scientists discovered how to trigger the chain reaction that \nunleashed the power of the atom. To continue that effort, the Atomic \nEnergy Commission established the Mound Laboratory in Miamisburg, just \nsoutheast of Dayton.\n  As my colleague explained, the act directs the Secretary of the \nInterior to study three specifically named sites associated with the \nhistory of the Manhattan Project. I would like to ask the distinguished \nSenator if there is the opportunity for sites associated with the \nDayton Project to be recognized?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The legislation directs the Secretary to include within \nthe study the ``historically significant sites associated with the \nManhattan Project.'' While the bill lists three of those sites, it does \nnot limit the study to only those sites. Additional sites may be \nincluded, and it leaves that decision to the discretion of the \nSecretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and other \ninterested Federal, State, tribal, and local officials, representatives \nof organizations, and members of the public. So, by those terms, there \ncertainly is the opportunity for sites such as the Dayton Project to be \nincluded in the study.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2240-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate \nInternational Women's Day, celebrated on March 8. International Women's \nDay gives us all an opportunity to reflect on women's accomplishments \naround the world and to reaffirm our commitment to continuing the \nvitally important work of securing and advancing women's rights, \nparticularly their health, education, and security.\n  Today, we can all marvel at the outstanding contributions that women \nmake every day to their communities, their countries, and the entire \nworld. We can reflect on the work of Wangari Maathai, the Kenyan Nobel \nPeace Prize winner, whose brave and insistent voice on behalf of human \nrights and environmental protection found an audience not just on the \nglobal stage, and not just among elites in government, but among the \nwomen of her country, who have made the Green Belt Movement a success. \nWe can celebrate the bravery of Afghan women, who have participated in \nelections even as the memory of the Taliban's brutal repression of \ntheir rights remains so fresh. Women accounted for 41 percent of the \nOctober 2004 vote in Afghanistan, and women hold 102 seats of \nAfghanistan's Constitutional Loya Jirga. We can reflect on the \nwonderful welcome that Dora Bakoyiannis, the mayor of Athens, extended \nto the world during this year's Olympic ceremonies.\n  But in too many parts of the world, the basic human rights of women \nare violated with impunity. Human rights groups continue to report \nrampant violence, abuse, and rape of tens of thousands of women and \nchildren by militants in Eastern Congo who are rarely, if ever, brought \nto justice. The murders of more than 370 women in the Chihuahua state \nof Mexico since 1993 remain unsolved. Thirty more women have been \nkilled there since 2004 and the lack of progress in these cases of \nbrutal violence and sexual assault against women from the cities of \nJuarez and Chihuahua is deeply disturbing. The internally displaced \nwomen of Darfur, Sudan, too often are confronted with a horrible \nchoice--collect firewood and risk being raped by jinjaweit militia, or \nwatch their children go hungry. I have authored or cosponsored \nlegislative initiatives to address each of these crises, but I know \nthat solutions will require hard work over the long term. I also \nsupport the U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of \nAll Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW. Ratification of the \ntreaty would send an important message to the international community \nabout our commitment to the rights of women and girls.\n  The global, rapid progression of HIV/AIDS infection, especially in \nwomen, is undeniable. More than 40 million adults and children are \ninfected with HIV/AIDS and over 20 million are women. UNAIDS reports \nthat women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa make up 57 percent of HIV-\npositive persons in this region. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region \nin which women are infected with the virus at a higher rate than men. \nIn sub-Saharan Africa, between the ages of 15 to 24, there are on \naverage 36 women testing positive for HIV for every 10 males. As the \nranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee \non African Affairs, I have had the opportunity to travel to numerous \ncountries in Africa and see firsthand the devastating toll that HIV/\nAIDS and other infectious diseases are taking on the people of this \ncontinent. We must find concrete ways to address the special \nvulnerabilities of women and girls in our HIV/AID prevention and \ntreatment programs.\n  Nearly 100 million children worldwide are not receiving an education, \nnearly two-thirds of them female. In countries such as Uganda and \nNigeria, some teachers are expected to instruct anywhere from 175 to \n215 students, singlehandedly. The education of girls regularly takes a \nback seat to that of their male siblings and to the needs of the family \nin many parts of the world. In order to combat global diseases, halt \nviolence against women, and enhance women's rights, ensuring girls are \neducated must be a global community priority.\n  In short, while there are shining examples of progress in women's \nrights, we have much more to do. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the efforts I have described and others to improve the lives \nof women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2240-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2240-S2241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING MAX FISHER\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

DANIELS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, With the death on January 6th, \n2005, at the age of 82 of Samuel Thornton Daniels, Sr., my city of \nBaltimore and the State of Maryland lost a distinguished citizen, a \ncourageous and far-sighted leader, a source of inspiration and, \nespecially, a beloved friend.\n  Sam Daniels, the Grand Master, was known to his fellow members of the \nPrince Hall Masons simply as ``The Grand,'' and grand he was. A \nBaltimorean through and through, he was born in the city and educated \nat Douglass High School and Coppin State College. He married his \nbeloved wife Gladys, a fellow student at Coppin, and together for more \nthan 60 years they went on to raise a new generation of Baltimoreans. \nSam made our community a better place for all its people.\n  Service to others came naturally to Sam Daniels. He interrupted his \ncollege studies to serve in the Army in World War II, returning to \nCoppin State to receive his degree in 1948. When the Korean War \nconflict broke out 2 years later, Sam returned to military service, and \nreached the rank of captain before receiving his honorable discharge. \nSoon thereafter he joined Gladys as a teacher in the Baltimore public \nschool system.\n  In the mid-1950s, Sam Daniels set out on the path that was to shape \nhis life's work. It was not just that he joined the civil rights \nmovement; rather, in innumerable ways he shaped it and he led it. His \nprofessional commitments tell part of the story: Maryland Commission on \nInterracial Problems and Relations; Baltimore Community Relations \nCommission; Baltimore Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; and \nthen, starting in 1967 and continuing for more than two decades, the \nBaltimore Council for Equal Business Opportunity, or CEBO. During the \n1960s, in addition to his other commitments, Sam also worked for the \nAFSCME local unions representing Baltimore's municipal workers. In 1968 \nhe was named to the city's school board by then-Mayor D'Alessandro, \nwhere his intelligence, his principles, his clear vision, and his wise \nand generous temperament all combined to make him, as the mayor was to \nobserve, ``a calming influence on the board during an unsettling \ntime.'' Sam balanced his professional commitments with his role in The \nPrince Hall Masons, whose Grand Master he was to become and who knew \nand loved him as ``The Grand.'' Under his leadership The Prince Hall \nMasons grew to have 5,000 members and to play a major role in the \nhistoric movement toward civil rights. When Dr. King came to Baltimore \nin October 1964, Sam Daniels stood among the leaders who welcomed him \nto the Prince Hall Masons Lodge. In everything he did he challenged us \nto make our Nation live up to its ideals.\n  Of all his many accomplishments, Sam Daniels considered CEBO the most \nimportant. It began modestly enough with a grant from the Ford \nFoundation, but over more than two decades under Sam Daniels' \nleadership CEBO became one of the first business development \norganizations in the country, helping to create opportunities for \nentrepreneurship and business where precious few existed for \nBaltimore's African-American community and along with those \nopportunities, new hopes, new plans, and new dreams. Sam Daniels has \nbeen described as a ``giant'' and an ``icon,'' and surely these words \nreflect the critical role he played in expanding the opportunities for \nAfrican American entrepreneurship and wealth-building, which has meant \nso much to the city that he served in so many different ways.\n  Sam Daniels was a giant and an icon in other ways as well in \ncharacter and temperament. Mayor D'Alessandro, who nearly 40 years ago \nappointed him to the school board, remembers him as ``an absolutely \ndecent human being,'' and his pastor, the Reverend Marion C. Bascom, \ncalls him ``the most giving human being this city has ever known.'' In \nthe words of George L. Russell, the former city solicitor and judge, \n``he was a temperate person who conveyed a great deal of wisdom.'' He \nwas a great man and a great citizen, and he has left us all a \nmagnificent legacy. We will miss him, and our thoughts are with his \nwife Gladys, his children, and his grandchildren.\n  The Baltimore Sun paid tribute to Sam Daniels in an obituary \npublished on January 8, 2005. I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, Jan. 8, 2005]\n\n      Samuel T. Daniels, 82, Leader in Local Civil Rights Struggle\n\n                           (By Jacques Kelly)\n\n       Samuel T. Daniels, a local leader in the civil rights \n     movement who championed African-American business enterprise \n     and led the Prince Hall Masons for nearly four decades, died \n     Thursday at Levindale Hebrew Geriatric Center of \n     complications from a fall and a brain illness. The Northwest \n     Baltimore resident was 82.\n       Mr. Daniels had retired in 1989 after more than 20 years as \n     executive director of the Baltimore Council for Equal \n     Business Opportunity, a private organization that encouraged \n     black participation in business. He was also a past grand \n     master of the 5,000-member Prince Hall Lodge, an African-\n     American Masonic organization.\n       ``He was an absolutely decent human being and an integral \n     part of the Baltimore civil rights movement in the 1960s,'' \n     said former Mayor Thomas J. D'Alesandro III, who named Mr. \n     Daniels to the city school board in December 1968. ``He was \n     tough, decent, orderly and competent. He was an articulate \n     spokesman for the black community.''\n       ``He was the most giving human being this city has ever \n     known,'' said the Rev. Marion C. Bascom, Mr. Daniels' pastor \n     and friend. ``Samuel outstretched his hand to just about \n     everyone I've ever known.''\n       Born in Baltimore and raised on Druid Hill Avenue, he was a \n     1940 graduate of Frederick Douglass High School and earned a \n     bachelor's degree in education from what is now Coppin State \n     University. He served in the Army in World War II and the \n     Korean War, attaining the rank of captain.\n       For eight years, he taught in city public schools, \n     including the old Henry H. Garnet School at Division and \n     Lanvale streets.\n       In 1958, he was named executive secretary of the Baltimore \n     Community Relations Commission and simultaneously worked for \n     Baltimore Municipal Employees Local 44 of the American \n     Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. In 1961, \n     he attended the Harvard Business School's trade union \n     program.\n       Mr. Daniels was a school board member from 1969 to 1971. \n     ``He was a calming influence on the board during an \n     unsettling time,'' said Mr. D'Alesandro.\n       Mr. Daniels became head of the Prince Hall Masons in the \n     early 1960s and was among the leaders who welcomed the Rev. \n     Martin Luther King Jr. to Baltimore on Oct. 31, 1964. Dr. \n     King's visit, including an appearance at the lodge's temple \n     on Eutaw Place, was on behalf of President Lyndon B. \n     Johnson's election campaign.\n       In a 1999 article in The Sun, Mr. Daniels recalled that day \n     and how Baltimore was becoming aggressive in its pursuit of \n     civil rights. The rally filled the temple.\n       ``They became friends after that visit,'' said Mr. Daniels' \n     wife of more than 60 years, the former Gladys Eva Wise.\n       Friends said that Mr. Daniels paid travel expenses so that \n     young civil rights advocates could attend the 1965 marches in \n     Selma, Ala.\n       ``He had been central to the advancement of black people in \n     Baltimore,'' said George L. Russell Jr., a lawyer and former \n     city solicitor and judge. ``He was a man who carried a great \n     deal of dignity. He was a temperate person who conveyed a \n     great deal of wisdom.''\n       In 1967, Mr. Daniels became director of CEBO, an \n     organization initially supported by the Ford Foundation. A \n     decade later, Mr. Daniels told The Sun that his most \n     important accomplishment had been helping African-American \n     business owners establish relationships with large commercial \n     banks.\n       He also pointed to many black-owned businesses, including \n     the Super Pride grocery chain, as proof that his council was \n     working.\n       In 1982, Mr. Daniels called for voter mobilization in black \n     communities.\n       ``Legislation, more than anything else, influences our \n     lives daily, monthly, weekly and eternally,'' he said at a \n     meeting reported in The Evening Sun. ``If we are not a voting \n     people, those in office are not going to care about us.''\n       Mr. Daniels was the recipient of many community honors and \n     testimonials. A room has been named after him at Coppin, and \n     Morgan State University awarded him an honorary degree in \n     2000.\n       Mr. Daniels was a longtime member of Douglas Memorial \n     Church.\n       Mr. Daniels will lie in state from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. \n     Wednesday at the Willard W. Allen Masonic Temple, 1301 Eutaw \n     Place.\n       Kappa fraternal services will be held at 6:30 p.m. \n     Wednesday and be followed by Masonic services at 7:30 p.m. \n     Mr. Daniels will rest in a sanctuary named in his honor.\n       A family hour wake will begin at 11 a.m. Thursday. The \n     funeral service begins at noon and will be followed by \n     interment at Arbutus Cemetery.\n       In addition to his wife, Mr. Daniels is survived by two \n     sons, Samuel T. Daniels Jr., chief inspector for the city \n     liquor board, and Van B. Daniels, a manager for the Maryland \n     Lottery; a brother, Edward Daniels; and three grandchildren. \n     All are of Baltimore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2241-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2241-S2242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING CLIFF MANLEY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Vermillion High School class \nof 1965, of\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\nwhich I am a member, will be celebrating its 40th reunion this summer \nin Vermillion, SD and will be paying tribute to former VHS Principal \nCliff Manley with the unveiling of a handsome plaque in his honor.\n  Ms. Michelle Rydell, the editor of the Vermillion High School \nnewspaper, ``The Vermillionaire,'' recently wrote an excellent column \nin that newspaper about the class of 1965 and the extraordinary career \nof Cliff Manley. I ask that this article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                       [From the Vermillionaire]\n\n                       Class of 1965 Pays Tribute\n\n                          (By Michelle Rydell)\n\n       ``When we were young and green, you tried to bend us in the \n     right direction. Now that we are old and bent, we look at the \n     path you lit and say, `Thank you, Mr. Manley, for helping us \n     set our course. You made a difference.' ''\n       It is with fond remembrance that the class of 1965 \n     dedicates these words to former Vermillion High School \n     principal, Clifford Manley. Manley was not simply an \n     authoritative figure--he was a friend to all students. VHS \n     alumni remember him as someone with a firm hand yet a soft \n     heart. According to former students, he had a sense of humor \n     that shone through even when he had to be firm with one of \n     his students. He was very personable with both his peers and \n     those under him. According to one class member, ``Mr. Manley \n     loved all of his students. Of course, there was still a \n     degree of fear when we had to go to the principal's office, \n     But he loved kids--he was a great man.''\n       They also remember him as someone who was always present \n     for extra-curricular activities and who loved watching \n     sports. A former coach himself, Manley made it an objective \n     to support not only the school but his students as well. It \n     if perhaps for his dedication that he is most well-known. As \n     principal, Manley did everything from teaching to coaching, \n     and most importantly, serving as a mentor and role model for \n     his students.\n       Manley's service and dedication is the reason the class of \n     1965 (which, incidentally, was the last class to graduate \n     from the old Vermillion High School) has dedicated a plaque \n     in remembrance of is gracious spirit. The plaque, featuring a \n     picture of Manley set against a picture of the old high \n     school and decorated with red birds to signify the class' \n     ever-present Tanager pride, will be hung in the high school \n     in the coming month.\n       The plaque had recently been hanging in the Sioux Valley \n     Dakota Gardens, where Manley's wife Helen now lives. The \n     plaque was displayed at the Dakota Gardens in order that \n     Helen's children and friends might get the opportunity to see \n     it during Christmas, but now that the holidays are over Helen \n     is giving the plaque to the high school to display. The \n     plaque will stay in the school as a lasting tribute to the \n     man who not only taught his students as a biology teacher and \n     principal, but a man who inspired them on a personal level as \n     well.\n       VHS students will be some of the first people to see the \n     plaque. The plaque is designated to be revealed at the class \n     of 1965's 40th reunion, which will be occurring this coming \n     summer. The reunion, therefore, will be not only be a time of \n     fellowship for former students to rediscover their \n     classmates, but it will also be a time for students to \n     remember the principal who had such an impact on so many \n     students' lives and take a moment to reflect on their \n     appreciation for his service.\n       It is hard to find those special people in life who make \n     such an impression that after forty years they are still \n     considered memorable and special. Yet many agree that Manley \n     was such a person. His dedication to Vermillion High School \n     has been remembered and appreciated throughout the decades, \n     and despite the fact that he has since passed away, he is not \n     forgotten. His works live on through the school and through \n     the lives of the many he has touched. It's not always easy to \n     be a disciplinarian and friend, yet Manley managed to do \n     both. As a result, he is remembered not only as a loving \n     husband, father and grandfather, but also as a beloved \n     principal, mentor and friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2242-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PROFESSOR RON SHAFFER\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \nnote the recent passing of Professor Ron Shaffer, a man who dedicated \nhis career to helping communities discuss and plan their economic \ndevelopment.\n  Ron joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in \n1972, the same year he received a doctorate in agricultural economics, \nand he soon became a pillar of that great institution. For three \ndecades, until his retirement from UW in 2001, Ron was one of the \nState's--if not the country's--leading experts on community economics \nand he wrote extensively on the subject. But, throughout his many years \nin academia, Ron always remained focused on the real world applications \nof his teaching. Economic development was not an abstract concept for \nhim--it was a way to help people live better, happier, more productive \nlives. Particularly in the decade he spent as director of the \nUniversity of Wisconsin Center for Community Economic Development, Ron \ndevoted himself to bolstering the many and varied rural communities \nthat are the backbone of Wisconsin.\n  Ron won many honors and accolades throughout his career. His work \nattracted international attention, and he was called upon by \ngovernments from Australia to Norway to advise on local economic \ndevelopment policies. In a particularly fitting move, the year he \nretired from UW, the National Rural Development Partnership established \nthe Ron Shaffer Award, to be given annually for outstanding \ncollaboration in rural America.\n  But I suspect that none of the honors he won mattered as much to Ron \nas the love and companionship of his family and friends. They loved his \ndecency, his compassion, and his willingness to lead a patient ear. \nThey admired him for the courage with which he handled his diagnosis of \nALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. It was typical of Ron that he used his \nillness as an opportunity to advocate for others afflicted with this \nterrible disease--after all, he spent his life helping others.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor employer retirement savings accounts, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Savings \nAccount Vehicle Enhancement, or ``SAVE,'' initiative, comprised of \nthree separate bills to create, respectively, Lifetime Savings \nAccounts, Retirement Savings Accounts, and Employer Retirement Savings \nAccounts.\n  Much attention has been focused lately on the retirement security of \nAmericans, but the focus thus far has centered primarily on Social \nSecurity. It is imperative that we remember that Social Security was \nnever intended as a primary income source for retirees, but rather as a \nsafety net and a supplement to private savings. The bills I introduce \ntoday focus on private savings, for both pre-retirement expenses and \nretirement security.\n  My reasons for introducing these bills are threefold. First of all, \nit is important that we address the appallingly-low personal savings \nrate in this country. Personal savings rates in the United States since \n1960 have reached a new low at less than 2 percent. These bills will \nencourage additional savings and reduce the temptation for individuals \nto tap into retirement savings for other, pre-retirement purposes.\n  Secondly, our tax code is entirely too complex and contributes to \nlack of participation in the tax-preferred vehicles that already exist. \nThese bills, by allowing individuals to accumulate tax-free interest \nand by streamlining current savings vehicles, represent an important \nstep toward fundamental tax reform.\n  Finally, as the Social Security system strains under increasing \npressure, it is even more important that we provide a better, more \nresponsive, simpler system for Americans to accumulate personal savings \nfor retirement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 545\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to \nfacilitating the development of microbicides for preventing \ntransmission of HIV and other diseases, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Microbicides Development Act of 2005. I am very pleased to be \nintroducing this bipartisan bill along with my colleagues, Senators \nSnowe, Obama, Bingaman, Cantwell, Clinton, Dodd, Durbin, Feinstein, \nKennedy, Lautenberg, Leahy, Mikulski, Murray, Schumer, and Smith. I \nthank my colleagues for their support of this important legislation, \nwhich we believe is vital to the pursuit of combating the global HIV/\nAIDS crisis.\n  Today we are celebrating International Women's Day. Not only should \nwe celebrate the achievements of women nationally and globally today, \nbut we should also promise to redouble our efforts to improve the lives \nof women around the globe. I can't think of an issue more deserving of \nour attention in the United States Senate than that of the toll that \nHIV/AIDS is having on women and their children around the world.\n  Today, nearly half of the 37 million adults now living with HIV \nworldwide are women. The U.N.'s new Epidemic Update released in late \n2004 shows that women and girls are increasingly affected by the \ndisease in each region of the world and the epidemic continues to \nworsen. Women are the new face of AIDS. Approximately 7,000 women are \ninfected with HIV everyday. The biggest rise in HIV/AIDS among women is \noccurring in East Asia, which has seen a 56 percent infection rate \nincrease, followed by the region of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.\n  Notably, these are areas of the world that are not currently included \nin the President's AIDS initiative (PEPFAR). I would like to note that \nlater this week I will be introducing legislation to make India \neligible for PEPFAR assistance. It is estimated that by 2010, India \ncould have 20 million HIV infected individuals up from five million \ncurrently and women are at the center of the rapid growth of the \ndisease.\n  I would like to quote from a recent news article in USA Today, which \ndiscusses the HIV/AIDS vulnerabilities that women confront.\n\n       ``In this male-dominated society, ironclad traditions \n     surrounding marriage leave women little say over their sexual \n     or reproductive lives. So many married men bring HIV home to \n     their wives that married women are one of India's highest-\n     risk groups. Nearly half of all new HIV infections occur in \n     women, and studies indicate that 90 percent of women with HIV \n     were virgins when they married and remained faithful to their \n     husbands.''\n\n  This statement describes the plight of women in so many societies and \ncountries where women simply do not have the economic or political \npower to insist that their husbands use condoms or abstain from having \nsex outside of marriage. The typical woman who gets infected with HIV \nhas only one partner--her husband. This trend devastates families and \nputs children at risk.\n\n  This astounding reality bears restating: The single greatest risk \nfactor for a woman in the developing world of\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\ncontracting the HIV virus is being married.\n  Women need HIV-prevention tools that they can control to safeguard \ntheir health and that of their families and communities. Unfortunately, \nthere exists absolutely no HIV or STD prevention method that is within \na woman's personal control. Condom use must be negotiated with a \npartner. We are all aware that for too many women, particularly low-\nincome women in the developing world and many in our own country who \nrely upon a male partner for economic support, there is no power of \nnegotiation. We know these women are at risk--yet, we expect them to \nprotect themselves without any tools.\n  Today we have the opportunity to invest in groundbreaking research \nthat can produce these tools, and ultimately, empower women. \nMicrobicides are self-administered products that women could use to \nprevent transmission of STDs, including HIV/AIDS. I say ``could'', \nbecause due to insufficient research investments, no microbicides have \nbeen brought to market. This legislation would expand Federal \ninvestments for microbicide research at the National Institutes for \nHealth (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and \nthe United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n  In addition to encouraging new investments in microbicide research, \nthe Microbicides Development Act will expedite the implementation of \nthe NIH's five-year strategic plan for microbicide research, as well as \nexpand coordination among federal agencies already involved in this \nresearch, including NIH, CDC, and the United States Agency on \nInternational Development (USAID).\n  Perhaps most importantly, the legislation calls for the establishment \nof a Microbicide Research and Development Branch within the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n  The National Institutes of Health, principally through the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), spends the \nmajority of Federal dollars in this area. However, microbicide research \nat NIH is currently conducted with no single line of administrative \naccountability or specific funding coordination. In addition, other \nFederal agencies such as CDC and USAID undertake microbicides research \nand development activities. Because there is no Federal coordination, \nhowever, there is the risk that inefficiencies and duplication of \neffort could result. Through a variety of committees Congress has \nrequested that NIH and its Office of AIDS Research provide Congress \nwith a ``Federal coordination plan'' for research and development in \nthis area, but formal submission of this plan has been repeatedly \ndelayed.\n  A unit dedicated to microbicide research and development at the NIH \nis essential to providing the appropriate staff and funding for the \ncoordination of these activities at the NIH and across agencies.\n  Microbicides may not be a magic bullet, but they are essential to \naddressing the HIV/AIDS crisis. With leading scientists concluding that \na vaccine is likely to be at least 10 years away, we need to make a \nstrong commitment to developing complementary prevention tools such as \nmicrobicides.\n  Microbicides are a public health good for which the social benefits \nare high but economic incentives to private investment are low. Despite \nthe potential market size, neither pharmaceutical nor major biotech \ncompanies have made large investments in the field because development \nis costly and the likelihood of finding an effective product is \nunknown. Like other public health goods, such as vaccines, public \nfunding must fill the gap left by market failure.\n  The cost of developing the existing pipeline of microbicide candidate \nproducts has been estimated at $775 million over five years. This \ninvestment should generate a number of safe, effective microbicides by \n2010. Currently, however, U.S. Federal funding for microbicides is only \nabout $88.8 million annually and is spread across all areas of \nmicrobicide research, not just product development.\n  As for any pharmaceutical or health care product, the key to \ndeveloping safe, effective, affordable and accessible microbicides is \nsufficient investment. If we are to realize the promise of microbicides \nand the lifesaving properties they may provide, then additional public \nfunding must be made available for research and development. The \nMicrobicide Development Act of 2005 will help us achieve this goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 550\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Women and girls are the new face of HIV/AIDS, and are \n     increasingly affected by the disease in each region of the \n     world. Women account for nearly \\1/2\\ of the 37,000,000 \n     adults living with HIV and AIDS worldwide as of 2005. \n     Approximately 7,000 women are newly infected with HIV each \n     day.\n       (2) Because of their social and biological vulnerabilities, \n     young women are particularly at risk. In Sub-Saharan Africa, \n     76 percent of the young people (between ages 15 and 24) with \n     HIV are girls under 20.\n       (3) When women become infected with HIV, they can pass \n     along the infection to their children during pregnancy, labor \n     and delivery, or breast-feeding. The most effective way to \n     halt mother-to-child transmission is to ensure that mothers \n     are not infected in the first place.\n       (4) An increasing number of women who become infected with \n     HIV have only 1 sexual partner, their husband. Unfortunately, \n     marriage is not necessarily effective protection against HIV, \n     because to protect themselves from HIV, women have to rely on \n     their male partners to be faithful or to use condoms. Many \n     women in the developing world are unable to insist on mutual \n     monogamy or negotiate condom use, especially in long-term \n     relationships.\n       (5) Scientists are working on a promising new prevention \n     tool that could slow down the spread of the HIV/AIDS \n     epidemic, microbicides. Formulated as gels, creams, or rings, \n     microbicides inactivate, block, or otherwise interfere with \n     the transmission of the pathogens that cause AIDS and other \n     sexually transmitted diseases (``STD''s). Microbicides could \n     allow a woman to protect herself from disease.\n       (6) Married couples need a method of HIV protection that \n     will allow them to conceive a child and start a family. No \n     existing HIV prevention method also allows conception. \n     Microbicides are being developed to allow women to both \n     conceive children and protect themselves from HIV.\n       (7) Households in developing countries often dissolve when \n     a mother dies. In the hardest hit countries, the number of \n     children who are orphaned by AIDS is increasing dramatically.\n       (8) Women in the United States also need HIV prevention \n     tools like microbicides. AIDS is now the number 1 cause of \n     death among African-American women between the ages of 25 and \n     34.\n       (9) In addition to HIV, other STDs continue to be a major \n     health threat in the United States. The United States has the \n     highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases of any \n     industrialized nation. Nineteen million STD infections occur \n     every year. It is estimated that by age 25, \\1/2\\ of all \n     sexually active people in the United States can expect to be \n     infected with an STD.\n       (10) HIV and AIDS represent a threat to national security \n     and economic well being, with direct medical costs of up to \n     $15,500,000,000 per year. The pandemic undermines armies, \n     foments unrest, and burdens the United States military.\n       (11) As the Nation's largest single provider of HIV/AIDS \n     care, the Veterans Affairs health care system spent \n     $359,000,000 to provided care to more than 20,000 American \n     veterans with HIV/AIDS in fiscal year 2004.\n       (12) The microbicide field has achieved an extraordinary \n     amount of scientific momentum, with several first-generation \n     candidates now in large scale human trials around the world. \n     At same time, new products, based upon recent advances in HIV \n     treatment, have advanced into early safety trials.\n       (13) Microbicides are a classic public health good for \n     which the social benefits are high but the economic incentive \n     to private investment is low. Like other public health goods, \n     such as vaccines, public funding must fill the gap. \n     Microbicide research depends in large part on Government \n     leadership and investment.\n       (14) The Federal Government needs to make a strong \n     commitment to microbicide research and development. Three \n     agencies--the National Institutes of Health (``NIH''), the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (``CDC''), and the \n     United States Agency of International Development \n     (``USAID'')--have played important roles in the progress to \n     date, but further strong, well-coordinated, and visible \n     public sector leadership will be essential for the promise of \n     microbicides to be realized.\n       (15) As of 2005, microbicide research at NIH is conducted \n     under several institutes with no single line of \n     administrative accountability, no specific funding \n     coordination, and highly\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\n     variable levels of interest and commitment across institute \n     leadership. Only a few NIH staff can claim microbicides as \n     their sole focus.\n       (16) The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief \n     (``PEPFAR'') recognizes the urgency of developing safe and \n     effective microbicides to prevent HIV. In addition, NIH \n     documents state that ``the US government is firmly committed \n     to accelerating the development of safe and effective \n     microbicides to prevent HIV,'' recognizing that microbicides \n     may provide ``one of the most promising preventative \n     interventions given that could be inexpensive, readily \n     available, and widely acceptable''. But as of 2005, NIH \n     spends barely 2 percent of its HIV/AIDS research budget on \n     microbicides. As more microbicide candidates are advanced \n     into later-stage clinical trials and development costs rise \n     correspondingly, 2005 funding levels are simply inadequate.\n       (17) USAID and the CDC have expanded their microbicide \n     portfolios, but without overall Federal coordination, costly \n     inefficiencies and unproductive duplication of effort may \n     result. USAID sustains strong partnerships with public and \n     private organizations working on microbicide research, \n     importantly including clinical trials in developing countries \n     where its experience is extensive. USAID is well positioned \n     to facilitate the introduction of microbicides once they are \n     available. The CDC also engages in critical microbicide \n     research and clinical testing, and has a long history of \n     conducting field trials in developing countries.\n       (18) HIV prevention options available as of 2005 are not \n     enough. HIV prevention strategies must recognize women's \n     needs and vulnerabilities. If women are to have a genuine \n     opportunity to protect themselves, their best option is the \n     rapid development of new HIV-prevention technologies like \n     microbicides, which women can initiate and control.\n\n   TITLE I--MICROBICIDE RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to make technical corrections to the Veterans Benefits \nImprovement Act of 2004; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that would provide \na technical correction to the Veterans Benefits Improvements Act of \n2004.\n  Last session, the law that allowed severely disabled members of the \nArmed Forces to receive specially adapted housing grants from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), while still on active duty, was \ninadvertently repealed. This was an oversight that occurred when the \nlaw was changed that authorized the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nprovide specially adapted housing for veterans whose disability is the \nresult of the loss, or loss of use, of both upper arms above the elbow.\n  Currently, only veterans are statutorily eligible for adapted housing \ngrants. Congress originally intended eligibility for both disabled \nveterans and servicemembers, as was the case before the change in law \nlast Session.\n  The correcting language in my bill would again provide the adapted \nhousing benefit to disabled servicemembers in need of accommodations as \nthey return to their homes. The adapted housing benefit is essential \nfor providing an adequate standard of living for our disabled \nservicemembers. The benefit provides necessary modifications to \nservicemembers' homes to accommodate their disabilities.\n  I ask that we continue to make every effort to ensure that those \nservicemembers who have sacrificed to defend Freedom receive the \nbenefits that they deserve. We owe it to these great men and women to \npass this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 552\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO VETERANS BENEFITS \n                   IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2004.\n\n       Section 2101 of title 38, United States Code, as amended by \n     section 401 of the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004 \n     (Public Law 108-454), is further amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d);\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (b) a new subsection (c) \n     consisting of the text of subsection (c) of such section 2101 \n     as in effect immediately before the enactment of such Act, \n     modified--\n       (A) by inserting after ``(c)'' the following: ``Assistance \n     to Members of the Armed Forces.--'';\n       (B) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) in the first sentence, by striking ``paragraph (1), \n     (2), or (3)'' and inserting ``subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or \n     (D) of paragraph (2)''; and\n       (ii) in the second sentence, by striking ``the second \n     sentence'' and inserting ``paragraph (3)''; and\n       (C) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) in the first sentence, by striking ``paragraph (1)'' \n     and inserting ``paragraph (2)''; and\n       (ii) in the second sentence, by striking ``paragraph (2)'' \n     and inserting ``paragraph (3)''; and\n       (3) in subsection (a)(3), by striking ``subsection (c)'' in \n     the matter preceding subparagraph (A) and inserting \n     ``subsection (d)''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by section 1 shall take effect \n     immediately after the enactment of the Veterans Benefits \n     Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-454).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 553. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \nHOV-lane exemptions for low-emission and hybrid vehicles; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with \nSenator Allen that would allow hybrids to access High Occupancy Vehicle \n(HOV) lanes.\n  California and other States, such as Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia, \ndo not want to risk losing their Federal highway dollars by acting \nwithout a waiver from the Department of Transportation to implement \nlaws permitting hybrid vehicles to use HOV lanes.\n  Virginia has decided to take that risk because the benefit of having \nmore fuel efficient cars on the roads is greater.\n  This bill would allow the Department of Transportation to grant such \na waiver to States.\n  The purpose of this bill is to encourage Americans to buy and drive \nhybrids, which provide an innovative solution to help reduce our thirst \nfor gasoline.\n  Allowing hybrids into HOV lanes is a low-cost and quick incentive to \npromote the use of hybrids.\n  Hybrid vehicles are more fuel efficient than cars powered by internal \ncombustion engines and they emit fewer greenhouse gases that lead to \nglobal warming.\n  Burning less gas can also help us to gain independence from foreign \nsources of energy.\n  The cost of hybrid technology will decrease by bringing more hybrids \ninto the market.\n  And, people can make smarter, more fuel efficient, less polluting \nchoices while getting to and from work faster.\n  Several States, including my State of California, have acted on their \nown to permit hybrid vehicles to use HOV lanes.\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\n  Current Federal law, however, only grants States the flexibility to \nallow electric or natural gas powered vehicles to drive in the HOV \nlanes with a single passenger.\n  Right now, there are approximately 20,000 high-mileage hybrid car \nowners in California waiting to take advantage of a State law that went \ninto effect on January 1, 2005. This State law, sponsored by \nassemblywoman Fran Pavley, allows hybrid vehicles that get 45 miles-\nper-gallon or better to use diamond or HOV lanes until 2008.\n  As California has 40 percent of the Nation's carpool lanes, high-\nmileage hybrid owners stand to gain a significant benefit for driving \nthese cars.\n  Some critics have expressed concerns that HOV lanes will get \noverloaeded, but each State can stop the program if congestion becomes \na problem.\n  Hybrids only account for a fraction of the cars sold today--43,435 \nhybrids out of a total of 16.7 million vehicles were sold in 2003!\n  If States want to act to encourage their citizens to drive more fuel \nefficient, less polluting vehicles, we need to give them the tools to \ndo so.\n  It is my hope that Congress will pass this bill quickly so that \nhybrid drivers in California, Georgia, Colorado and elsewhere can take \nadvantage of the HOV lanes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 553\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. HOV-LANE EXEMPTION FOR LOW-EMISSION AND HYBRID \n                   VEHICLES\n\n       Section 102(a)(2) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking the first sentence and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a State \n     may permit a vehicle with fewer than 2 occupants to operate \n     in high occupancy vehicle lanes if the vehicle is--\n       ``(i)(I) certified as meeting the inherently low-emission \n     vehicle evaporative emission standard under part 88 of title \n     40, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor regulation) \n     (including a vehicle produced before or during the 2004 model \n     year that meets that standard); and\n       ``(II) labeled in accordance with section 88.312-93(c) of \n     title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor \n     regulation); or\n       ``(ii) a motor vehicle that--\n\n       ``(I) draws propulsion energy from onboard sources of \n     stored energy produced or stored by--\n\n       ``(aa) an internal combustion or heat engine using \n     combustible fuel; and\n       ``(bb) a rechargeable energy storage system that provides \n     at least 5 percent of the maximum available power; and\n\n       ``(II) meets such other requirements or criteria as may be \n     specified by the State.''; and\n\n       (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``Such permission'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(B) Revocation.--The permission under subparagraph (A)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Feingold, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 555. A bill to amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and \nexporting cartels illegal; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues--\nSenators Kohl, Leahy, Grassley, Feingold, Snowe, Schumer, Durbin, \nLevin, Boxer, Wyden, Corzine, and Dayton--to introduce the No Oil \nProducing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2005 (NOPEC). This legislation \nwould give the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission legal \nauthority to bring an antitrust case against the Organization of \nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n  Every consumer in America knows that gasoline prices have reached \nrecord highs recently. Likewise, the price of home heating oil has \ndramatically increased. These price increases have been acutely painful \nto people in my home State of Ohio.\n  Moreover, the rise in jet fuel prices is crippling our already weak \nairline industry. One of the main reasons that many U.S. airlines have \nnot been able to make a profit has been due to skyrocketing jet fuel \ncosts. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2004, Continental \nAirlines' jet fuel costs were $453 million, which was a 48 percent \nincrease compared to last year, and Delta's jet fuel costs were $385 \nmillion, which was 76 percent increase compared to last year. No wonder \nso many U.S. airlines are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy or are \nalready in bankruptcy.\n  What is the cause of these high gas and fuel prices? There are a \nnumber of factors at play, but there is clear agreement among industry \nexperts about the primary cause of high gas and fuel prices--and that \nis the increase in imported crude oil prices. Who sets crude oil \nprices? OPEC does. The unacceptably high price of imported crude oil is \na direct result of price fixing by the OPEC nations to keep the price \nof oil unnaturally high.\n  OPEC's hunger for ill-gotten gains is astounding. It seems its \nappetite can never be satisfied. For example, despite the fact that oil \nprices recently hit the historic high of $55 a barrel, OPEC members met \nin December 2004 and decided to cut the output of oil by another 1 \nmillion barrels. When demand is high and supplies are cut, that means \nprices will increase. Nonetheless, OPEC cut production. This is an \noutrage.\n  OPEC is probably the most notorious example of an illegal cartel in \nthe world today. It is an affront to the principle that markets should \nbe free. Nation after nation has adopted antitrust laws that make it \nillegal to fix prices. In 1998, the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, then composed of 29 member nations, issued \na formal recommendation denouncing price fixing. OPEC's continued \nactions, in ongoing defiance of American and international antitrust \nnorms, should not be tolerated.\n  Until now, however, OPEC has effectively received a ``free pass'' \nfrom prosecution under U.S. antitrust laws. For over two decades, \nenforcement has been constrained by two related court opinions. In \n1979, a Federal district court found that OPEC's price-setting \ndecisions were ``governmental'' acts. As a result, they were given \nsovereign status and protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. \nSubsequently, in 1981, a Federal court of appeals declined to consider \nthe appeal of that antitrust case based on the so-called ``act of \nstate'' doctrine, which holds that a court will not consider a case \nregarding the legality of the acts of a foreign nation.\n  Our bill would effectively reverse these decisions. It makes it clear \nthat OPEC's activities are not protected by sovereign immunity and that \nthe Federal courts should not decline to hear a case against OPEC based \non the ``act of state'' doctrine. As a result, under NOPEC, the \nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission could bring an \nantitrust enforcement action against OPEC's member nations. This bill \nwould force OPEC to begin pricing in a competitive, free-market manner \nor face the possibility of civil or criminal antitrust prosecution.\n  Senator Kohl and I have introduced this bill three times before--in \n2000, 2001, and 2004. We intend to keep fighting for American consumers \nand businesses so that they will not be fleeced by OPEC in the future.\n  NOPEC says to OPEC: When you want to do business with America, you \nmust abide by our antitrust laws and the rules of the free market. And \nwhen OPEC, one day, abides by the rules of the free market, we will all \nsee lower oil and gas prices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``No Oil Producing and \n     Exporting Cartels Act of 2005'' or ``NOPEC''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SHERMAN ACT.\n\n       The Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) is amended by adding \n     after section 7 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 7A. OIL PRODUCING CARTELS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--It shall be illegal and a violation of \n     this Act for any foreign state, or any instrumentality or \n     agent of any foreign state, to act collectively or in \n     combination with any other foreign state, any instrumentality \n     or agent of any other foreign state, or any other person, \n     whether by cartel or any other association or form of \n     cooperation or joint action--\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\n       ``(1) to limit the production or distribution of oil, \n     natural gas, or any other petroleum product;\n       ``(2) to set or maintain the price of oil, natural gas, or \n     any petroleum product; or\n       ``(3) to otherwise take any action in restraint of trade \n     for oil, natural gas, or any petroleum product;\n\n     when such action, combination, or collective action has a \n     direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on the \n     market, supply, price, or distribution of oil, natural gas, \n     or other petroleum product in the United States.\n       ``(b) Sovereign Immunity.--A foreign state engaged in \n     conduct in violation of subsection (a) shall not be immune \n     under the doctrine of sovereign immunity from the \n     jurisdiction or judgments of the courts of the United States \n     in any action brought to enforce this section.\n       ``(c) Inapplicability of Act of State Doctrine.--No court \n     of the United States shall decline, based on the act of state \n     doctrine, to make a determination on the merits in an action \n     brought under this section.\n       ``(d) Enforcement.--The Attorney General of the United \n     States and the Federal Trade Commission may bring an action \n     to enforce this section in any district court of the United \n     States as provided under the antitrust laws.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY.\n\n       Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (6), by striking ``or'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in paragraph (7), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) in which the action is brought under section 7A of \n     the Sherman Act.''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senator \nDeWine and 11 co-sponsors, of the No Oil Producing and Exporting \nCartels Act of 2005 (``NOPEC''). It is time for the U.S. government to \nfight back on the price of oil and hold OPEC accountable when it acts \nillegally. This bill will hold OPEC member nations to account under \nU.S. antitrust law when they agree to limit supply or fix price in \nviolation of the most basic principles of free competition.\n  Our bill will authorize the Attorney General and Federal Trade \nCommission to file suit against nations or other entities that \nparticipate in a conspiracy to limit the supply, or fix the price, of \noil. In addition, it will expressly specify that the doctrines of \nsovereign immunity and act of state do not exempt nations that \nparticipate in oil cartels from basic antitrust law. Senator DeWine and \nI have introduced this bill in each of the last three Congresses. This \nlegislation was the subject of an extensive hearing at the Antitrust \nSubcommittee last year, and subsequently passed the Judiciary Committee \nwithout dissent. It is now time, in this new Congress, to finally pass \nthis legislation into law and give our nation a long needed tool to \ncounteract this pernicious and anti-consumer conspiracy.\n  Throughout the last year, consumers all across the Nation have \nwatched gas prices rise to previously unimagined levels. As crude oil \nprices exceeded $40, then $50 and then $55 per barrel, retail prices of \ngasoline over $2.00 per gallon became commonplace. While prices \ntemporarily receded for short periods, the general trend was \nsignificantly upwards, and rising even today. We now hear predictions \nthat the price of crude oil may soon break the $60 barrier, and oil \nindustry analysts even say $80 per barrel is not unthinkable. And one \nfact has remained consistent--any move downwards in price would end as \nsoon as OPEC decided to cut production. The price of crude oil danced \nto the tune set by OPEC members. Such blatantly anti-competitive \nconduct by the oil cartel violates the most basic principles of fair \ncompetition and free markets and should not be tolerated.\n  Real people suffer real consequences every day in our nation because \nof OPEC's actions. Rising gas prices are a silent tax that takes hard-\nearned money away from Americans every time they visit the gas pump. \nHigher oil prices drive up the cost of transportation, harming \nthousands of companies throughout the economy from trucking to \naviation. And those costs are passed on to consumers in the form of \nhigher prices for manufactured goods. Higher oil prices mean higher \nheating oil and electricity costs. Anyone who has gone through a \nMidwest winter can tell you about the tremendous personal costs \nassociated with higher home heating bills.\n  We have all heard many explanations offered for rising energy prices. \nSome say that the oil companies are gouging consumers. Some blame \ndisruptions in supply. Others point to the EPA requirement mandating \nuse of a new and more expensive type of ``reformulated'' gas in the \nMidwest or other ``boutique'' fuels around the country. Some even claim \nthat refiners and distributors have illegally fixed prices. On this \nissue, Senator DeWine and I have repeatedly asked the Federal Trade \nCommission to investigate these allegations. As a result of our \nrequests, the FTC has put a task force in place to find out if those \nallegations were true. While we continue to urge the FTC to be \nvigilant, the FTC has to date found no evidence of illegal domestic \nprice fixing as a cause of higher gas prices. And we conducted our own \ninquiry in the Antitrust Subcommittee last year which found no basis to \nchallenge the FTC's conclusions.\n  But one cause of these escalating prices is indisputable: the price \nfixing conspiracy of the OPEC nations. For years, this conspiracy has \nunfairly driven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed \nof the oil exporters. We have long decried OPEC, but, sadly, no one in \ngovernment has yet tried to take any action. Our bill will, for the \nfirst time, establish clearly and plainly that when a group of \ncompeting oil producers like the OPEC nations act together to restrict \nsupply or set prices, they are violating U.S. law. The bill will not \nauthorize private lawsuits, but it will authorize the Attorney General \nor FTC to file suit under the antitrust laws for redress. Our bill will \nalso make plain that the nations of OPEC cannot hide behind the \ndoctrines of ``Sovereign Immunity'' or ``Act of State'' to escape the \nreach of American justice. In so doing, our bill will overrule one \ntwenty-year old lower court decision which incorrectly failed to \nrecognize that the actions of OPEC member nations was commercial \nactivity exempt from the protections of sovereign immunity.\n  The most fundamental principle of a free market is that competitors \ncannot be permitted to conspire to limit supply or fix price. There can \nbe no free market without this foundation. And we should not permit any \nnation to flout this fundamental principle.\n  Some critics of this legislation have argued that suing OPEC will not \nwork or that threatening suit will hurt more than help. I disagree. Our \nNOPEC legislation will, for the first time, enable our antitrust \nauthorities to take legal action to combat the illegitimate price-\nfixing conspiracy of the oil cartel. It will, at a minimum, have a real \ndeterrent effect on nations that seek to join forces to fix oil prices \nto the detriment of consumers. This legislation will be the first real \nweapon the U.S. government has ever had to deter OPEC from its \nseemingly endless cycle of price increases. There is nothing remarkable \nabout applying U.S. antitrust law overseas. Our government has not \nhesitated to do so when faced with clear evidence of anti-competitive \nconduct that harms American consumers. A few years ago, for example, \nthe Justice Department secured record fines totaling $725 million \nagainst German and Swiss companies engaged in a price fixing conspiracy \nto raise and fix the price of vitamins sold in the United States and \nelsewhere. Their behavior harmed consumers by raising the prices \nconsumers paid for vitamins every day and plainly needed to be \naddressed. As this and other cases show, the mere fact that the \nconspirators are foreign nations is no basis to shield them from \nviolating these most basic standards of fair economic behavior.\n\n  Even under current law, there is no doubt that the actions of the \ninternational oil cartel would be in gross violation of antitrust law \nif engaged in by private companies. If OPEC were a group of \ninternational private companies rather than foreign governments, their \nactions would be nothing more than an illegal price fixing scheme. But \nOPEC members have used the shield of ``sovereign immunity'' to escape \naccountability for their price-fixing. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities \nAct, though, already recognizes that the ``commercial'' activity of \nnations is not protected by sovereign immunity. And it is hard to \nimagine an activity that is more obviously commercial than selling oil \nfor profit, as the OPEC nations do. Our legislation will establish that \nthe sovereign immunity doctrine will not divest a U.S. court from \njurisdiction to hear a lawsuit alleging that members of the oil cartel \nare violating antitrust law.\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\n  The suffering of consumers across the Nation in the last year has \nmade me more certain than ever that this legislation is necessary. \nBetween OPEC's repeated decisions to cut oil production and the FTC's \nconclusion for the last several years that there is no illegal conduct \nby domestic companies responsible for rising gas prices, I am convinced \nthat we need to take action, and take action now, before the damage \nspreads too far.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our legislation so that our Nation \nwill finally have an effective means to combat this price-fixing \nconspiracy of oil-rich nations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 556. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to jointly conduct a study of certain land \nadjacent to the Walnut Canyon National Monument in the State of \nArizona; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman Rick Renzi, in \nintroducing legislation to authorize a special resources and land \nmanagement study for the Walnut Canyon National Monument in Arizona. \nThe study is intended to evaluate a range of management options for \npublic lands adjacent to the monument to ensure adequate protection of \nthe canyon's cultural and natural resources.\n  For several years, local communities adjacent to the Walnut Canyon \nNational Monument have debated whether the land surrounding the \nmonument would be best protected from future development under \nmanagement of the U.S. Forest Service or the National Park Service. The \nCoconino County Board and the Flagstaff City Council have passed \nresolutions concluding that the preferred method to determine what is \nbest for the land surrounding Walnut Canyon National Monument is by \nhaving a Federal study conducted. The recommendations from such a study \nwould help to resolve the question of future management and whether \nexpanding the monument's boundaries could compliment current public and \nmultiple-use needs.\n  The legislation also would direct the Secretary of the Interior and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to provide recommendations for management \noptions for maintenance of the public uses and protection of resources \nof the study area.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would provide a mechanism for \ndetermining the management options for one of Arizona's high uses \nscenic areas and protect the natural and cultural resources of this \nincredibly beautiful monument. I urge my colleagues to support its \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Biden, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Salazar, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 558. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncertain additional retired members of the Armed Forces who have a \nservice-connected disability to receive both disability compensation \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either \nretired pay by reason of their years of military service or Combat-\nRelated Special compensation and to eliminate the phase-in period under \ncurrent law with respect to such concurrent receipt; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to again introduce a bill along with my \ncolleagues Mr. Biden, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nMrs. Boxer, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lieberman, and \nMr. Durbin.\n  Nothing is more important than keeping America safe. The key to our \nsecurity is a professional, well-trained military. And in order to \nattract the dedicated soldiers we need, we must honor our commitment to \nAmerica's veterans. Most everyone in the Senate knows about the ban on \nconcurrent receipt . . . and our veterans certainly know about the \nhardship it causes.\n  This is the outdated and unfair policy that prevents disabled \nveterans from collecting both their military retirement pay and \ndisability compensation at the same time. Under current law, a retired \ndisabled veteran must deduct from his retirement pay, dollar for \ndollar, the amount of any disability compensation he receives.\n  In many cases, this totally wipes out the veteran's retirement pay. \nThe end result is that the disabled military retiree loses all of the \nvalue of his 20 or more years of service to our Nation. We don't \nsubject any other Federal retiree to this kind of offset, only our \ndisabled military retirees. So this policy amounts to a special tax on \nour disabled veterans . . . men and women who have already sacrificed \nso much for our Nation.\n  When this situation was first brought to my attention a few years ago \nby a veteran from Nevada, I could hardly believe it. It seemed too \noutrageous to be true. And to this day, I can't understand why it has \ntaken so long to correct the problem. Because to me, it just goes \nwithout saying that we should treat our disabled veteran with honor . . \n. with dignity . . . and with respect.\n  The members of this Senate share my feelings. For the past years, the \nSenate has passed measures to end the ban on concurrent receipt. I want \nto especially thank Senators Levin and Warner for their support of this \nissue, year after year. Thanks to their strong leadership we have made \nsome progress each year.\n  In 2003 we passed a measure to allow concurrent receipt for those who \nare 100 percent disabled. Last year we made that change immediate, \ninstead of being phased in over 10 years. This will benefit as many as \n50,000 severely disabled veterans. But there are still hundreds of \nthousands of disabled veterans who need our help.\n  We would not dream of leaving a soldier behind on the battlefield. \nAnd we should not walk away from our disabled veterans now, when they \nneed our help. Frankly, I can't understand why the administration is \neven debating whether this policy should be changed for veterans whose \ndisabilities make them unemployable. The fact is, many veterans with a \ndisability rated at less than 100 percent cannot get or hold a job \nbecause of their disabilities.\n  And a 10-year phase-in simply isn't fair for these veterans, because \nmany of them will never live to see the benefits. They deserve \nimmediate help. We have to take care of these veterans--now. If the \nadministration doesn't want to do it, then Congress will be forced to \nlegislate the necessary changes. Taking care of veterans is the right \nthing to do because we must never forget the sacrifices they made to \nprotect our freedom.\n  Taking care of our veterans is also a key to winning the war on \nterror. In our all-volunteer military, it is critical to attract and \nretain professional, dedicated soldiers.\n  These people serve because they love America. They don't expect to \nget rich in the military but they do expect that we will honor our \ncommitments to provide health care and other benefits for them and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 558\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Retired Pay Restoration Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all disabled \n     military retirees were required to fund their own veterans' \n     disability compensation by forfeiting one dollar of earned \n     retired pay for each dollar received in veterans' disability \n     compensation.\n       (2) Since 1999, Congress has enacted legislation every year \n     to progressively expand eligibility criteria for relief of \n     the retired pay disability offset and further reduce the \n     burden of financial sacrifice on disabled military retirees.\n       (3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the sacrifice for \n     all disabled retirees, Congress has given initial priority to \n     easing financial inequities for the most severely disabled \n     and for combat-disabled retirees.\n       (4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility within cost \n     constraints, Congress effectively has authorized full \n     concurrent receipt for all\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\n     qualifying retirees with 100-percent disability ratings and \n     all with combat-related disability ratings, while phasing out \n     the disability offset to retired pay over 10 years for \n     retired members with noncombat-related, service-connected \n     disability ratings of 50 percent to 90 percent.\n       (5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, Congress \n     acknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating new \n     thresholds of eligibility that understandably are \n     disappointing to disabled retirees who fall short of meeting \n     those new thresholds.\n       (6) Congress is not content with the status quo.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     military retired pay earned by service and sacrifice in \n     defending the Nation should not be reduced because a military \n     retiree is also eligible for veterans' disability \n     compensation awarded for service-connected disability.\n\n     SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENT OF BOTH RETIRED PAY AND \n                   VETERANS' DISABILITY COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN \n                   ADDITIONAL MILITARY RETIREES WITH COMPENSABLE \n                   SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Extension of Concurrent Receipt Authority to Retirees \n     With Service-connected Disabilities Rated Less Than 50 \n     Percent.--Section 1414 of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking paragraph (2) of subsection (a).\n       (b) Repeal of Phase-in of Concurrent Receipt of Retired Pay \n     and Veterans' Disability Compensation.--Such section is \n     further amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking the final sentence of \n     paragraph (1);\n       (2) by striking subsection (c) and redesignating \n     subsections (d) and (e) as subsections (c) and (d), \n     respectively; and\n       (3) in subsection (d) (as so redesignated), by striking \n     subparagraph (4).\n       (c) Clerical Amendments.--\n       (1) The heading for section 1414 of such title is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1414.

Members eligible for retired pay who are also eligible for \n              veterans' disability compensation: concurrent payment of \n              retired pay and disability compensation.''.\n\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as of January 1, 2006, and shall apply to \n     payments for months beginning on or after that date.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to make the protection of vulnerable populations, \nespecially women and children, who are affected by a humanitarian \nemergency a priority of the United States Government, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as we stand here today women and children \nare suffering the ravages and privations of war and natural disasters. \nThey are suffering food shortages and lack the most basic necessities \nin so many nations around the world. Five million people have been \naffected by the tsunami. Of that 5 million, 1.5 million are children, \nmany alone and parentless, vulnerable to human trafficking, forced \nrecruitment into military service or worse.\n  We can help. We can do our share by making sure U.S. programs do \ntheir share.\n  Today, I am introducing--along with Senator Lugar--the Protection of \nVulnerable Populations During Humanitarian Emergencies Act of 2005, to \nmake vulnerable people, especially women and children, an absolute \npriority of our foreign assistance programs. As a Nation, as a people, \nwe probably should do more, but we certainly can do no less than to \nensure the international community has a system in place to prevent the \nexploitation of so many lost, vulnerable, suffering women and children \nwho are struggling to survive the most God-awful conditions imaginable.\n  Over the past fifty years the nature of war has changed dramatically. \nIn today's world, 90 percent of the casualties in any war are \ncivilians, most of them women and children. Since 1990, more than 2 \nmillion children have been killed, and 6 million maimed or injured as a \nresult of a war somewhere in this world.\n  It is extraordinary to think that, in what we believe is the most \nsophisticated, technologically advanced period in world history, rape \nhas become a routine weapon of war used at will by bands of marauding \nmilitary forces--some of them young boys--everywhere from Burma to \nBosnia, and from Sierra Leone to Sudan.\n  Forced displacement of civilians, rather than being one of the \nunfortunate results of war is now a deliberate tactic of war.\n  Look at Darfur in the last 18 months.\n  Civilians have been targeted by Khartoum in one of the most horrific \ngenocides we have seen in recent years. Homes have been bombed, and \nvillages attacked. Government sponsored militia are destroying crops \nand have fouled the water supply. They're burning homes, leaving \nmothers no choice but to flee for their lives and their children's \nlives.\n\n  Civilians forced to flee during war find their way to camps, but \ninstead of relative safety what do they find? They find more suffering. \nThe camps become virtual prisons. Women and girls are beaten and raped \nif they venture outside the camps for firewood.\n  When I recently read a report by a United Nations investigatory team \nwhich states that a number of U.N. peacekeepers--U.N. peacekeepers, \nmind you--deployed to protect civilians from ethnic violence in the \neastern Democratic Republic of Congo were sexually exploiting girls as \nyoung as 13 years old, it reinforced my belief that we cannot stand by \nany longer. Something must be done and this bill only begins to do it. \nLet me read you what that report said:\n\n       Interviews with Congolese women and girls confirmed that \n     sexual contact with peacekeepers occurred with regularity, \n     usually in exchange for food or small sums of money . . .''\n       . . . ``Many of the contacts involved girls under the age \n     of 18.''\n\n  What's more horrifying to me: the investigators found that the abuse \nwas going on while they were there, on the ground, conducting the \ninvestigation. These incidents as well as allegations of sexual \nexploitation by camp residents and humanitarian workers in refugee \ncamps in West Africa and Nepal in 2002 are incredible, real life \nexamples of the sad fact that women and children remain vulnerable even \nin the very places they flee for safety.\n  This bill seeks to do something about it.\n  It enhances the U.S. government's ability to see that women and \nchildren are protected before, during, and after a complex humanitarian \nemergency. It directs the Secretary of State to designate a special \ncoordinator for protection issues who will be charged with\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\nmaking sure our embassies and consular posts are made aware of the \nwarning signs that an emergency which may put the lives and safety of \nwomen and children at risk is imminent.\n  It directs the coordinator to compile a watch list of such countries \nand regions so that the Agency for International Development can plan \nto meet potential need. It prohibits U.S. funding for relief agencies \nthat do not sign a code of conduct that outlaws improper exploitative \nrelationships between aid workers and recipients.\n  It expresses the Sense of Congress that the U.N. Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations should improve its mechanism to prevent and \nrespond to allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by \npeacekeepers.\n  It establishes a fellowship with the AID for someone with expertise \nand skills in preventing and responding to violence and exploitation of \nthose made vulnerable by war.\n  It calls upon the United States Executive Director of the \nInternational Bank of Reconstruction and Development to try to make \nsure World Bank demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration programs \nextend the same benefits that ex-combatants receive to women and \nchildren who were associated with them.\n  As it now stands, women and children who were used as cooks and \nporters and so called ``wives,'' a euphemism for women who were \nkidnaped to serve as sexual slaves, may well not be given a single \nthing through these programs--nothing with which to rebuild their lives \ndespite the fact that they were not there by choice. Yet the very \npeople who forced them into such conditions receive assistance with no \nqualms or reservations.\n  Finally, it amends the Foreign Assistance Act to authorize programs \nand activities specifically aimed at making people--especially women \nand children--who are affected by humanitarian emergencies safer from \nfurther exploitation and abuse.\n  This bill is by no means a panacea, but it is a decent beginning. It \nis the least we can do to mitigate the extraordinary violence against \nwomen and children in times of war and natural disasters the results of \nwhich we see all too often in a world that seems to have gone mad.\n  To do nothing in the face of it would be sinful, inhumane, and wrong.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 559\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The nature of war has changed dramatically in recent \n     decades, putting civilians, especially women and children, at \n     greater risk of death, disease, displacement, and \n     exploitation.\n       (2) In the last decade alone, more than 2,000,000 children \n     have been killed during wars, while more than 4,000,000 have \n     survived physical mutilation, and more than 1,000,000 have \n     been orphaned or separated from their families as a result of \n     war.\n       (3) The use of rape, particularly against women and girls, \n     is an increasingly common tactic in modern war.\n       (4) Civilians, particularly women and children, account for \n     the vast majority of those adversely affected by humanitarian \n     emergencies, including as refugees and internally displaced \n     persons, and increasingly are targeted by combatants and \n     armed elements for murder, abduction, forced military \n     conscription, involuntary servitude, displacement, sexual \n     abuse and slavery, mutilation, and loss of freedom.\n       (5) Large-scale natural disasters, such as the tsunami that \n     struck South East Asia, South Asia, and East Africa on \n     December 26, 2004, and claimed over 200,000 lives, are \n     particularly threatening to children, who are often orphaned \n     or separated from their families.\n       (6) Traditionally, the response to such humanitarian \n     emergencies has focused on providing food, medical care, and \n     shelter needs, and has placed less emphasis on the safety and \n     security of those affected by a humanitarian emergency.\n       (7) Refugee women and girls face particular threats because \n     of power inequities, including being forced to exchange sex \n     for food and humanitarian supplies, and being at increased \n     risk of rape and sexual exploitation and abuse due to poor \n     security in refugee camps.\n       (8) In some circumstances, humanitarian agencies have \n     failed to make individuals affected by a humanitarian \n     emergency, especially women and children, aware of their \n     rights to protection and assistance, to give them access to \n     effective channels of redress, and to make humanitarian \n     workers aware of their duty to respect these rights and \n     provide adequate assistance.\n       (9) Refugee and displaced women face heightened risks of \n     developing complications\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\n     during pregnancy, suffering a miscarriage, dying, being \n     injured during childbirth, becoming infected with HIV or \n     another sexually transmitted infection, or suffering from \n     posttraumatic stress disorder.\n       (10) Despite the heightened risks for women during a \n     humanitarian emergency, women's needs for specialized health \n     services have often been overlooked by donors and relief \n     organizations, which are focused on providing food, water, \n     and shelter.\n       (11) There is a substantial need for the protection of \n     civilians, especially women and children, to be given a high \n     priority during all humanitarian emergencies.\n\n                TITLE I--PROGRAM AND POLICY COORDINATION\n\n     SEC. 101. REQUIREMENT TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall, in consultation with \n     the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development, develop a comprehensive strategy \n     for the protection of vulnerable populations, especially \n     women and children, who are affected by a humanitarian \n     emergency.

Mr. President, I rise to comment on International Women's \nDay and to join Senator Biden in introducing the Protection of \nVulnerable Populations During Humanitarian Emergencies Act of 2005.\n  Today is International Women's Day, a day on which we celebrate the \nprogress of women and rededicate ourselves to overcoming the inequities \nfacing women around the globe. In many places in the world, \ndiscrimination continues to deny women and girls full political and \neconomic equality. The lives and health of women and girls continue to \nbe endangered by violence that is directed at them simply because they \nare female. In recognition of these issues, I co-sponsored a Resolution \nwith Senators Biden and Clinton commemorating International Women's Day \nand reaffirming the Senate's commitment to improving the status of \nwomen worldwide.\n  In addition, I am co-sponsoring with Senator Biden the Protection of \nVulnerable Populations During Humanitarian Emergencies Act of 2005, \nwhich the Committee on Foreign Relations supported as an amendment to \nour Foreign Affairs Authorization Act for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. \nDuring humanitarian emergencies, women and children become more \nvulnerable to a range of abuses including sexual exploitation, \ntrafficking and gender-based violence. Our bill seeks to ensure that \nU.S. foreign assistance programs are a force for protecting women, \nchildren, and other vulnerable populations in the wake of military \nconflict and natural disasters.\n  The recent tsunami tragedy in the Indian Ocean region has highlighted \nthis important issue. Tens of thousands of children have lost family \nmembers and friends and are coping with unspeakable trauma. Nearly \n35,000 children have been orphaned, and many more have been separated \nfrom their families. These children face the imminent threats of \nhunger, disease, and diarrhea. Beyond these dangers, children are \nvulnerable to being trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labor, \nor conscription. Without their families, the children orphaned by the \ntsunami lack protection from predators who would profit from their \ntragedy.\n  During many of the humanitarian crises that we have witnessed over \nthe last decade, including Rwanda, Bosnia, and Sudan, we have learned \nthat women and children are uniquely vulnerable to sexual violence and \nexploitation. Over the course of the past year, the world has heard \naccounts of rape at the camps in Darfur in Western Sudan. Our bill aims \nto improve the ability of the United States to protect women and \nchildren, like those in the tsunami-affected region and in Darfur, from \nthe additional dangers they face during a humanitarian emergency. Our \nbill calls for a coordinator for protection issues and a strategy to \nimprove our ability to protect and respond to the needs of women and \nchildren in such crises. Our bill authorizes funding for the specific \nhealth care needs of women during an emergency, the establishment of \nregistries and clearinghouses to trace relatives and help children find \ntheir families, and legal services for survivors of sexual exploitation \nand abuse. In addition, the bill requires that any organization \nreceiving U.S. funds to assist in a humanitarian emergency have in \nplace a code of conduct forbidding its employees from sexually abusing \nthe victims of the crisis. Finally, our bill urges the United Nations \nto strengthen its policies concerning sexual abuse and exploitation by \nUN personnel involved in UN peacekeeping operations. I am hopeful that \nSenators will join me in backing this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWine (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 560.

A bill to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration to establish and carry out traffic safety law \nenforcement and compliance campaigns, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the number one killer of those between the \nages of 4 and 34 in this country today is auto fatalities. If you look \nat those between the ages of 16 and 25, the figures are even more \nexaggerated. We all know that in this country over 42,000 Americans \nlose their lives every year in auto accidents. That figure stays fairly \nconstant. The last year we have figures for is 2003, and in that year, \n42,643 of our fellow citizens lost their lives.\n  In fact, in the next 12 minutes, to be precise, at least one person \nwill be killed in an automobile accident in this country, while nearly \nsix people will be injured in just the next 60 seconds.\n  This is a tragedy that we as a society are much too willing to \ntolerate. If a foreign enemy were doing this to us, we would not \ntolerate it. We would be up in arms. Someone said it is the equivalent \nof a 747 airplane going down every two days in this country. If that \nwere happening, of course, it would be on CNN; we would be demanding an \nexplanation. Yet, these auto fatalities that occur, hour-by-hour, day-\nby-day, just go on, and for some reason, we have become immune to it, \nhardened to it. They just continue.\n  I come to the Floor today to discuss five bills--five bills that my \nstaff and I have been working on for a few years now--five bills that I \nwill be introducing, but hope will be incorporated in the \ntransportation bill we will be considering in the next several weeks. \nThese bills are commonsense, practical ways to save lives. Each bill is \nbuilt on solid evidence of what will, in fact, make a difference. These \nare bills that will, in fact, save lives.\n  Last year, the Senate passed each of these bills as a part of the \nSAFE-TEA transportation bill. I want to thank Senators Inhofe, \nJeffords, Bond, Reid, and McCain for their assistance in making that \nhappen. Our former colleague Senator Hollings was also instrumental in \nclearing these bills. So, what I'm talking about today is a set of \nbills that has already enjoyed the support of the Senate, and I believe \nwe ought to pass each and every one of them again this year as a part \nof the transportation reauthorization. In particular, I look forward to \nworking with Senators Stevens, Lott, and Inouye on the Commerce \nCommittee portion of my transportation safety package.\n  I am thankful for the support and assistance of Senator Rockefeller \nas the lead co-sponsor on the first several bills--the vehicle safety \nbills--as well as Senator Lautenberg's leadership as my chief co-\nsponsor on the drunk driving prevention campaign bill. Both Senators \nare great leaders on highway safety, and I'm pleased to be working with \nthem this year in an effort to get these bills signed into law.\n  The first bill we call ``Stars on Cars.'' While its name is cute, its \nfocus is quite serious. When you go to buy a new car, there is a large \nlabel in the window detailing the price, features, gas mileage, and \nother information about the vehicle. This label is referred to in the \nauto industry as the ``Monroney Label'' after a former member of this \nbody, Senator Monroney from Oklahoma. We all know what the sticker \nlooks like.\n  But, what we may not know is that most of the content on that sticker \nis mandated by the Federal Government. The mileage per gallon has been \non there for a number of years. The Federal government says that your \ncity mileage has to be on there and your highway mileage has to be on \nthere. It has to tell you whether the vehicle has air-conditioning. It \nhas to tell you whether it has a stereo. It has to tell you a whole \nbunch of other stuff.\n  One piece of information is not on there--and that is the vehicle's \nsafety rating.\n  The funny thing is that in the vast majority of cases, you have \nalready paid to have the Federal Government--specifically the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)--spend millions of \ndollars to test that very car and others like it. In fact, the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration has put that information up on \nthe Internet. Nonetheless, the basic fact is that when you go in to buy \nthat car, that information is not available to you. It is not available \nto the American consumer in the one place where it would make a \ndifference--where you buy the car, at the dealership.\n  Doing this right wouldn't cost the taxpayers another dime. The car \ncompanies are already printing the labels. Under this legislation, we \nwould add a new section to the label titled ``Government Safety \nInformation.'' The new section would clearly lay out information from \neach of the government crash tests--frontal crash impact, side impact, \nand rollover resistance. For vehicles that haven't been tested yet, the \nlabel will say so. We would show the ratings pure and simple, as \ngraphical star ratings on the label, just like many automakers do in \ntheir commercials.\n\n  The bill requires that this be done in a manner that can be clearly \nunderstood by your average car buyer, with short explanations as to \nwhat each rating means.\n  What impact would this have? I happen to believe the consumer is \nbetter off with more information than less information on whatever we \nare talking about. The consumer ought to know what the Government does. \nThe consumer ought to know that type of information. The consumer would \nmake better choices. Consumers care about safety. They will make better \nchoices, and in all likelihood, they are going to choose safer vehicles \nand more lives will, in fact, be saved.\n  It just makes good common sense to do this. We have worked hard to \nfashion a bill that gets this life-saving information to consumers in a \nway that is sensitive to the concerns of automakers, as well as the \nNHTSA. We've reached out to a broad coalition to craft our bill for \n2005, and I look forward to working with interested parties to continue \nto improve and shape the language contained in it. In the end, this \nbill is my number one safety priority for passage into law this year.\n  The second bill we call ``Safe Kids and Cars.'' Cars, unfortunately, \nare involved in child deaths at unbelievable rates. According to NHTSA \ndata, automobile accidents happen to be the leading cause of death in \nthe United States for children age 4 and up, and are right among the \ntop causes for those ages 0 to 3.\n  More than cancer, more than homicide, more than fire, more than \ndrowning, more than anything else, auto accidents are the source of \nchild fatalities. We have a problem. And, while I congratulate auto \nmanufacturers, safety groups, and NHTSA for working hard on this issue, \nthere's more work to be done. Anything we can do to make a car safer \nfor our kids, we should be doing it. Complacency is not an option.\n  The focus of this bill is to improve data collection and vehicle \ntesting with regard to some specific dangers that small children face. \nNHTSA has done an excellent job in terms of working from solid data, \nand this is one area where unfortunately we just don't have enough data \nto move forward. Likewise, we need the tools to perform effective \nvehicle tests once we have those numbers, and my bill contains measures \nto see to it that we develop these tools.\n  In terms of testing, child-size dummies are an area where NHTSA needs \nto review its testing and look for areas where increased use of these \ndummies would lead to increased safety, or a better understanding of \nhow crash forces impact small children. My bill directs NHTSA to \nconduct a full review of test procedures and incorporate\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\nthese child dummies when and where suitable. We also ask the agency to \ngive a status update on the extremely important Hybrid-III 10-year-old \nchild test dummy.\n  The rest of the bill focuses on an emerging danger for small children \noften referred to as ``non-traffic, non-crash'' accident situations. \nThese are incidents in which interaction between an automobile and a \nchild leads to injury or death when the vehicle is not on the road, or \nwhere no actual crash has occurred. Instead, these are incidents that \nhappen in parked cars, driveways, parking lots, and other very common \nsituations. Unfortunately, these common situations can be deadly under \nthe wrong circumstances.\n  A prime example of ``non-traffic, non-crash'' dangers to small \nchildren has to do with dangerous power window switches. In many cases, \nchildren are left alone in a vehicle and manage to inadvertently \nactivate a power window switch--a situation which can lead to the \nwindow moving up and crushing a limb or other part of the child's body. \nSome children are killed almost instantaneously by the force of the \nrising window. These incidents are not terribly frequent, but they are \npreventable at almost no cost to consumers and manufacturers.\n  Power windows are an area where NHTSA has taken action since I last \nintroduced the child safety bill, and I want to pause to thank Dr. \nJeffrey Runge, NHTSA Administrator; Janette Fennel, President of the \nsafety advocacy group Kids and Cars; and several other groups for their \nwork to make the new power window safety rule possible. The new rule, \nwhich I helped announce in Columbus late last year, will lead to the \nelimination of unsafe power window switches--switches that can be \naccidentally tripped by children with ease--in every car and light \ntruck sold in the United States. It is clearly a step in the right \ndirection, and it will save lives.\n\n  Unsafe power window switches show one kind of ``non-traffic, non-\ncrash'' danger children face today. Were it not for a one-time study of \ndeath certificates by NHTSA, we would have no government data \nwhatsoever on how widespread this problem happens to be. We would not \nknow much about other types of ``non-traffic, non-crash'' dangers, such \nas backover incidents and heat exhaustion in closed vehicles. These are \nareas where there is a clear need for better data collection and \ntesting. My bill tackles each head-on.\n  The ``Safe Kids and Cars'' bill directs NHTSA to continue pushing \nforward on ``non-traffic, non-crash'' incidents by instituting, for the \nfirst time, regular collection of data on these kinds of accidents. \nWith time and some solid data, we may be able to tackle other kinds of \n``non-traffic, non-crash'' problems in the future. Understanding the \nproblem is the first step.\n  A third bill has to do with dangerous road intersections. Every State \nhas them. Most States, fortunately, rank these roads. They keep a list \nof the bad ones. But, amazingly, there are many States that keep this \ninformation secret and don't tell the public.\n  Again, citizens have a right to know this information. What would you \ndo with the information? As a parent, I might tell my 16-year-old not \nto go that way to the movie. At least I have the right to have that \ninformation and would be able to say go another way. It might take \nanother 10 minutes, but go that way. Don't go by that intersection. \nDon't go on that curvy road. State Departments of Transportation \nalready have that information.\n  Each State should provide that information to the public. They \nalready know it, and they should provide it. Policymakers need to know \nthat to make decisions about how to spend money in that state and what \nroads to fix.\n  I would like to briefly talk about a woman by the name of Sandy \nJohnson and her mother Jacqueline. On October 5, 2002, Sandy and \nJacqueline were killed in a car crash at a dangerous intersection near \nColumbus.\n  What they did not know as they drove into that intersection--and what \ncountless other area residents who used the roads that cross through it \ndid not know at the time--was that this particular intersection was \nknown at that time by the Ohio Department of Transportation to be a \nvery dangerous area. In fact, ODOT had indeed known that information \nfor quite some time. Perhaps if Sandy Johnson had known that she would \nhave taken a different route that day. We will never know.\n  Following the tragic death of his wife and his mother-in-law, Dean \nJohnson initiated a campaign to tackle the issue of dangerous roads and \ndangerous intersections, not just in Ohio, but across the country. He \nhas tried with varying results from state to state to get information \non dangerous roads and intersection locations out to the public so \ntragedies like the one involving his wife could be prevented.\n  As I have in the past, I would like to thank Dean Johnson for his \ndedication to this very important public safety issue and for the \nprogress he has made in my home State of Ohio and elsewhere in terms of \ngetting critical lifesaving information out to citizens through the \nSandy Johnson Foundation. His assistance has been an asset in crafting \nthis legislation, and I look forward to working with him in the future.\n  My bill requires that safety information be disclosed to the public \nas an eligibility requirement for a new Federal safety funding \nprogram--the Highway Safety Improvement Program. States seeking \nadditional Federal dollars for safety construction projects will have \nto take the quick and easy step of identifying their danger spots, \nranking them according to severity, and then disclosing them to the \npublic. I believe this is the least we can ask from States in exchange \nfor large chunks of federal aid.\n  In some cases, States would like to release the data but fear the \nlegal ramifications of doing so. My bill contains a fix for this that \nprovides the same kind of protection States already enjoy for other \ntypes of highway safety data. In other words, no legal harm could come \nto a State for releasing lists of dangerous locations under this bill.\n  Further, States need to find ways to get safety experts, law \nenforcement, engineers, transportation officials, and the general \npublic working together to identify and correct dangerous locations. \nI've borrowed language in my bill from last year's Senate-passed SAFE-\nTEA bill--excellent language drafted and passed by Senator Inhofe and \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee that creates incentives for \nStates to foster this kind of collaboration. Collaboration between \nthese entities is essential to finding quick, effective solutions to \nfatalities arising from dangerous intersections, as well as long \nstretches of roadway that account for high crash rates. I am including \nthe Committee's language on Highway Safety Improvement Programs in my \nbill because I strongly believe that it is a step in the right \ndirection.\n\n  The fourth bill I am introducing has to do with driver education. \nTeen driving is an area where fatality rates are extremely high and \nunfortunately where programs across the country are not getting the job \ndone.\n  Above average crash and fatality rates may be inevitable for teenage \ndrivers, but they can certainly be reduced substantially from present-\nday levels. The Federal Government cannot run driver education. It is \nclearly a State responsibility. But it can play a small, productive \nrole.\n  For decades, our attempt to address this problem--standard classroom-\nbased driver education--has been ineffective or worse, inspiring false \nconfidence in students and parents alike that graduates are ready to \ndrive safely. Fortunately, we've started to move in a new direction as \na nation, with 41 States adding innovative graduated driver licensing \n(GDL) laws to their ongoing driver education efforts. These new laws \nhave been proven to be effective in reducing accident and fatality \nrates. While my bill contains language to raise the bar on GDL laws and \nmake them more effective, its real emphasis is on finding a better way \nwith respect to driver education.\n  Revitalized driver education needs to be data-driven and cognizant of \nthe limitations associated with classroom-based instruction. It must \nutilize new ways of inculcating young drivers with the knowledge and \nskills they need to avoid unnecessary high-risk situations, \nparticularly in the first six months behind the wheel. Integration of \ndriver education with the graduated driver licensing process to \nmaximize the safety value of both programs also must be addressed.\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\n  Past failures in our Nation's history with regard to driver education \nare not a reason to abandon these programs. They are a reason to go \nback to the drawing board to re-invent more effective means of \npromoting safe driving.\n  A recent study by the National Institutes for Health sheds some light \non the problem. The study suggests that due to their unique brain \ndevelopment, risk tolerance, and other tendencies--teen drivers are \nnaturally inclined toward increased danger on the roads. Clearly, some \nmethods used in driver education today aren't getting the message \nthrough, and in some areas, the message may never get through \nindependent of who does the teaching.\n  NHTSA and its research partners must find ways to tailor the content \nand delivery of driver education so that it recognizes these realities \nand focuses on areas where novice drivers can learn the skills \nnecessary to be safer drivers. A NHTSA pilot program is currently under \nway with several states to test out updated ``best practices'' driver \neducation models--not mandates, not national standards, but just best \npractices.\n  My bill responds to the call for national leadership in driver \neducation and licensing made at a recent National Transportation Safety \nBoard forum by creating a Driver Education and Licensing Improvement \nProgram within NHTSA. The new Improvement Program will provide NHTSA \nwith the resources and time it needs to run the pilot program and then \nevaluate the results to see what works and what doesn't.\n  Once this pilot program has run its course, my bill provides a modest \namount of grant funding to supply states with the resources and \ntechnical expertise necessary to implement the ``best practices'' model \nin a way that fits their specific needs and circumstances. The grants \nwill be competitively awarded, and also will be available for \nfulfillment of several other state needs with regard to novice driver \neducation and licensing. This grant program is 100 percent voluntary, \nand my bill has been crafted carefully to ensure that the prerogatives \nof States are protected in every manner.\n  The areas ripe for improvement are numerous: instructor \ncertification, curriculum improvement, outreach to increase parental \ninvolvement, enforcement of graduated driver licensing laws, and \nfollow-up testing to ensure program effectiveness. These are just a few \nexamples. By creating a National Driver Education and Licensing \nImprovement Program within NHTSA, and tasking that program to come up \nwith best practices, we can help States interested in improving their \nprograms do so without having to expend the time and resources \nnecessary to ``re-invent the wheel'' on their own.\n\n  I have worked for over a year with NHTSA, the American Driver \nTraining and Safety Education Association, the Governors' Highway \nSafety Association, the American Motor Vehicle Administrators' \nAssociation, AAA, the Driving School Association of America, Advocates \nfor Auto and Highway Safety, and several other groups to come up with \nthe bill that will be introduced today. Its contents are a compromise \nthat reflects significant input from each of these fine organizations, \nand I believe we are now at a point where the road ahead toward safer, \nmore effective driver education and licensing programs is clear. The \ngoals set by this bill are clear, and the means to achieve them are \nprovided for in full. The time has come to take serious action on \ndriver education and licensing in this country.\n  Lastly, I'd like to introduce the Safe Intersections Act of 2005. \nThis bill would criminalize the unauthorized sale or use of mobile \ninfrared transmitters, also known as ``MIRTs.''\n  A MIRT is a remote control for changing traffic signals. These \ndevices have been used for years by ambulances, police cars, and fire \ntrucks, and maintenance crews, allowing them to reach emergencies \nfaster. As an ambulance approaches an intersection where the light is \nred, the driver engages the transmitter. That transmitter then sends a \nsignal to a receiver on the traffic light, which changes to green \nwithin a few seconds. This is a very useful tool when properly used in \nemergency situations.\n  In a 2002 survey, the U.S. Department of Transportation found that in \nthe top 78 metropolitan areas, there are 24,683 traffic lights equipped \nwith the sensors. In Ohio, there is a joint pilot project underway by \nthe Washington Township Fire Department and the Dublin Police \nDepartment to install these devices. Other areas in Ohio where they are \nin use include Mentor, Twinsburg, Willoughby, and Westerville. Here in \nthe District of Columbia, emergency services across the country, law \nenforcement officers, fire departments, and paramedics utilize this \ntechnology to make communities safer.\n  However, recently it has come to light that this technology may be \nsold to unauthorized individuals--individuals who want to use this \ntechnology to bypass red lights during their commute or during their \neveryday driving. MIRT was never intended for this use. MIRT \ntechnology--in the hands of unauthorized users--could result in traffic \nproblems, like gridlock, or even worse, accidents in which people are \ninjured or killed.\n  Let me quote from an ad that was posted on the Internet auction site, \neBay:\n  ``Tired of sitting at endless red lights? Frustrated by lights that \nturn from green to red too quickly, trapping you in traffic? The MIRT \nlight changer used by police and other emergency vehicles Change the \nTraffic Signal Red to Green [for] only $499.00. Traffic Signal Changing \nDevices--it's every motorist's fantasy to be able to make a red traffic \nlight turn green without so much as easing off the accelerator. The \nvery technology that has for years allowed fire trucks, ambulances, and \npolice cars to get to emergencies faster--a remote control that changes \ntraffic signals--is now much cheaper and potentially accessible.''\n  This ad demonstrates the extent to which the potential widespread \nsale and possession of MIRT technology by drivers would be a hazard to \npublic safety and must be stopped before it starts. The Congressional \nFire Service Institute, Ohio Fire Alliance, and several other \norganizations have come out in support of this measure. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to ensure that it becomes law.\n  The sixth bill I am introducing today is a bi-partisan bill aimed at \nreducing the number of drinking and driving deaths and injuries on our \nroads. Tragically, our Nation has experienced increases in alcohol-\nrelated traffic fatalities three of the past four years. In 2003--the \nlast year for which full statistics are available--17,013 Americans \ndied in alcohol-related incidents. This total represents 40 percent of \nthe 42,643 people killed in traffic incidents.\n  The bill I am introducing today along with Senator Lautenberg--the \nTraffic Safety Law Enforcement Campaign Act--would require states to \nconduct a combined media/law enforcement campaign aimed at reducing \ndrunk driving fatalities. Specifically, the law enforcement portion \nconsists of sobriety checkpoints in the District of Columbia and in the \n39 States that allow them and saturation patrols in those states that \ndo not. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that the sobriety \ncheckpoints proposed in the underlying bill may reduce alcohol related \ncrashes by as much as 20 percent. Law enforcement officials from across \nthe United States underscored this point in a recent conference \nsponsored by MADD, making high visibility enforcement campaigns a top \npriority. More than 75 percent of the public has indicated in NHTSA \npolls their support for sobriety checkpoints. In fact, NHTSA has \nconcluded that 62 percent of Americans want sobriety checkpoints to be \nused more often.\n  These six bills will go a long way. They are common sense. They will \nmake a difference. This is something I have been interested in for many \nyears, going back to my time in the Ohio Legislature 20 years ago when \nI introduced the drunk driving bill, and we were able to pass a tough \ndrunk driving bill in the Ohio Legislature. I worked for .08. It was \nvery controversial in the Senate, but we were able to pass .08. Senator \nLautenburg and I worked on that.\n  Anytime you lose 42,643 Americans every year, highway safety is \nsomething we all have to be concerned about.\n  I know the SAFE-TEA highway bill is not on the Floor yet, but I have \nseen it, and of course was pleased to support\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nit on the Floor last year. As passed by the Senate in 2004, the bill \ngoes farther than any highway bill regard to safety. This year's bill \nfrom the Environment and Public Works Committee will enable the same \ngreat progress on highway safety. I congratulate the authors.\n  In the weeks ahead, I look forward to working with the respective \ncommittees and outside organizations on the bills I have described \nabove as amendments to the 2005 SAFE-TEA bill. But, I want to make it \nvery clear that these bills and amendments are not in any way critical \nof the underlying bill. In fact, I hope they will be complementary and \nsimply add to a good product that is already a good product and will \nhelp to improve it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to continue State coverage of medicaid prescription \ndrug coverage to medicare dual eligible beneficiaries for 6 months \nwhile still allowing the medicare part D benefit to be implemented as \nscheduled; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, millions of seniors and disabled \nAmericans are facing a major disruption in their health care when the \nMedicare prescription drug law goes into effect on January 1, 2006. On \nthat singular date, 6.4 million dual eligibles--individuals who are \neligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid benefits--will lose their \nMedicaid prescription drug coverage regardless of whether they have \nobtained coverage through a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and \nregardless of whether their Part D plan's coverage is as broad as their \nState's Medicaid coverage. Such a short transition period leaves no \ntime to address the inevitable problems that will occur with a \ntransition of this magnitude.\n  Dual eligibles should have as smooth a transition as possible to \nMedicare prescription drug coverage. Unfortunately, a smooth transition \nis not what will happen under current law. The Medicare prescription \ndrug law only requires a six-week transition period for dual eligibles, \nfrom November 15, 2005, to January 1, 2006. This is the largest \ntransition of individuals from one insurance program to another, public \nor private, and it is unrealistic to believe that such a huge \ntransition can take place in the span of six weeks.\n  Moving a large number of seniors and people with disabilities to an \nentirely new system for prescription drug coverage is a major \nundertaking. Dual eligibles will require adequate outreach, education, \nand time to adjust to a change of this magnitude. The stakes are \nextremely high for this population. Over half are limited in activities \nof daily living. Many live alone or in nursing homes. And, in \ncomparison to other Medicare beneficiaries, dual eligibles are much \nmore likely to have heart disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, or \nAlzheimer's. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that we get this \ntransition right the first time.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken \nseveral steps to improve the transition of the dual eligibles from \nMedicaid to Medicare. However, I fear these steps do not go far enough. \nAutomatic enrollment does not guarantee that beneficiaries will know \nthat they have been enrolled in a new Medicare drug plan or know how to \naccess necessary prescription drugs using that drug plan. Once \nbeneficiaries are enrolled, they are likely to experience ongoing \nconfusion about covered drugs, authorized pharmacies, and the Medicare \nappeals process.\n  In its June 2004 report to Congress, the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission (MedPAC) suggested that even large, private employers need \nat least six months to transition their employees' drug coverage from \none pharmacy benefit manager to another. The two large employers that \nMedPAC studied had 25,000 and 75,000 employees, respectively. The \nstates and the federal government are taking on a far more complex task \nwith 6.4 million dual eligibles, and should have at least six months to \ntransition the duals to Medicare in order prevent major disruptions in \naccess to prescription drugs.\n  I am pleased to be joined today by my distinguished colleagues in the \nSenate, Senators Kennedy, Corzine, and Lautenberg, as well my \ndistinguished co-sponsor in the House of Representatives, Congressman \nTom Allen of Maine, in introducing the Medicare Dual Eligible \nPrescription Drug Coverage Act of 2005. This important legislation \nwould extend the dual eligible transition period to six months in order \nto achieve the best possible health outcomes for some of our Nation's \nmost vulnerable citizens. An extended timeframe would give states \nenough time to carry out comprehensive education and outreach \ninitiatives. It would also give seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities time to explore their options and gradually transition to \nMedicare Part D.\n\n  Specifically, the Medicare Dual Eligible Prescription Drug Coverage \nAct of 2005 would extend the availability of Medicaid prescription drug \ncoverage for six months while still allowing the Part D benefit to be \nimplemented as scheduled. Since states would be temporarily \nsupplementing Medicare Part D, they would be fully relieved of any \n``clawback'' responsibilities during the six-month transition. This \nlegislation would also provide dedicated resources\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\nfor education and outreach to the dual eligibles, including additional \nresources for State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs). \nFinally, the Medicare Dual Eligible Prescription Drug Coverage Act \nwould require CMS to share drug utilization data with state Medicaid \nprograms so that states can appropriately coordinate non-prescription \ndrug coverage for the duals.\n  This is an issue of fundamental fairness. The Medicare law provides \nMedicare beneficiaries who are not dually eligible for Medicaid six \nmonths to transition to Medicare prescription drug coverage. Dual \neligibles should not be treated any differently. Medicare's \nuniversality is something I fought hard for during the Medicare debate. \nI strongly believe low-income seniors and disabled individuals should \nnot be excluded from Medicare benefits because of their income levels. \nThe Medicare law should not merely support the principle of \nuniversality in statute. It must also support universality in fact, and \nthat means Medicare beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicaid \nmust also be given enough time to make a smooth transition to Medicare.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation. I ask that the full text of this bill, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 566\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Dual Eligible \n     Prescription Drug Coverage Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Individuals who are dually eligible for benefits under \n     the medicare program and full benefits under the medicaid \n     program--\n       (A) are among the most vulnerable populations in our \n     society; and\n       (B) require adequate outreach, education, and timing in \n     order to adjust to changes in our health care delivery \n     system.\n       (2) The transition of 6,400,000 dual eligibles from \n     prescription drug coverage under the medicaid program to \n     prescription drug coverage under part D of the medicare \n     program is the largest transition ever of individuals from \n     one insurance program to another.\n       (3) In its June 2004 report to Congress, the Medicare \n     Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) suggested that large, \n     private employers with 75,000 employees or less need at least \n     6 months to transition their employees' drug coverage from \n     one pharmacy benefit management company to another such \n     company. The States and the Federal Government are taking on \n     a far more complex task with 6,400,000 dual eligibles having \n     to make the transition described in paragraph (2).\n       (4) Timely access to prescription drugs leads to higher \n     quality of life and prevents avoidable emergency room visits, \n     hospitalizations, and premature nursing home placements.\n       (5) Since even a short-term gap in prescription drug \n     coverage could have serious health consequences for dual \n     eligibles, Congress must work to guarantee as smooth a \n     transition as possible for dual eligibles so that no dual \n     eligible is without prescription drug coverage even for one \n     day.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide immunity for nonprofit athletic \norganizations in lawsuits arising from claims of ordinary negligence \nrelating to the passage, adoption, or failure to adopt rules of play \nfor athletic competitions and practices; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President. Today I rise to introduce the Nonprofit \nAthletic Organization Protection Act of 2005. I am pleased to join with \nmy good friend and colleague, Representative Mark Souder, in \nintroducing this measure. This legislation is based on a bill that was \nintroduced in the last legislative session.\n  I believe that this legislation is very important to encouraging \nhealth promotion in our country. The United States has invested a \ntremendous number of resources in providing our children with the \nability to promote fitness through sports. In every town in America, \nyou will find boys and girls playing America's most popular sports: \nbaseball, soccer, football, and, of course, basketball. A recent study \nby the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association showed that in 2000 at \nleast 36 million American children played on at least one team sport. \nOf those 36 million, 26 million children between the ages of 6 and 17, \nplayed on an organized team in an organized league. A study by \nStatistical Research, Inc. for the Amateur Athletic Foundation and ESPN \nfound that 94 percent American children play some sport during the \nyear.\n  The ability for children to participate in sporting events provides \nour society many benefits that government cannot provide. Studies have \nshown that these benefits include betterment to a child's health, \nacademic performance, social development and safety. The most obvious \nbenefit of organized sports is physical fitness. The National Institute \nof Health Care Maintenance has identified physical activity such as \nsports as a key factor in the maintenance of a healthy body. Lack of \nphysical activity, along with unhealthy eating habits, has been \nidentified as the leading cause of obesity in children. The center \nnotes: ``Physical activity provides numerous mental and physical \nbenefits to health, including reduction in the risk of premature \nmortality, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, depression, \nand cancers.'' A Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research study \nindicated, ``Low fitness outranks fatness as a risk factor for \nmortality.'' By encouraging our children to participate in organized \nsports, we increase physical fitness and fight obesity.\n  A second benefit in the participation of organized sports is an \nincrease in academic performance. The National Institute of Health Care \nMaintenance has highlighted ``a recent large-scale analysis reported by \nthe California Department of Education [has shown] that the level of \nphysical fitness attained by students was directly related to their \nperformance on standardized achievement measures.'' When we encourage \nour children to participate in organized sports, we increase the \nability for them to achieve academically.\n  A third benefit for young people who participate in organized sports \nis that they learn positive social development. Organized sports teach \nvalues of teamwork, fair play, and friendly competition. Success in \norganized sports is also a vital self-esteem builder in many children.\n  These three benefits have been widely discussed on the floor of the \nSenate and we have acted to implement several programs designed to \nreduce obesity and increase fitness, educational standards and the \nsocial well-being of our children.\n  The fourth benefit to participation in organized youth sports, \nproviding a safe place to play, is a topic that has not received as \nmuch attention as the first three. Nonetheless, it is no less \nimportant. Fewer kids are simply going outside to play, due to the \nattraction of TV, video games, and the Internet, combined with parents' \nsafety concerns about letting children run around outside unsupervised. \nAs a result, organized sports teams are an increasingly important \nsource of safe physical activity in children. The American Academy of \nPediatrics has stated, ``In contrast to unstructured or free play, \nparticipation in organized sports provides a greater opportunity to \ndevelop rules specifically designed for health and safety.''\n  One primary reason why organized sports provide such an opportunity \nfor safe play is that non-profit, volunteer organizations establish \nrules to provide a safe place to play. These organizations are made up \nof professional people who are in the business of providing children a \nfun and safe avenue for athletic exercise. Organizations like the Boys \nand Girls Club, the National Council of Youth Sports, the National \nFederation of State High School Associations and others exist largely \nto establish rules in order to minimize the risk of injury our children \nface while participating in sports. No matter how well these \norganizations perform their work, however, boys and girls will be \ninjured.\n  Over the last several years, more and more of these rule making \nbodies have become targets for lawsuits seeking to prove that the rule \nmaker was negligent in making the rules of play. These lawsuits claim \nthat had a different rule been in place, the injury would not have \nhappened. Indeed, these suits place rule makers into a Catch-22. A \nchild can be injured in almost any situation no matter how a rule is \nwritten. The result has been to have more and more lawsuits.\n  As a consequence, the insurance premiums of these organizations have \nrisen dramatically over the past several years. In his testimony before \nthe House Judiciary Committee last year, Robert Kanaby the Executive \nDirector of the National Federation of State High School Associations \ntestified that:\n  ``Over the last three years, the annual liability insurance premiums \nfor the National High School Federation have increased three-fold to \nabout $1,000,000. We have been advised by experts that given our claims \nexperience and the reluctance of insurers to offer such coverage to an \norganization `serving 7,000,000 potential claimants,' the premiums will \nlikely increase significantly in years to come. Since we operate on a \ntotal budget of about $9,000,000, such an increase would be, to put it \nmildly, problematical.''\n  The costs have increased to the point where it is possible that these \norganizations will cease from providing age appropriate rules and the \nsafety of youth sports will decline.\n  Because of this problem, I join, once again, with Representative Mark \nSouder in introducing the Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection \nAct of 2005. This legislation will eliminate lawsuits based on claims \nthat a non-profit rulemaking body is liable for the physical injury \nwhen the rules was made by a properly licensed rulemaking body that has \nacted within the scope of its authority. Lawsuits may be maintained if \nthe rule maker was grossly negligent or engaged in criminal or reckless \nmisconduct. This reasonable legislation will help sports rule makers to \ndo their job. If we do not pass this legislation, it is likely that \nrule makers will eventually close their doors since they will be unable \nto afford the insurance needed to provide a safe sporting environment.\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\n  No one who has participated in the debate surrounding this problem \nhas disagreed that the current lawsuit culture needs reform. Instead, \nconcerns have arisen that the remedy was overly broad preventing \nlawsuits against rule makers on other issue.\n  To remedy these concerns, the legislation introduced today contains a \nprovision that explicitly says that lawsuits involving ``antitrust, \nlabor, environmental, defamation, tortuous interference of contract law \nor civil rights law, or any other federal, state, or local law \nproviding protection from discrimination'' are not barred by this bill. \nThis provision was worked out between the civil rights groups, \nincluding the National Women's Law Center and the National Federation \nof State High School Associations, in an effort to alleviate this \nconcern.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I am a runner. I enjoy the activity \nand the positive effect that running and athletics have played in my \nlife. I would hope that my nine grandchildren will be able to have an \nopportunity to participate in organized sports and that lawsuits \nagainst rule makers for allegedly faulty rules will not prevent these \norganizations from functioning properly. I look forward to the \nconsideration and passage of the Nonprofit Athletic Organization \nProtection Act of 2005 during the 109th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Corzine, \n        and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 569. A bill to improve the health of women through the \nestablishment of Offices of Women's Health within the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, on International Women's Day, \nto introduce the Women's Health Office Act with my colleague, Senator \nBarbara Mikulski.\n  Historically, women's health care needs have been ignored or poorly \nunderstood, and women have been systematically excluded from important \nhealth research. We heard just this week about a landmark example. One \nfederally-funded study examined the ability of aspirin to prevent heart \nattacks in 20,000 medical doctors, all of whom were men, despite the \nfact that heart disease is the leading cause of death among women. When \na benefit was found in men, many physicians assumed that the same \nprotective effect applied to women. Just this week, after research on \nwomen was finally conducted, we learned that the effect of aspirin on \nwomen appear to be quite different. We are simply not protected in the \nsame way men are protected. It is tragic that so much of our medicine \nhas been based on such assumptions.\n  Today we recognize that both genders should benefit equally from \nmedical research and health care services. Yet equity does not yet \nexist in health care, and we have a long way to go. Knowledge about \ndifferences in women--in symptoms of disease, and in appropriate \nmeasures for prevention and treatment--frequently lags far behind our \nknowledge of men's health.\n  We must also recognize that some diseases--such as ovarian cancer and \nendometriosis--affect only women. Other diseases affect women \ndisproportionately--such as osteoporosis. We also see differences in \nhealth care access between men and women. These simply must be \nreflected in our health policy.\n  It is for these reasons that we are again introducing the Women's \nHealth Office Act. This legislation provides permanent authorization \nfor offices of women's health in five federal agencies: the Department \nof Health and Human Services; the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the Health \nResources and Services Administration; and the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Currently only two women's health offices in the \nFederal Government have statutory authorization; the Office of Research \non Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health and the Office \nfor Women's Services within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration.\n  With some offices established, but not authorized, the needs of women \ncould be compromised without the consent of Congress. We must create \nstatutory authority for these offices, to ensure that health policy \nflows from fact, not assumption. Improving the health of American women \nrequires a far greater understanding of women's health needs and \nconditions, and ongoing evaluation in the areas of research, education, \nprevention, treatment and the delivery of services--and this bill will \nensure that.\n  I must also note today, on International Women's Day, that of all the \ndisease threats to women, few rival the threat of AIDS. Increasingly, \nthe face of the individual with HIV-infection is a woman's. Tragically, \nit is often the woman's husband who places her at risk, yet in many \nsocieties, the status of women makes her use of prevention difficult. \nOne promising way to counter the risk of HIV infection is the \ndevelopment of an effective microbicide--a typical product which women \ncould use to reduce their risk of contracting HIV. A number of \nscientists are working to develop such a product. If successful, this \ncould prevent millions of infections, and would be a practical means of \nprevention in much of the world where options for women are so few. For \nthis reason I again join Senator Corzine today in introducing the \nMicrobicides Development Act. This legislation will establish a \ncoordination of this development at the NIH to reduce the toll of AIDS. \nJust today we read of a promising new microbicide which appears to show \ngreat promise. We must ensure that the promise of microbicides become \nreality for millions of women. This research is spread over multiple \nInstitutes at NIH, and definitely will benefit from the coordination \nand integration which this Act will instill.\n  Today, on a day when we recognize both the achievements and \ncontributions of women, it is fitting, that we provide the support and \nopportunity to facilitate the continued progress of women, I call on my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, which will ensure \nbetter health for our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, both here \nand abroad.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise to introduce the Women's Health Office Act with \nmy colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe. The Women's Health Office Act \nauthorizes and strengthens women's health offices or officers at \nFederal health agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services. \nThis legislation will make sure that men and women get equal benefit \nfrom Federal investments in medical research and health care services.\n  Today, doctors, scientists, Members of Congress, and the American \npublic know that women and men have different bodies and different \nhealth care needs. Diseases like ovarian cancer and endometriosis \naffect only women. Women are four times more likely to develop \nosteoporosis than men and according to some estimates, half of all \nwomen over 50 will fracture a bone because of osteoporosis in her \nlifetime.\n  Despite these differences, men's health needs have set the standard \nfor our health care system and our health care research agenda. Women \nhave been systematically excluded from medical research because \ndecision-makers said that our hormone cycles complicated the results. \nOne study on heart disease risk factors was conducted on 13,000 men--\nand not one women. But the results of studies like these were applied \nto both men and women. This neglect puts women's health and lives at \nrisk.\n  That's why my colleagues and I took action. More than a decade ago, I \nworked with Olympia Snowe, Ted Kennedy, Tom Harkin, and other women in \nthe House to get an Office of Research on Women's Health at the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH. In 1993, I worked with these same \nwomen and Galahads in Congress to make sure that the women's health \noffice would stay at NIH by putting it into law.\n  This office at NIH has made a real difference in how women are \ntreated for certain illnesses. We now know that men and women often \nhave different symptoms before a heart attack. Women's symptoms are \nmore subtle, like nausea and back pain. Knowing these symptoms means \nwomen can get to the hospital sooner and can be treated earlier. That's \nturning women's health research into life-saving information.\n  I am proud that there are now women's health offices or officers at \nnearly every federal health agency at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. Like the one at NIH, women's\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\nhealth offices mean that women's health needs are always at the table. \nThese offices at the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration, HRSA, make sure women are included in clinical \ndrug trials, reach out to low-income and minority women to make sure \nthey are getting vaccines and cancer screenings, and work with health \ncare providers to put research on women's health into practice. Recent \nquestions about the risks and benefits of mammography and hormone \nreplacement therapy remind us that women's health offices are as \nimportant as ever.\n  Right now, many of these offices--and the important work they do--\ncould be eliminated or cut back without the consent of Congress. That \nis why this bill is so important. This bill would put women's health \noffices into our nation's lawbooks.\n  The Women's Health Office Act does more than protect the status quo. \nIt keeps us moving forward on women's health. It gives women's health \noffices a clear, consistent framework throughout the department. By \nwriting them into law, it gives women's health offices the stature they \nneed to be strong, effective advocates for women's health within the \nFederal Government. This legislation coordinates women's health \nactivities within each agency, to identify needs and set goals. The \nWomen's Health Office Act centralizes overall coordination throughout \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, to clarify lines of \naccountability and chart a clear course on women's health. Finally, it \nauthorizes funding for these women's health offices or officers, to \nmake sure that we put our nation's priorities in the federal checkbook \nas well as the Federal lawbooks.\n  I would like to thank Senator Olympia Snowe for leading the way on \nthis important legislation. As Dean of the Senate women, I will \ncontinue to fight to get this bill signed into law and to make progress \nto improve the health of American women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2274-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2274-S2275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 73--HONORING THE LIFE OF ENRIQUE ``KIKI'' CAMARENA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \ncommemorate the outstanding life and tragic but courageous death of \nEnrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, a Special Agent of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration.\n  Enrique grew from a boy in the small town of Mexicali in Baja \nCalifornia, Mexico to a man as a United States Marine. During his two \nyear tour as a Legal Clerk with the Marine Corps in San Diego, Enrique \nreceived the National Defense Service Medal. It was during this time \nthat Enrique first demonstrated his dedication to the United States.\n  Following his honorable discharge from the Marine Corps in 1970, \nEnrique demonstrated his courage as a fireman for the City of Calexico \nwhile demonstrating his intelligence as a student at Imperial Valley \nCollege, where he earned an Associates degree in 1972. It was also in \n1970 that Enrique Camarena first showed his interest in law enforcement \nby joining the Calexico, CA Police Department.

Each award recognized Enrique's dedication to the fight against \ndrug abuse and determination to scourge our country of illegal drugs.\n  His frustration with the drug trade was perhaps most evident by a \nstatement that would later prove to be prophetic: He asked, ``What's \ngonna have to happen? Does somebody have to die before anything is \ndone? Is somebody going to have to get killed?''\n  On Thursday, February 7, 1985, at 2:00 p.m., Special Agent Camarena \nleft the American Consulate in Guadalajara to meet his wife for lunch. \nHaving come dangerously close to unlocking a multi-billion drug \npipeline, Enrique was awaiting a reassignment, which was just three \nweeks away. Enrique never met his wife for lunch that day and he never \nreceived his reassignment.\n  As he neared his truck that afternoon, five men approached him and \nshoved him into a car. By February 10, DEA Administrator Francis \n``Bud'' Mullen had flown to Guadalajara and to help begin the search \nfor Enrique.\n  On March 5, Enrique's body was found on a ranch outside of the town \nof Zamora, Mexico, approximately 60 miles outside of Guadalajara. \nAutopsy reports indicated that Special Agent Camarena had been tortured \nand beaten.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \ncommemorate the outstanding life and tragic but courageous death of \nEnrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, a Special Agent of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration.\n  Enrique grew from a boy in the small town of Mexicali in Baja \nCalifornia, Mexico to a man as a United States Marine. During his two \nyear tour as a Legal Clerk with the Marine Corps in San Diego, Enrique \nreceived the National Defense Service Medal. It was during this time \nthat Enrique first demonstrated his dedication to the United States.\n  Following his honorable discharge from the Marine Corps in 1970, \nEnrique demonstrated his courage as a fireman for the City of Calexico \nwhile demonstrating his intelligence as a student at Imperial Valley \nCollege, where he earned an Associates degree in 1972. It was also in \n1970 that Enrique Camarena first showed his interest in law enforcement \nby joining the Calexico, CA Police Department. In May 1973, he began \nwhat would be his life-long fight against drug abuse when he was \nassigned to El Centro, CA, where he served for 13 months as a Narcotics \nInvestigator for Imperial County.\n  Those 13 months as a Narcotics Investigator proved to be a life-\naltering time for Enrique.

Res. 74\n\n       Whereas all over the world, women are contributing to the \n     growth of economies, participating in the world of diplomacy \n     and politics, and improving the quality of the lives of their \n     families, communities, and nations;\n       Whereas discrimination continues to deny women full \n     political and economic equality and is often the basis for \n     violations of women's basic human rights;\n       Whereas worldwide, the lives and health of women and girls \n     continue to be endangered by violence that is directed at \n     them simply because they are female;\n       Whereas worldwide, violence against women includes rape, \n     genital mutilation, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating \n     violence, honor killings, human trafficking, dowry-related \n     violence, female infanticide, sex-selection abortion, forced \n     pregnancy, forced sterilization, and forced abortion;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization asserts that domestic \n     violence causes more deaths and disability among women aged \n     15 to 44 than cancer, malaria, traffic accidents, and war;\n       Whereas worldwide, 130,000,000 girls and young women have \n     been subjected to female genital mutilation;\n       Whereas worldwide, at least 1 in 3 females has been beaten \n     or sexually abused in her lifetime;\n       Whereas worldwide, 20 to 50 percent of women experience \n     some degree of domestic violence during marriage;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 women in the United States have been raped \n     or physically assaulted by an intimate partner at some point \n     in their lives;\n       Whereas somewhere in the United States, a woman is \n     battered, usually by her partner, every 15 seconds;\n       Whereas more than 3 women are murdered by their husbands or \n     boyfriends in the United States every day;\n       Whereas battering is the leading cause of injury to women \n     aged 15 to 44 in the United States;\n       Whereas it is estimated that 1 in 5 adolescent girls in the \n     United States becomes a victim of physical or sexual abuse, \n     or both, in a dating relationship;\n       Whereas worldwide, women account for \\1/2\\ of all cases of \n     HIV/AIDS, and in Africa, young women are 3 times more likely \n     to contract the virus than men;\n       Whereas worldwide, sexual violence, including marital rape, \n     has been denounced as a major cause of the rapid spread of \n     HIV/AIDS among women;\n       Whereas between 75 and 80 percent of the world's millions \n     of refugees are women and children;\n       Whereas illegal trafficking worldwide for forced labor, \n     domestic servitude, and sexual exploitation involves between \n     1,000,000 and 2,000,000 women and children each year, of whom \n     approximately 50,000 are transported to the United States;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of the world's nearly 1,000,000,000 \n     illiterate individuals are women;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of the children denied primary education are \n     girls;\n       Whereas these educational failures have serious \n     consequences for the global economy and the United States \n     national security, as well as for tens of millions of girls \n     who are losing the chance to discover their worth and \n     importance as global citizens;\n       Whereas girls who are educated are more likely to have \n     healthy and stable families, lower mortality rates, higher \n     nutrition levels, and delayed sexual activity, and have less \n     chance of contracting HIV/AIDS or having unwanted \n     pregnancies;\n       Whereas in most countries, women work approximately 2 times \n     more unpaid time than men do;\n       Whereas women work \\2/3\\ of the world's working hours and \n     produce \\1/2\\ of the world's food, yet earn only 10 percent \n     of the world's income and own less than 1 percent of the \n     world's property;\n       Whereas 3 in 10 households are maintained by women with no \n     husband present;\n       Whereas rural women produce more than 55 percent of all \n     food grown in developing countries;\n       Whereas it is estimated that women and girls make up more \n     than 70 percent of the poorest people in the world;\n       Whereas worldwide, women earn less, own less property, and \n     have less access to education, employment, and health care \n     than do men;\n       Whereas microcredit is a stunningly simple, inexpensive \n     tool that can forever alter the economic landscape for the \n     better;\n       Whereas women now make up 80 percent of the world's \n     70,000,000 microcredit borrowers, and from India to Nicaragua \n     to South Africa to Costa Rica, women are proving that small \n     loans can transform individual lives, families, and entire \n     communities;\n       Whereas nations should take steps to ensure the full \n     participation and representation of women in political \n     conferences, committees, plenaries, and parliaments;\n       Whereas social investment, particularly investments in \n     women and girls, should be an integral part of foreign \n     policy;\n       Whereas despite extraordinary advances, women still \n     comprise the majority of the world's poor, illiterate, and \n     uneducated, remain under-compensated for the work they do, \n     still do not have adequate access to medical care in too many \n     countries, are under-represented in leadership positions in \n     government and business, and continue to be targeted for \n     unspeakable atrocities in war and conflict;\n       Whereas March 8 has become known as International Women's \n     Day for the last century, and is a day on which people, who \n     are often divided by ethnicity, language, culture, and \n     income, come together to celebrate a common struggle for \n     women's equality, justice, and peace;\n       Whereas the dedication and successes of those working all \n     over the world to end violence against women and girls and \n     fighting for equality should be recognized; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States should be \n     encouraged to participate in International Women's Day: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 8, 2005, as International Women's Day;\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to--\n       (A) improve women's access to quality health care, \n     including HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment;\n       (B) end and prevent violence against women, including the \n     trafficking of women and girls worldwide, and ensure that the \n     criminals who engage in these activities are brought to \n     justice;\n       (C) end discrimination and increase the participation of \n     women in decisionmaking positions in government and the \n     private sector;\n       (D) extend full economic opportunities to women, including \n     access to microfinance and microenterprise; and\n       (E) strengthen the role of women as agents of peace because \n     women are among the best emissaries for easing religious, \n     racial, and ethnic tensions, crossing cultural divides, and \n     reducing violence in areas of war and conflict; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``International Women's Day'' with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

Res. 75\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821, ``it is in your land that liberty \n     has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we shall \n     imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we \n     succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete that \n     presented the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas the price for Greece in holding our common values \n     in their region was high, as hundreds of thousands of \n     civilians were killed in Greece during the World War II \n     period;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was 1 of only \n     3 nations in the world, beyond the former British Empire, \n     that was allied with the United States in every major \n     international conflict;\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\n       Whereas President George W.

[and] as the 21st Century dawns, Greece \n     and America once again stand united; this time in the fight \n     against terrorism. The United States deeply appreciates the \n     role Greece is playing in the war against terror. . . . \n     America and Greece are strong allies, and we're strategic \n     partners.'';\n       Whereas Greece is a stabilizing force by virtue of its \n     political and economic power in the volatile Balkan region \n     and is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe;\n       Whereas Greece, through excellent work and cooperation with \n     United States and international law enforcement agencies, \n     arrested and convicted key members of the November 17 \n     terrorist organization;\n       Whereas President Bush stated that Greece's successful \n     ``law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization \n     [November 17] responsible for three decades of terrorist \n     attacks underscore the important contributions Greece is \n     making to the global war on terrorism'';\n       Whereas Greece was extraordinarily responsive to United \n     States requests during the war with Iraq, as Greece \n     immediately granted unlimited access to its airspace and the \n     base in Souda Bay, and many United States ships delivering \n     troops, cargo, and supplies to Iraq were refueled in Greece;\n       Whereas the Olympic Games came home in August 2004 to \n     Athens, Greece, the land of their ancient birthplace 2,500 \n     years ago and the city of their modern revival in 1896;\n       Whereas Greece received world-wide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling of over 14,000 athletes from 202 \n     countries and over 2,000,000 spectators and journalists and \n     did so efficiently, securely, and with its famous Greek \n     hospitality;\n       Whereas the unprecedented Olympic security effort in Greece \n     for the first post-9/11 Olympics included a record-setting \n     expenditure of over $1,390,000,000 and assignment of over \n     70,000 security personnel, as well as the utilization of an \n     8-country Olympic Security Advisory Group which included the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Greece, geographically located in a region where \n     Christianity meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent \n     relations with Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas Greece has had extraordinary success in recent \n     years in furthering cross-cultural understanding and reducing \n     tensions between Greece and Turkey;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our 2 nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 2005, marks the 184th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution that freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which our 2 great nations were born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 2005, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2276-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 15--ENCOURAGING ALL AMERICANS TO INCREASE \nTHEIR CHARITABLE GIVING, WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING THE ANNUAL AMOUNT \n         OF CHARITABLE GIVING IN THE UNITED STATES BY 1 PERCENT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \nencourages all Americans to increase their charitable giving with the \ngoal of increasing charitable giving in the United States by 1 percent.\n  I am proud to be a citizen of such a charitable nation. However, \nindividual charitable giving rates among Americans have stagnated over \nthe past 50 years. On average, Americans donate 2 percent of their \naggregate income to charitable causes. A 1-percent increase to 3 \npercent could generate up to $90 billion annually. Further, a 1-percent \nincrease in charitable giving has the potential to reduce the Federal \ndeficit, reduce the call for tax increases, and provide our national \nhealth, education, and welfare programs with much needed assistance in \nperforming their duties.\n  I also realize the Government's role to make it easier for Americans \nto be charitable. As legislators, we must provide incentives for \ncharitable giving, opportunities for low-income families to build \nindividual assets, and support faith-based and secular organizations as \nthey provide charitable social services. I remain committed to \npromoting increased opportunities for the less fortunate to obtain help \nthrough faith-based and community organizations.\n  There are people all around the country waiting to give more to \ncharity--they just need a little push. The CARE Act gives that in the \nform of a series of targeted tax incentives. The bill provides $2 \nbillion in food-donation incentives that would allow farmers, \nrestaurants and corporations to give more of their surplus food to \nlocal food banks and soup kitchens. America's Second Harvest estimates \nthis provision translates into an additional 878 million meals for the \nhungry over the next 10 years.\n  In addition, the CARE Act removes the tax penalties that are \npreventing larger-dollar donors from rolling over their IRA account \nfunds to assist a wide range of charities, including foundations, \ncolleges and universities. If the CARE Act passes, individuals will be \nable to give 30 percent more in tax-free IRA contributions than would \notherwise be possible.\n  The spirit of giving is part of what makes America great. I submit \nthis resolution to remind us all that more can be done to assist the \nneedy. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2276-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 130.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 74, submitted earlier \ntoday by Senators Biden, Clinton, Lugar, Kohl, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 74) designating March 8, 2005, as \n     ``International Women's Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Today, March 8, is International Women's Day. This day \nprovides a special opportunity for us to reflect on the status of women \nthroughout the world and to think about what we can do to improve the \nhealth and well-being of some of the world's most vulnerable women.\n  Today, I would like us to think about Uganda, where I sat on a porch \nwith mothers who were HIV-positive. These mothers were gathering \nscrapbooks, photos, notes, and little memorabilia of their lives to \nleave to their children. Their children, playing in the yard, had \nalready lost one parent, and were now about to lose a second.\n  I would like us to think about South Africa, where I saw women \nwaiting for hours on wooden benches, inside a clinic made from old rail \ncars, in the hope that they might be sick enough to qualify for \nantiretroviral treatment for HIV.\n  And, I would like us to think about Bangladesh, where I saw women who \nhad known nothing but poverty, but who, thanks to a tiny loan, had \nbecome entrepreneurs. They were offering cell phone service to their \nvillages, made possible by their ownership of a single, solar-powered \ncell phone.\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\n  The stories of women like these from around the world are often \nstories of great sadness, but also stories of hope. The health and \neconomic well-being of these women and their families are deeply \nintertwined. If we can improve one, we may be able to improve the other \nas well.\n  The connection between health and economic well-being is clearly \napparent in two areas of international assistance: fighting HIV/AIDS, \nand providing family planning.\n  Women are now the face of AIDS in many parts of the world. In sub-\nSaharan Africa, 57 percent of those infected with HIV are women. \nYounger women are at particular risk. They are three times more likely \nthan young men to be infected. This striking statistic, according to \nStephen Lewis, the United Nations Secretary General's Special Envoy for \nHIV/AIDS in Africa, ``is unprecedented in the history of the pandemic \nand . . . perhaps the most ominous warning of what is yet to come.''\n  HIV/AIDS exploits and widens the inequities that make women more \nvulnerable. Women may have fewer economic opportunities, making them \ndependent on others for simple survival. When a family's resources are \nlimited, any available money may go first for care and treatment for \nthe men. Where women do not have rights to property, a husband's death \ncan leave a widow and her children with literally nothing except \ninfection with HIV. Women are also too often at risk for sexual \nviolence and coercion.\n  The list of problems is long. It is clear that to win the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS, we must address the many and wide-ranging impacts of \nthe disease on women. Our strategies to fight HIV/AIDS should include \napproaches such as microcredit programs that provide women with small \nloans. These loans, often as small as $10, enable women to start \nbusinesses to sustain themselves and their families. We should also \nsupport efforts to keep girls in school, using education's \neffectiveness as a ``social vaccine'' against HIV infection. We should \nwork to make prevention, care, and treatment accessible to women. We \nmust address the problem of gender-based violence and intimidation.\n  And, as part of our strategy, we should also support promising women-\ncentered technologies such as microbicides. This is why I am a \ncosponsor of the Microbicides Development Act being introduced today. \nThis bill calls on the Federal Government to accelerate and coordinate \nresearch and development of microbicides.\n  Family planning is another area that can have important benefits for \nwomen's health and economic well being. The World Bank has called \nfamily planning ``a development success story'' because it contributes \nso greatly not just to women's health and opportunities, but also to \nthe social and economic development of entire societies. Family \nplanning improves economic and educational opportunities for women and \ntheir families. It also has a direct effect on health.\n  Worldwide, over half a million women die each year from pregnancy or \ndelivery. Family planning makes pregnancy safer by reducing unintended \npregnancies and by allowing couples to space births, giving mothers' \nbodies more time to recover between pregnancies. Spacing births 3 to 5 \nyears apart can prevent the deaths of women and children. It decreases \na mother's risk of dying from childbirth by 2.5 times, and also \ndecreases by 2.5 times the baby's risk of dying before the age of five.\n  Unfortunately, many couples still lack access to family planning \ncare. Worldwide, an estimated 200 million women want to delay the birth \nof their next child or stop childbearing altogether, but lack access to \neffective contraceptive methods.\n  Fully funding this unmet need for contraceptives could reduce \nabortions by 22 million, infant deaths by 1.4 million, and pregnancy-\nrelated deaths by 142,000. Improving access to family planning care is \nalso a wise economic investment. Studies from Mexico, Thailand, Egypt, \nand Vietnam have found that every dollar spent on family planning saves \n$8 to $31 in government expenditures.\n  The United States has been a leading supporter of family planning \nprograms since the 1960s. For family planning's many benefits to \nwomen's health and lives, I hope we will continue our leadership in \nthis area.\n  Today, on International Women's Day, we have an opportunity to \nrecognize the progress that has been made in advancing the health and \neconomic well-being of women. We also have an obligation to renew our \ncommitment to providing the care that is needed to help some of the \nworld's most vulnerable women and their families.\n  When we face challenges, we must not be deterred. When we experience \nsuccess, we ought not to become complacent. Winston Churchill reminds \nus, ``Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to \ncontinue that counts.'' The women that I have met in Uganda, South \nAfrica, and Bangladesh have all had the courage to continue. We too \nmust continue our efforts to improve the health and lives of women \naround the world.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today we commemorate International \nWomen's Day. Discussions that will take place this week in celebration \nof International Women's Day allow women leaders, policy makers and \nexperts from governments around the world to take stock of our progress \nand recommend concrete steps for future action.\n  I commend U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan for using his platform at \nthe United Nations to advocate on behalf of women's rights. More than \nmost, the Secretary General knows firsthand that global progress \ndepends on securing the rights of women worldwide. I am grateful to him \nfor raising his voice on behalf of women and for the pivotal role the \nU.N. continues to play in advancing women's rights on every continent.\n  About 2 weeks ago, I had the privilege of traveling to Iraq, \nAfghanistan and Pakistan with some of my colleagues on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I visited U.S. troops and had a chance to see the \nextraordinary work these dedicated men and women are doing under \nextremely trying circumstances.\n  I also spent a few very valuable moments with Iraqi and Afghan women, \njust as I had done on a previous visit to Iraq and Afghanistan during \nThanksgiving in 2003. What I saw, and what I heard from these women, \nwas both inspiring and unnerving. In many ways the experiences of Iraqi \nwomen, and their counterparts in Afghanistan, underscore the \nopportunities unfolding for women all over the globe. But they also \nrepresent an enduring truth--that no matter how far we have come and \nhow much hope is on the horizon, women must continue to work, struggle, \nand fight for every ounce of progress we make. Even then there are no \nguarantees.\n  Ten years ago, women from 189 countries came together for the United \nNations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. It was a gathering \nthat lasted only a few days, but it changed the world.\n  We were women of all colors, races, ethnicities, languages, and \nreligious backgrounds. Yet we knew that, as women, we shared common \naspirations and dreams, as well as concerns and worries about the \nfutures of our families and our communities.\n  In Beijing, after years, decades, indeed centuries, we broke our \nsilence. Together we spoke up and we spoke out.\n  We spoke out on behalf of women and their daughters, mothers and \nsisters; women who were underpaid, under-educated and undervalued; \nwomen who were deprived of the right to go to school, earn a living, \nsee a doctor, own property, get a loan, cast a vote or run for office; \nwomen who were persecuted, abused, violated, even killed because there \nwere no laws to protect them or no enforcement of the laws that were \nsupposed to protect them.\n  Although some governments and officials doubted that a United Nations \nconference on women would have an impact, what transpired in Beijing \nwas the beginning of a global movement. It was a global movement \nfocusing attention on the issues that matter most in the lives of women \nand their families: access to education, health care, jobs and credit, \nand the opportunity to enjoy the full range of political, legal and \nhuman rights.\n  We called on governments around the world to promote and protect \nwomen's rights unequivocally and to act on the ideal that ``women's \nrights are human\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nrights and human rights are women's rights.''\n  We made our case that global progress depends on the progress of \nwomen; that democratic institutions cannot thrive and survive without \nthe participation of women; that market economies cannot grow and \nprosper without the inclusion of women; that societies are not truly \nfree and just without legal protections and rights for women; that a \nnation cannot advance into the 21st century and in the Information Age \nwithout educated, literate women.\n  Today, as we face new and daunting enemies--from stateless terrorism \nto the global pandemic of HIV/AIDS to the scourge of human \ntrafficking--we are learning that our Nation and our world cannot be \nsecure or at peace if women are denied the right to fulfill their God-\ngiven potential at home, at school, at work, at the ballot box, in the \ncourthouse and in the board room.\n  The Beijing Conference got us going. Governments, working with NGOs, \nused the Beijing Platform for Action as a road map. In the 10 years \nsince, many have taken significant steps in the right direction.\n  From Mongolia to Indonesia to Tajikistan, we are seeing more \nequitable laws protecting women from discrimination, abuse and \nviolence. From Gambia to Chile more women are getting elected or \nappointed to leadership roles in government. Our global movement is \nhaving a profound impact around the world.\n  Turkey recently passed sweeping legislative reforms to protect the \nrights of women with regard to rape and honor killings.\n  In Ethiopia, a center funded by the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment opened last summer to offer medical assistance and \ncounseling to women and girls who are victims of human trafficking.\n  Morocco instituted new family law that gives women equal rights to \nmake decisions about marriage, divorce custody and alimony.\n  In Afghanistan, for the first time, a woman, Dr. Masooda Jalal, ran \nfor the presidency. And Habiba Sarobi was just appointed governor of \none of Afghanistan's central provinces. She is the first woman to hold \na provincial government post in Afghanistan.\n  In Mexico, Amalia Garcia became the third women ever to be elected \ngovernor of a state in her country.\n  In Iran, Dr. Shirin Ebadi, a woman lawyer, judge, and human rights \nactivist, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.\n  The following year in Kenya, Wangari Maathai, the deputy minister of \nthe environment, won the Nobel Peace prize for her efforts to protect \nthe environment and advance opportunities for poor women.\n  In the United States, the Clinton administration launched the Vital \nVoices democracy initiative to help women around the globe build \ndemocratic institutions and market economies in their own countries. \nDuring my husband's administration, I was honorary chair of the \nPresident's Interagency Council on Women, whose job was to follow up on \nBeijing and make sure that policies and programs relating to women and \ngirls were a priority in every federal agency.\n\n  President Clinton's administration was the first ever to understand \nthat social investment particularly investments in women and girls \nshould be an integral part of foreign policy. Secretary Madeleine \nAlbright led the charge, and I am grateful for her energy and vision.\n  These achievements might not have been possible without the \ngalvanizing effects of Beijing. We should all be very proud of the work \nwe have done here in the United States, as well as around the world, to \nadvance the Beijing agenda and ensure that we continue to make progress \non all of these fronts.\n  But where do we go from here?\n  Despite our advances, women still comprise the majority of the \nworld's poor, illiterate and uneducated. Women remain undercompensated \nfor the work they do in every country on Earth. Women in too many \ncountries still do not have adequate access to medical care or the \nfundamental right to plan their own families. Women are \nunderrepresented in leadership positions in government and business. \nWomen continue to be targeted for unspeakable atrocities in war and \nconflict.\n  At this very moment, women and girls in some parts of the world are \nbeing forced into marriages they do not want. They are dying of HIV/\nAIDS in disproportionate numbers. They are getting trapped in the \nbondage of international trafficking rings. They are being subjected to \nrape, mutilation and murder as a tactic or prize of war. They are left \ndiseased, destitute and dying in refugee camps.\n  In too many instances, the march to globalization has also meant the \nmarginalization of women and girls. That has to change.\n  This week's events offer an opportunity not just to assess our \nprogress and pat ourselves on the back. We also must reaffirm the goals \nlaid out in the Beijing platform for action and adopt our strategies to \nmeet the new and complex challenges of the 21st century.\n  Specifically:\n  One, we must continue to improve access to quality health care, \nincluding reproductive and sexual health and HIV/AIDS prevention and \ntreatment.\n  When women and girls are healthy, we all benefit from lower rates of \nmaternal and child mortality, improved public health, a decline in \npopulation growth, a more productive work force and more stable \nfamilies.\n  Among the most serious health crises facing women today is HIV/AIDS. \nAbout half of those infected worldwide are women. In Africa, young \nwomen are three times more likely to contract the virus than men. A \nvicious cycle of poverty, inadequate health care, illiteracy, sexual \ncoercion and gender-based violence make this a daunting problem with \nimplications well beyond the developing world.\n  That is why Senator Boxer and I proposed an amendment to the Global \nAIDS bill that would provide assistance to foreign countries to combat \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\n  We also have to ensure that women enjoy the fundamental right to plan \ntheir own families and that they have access to family planning \nservices.\n  This is not an easy issue. There are people with equally strong \npassions and convictions on both sides. But we should all be able to \nagree that we want every child born in this country and around the \nworld to be wanted, cherished and loved. And the best way to achieve \nthat is to educate the public about reproductive health and how to \nprevent unsafe and unwanted pregnancies.\n  Research shows that the primary reason that teenage girls abstain is \nbecause of their religious and moral values. We should embrace this and \nsupport programs that reinforce the idea that abstinence at a young age \nis not just the smart thing to do; it is the right thing to do. But we \nshould also recognize what works and what does not work and the jury is \nstill out on the effectiveness of abstinence-only programs. I do not \nthink this debate should be about ideology, it should be about facts. \nWe have to deal with the choices young people make and not only the \nchoices we want them to make. We should use all the resources at our \ndisposal to ensure teens are getting the information they need to make \nthe right decisions.\n  Today, roughly 20 million women worldwide risk unsafe abortions every \nyear. About 68,000, most of them in developing countries, die in the \nprocess. Many more suffer horrific injuries. The World Health \nOrganization estimates that about 600,000 women die each year from \npregnancy-related causes. Many times that number suffer grievous \ninjury. Many of these deaths could be prevented by providing women with \nthe information and means to choose the size and spacing of their \nfamilies.\n  Yet, the Bush administration is making it more difficult for women in \nthese situations to receive safe medical care. Under the global gag \nrule, none of our foreign aid dollars can go to foreign NGOs that \nprovide abortions beyond cases of rape, incest or endangerment to the \nmother. Or provide abortion counseling or advocate the legalization of \nabortion in their countries.\n  In places such as Nepal and Afghanistan, which suffer from some of \nthe highest maternal mortality rates in the world, clinics funded by \nour government provided a full range of health services to women and \ngirls. But with the Bush administration's reinstatement of the global \ngag rule, those funds have dried up; the doors to the clinics are \nclosed. When I visited Afghanistan two years ago and recently,\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\nAfghan women asked that the U.S. renew women's health assistance for \nthat country.\n  Practically speaking, making it harder for women to get information, \ncounseling and family planning services is a counterproductive policy. \nIt does nothing to reduce abortion; in fact, it may do quite the \nopposite. Without access to contraception and family planning services, \nthere will be more unwanted pregnancies. Without access to adequate \nmedical care, many pregnant women will die undergoing unsafe abortions.\n  There is no reason why governments cannot help educate women and \nassist girls and women with their health care needs. It is the most \neffective way to reduce abortions and improve the health and well-being \nof women and their families.\n  Two, we must prevent violence against women, and that includes the \ntrafficking of women and girls worldwide, and we must make sure that \nthe criminals who engage in these activities are brought to justice and \nnot allowed to go free.\n  For all the benefits of globalization, modern technology and instant \ncommunications, there are dark sides. One of the most insidious is the \ncrime and heinous human rights violation of human trafficking.\n  As many as 800,000 men, women and children are trafficked across \ninternational borders each year, lured by the promise of jobs or a \nbetter life, only to find themselves trapped in prostitution, forced \nlabor and debt bondage.\n  I will never forget visiting a school in northern Thailand that took \nin young girls whose lives were ruined by prostitution and taught them \nvocational skills. Many of the girls had contracted HIV/AIDS. I \nremember crouching in front of a teenage girl in a wheelchair who was \nso ill that she could barely raise her hands to greet me. The girl had \nbeen sold into prostitution by her family because they were desperate \nfor money. She had escaped her brothel, returned home, and was sold \nagain. She died a few days after my visit.\n  I also met with women leaders from Eastern and Central Europe and our \ngovernment launched campaigns in Lviv, Ukraine, and in Istanbul to \ncombat trafficking. I am proud that in March of 1998, President Clinton \ncondemned human trafficking as a violation of human rights and outlined \nthe prevention, protection and prosecution framework and strategy which \nled to the first anti-trafficking bill, which he signed into law in \n2000.\n  Now the Senate must ratify the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and \nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Our \ngovernment played a major role in developing this Protocol that has led \nmany countries around the world to enact new antitrafficking \nlegislation and we and other member states must ratify it. So far 79 \ncountries have ratified it and I believe that it is past time for our \ncountry to provide clearer leadership to other countries who have not \nyet ratified this landmark instrument of international cooperation.\n  But more is needed. I am heartened that since we initially helped \nbring global attention to this issue that our work continues to grow. \nBut I am equally concerned that current efforts have not yet achieved \nthe concrete results desperately needed by the victims of trafficking \nlike the girls I visited whose lives were ravaged by their servitude. \nWe have a deep responsibility to all of trafficking's victims to do \nbetter and I am committed to continue to work on their behalf.\n  In a related area, the U.S. and other nations must, for moral and \neconomic reasons, support efforts to curb all forms of violence against \nwomen, be it mass rapes in Bosnia and Darfur or battered women \nsuffering in the silence of their own homes in America.\n  Three, we must continue to increase participation of women in \ndecision-making positions in government and the private sector.\n  Women are on the front lines when it comes to issues involving their \nchildren, their families and their communities. But too often their \nvoices are not part of the political dialogue. We need to make sure \nthat women have every opportunity to make their voices heard, to be \npart of civic life and to contribute to the formation of policies and \nprograms that will affect their lives and the lives of those around \nthem.\n  NGOs have been a critical element of promoting women's human rights. \nThey were the voice for women in Afghanistan during the dark days of \nthe Taliban. Thanks to organizations such as the Vital Voices Global \nPartnership, more and more women around the world are learning the \nskills necessary to run political organizations and campaigns, build \npolitical networks and win elective office. As more women enter the \npolitical arena, research shows that their presence raises the \nstandards of ethical behavior, lowers corruption and makes political \ninstitutions more responsive to constituents.\n  We have seen women in Rwanda win nearly half the seats in their \nparliament during the 2003 elections. Their active participation makes \nRwanda stronger.\n  We have seen Afghan women refuse to sell their voter registration \ncards to tribal warlords and defy expectations by voting. Their active \nparticipation makes Afghanistan stronger.\n  We just saw Iraqi women refuse to run away from polling stations in \nJanuary despite the enormous risk and sometimes flying bullets. Their \nactive participation will make Iraq stronger.\n  We were all moved by photos of women and men on Election Day in Iraq \nholding up their ink-stained fingers, showing their courage and \ndetermination to vote freely in their country's first democratic \nelections. We were encouraged that a significant number of women were \ncandidates and won.\n  The wide participation in this election gives us good reason to be \ncautiously optimistic that Iraq is on the path to building a stable and \nsecure democratic government. But there are also troubling signs: Women \nhave been targeted for retribution, with tragic consequences. Women \nhave been attacked for wearing Western dress or promoting progressive \nideas. I have been told that fear of violence has kept some women \nconfined to their homes.\n  And so it is important that we recognize and applaud the progress \nthat has been made, and that we remain vigilant for the future. We \ncannot become complacent and see women freed from one tyranny only to \nbe imprisoned by another: the tyranny of violence or of extremism.\n  Decisions are being considered right now in Iraq that will determine \nthe role that women have in governance, under the law and in society.\n  To ensure that Iraqi women are not marginalized under their new \ngovernment, their rights must be ensured, their personal security \nguaranteed and their access to opportunity protected.\n  Four, we must extend full economic opportunities to women, including \naccess to microfinance and microenterprise.\n  It seems obvious that, with women making up more than half of the \nworld's population, global prosperity depends on women having the right \nto education, jobs, property ownership and credit. Yet it is only \nrelatively recently that this fact became more widely accepted. Over \nthe past several decades we have seen the enormous benefits accrued \nwhen women are given even a small slice of the economic pie.\n  Microcredit is one of those stunningly simple, inexpensive tools that \ncan forever alter the economic landscape for the better. Women now make \nup 80 percent of the world's 70 million microcredit borrowers. From \nIndia to Nicaragua to South Africa to Costa Rica, women are proving \nthat small loans can transform individual lives, families and entire \ncommunities.\n  Five, we must ensure that the doors of primary education are open to \nevery girl--and boy--in every country and on every continent.\n  If there is a domino effect at work here, it begins with primary \neducation. Today, 55 percent of girls in sub-Saharan Africa do not \ncomplete primary school. This failure has real consequences for our \nglobal economy and our national security, not to mention for tens of \nmillions of children with limitless potential who are losing the chance \nto discover their worth and importance as global citizens.\n  Girls who are educated are more likely to have healthy and stable \nfamilies, lower mortality rates, higher nutrition levels, delayed \nsexual activity and less chance of contracting HIV/AIDS or\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\nhaving unwanted pregnancies. Educated children also correlate to \nincreases in the GDP.\n\n  Equally important today, the education of children in the developing \nworld is one of our best weapons against terror. We cannot just win the \nmilitary battles; we have to win the hearts and minds of hundreds of \nmillions of people around the world, many of them between the ages of \n15 and 24. We have to educate them, and we have to engage them in \ndiscussions about our future.\n  I am pleased to have introduced the Education For All Act last year, \nwhich calls for a clear, global strategy to achieve universal global \neducation by 2015. By dramatically increasing our investment in global \neducation, the legislation would make educating children, including \ngirls, a top priority of U.S. foreign policy.\n  No country can do this alone. We need other reform-minded countries \nto step up to the plate. We need to leverage the strength and resources \nof private voluntary organizations. We have to work together to achieve \nthis goal.\n  Six, we must strengthen the role of women as agents of peace because \nwe know that women are among our best emissaries when it comes to \neasing religious, racial and ethnic tensions, crossing cultural \ndivides, and reducing violence in areas of war and conflict.\n  War and conflict disproportionately impact women, yet women are \nrarely included in peace negotiations or the peace process. Too many \nsocieties continue to view women's roles narrowly, thus losing the \nchance to benefit from the special wisdom and insights that women \noffer.\n  In Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Colombia, women have formed groups to \nsupport orphans and widows left in the wake of genocide and have \nadvocated for peace.\n  The 2004 U.N. Report of the High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges \nand Change recommends that in order to more capably resolve conflicts \nbetween states, the U.N. should engage in greater consultation with \nimportant voices from civil society, especially those of women, who are \noften neglected during peace talks.\n  The report goes on to say that in order to protect civilians, the \nSecurity Council, U.N. agencies and Member States should fully \nimplement Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, which passed \nunanimously in 2000; it is the first resolution ever passed by the \nSecurity Council that specifically addresses the impact of war on \nwomen, and women's contributions to conflict resolution and sustainable \npeace.\n  From my own experiences, I know that women can serve as tremendously \ncourageous and effective peace brokers. I have listened to women from \nCentral America talk about combating domestic violence after helping \nend real combat in deadly civil war. I have seen Catholic and \nProtestant women meet over tea, finding common ground amidst the \nconflict of Northern Ireland. I have seen Bosnian, Croat, and Serbian \nwomen bridge their differences by working together, eating together and \nlearning side by side.\n  Finally, it is time to ensure that women have equal opportunity for \nmeaningful representation in all areas of decision-making. Not just \ntoken positions. We need to be partners in developing budgets, writing \nlaws, serving in security forces, dispensing justice, conducting \nbusiness and serving in government.\n  Doing all of these things is not just the right thing to do. It is \nthe smart thing to do. Stronger, healthier, fulfilled and productive \nwomen are the key to building stronger societies.\n  Ten years after Beijing, politicians and policymakers around the \nglobe have become increasingly sophisticated at talking about gender \nequality and the important role women play in society. Political \nspeeches, election outreach and advertisements all suggest a growing \nacceptance of women's rights. But listen carefully to the words, match \nthem to their deeds and you will see that we still have a lot of work \nto do.\n  It is not enough to enshrine equal rights in a constitution. It is a \ncritical first step, but nations have to interpret and actively enforce \nequal rights for women. We are working with women in Iraq to make sure \nthis happens and that their rights are not eroded under a new \ngovernment.\n  It is not enough to say women deserve a voice in politics. Nations \nhave to take steps to ensure the full participation and representation \nof women in their conferences and committees, their plenaries and \nparliaments. Our sisters in Nigeria are struggling with this as we \nspeak. Although the constitution guarantees equal rights, Nigerian \nwomen have been virtually excluded from the political process.\n  It is not enough to say we want to educate our girls and give women \neconomic opportunities. Women must be able to safely conduct business, \nhave access to loans and participate fully in economic activities. They \nmust have a say in how society allocates its resources.\n  It is not enough to say violence targeted against women is wrong. Nor \nis it acceptable to excuse violence against women as a cultural norm. \nViolence against women is not cultural. It is criminal, and laws must \nbe written and enforced to punish perpetrators of any and all forms of \nviolence against women.\n  During this week, women on all continents, who are often divided by \nnational boundaries and by ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic and \npolitical differences, come together to celebrate International Women's \nDay. It is a time to reflect on our commitment to the ideals of \nequality, justice, peace and development for women around the world.\n  Let us use this occasion to redouble our efforts on behalf of the \nhundreds of millions of women worldwide who rely on us to speak up and \nspeak out for them because they cannot speak up for themselves.\n  Let us keep women's rights on the world's agenda. Let us continue to \nmobilize and galvanize until every woman and every girl is able to \nexercise her human rights and achieve her full potential.\n  Women represent our best hope for democracy, stability, prosperity, \npeace and security as we look forward into this new century,\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, gender equality is critical to peace \nand prosperity around the world. As we become more interconnected, it \nis crucial that the rights of women are recognized by all countries as \nfundamental human rights because countries which value women's rights \nare more stable, freer, and more prosperous. Therefore, it is befitting \nthat I rise today to commemorate, March 8, 2005, International Women's \nDay.\n  The genesis of International Women's Day comes from a number of \nprovocative moments in history. On March 8, 1857, women working in the \ntextile and clothing industry in New York City staged a protest \ndemanding better working conditions and higher wages. More than 50 \nyears later on March 8, 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York \nCity in support of voting rights, shorter work hours, and an end to \nchild labor.\n  It is because of these strong and courageous women that we recognize \ntoday as International Women's Day. They lit the torch for gender \nequality and passed it down through the generations to us. We have a \nduty and a responsibility to continue their noble work and I am ready \nto do so by ensuring that the voices of women from around the world are \nheard loud and clear.\n  Mohandas K. Gandhi once said, ``There is no occasion for women to \nconsider themselves subordinate to men.'' Yet, even today, there are \nplaces around the world where this is not the case. If the United \nStates aims to be a great champion of the rights of women and girls for \nthe rest of the world, we must do more to promote respect for women as \nwell as increase their participation in every aspect of a country's \ncivic, political, and economic life. Today, I would like to highlight \nseveral issues related to women that require decisive leadership: the \nrole of women in Iraq and Afghanistan, international family planning \nprograms, and the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination \nAgainst Women.\n  We all know that Iraq can only complete a peaceful transition to a \ncountry based on the rule of law, human rights, and democracy with the \nfull participation of women. One year ago today, the United States \nsought to assist Iraq on this path when the Department of State \nestablished the Iraqi Women's Democracy Initiative along with the\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\nU.S. Iraqi Women's Network. Through these grants, the U.S. reached out \nto Iraqi women and informed them of the importance of their vote and \nrole in the new Iraq.\n  On January 30, 2005, the world watched as 58 percent of Iraqi voters \nturned out for an election in which 25 percent of the candidates \nrunning were women. In the months following the elections, special \ntraining will focus on constitution drafting, legal reform, and the \nlegislative process, so that women may ensure their rights are \nenshrined in the new constitution. While I am encouraged by recent \npositive events, we must remain vigilant and encourage our Iraqi \nfriends to put the active and meaningful participation of women in the \nnew Iraq at the top of their agenda.\n  Last year, Women for Women International commissioned a survey of \nIraqi women and found that despite ethnic educational, religious, and \neconomic differences, an overwhelming majority of women in Iraq support \na strong role for themselves in the new Iraq. Of the women surveyed, 94 \npercent want to secure legal rights for women, 84 percent want the \nright to vote on the final Constitution, and 95 percent think there \nshould be no restrictions on education. It is the duty of the United \nStates to assist Iraqi women in realizing these goals and I encourage \nmy colleagues to continue to support funding for women's initiatives in \nIraq.\n  One of the great success stories of our campaign against terrorism is \nthe liberation of the women and girls of Afghanistan from the brutal \noppression of the Taliban regime. Under the Taliban, women in public \nwere forced to cloak themselves in shroud-like burkas while being \naccompanied by a male relative or else risk being beaten mercilessly. \nMost Afghan women were restricted by the Taliban from working, \nreceiving an education, from visiting doctors, and from receiving \nhumanitarian aid.\n  The women of Afghanistan have the opportunity to build a better life \nfor themselves and their families. More and more women in Afghanistan \nare getting an education, earning a living, receiving medical \nattention, and participating in public life.\n  In fact, I was pleased to hear that Hamid Karzai made history last \nweek when he appointed Habiba Sarabi as Afghanistan's first female \nprovincial governor.\n  During the Taliban regime, Ms. Sarabi fled from Kabul to Pakistan. \nFollowing the removal of the Taliban from power in 2001, she was \nselected for Mr. Karzai's cabinet and instantly became a hero not just \nfor women and girls, but for all Afghans. Her story is truly a \ntestament to the remarkable turnaround taking place in Afghanistan.\n  Nevertheless, obstacles still remain that prevent women and girls \nfrom reaching their full potential.\n  A recent U.N. report from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to the \nEconomic and Social Council's Commission on the Status of Women states:\n\n     while the status of women and girls has improved, overall \n     progress has been uneven. The volatile security situation and \n     traditional social and cultural norms continue to limit \n     women's and girls' role in public life and deny them the full \n     enjoyment of their rights. The massive needs in terms of \n     reconstruction of infrastructure and strengthening of human \n     capacity, including in the fields of education and health \n     care, will require the sustained attention and support of \n     national actors and the international community for many \n     years to come.\n\n  Our victory in Afghanistan will be lost if women and girls are not \nafforded basic human rights and equal opportunity. The United States \nmust not forget our commitment to provide a better future for Afghan \nwomen of all ages, and I urge my colleagues to stay the course and \nsupport additional assistance for education, health care, and democracy \ntraining for women and girls in the years ahead.\n  Once again, as we commemorate International Women's Day, I regret to \npoint out that the Senate has still not acted on the Convention to \nEliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Convention, \nwhich was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1979, has been ratified \nby 179 countries to date, including every other democracy in the world.\n  By ratifying the Convention, states commit themselves to take \nappropriate steps to eliminate discrimination against women in \npolitical and public life, law, education, employment, health care, \ncommercial transactions, and domestic relations.\n  I am shocked and disappointed that the United States has failed to \nratify this Convention. Every year we fail to ratify this important \nConvention, we compromise our ability to lead the world as the \ntorchbearer for women's rights. Not only would signing the Convention \nreaffirm our Nation's leadership role on these issues, it would bring \nus closer with our friends and allies who have already ratified the \npact. I urge the Senate to act on the Convention this year.\n  The United Nations Population Fund UNFPA is the single largest global \nsource for maternal health and family planning programs, working in \nover 140 countries.\n  Nevertheless, since 2002, the Bush administration has withheld over \n$90 million in vital U.S. contributions to UNFPA because of its \nperceived ties with China's family planning program and policies. The \nadministration has taken these actions despite a report from a State \nDepartment fact finding team that the UNFPA in no way supported or was \ninvolved in coercive abortions or involuntary sterilization. As a \nresult of administration actions, millions of poor women and families \nhave been deprived of desperately needed care.\n  The work of UNFPA benefits women in need around the world. In the \nwake of the horrific tsunami that struck South Asia, UNFPA has been \nworking to ensure that women and girls in this area are receiving the \ncare they need. UNFPA's priorities are reproductive health, including \nsafe childbirth, prevention of violence against women and girls, and \npsychosocial counseling for those affected by the 26 December tsunami.\n  In early January, UNFPA asked for $28 million to support its tsunami-\nrelated work in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Maldives as part of the \nUnited Nations interagency Flash Appeal. A month later, over 70 per \ncent of the requested funding had been received or pledged from various \ndonors, including Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, China, Norway, and \nNew Zealand. The United States is absent from this list.\n  No women should be prevented from receiving the assistance she \ndeserves to plan and care for healthy families. We need to ensure that \nwomen have access to the educational and medical resources they need to \ncontrol their reproductive destinies and their health so they will be \nable to better their own lives and the lives of their families.\n  Women are the backbone of our global society. They are our mothers, \nour sisters, our daughters, and our grandmothers. They nurture us and \nteach us the lessons of life and how to be a better person. As such, I \nam proud to commemorate March 8, 2005, as International Women's Day.\n  There are many great issues facing women and the United States. \nHowever, I am confident and optimistic we can address problems such as \nfamily planning, the burgeoning roles of women in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand eliminating all forms of discrimination against women.\n  As a United States Senator, I truly believe it is our duty as the \nleader of the free world to address and seek workable solutions to \nevery problem that women face around the world. We can--and we must.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record, without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 74) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 74\n\n       Whereas all over the world, women are contributing to the \n     growth of economies, participating in the world of diplomacy \n     and politics, and improving the quality of the lives of their \n     families, communities, and nations;\n       Whereas discrimination continues to deny women full \n     political and economic equality and is often the basis for \n     violations of women's basic human rights;\n       Whereas worldwide, the lives and health of women and girls \n     continue to be endangered\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\n     by violence that is directed at them simply because they are \n     female;\n       Whereas worldwide, violence against women includes rape, \n     genital mutilation, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating \n     violence, honor killings, human trafficking, dowry-related \n     violence, female infanticide, sex-selection abortion, forced \n     pregnancy, forced sterilization, and forced abortion;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization asserts that domestic \n     violence causes more deaths and disability among women aged \n     15 to 44 than cancer, malaria, traffic accidents, and war;\n       Whereas worldwide, 130,000,000 girls and young women have \n     been subjected to female genital mutilation;\n       Whereas worldwide, at least 1 in 3 females has been beaten \n     or sexually abused in her lifetime;\n       Whereas worldwide, 20 to 50 percent of women experience \n     some degree of domestic violence during marriage;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 women in the United States have been raped \n     or physically assaulted by an intimate partner at some point \n     in their lives;\n       Whereas somewhere in the United States, a woman is \n     battered, usually by her partner, every 15 seconds;\n       Whereas more than 3 women are murdered by their husbands or \n     boyfriends in the United States every day;\n       Whereas battering is the leading cause of injury to women \n     aged 15 to 44 in the United States;\n       Whereas it is estimated that 1 in 5 adolescent girls in the \n     United States becomes a victim of physical or sexual abuse, \n     or both, in a dating relationship;\n       Whereas worldwide, women account for \\1/2\\ of all cases of \n     HIV/AIDS, and in Africa, young women are 3 times more likely \n     to contract the virus than men;\n       Whereas worldwide, sexual violence, including marital rape, \n     has been denounced as a major cause of the rapid spread of \n     HIV/AIDS among women;\n       Whereas between 75 and 80 percent of the world's millions \n     of refugees are women and children;\n       Whereas illegal trafficking worldwide for forced labor, \n     domestic servitude, and sexual exploitation involves between \n     1,000,000 and 2,000,000 women and children each year, of whom \n     approximately 50,000 are transported to the United States;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of the world's nearly 1,000,000,000 \n     illiterate individuals are women;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of the children denied primary education are \n     girls;\n       Whereas these educational failures have serious \n     consequences for the global economy and the United States \n     national security, as well as for tens of millions of girls \n     who are losing the chance to discover their worth and \n     importance as global citizens;\n       Whereas girls who are educated are more likely to have \n     healthy and stable families, lower mortality rates, higher \n     nutrition levels, and delayed sexual activity, and have less \n     chance of contracting HIV/AIDS or having unwanted \n     pregnancies;\n       Whereas in most countries, women work approximately 2 times \n     more unpaid time than men do;\n       Whereas women work \\2/3\\ of the world's working hours and \n     produce \\1/2\\ of the world's food, yet earn only 10 percent \n     of the world's income and own less than 1 percent of the \n     world's property;\n       Whereas 3 in 10 households are maintained by women with no \n     husband present;\n       Whereas rural women produce more than 55 percent of all \n     food grown in developing countries;\n       Whereas it is estimated that women and girls make up more \n     than 70 percent of the poorest people in the world;\n       Whereas worldwide, women earn less, own less property, and \n     have less access to education, employment, and health care \n     than do men;\n       Whereas microcredit is a stunningly simple, inexpensive \n     tool that can forever alter the economic landscape for the \n     better;\n       Whereas women now make up 80 percent of the world's \n     70,000,000 microcredit borrowers, and from India to Nicaragua \n     to South Africa to Costa Rica, women are proving that small \n     loans can transform individual lives, families, and entire \n     communities;\n       Whereas nations should take steps to ensure the full \n     participation and representation of women in political \n     conferences, committees, plenaries, and parliaments;\n       Whereas social investment, particularly investments in \n     women and girls, should be an integral part of foreign \n     policy;\n       Whereas despite extraordinary advances, women still \n     comprise the majority of the world's poor, illiterate, and \n     uneducated, remain under-compensated for the work they do, \n     still do not have adequate access to medical care in too many \n     countries, are under-represented in leadership positions in \n     government and business, and continue to be targeted for \n     unspeakable atrocities in war and conflict;\n       Whereas March 8 has become known as International Women's \n     Day for the last century, and is a day on which people, who \n     are often divided by ethnicity, language, culture, and \n     income, come together to celebrate a common struggle for \n     women's equality, justice, and peace;\n       Whereas the dedication and successes of those working all \n     over the world to end violence against women and girls and \n     fighting for equality should be recognized; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States should be \n     encouraged to participate in International Women's Day: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 8, 2005, as International Women's Day;\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to--\n       (A) improve women's access to quality health care, \n     including HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment;\n       (B) end and prevent violence against women, including the \n     trafficking of women and girls worldwide, and ensure that the \n     criminals who engage in these activities are brought to \n     justice;\n       (C) end discrimination and increase the participation of \n     women in decisionmaking positions in government and the \n     private sector;\n       (D) extend full economic opportunities to women, including \n     access to microfinance and microenterprise; and\n       (E) strengthen the role of women as agents of peace because \n     women are among the best emissaries for easing religious, \n     racial, and ethnic tensions, crossing cultural divides, and \n     reducing violence in areas of war and conflict; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``International Women's Day'' with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

Res. 75\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821, ``it is in your land that liberty \n     has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we shall \n     imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we \n     succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete that \n     presented the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas the price for Greece in holding our common values \n     in their region was high, as hundreds of thousands of \n     civilians were killed in Greece during the World War II \n     period;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was 1 of only \n     3 nations in the world, beyond the former British Empire, \n     that was allied with the United States in every major \n     international conflict;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, in recognizing Greek \n     Independence Day, said, ``Greece and America have been firm \n     allies in the great struggles for liberty. Americans will \n     always remember Greek heroism and Greek sacrifice for the \n     sake of freedom . . . [and] as the 21st Century dawns, Greece \n     and America once again stand united; this time in the fight \n     against terrorism. The United States deeply appreciates the \n     role Greece is playing in the war against terror. . . . \n     America and Greece are strong allies, and we're strategic \n     partners.'';\n       Whereas Greece is a stabilizing force by virtue of its \n     political and economic power in the volatile Balkan region \n     and is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe;\n       Whereas Greece, through excellent work and cooperation with \n     United States and international law enforcement agencies, \n     arrested and convicted key members of the November 17 \n     terrorist organization;\n       Whereas President Bush stated that Greece's successful \n     ``law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization \n     [November 17] responsible for three decades of terrorist \n     attacks underscore the important contributions Greece is \n     making to the global war on terrorism'';\n       Whereas Greece was extraordinarily responsive to United \n     States requests during\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\n     the war with Iraq, as Greece immediately granted unlimited \n     access to its airspace and the base in Souda Bay, and many \n     United States ships delivering troops, cargo, and supplies to \n     Iraq were refueled in Greece;\n       Whereas the Olympic Games came home in August 2004 to \n     Athens, Greece, the land of their ancient birthplace 2,500 \n     years ago and the city of their modern revival in 1896;\n       Whereas Greece received world-wide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling of over 14,000 athletes from 202 \n     countries and over 2,000,000 spectators and journalists and \n     did so efficiently, securely, and with its famous Greek \n     hospitality;\n       Whereas the unprecedented Olympic security effort in Greece \n     for the first post-9/11 Olympics included a record-setting \n     expenditure of over $1,390,000,000 and assignment of over \n     70,000 security personnel, as well as the utilization of an \n     8-country Olympic Security Advisory Group which included the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Greece, geographically located in a region where \n     Christianity meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent \n     relations with Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas Greece has had extraordinary success in recent \n     years in furthering cross-cultural understanding and reducing \n     tensions between Greece and Turkey;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our 2 nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 2005, marks the 184th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution that freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which our 2 great nations were born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 2005, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/08/senate-section/article/S2296-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2005\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.
