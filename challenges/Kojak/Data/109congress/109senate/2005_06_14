GRIFFITH TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to resume consideration of Calendar No. \n66, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Thomas B. Griffith, of \nUtah, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia \nCircuit.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments, we will be voting on Tom \nGriffith's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court. Tom Griffith is a man \nof deep integrity, a man of skill, a man of experience who has won the \nrespect and admiration of colleagues all across the political spectrum. \nI am confident that once approved, Mr. Griffith will serve the D.C. \nCircuit Court with honor and distinction.\n  Mr. Griffith graduated summa cum laude from Brigham Young University. \nHe earned his law degree from the University of Virginia Law School \nwhere he served on the Law Review.\n  Over the course of his legal career, Mr. Griffith has developed a \nbroad range of experience from civil and criminal law to regulatory and \ninternational issues. Mr. Griffith currently serves as assistant to the \npresident and general counsel of Brigham Young University.\n  As Senate legal counsel during the impeachment trial of President \nClinton, Mr. Griffith proved his ability to fairly and impartially \ninterpret the law. David Kendall and Lanny Breuer, special counsel to \nPresident Clinton, wrote to the Washington Post:\n\n       Tom has been a leader in the bar and has shown dedication \n     to its principles. The Federal bench needs judges like Tom.\n\n  Glen Ivey, former counsel to former Senate minority leader Tom \nDaschle, testified that during the Senate's Whitewater and campaign \nfinance reform investigations, Mr. Griffith was scrupulous. Mr. Ivey \nsays:\n\n       Even when we were handling sensitive and politically \n     charged issues, he acted in a nonpartisan and objective \n     manner. I believe Mr. Griffith has the intellect and \n     temperament to make an outstanding jurist.\n\n  Tom Griffith is a dedicated public servant of tremendous ability. Two \nformer presidents of the American Bar Association call Mr. Griffith \n``extremely well qualified for service on the D.C. Circuit.'' They \nwrite:\n\n       The Federal bench needs people like him, one of the best \n     lawyers the bar has to offer.\n\n  Senator Hatch has said that in all of his years in the Senate, he has \nnever\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\nseen such a broad outpouring of support for a nominee from so many \ndistinguished individuals on both sides of the aisle.\n  Senator Dodd says:\n\n       Tom handled his difficult responsibilities as Senate legal \n     counsel with great confidence and skill, impressing all who \n     knew him with his knowledge of the law and never succumbing \n     to the temptation to bend the law to partisan ends.\n\n  In that spirit, I urge my colleagues to vote in a few moments to \nconfirm Tom Griffith to the D.C. Circuit Court.\n  I am pleased by the bipartisan progress we are making in the judge \nconfirmation process. In the last 3 weeks alone, we confirmed Priscilla \nOwen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Janice Rogers Brown to the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, David McKeague to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nand Richard Griffin to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. I now look \nforward to Tom Griffith being added to this outstanding list of \nconfirmations.\n  Let us continue on this path of progress and cooperation. I believe \nit is our constitutional duty and responsibility to vote. We are doing \nso. Our constituents expect us to do just that--vote. Every nominee \ndeserves the respect of a vote, fair, civil, up or down. That is what \nwe will be doing today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to hear the distinguished leader \nsay nominees deserve an up-or-down vote. Of course, he and other \nRepublicans assured that 61 of the judicial nominees of President \nClinton were not given a vote. They were subjected to pocket \nfilibusters--61. In fact, this nomination is a measure of the double \nstandards used by Republicans in connection with judicial vacancies. \nDuring President Clinton's Presidency, Senate Republicans said the 11th \nand 12th judgeships to the D.C. Circuit were not to be filled, that we \ndid not need those seats. They had argued since 1995 that the caseload \nof the D.C. Circuit did not justify a full complement of the court. \nIndeed, at a hearing in 1995, Republicans called Chief Judge Laurence \nH. Silberman of the circuit to testify against proceeding to fill \nvacancies on the D.C. Circuit. Republicans have argued for years this \ncircuit's caseload per judge is one of the lightest in the country. In \na May 9, 2000, letter, Judge Silberman argued that the D.C. Circuit's \ncaseloads had continued to decline from 1995 to 2000, and he opposed \nconfirmation of additional Clinton nominees. In fact, the D.C. Circuit \ncaseload has continued to decline and in 2004 was lighter than it was \nin 1999 when Senate Republicans pocket filibustered two highly \nqualified and moderate nominees by President Clinton to vacancies on \nthat circuit.\n  Now with the confirmation of Janice Rogers Brown to the court last \nweek, there are 10 confirmed, active judges on the D.C. Circuit, which \nis what Republicans have always maintained is the most that circuit \nshould have. Now, of course, we find we have another one.\n  With all the self-righteous talk from the other side of the aisle \nabout their new-found ``principle'' that ever judicial nominee is \nentitled to an up-or-down vote, the facts are that the nominations of \nAllen Snyder and Elena Kagan to the D.C. Circuit were pocket \nfilibustered by those same Senate Republicans in 1999 and 2000. Ms. \nKagan is now Dean of the Harvard Law School. Qualified? Undoubtably. \nOne of the most qualified people to be nominated to that court in the \n31 years I have been in the Senate. Was she given consideration in a \nRepublican-led Senate? Not on your life. She was filibustered by \nRepublicans. Likewise, the nomination of Allen Snyder, former clerk to \nChief Justice Rehnquist and a highly respected partner in a prominent \nD.C. law firm, was pocket filibustered by Senate Republicans. When one \nof Mr. Synder's partners, John Roberts, was nominated to the same court \nby President Bush, he was, of course, unanimously supported by Senate \nRepublicans. Senate Republicans played a cruel joke on Mr. Snyder when \nthey allowed him a hearing but then went on to refuse to list him for a \nvote by the Judiciary Committee or the Senate.\n  I recall that in September 2000, Senator Sessions explained that \nClinton nominees Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan were blocked: ``Because \nthe circuit had a caseload about one-fourth the average caseload per \njudge. And the chief circuit judge said 10 judges was enough, instead \nof 12. And I actually thought that was too many. I thought 10 was too \nmany.'' So this Republican Senator joined in the pocket filibuster of \nthese two nominees.\n  Well, the D.C. Circuit's caseload per judge is lower now than it was \nduring the Clinton administration, but suddenly with a Republican \nPresident, Republican Senators say we need to fill those seats. It is a \nbit hypocritical. Let us see whether the votes of Republican Senators \nthis time will be based on the same rationale they gave in inflicting \npocket filibusters on Clinton nominees.\n  Last week we witnessed a Republican Senator--who had voted against \nthe confirmation of a Clinton judicial recess appointment and had \nexplained his vote as representing his opposition to \nrecess appointments reverse himself to vote for a Bush judicial recess \nappointment.\n\n  Last week, we witnessed dozens of Republican Senators--who voted \nagainst confirmation of Ronnie White of Missouri in 1999 and had \nexplained their vote as compelled by the opposition of his home-state \nSenators--reverse themselves and vote in favor of Justice Janice Rogers \nBrown and ignore the strong, consistent and well- founded opposition of \nher two home-state Senators.\n  Ronnie White, now the first African American to be chief justice of \nthe Supreme Court of Missouri, was turned down by a double standard \nused by Republicans. I wonder whether the many Republicans Senators who \ndelayed and opposed the confirmation of Merrick Garland in 1996 and \n1997 and pocket filibustered the nominations of Allen Snyder and Elena \nKagan in 1999 and 2000 will vote against a nominee to the D.C. Circuit \nbecause the caseload of the circuit does not justify more judges. We \nwill see if Republican Senators again abandon their earlier rationale.\n  It is sometimes embarrassing, I think, to some of my friends on the \nother side to be reminded of all the rationales they used in pocket \nfilibustering President Clinton's nominees, when now all of a sudden \nthose same rationales are out the window when a Republican nominates a \njudge.\n  In addition, as I explained yesterday, my opposition to this \nparticular nominee, Mr. Griffith, is because he did not follow the law. \nHis decision to practice law without a license for a good part of his \ncareer should be disqualifying. He has not honored the rule of law by \nfirst practiced law illegally in the District of Columbia for several \nyears and then in Utah for several years without even bothering to \nfulfill his obligation to become a member of the Utah bar. In this \nregard he appears to think he is above the law. This is not the kind of \nnominee who should be entrusted with a lifetime appointment to a \nFederal court and, least of all, to such an important court as the D.C. \nCircuit, which is entrusted with protecting the rights of all \nAmericans. He may be a fine gentleman, but what a standard. We turn \ndown a partner in a prestigious law firm because he was nominated by a \nDemocrat, and we turn down a woman highly qualified who becomes the \ndean of the Harvard Law School, but she committed a sin of having been \nnominated by a Democratic President. When a Republican nominates \nsomebody for the same seat and he practiced law illegally for 7 years, \nwell, all is forgiven. This is the wrong nomination for this court, and \nI will vote against it.\n  I think it is another in a series of inappropriate nominations the \nPresident has made to the same court. Of course, the takeover of this \ncourt is now complete. It becomes an arm of the Republican Party. Mr. \nGriffith is the third nominee from President Bush to be considered by \nthe Senate. If he is confirmed with those 11 judges, a majority of 7 \njudges will be appointed by Republican Presidents, but interestingly \nenough, they have turned this court into an arm of the Republican Party \nby using some of the worst double standards we have seen. Instead of \nhaving a balanced court where we have nominees of both parties, the \nRepublicans in the Senate filibustered, pocket filibustered judge after \njudge nominated by a Democratic President.\n  The D.C. Circuit is an especially important court in our Nation's \njudicial system for its broad caseload covering\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\nissues as varied as reviews of federal regulation on the environment, \nworkplace safety, telecommunications, consumer protection, and other \ncritical statutory and constitutional rights. The White House has \nrejected all Democratic efforts to work together on consensus nominees \nfor this court and refused to engage in consultation. I wish the \nPresident would work to unite the country instead of dividing it. But \nhe has divided the Senate and the American people with several of his \njudicial nominees. It is unfortunate for the judiciary, the Senate, and \nthe Nation. The President's unilateral approach is totally unnecessary \nand unlike his predecessors'.\n  I have been here with six Presidents. Five before this Senate always \nconsulted with both parties on judges they sought to unite rather than \ndivide.\n  This is the first President who has not.\n  To reiterate, I oppose the nomination of Thomas Griffith to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Mr. Griffith's decision to \npractice law without a license for a good part of his career should be \ndisqualifying. Mr. Griffith has foregone at least 10 opportunities to \ntake the bar in Utah, and has continued to refuse during the pendency \nof his nomination. In this regard he appears to think he is above the \nlaw. That is not the kind of person who should be entrusted with a \nlifetime appointment to a Federal court and, least of all, to such an \nimportant court as the D.C. Circuit, which is entrusted with protecting \nthe rights of all Americans. This is the wrong nomination for this \ncourt and I will vote against it.\n  Given the fact that the Supreme Court routinely reviews fewer than \n100 cases per year, the circuit courts, like the D.C. Circuit, end up \nas the courts of last resort for nearly 30,000 cases each year. These \ncases affect the interpretation of the Constitution as well as statutes \nintended by Congress to protect the rights of all Americans, such as \nthe right to equal protection of the laws and the right to privacy. The \nD.C. Circuit in particular is an especially important court in our \nNation's judicial system because Congress has vested it with exclusive \nor special jurisdiction over cases involving many environmental, civil \nrights, consumer protection, and workplace statutes. For example, the \nD.C. Circuit has exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction in cases \ninvolving the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety \nand Health Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \nthe Federal Election Commission, and the Federal Communications \nCommission. The D.C. Circuit is entrusted with interpreting the \nAmericans with Disability Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and has primary responsibility for \nruling on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Superfund, the \nClean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. It is crucial that this court \nretain its independence.\n  The White House has rejected all Democratic efforts to work together \non consensus nominees for this court and refused to engage in \nconsultation. That is too bad and totally unnecessary. This is another \nin a series of inappropriate nominations this President has made to \nthis court. Last week, Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to confirm \nJanice Rogers Brown to this court. The takeover of this court is now \ncomplete. Mr. Griffith is the third nominee for this court from \nPresident Bush to be considered by the Senate. If he is confirmed the \n11 judges on the court will include a majority of seven judges \nappointed by Republican Presidents.\n  At Mr. Griffith's hearing last March, I noted that unlike the many \nanonymous Republican holds and pocket filibusters that kept more than \n60 of President Clinton's moderate and qualified judicial nominees from \nmoving forward, the concerns about Mr. Griffith were no secret. Unlike \nthe Republicans' pocket filibusters of Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan, \nwho were each denied consideration and an up or down vote when \nnominated to the D.C. Circuit, Mr. Griffith knows full well that I \nthink he has not honored the rule of law by his practicing law in Utah \nfor 5 years without ever bothering to fulfill his obligation to become \na member of the Utah bar.\n  By one count, Mr. Griffith has so far foregone 10 opportunities to \ntake the Utah bar exam while applying for and maintaining his position \nas general counsel at BYU. He is about to forego an eleventh. This \nconscious and continuous disregard of basic legal obligations is not \nconsistent with the respect for law we should demand of lifetime \nappointments to the Federal courts. He has yet to satisfactorily \nexplain why he obstinately insists on refusing to do what hundreds of \nlawyers do twice a year in Utah and thousands of lawyers do around the \ncountry: apply for and take the State bar exam and qualify to become a \nmember of the State bar in order to legally practice law.\n  He has testified that he has obtained a Utah driver's license and \npays Utah State taxes, but he is not a member of the bar despite \nadmitting practicing law there since 2000. This is not Mr. Griffith's \nfirst or only bar problem. Mr. Griffith was less than forthcoming with \nus on questions related to his repeated failures to maintain his D.C. \nbar membership and his failures to pay his annual dues on time not just \nonce, not twice, but in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. He was \ntwice suspended for his failures, including one suspension that lasted \nfor 3 years.\n  As was reported last summer in the Washington Post, and confirmed \nthrough committee investigation, Mr. Griffith has spent the last 5 \nyears as the general counsel to BYU. In all that time he has not been \nlicensed to practice law in Utah, nor has he followed through on any \nserious effort to become licensed. He has hidden behind a curtain of \nshifting explanations, thrown up smokescreens of letters from various \npersonal friends and political allies, and refused to acknowledge what \nwe all know to be true: Mr. Griffith should have taken the bar. I ask \nunanimous consent that the relevant Washington Post articles be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 2004]\n\n Court Nominee Gave False Data, Text Shows; Law License Was Suspended \n                          Despite Early Denial\n\n                         (By Carol D. Leonnig)\n\n       Thomas B. Griffith, President Bush's nominee to the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \n     appeared to provide inaccurate information to Utah bar \n     officials about his legal work and lapses in obtaining law \n     licenses over the past year, according to documents released \n     yesterday at his nomination hearing.\n       Griffith's nomination has been stalled for months over \n     concerns that he failed to maintain a valid license for three \n     years while he practiced law in the District and Utah, and \n     that he did not obtain a Utah license after taking a job as \n     general counsel for Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. \n     Even as Griffith defended his record yesterday, the new \n     documents added to that controversy.\n       They show Griffith reported to Utah state bar officials \n     last year that his law license had never been suspended. It \n     had been suspended from 1998 to 2001. He also told the state \n     bar that he relied on his D.C. license to practice law in \n     Utah. But at yesterday's hearing, Griffith testified that he \n     had practiced law in Utah by relying on associations with \n     licensed attorneys there.\n       Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), a \n     longtime friend of Griffith's who pledged to ``do everything \n     in my power'' to help him win confirmation, scheduled \n     yesterday's hearing for the middle of a lame-duck session and \n     was the sole committee member present to question Griffith. \n     Democrats said they were surprised Hatch proceeded despite \n     the slim chances of the Senate approving Griffith in the \n     remaining days before Congress adjourns and the objections to \n     the nominee.\n       ``We're going to do our very best to get you confirmed \n     before the end of the session,'' Hatch told Griffith, before \n     acknowledging: ``It'll be miraculous if we do.''\n       Senator Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) asked that Griffith's \n     application and letters to the Utah bar be released at \n     yesterday's hearing.\n       The Washington Post reported this summer that Griffith's \n     D.C. license had been suspended because he did not pay bar \n     dues from 1998 to 2001, a lapse that prevented Griffith from \n     obtaining a reciprocal law license in Utah after he took the \n     Brigham Young job. Griffith applied late last year to take \n     the bar exam to obtain a Utah license but never sat for the \n     January 2004 test.\n       Last month, the American Bar Association gave Griffith the \n     lowest passing grade for a judicial nominee, a ``qualified'' \n     rating. A large minority of the review committee voted ``not \n     qualified.''\n       Yesterday, in his first public comments on the matter, \n     Griffith said he ``deeply regrets'' his failure to make sure \n     that his law firm paid his dues so he could keep a valid \n     District law license. ``I bear full responsibility for what \n     happened,'' he said. ``I should not have relied on others.''\n       Griffith added that because his license was suspended for \n     administrative reasons, he\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\n     never considered it a true suspension or disciplinary matter, \n     and did not report it to Utah officials. ``The thought never \n     crossed my mind that it was related,'' he said.\n       Griffith also defended his decision not to obtain a Utah \n     law license since becoming general counsel at Brigham Young, \n     Hatch's alma mater, in the summer of 2000.\n       ``It was always my understanding that in-house counsel need \n     not be licensed,'' he said, as long as he worked with lawyers \n     who did have valid Utah state licenses when he dispensed \n     advice on state matters. He said he has been ``meticulous'' \n     in limiting his work by collaborating with the four lawyers \n     he supervises in his office.\n       In the newly released licensing application to the Utah \n     state bar, however, Griffith answered ``yes'' to a question \n     on whether he practiced law in Utah. He reported that he did \n     so as general counsel for Brigham Young, relying on his D.C. \n     law license.\n       In April 2003, the documents show, Griffith wrote a letter \n     seeking advice from the Utah bar on how he could obtain a \n     state license. Griffith said he had erred in assuming that a \n     new state rule might help him get a reciprocal license. The \n     bar's general counsel, Katherine A. Fox, wrote back the next \n     month urging him to apply to take the bar exam and warning \n     him to work with licensed colleagues in the meantime.\n       ``It is unfortunate that you anticipated relying on the \n     rule without having an understanding of the restrictions it \n     imposed,'' she wrote.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 30, 2004]\n\nAppeals Nominee Gets Low Grade; ABA Cites Licensing Lapses in Granting \n                           `Qualified' Rating\n\n                         (By Carol D. Leonning)\n\n       The American Bar Association yesterday gave President \n     Bush's choice for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia the lowest possible passing grade for \n     judicial nominees, and sources said a Republican Senate \n     chairman was expected to schedule a hearing next week on his \n     nomination.\n       Thomas B. Griffith, who failed to obtain a law license in \n     Utah or keep a current license in the District during parts \n     of the past six years, received a slight majority from his \n     peers after an unusually long, three-month investigation. \n     Under the ABA's system, that means at least eight of the 15 \n     members on the review panel rated him ``qualified'' for a \n     seat on the court, and at least six rated him ``not \n     qualified.''\n       The national lawyers group, which also offers a higher \n     rating of ``well qualified,'' evaluates judicial nominees for \n     the Senate.\n       Others have received the same rating and been appointed to \n     the federal judiciary. Of the 10 Bush administration appeals \n     court nominees who received the same rating, six were \n     confirmed to the bench. In President Bill Clinton's second \n     term, two of the five appellate court nominees who received \n     that rating were confirmed.\n       Griffith has declined to discuss his pending nomination.\n       A spokeswoman for Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin G. Hatch \n     (R-Utah) declined to say whether he plans to hold a \n     nomination hearing for Griffith, but committee sources said \n     they expect Hatch to announce today that he will schedule a \n     hearing for Oct. 7. Hatch has campaigned for Griffith's \n     confirmation, telling senators it is personally important \n     that the White House nominee, a friend who hails from Hatch's \n     home state, join the bench.\n       ``The chairman is pretty committed to this nominee and has \n     a high impression of Mr. Griffith,'' said Hatch spokeswoman \n     Margarita Tapia.\n       Griffith failed to renew his law license in Washington for \n     three years while he was a lawyer based in the District from \n     1998 to 2000, as counsel to the U.S. Senate and a partner in \n     the firm of Wiley Rein and Fielding. He said the licensing \n     dues were not paid because of an oversight by his firm's \n     staff.\n       But that lapse subsequently prevented Griffith from \n     receiving a law license in Utah when he took a job as general \n     counsel for Brigham Young University in August 2000. Griffith \n     said he discovered his D.C. license had expired in 2001. The \n     Utah Bar told Griffith that after so many years without a \n     valid license, the only way he could obtain a Utah license \n     was to take the Utah bar exam. Griffith applied to sit for \n     the arduous test but never took it, bar officials said.\n       Opponents of Griffith's nomination said yesterday that the \n     low rating and the lateness of the Senate session should \n     prevent him from getting a hearing.\n       Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, (D-Vt.) who this month said \n     Griffith's nomination was on ``life support,'' said yesterday \n     that he was surprised the White House and Hatch continue to \n     press for a nominee with ``not exactly a confidence-inspiring \n     rating.''\n       ``This is a nominee who has been suspended from one legal \n     jurisdiction and who apparently continues to this day to \n     engage in the unauthorized practice of law in another,'' he \n     said.\n       Thomas Z. Hayward Jr., a Chicago lawyer with Bell, Boyd & \n     Lloyd and chairman of the ABA standing committee on judicial \n     nominations, acknowledged this is ``one of the more \n     difficult'' nominee investigations for the bar. He said that \n     after Griffith's license lapses were reported in The \n     Washington Post in June and a preliminary investigation was \n     conducted in July, committee members appeared ``very closely \n     split'' about whether Griffith met the minimum qualifications \n     for an appellate judgeship.\n       Hayward said he then ordered a supplemental investigation \n     ``to be fair to the nominee.'' About 40 more people with \n     direct knowledge of Griffith, his licensing lapses in the \n     District and Utah, and his career were interviewed.\n       People can respectfully disagree, but we have probably done \n     more investigation into the questions raised by this \n     nomination than anybody else, including the White House, the \n     FBI and the two sides of the [Senate] Judiciary Committee,'' \n     Hayward said.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Practicing law without a license, or as the bars call it, \nunauthorized practice of law, is not a technicality. In some States it \nis a crime. In Texas, for example, it is a third degree felony. It is a \nserious dereliction of a lawyer's duty. It is a commonplace of American \njurisprudence that no one is above the law. If the American people are \nto have confidence in our system of laws that must include the lawyers, \nand beyond question, it must include the judges. I continue to be \ndisappointed by Mr. Griffith's unwillingness to do what is now long \noverdue: namely, to take the Utah bar exam and become properly licensed \nto practice law in Utah, where Mr. Griffith has been practicing law for \nthe last 5 years.\n  Despite the evident controversy surrounding his practice of law in \nUtah for 5 years without becoming a member of the Utah bar, he appears \nto have comfortably and conveniently placed himself above the law. That \nis not something I look for in lifetime appointments to the Federal \ncourts. For a court that decides some of the most important issues of \nlaw in our Nation, where the ruling in just one case can affect \nmillions of people in the most critical areas of their lives, the \nPresident has chosen to send us a nominee whose disregard for the rules \nthat apply to him is simply unacceptable.\n  Over the months that this nomination has been pending before us we \nhave done a good deal of investigation into this matter on a bipartisan \nbasis. The committee investigators questioned the nominee, spoke to \nofficials and experts at the D.C. bar and the Utah bar, asked for and \nreceived correspondence and other documents relating to Mr. Griffith's \nbar memberships and worked to understand the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding the two situations. Having reviewed all of this information \nand studied Mr. Griffith's many answers, I have come to the inescapable \nconclusion that he feels he cannot be bothered to live up to the laws \nthat apply to everyone else.\n  I will begin with the D.C. bar dues problem. In his initial \ndescription of this problem Mr. Griffith did his best to downplay it, \ntelling the committee in his questionnaire that his membership in the \nD.C. bar ``lapsed for non-payment of dues . . . due to a clerical \noversight.'' At the committee hearing on his nomination, he tried to do \nthe same, telling us that from the time he first began practicing law \nin North Carolina, and continuing through the time he practiced with a \nfirm in D.C., he counted on his law firm to pay his bar dues. He went \non further to say that when he took the job as Senate legal counsel he \ndiscovered the Government does not pay your professional fees. Here, I \nquote his testimony, where he told us: ``[W]hen I learned that the \nSenate wouldn't pay, I notified the D.C. bar to send the bar notices to \nmy home, where I pay personal bills. They did so in '95, '96 and '97, \nand every time they sent a notice, I paid.''\n  The only problem arose, according to Mr. Griffith, in 1998, when, for \nreasons he cannot explain, the D.C. bar suddenly stopped sending him \nmail. He says he never received his bill for the 1998 dues year, does \nnot remember receiving any of the follow-up notices the bar routinely \nsends, and simply forgot about his obligation until 3 years later, when \nhe was seeking a certificate of good standing from the D.C. bar.\n  All of this may seem relatively harmless but a more serious problem \narises because what Mr. Griffith told us and what he testified to is \nnot entirely true, it was not the whole truth. For example, his \nmembership in the D.C. bar did not just lapse when he failed to pay his \ndues in 1998, it was actually suspended. That means for the 3 years the \nsuspension lasted, he was not legally allowed to practice in reliance \non his D.C. law license. And he was not only suspended once from the \nD.C. bar, he was suspended twice, once in 1998 for not paying his dues \nat all, and also the year before, in late 1997. Furthermore,\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\nwe have also learned that while he managed to avoid suspension in 1996, \nhe paid his bar dues late that year, as well. Contrary to his \nmisleading testimony at his hearing, it seems that the only year Mr. \nGriffith actually paid his D.C. bar dues on time, after coming to the \nSenate in 1995, was in 1995. Two suspensions from the practice of law \nin 2 years, 3 late or nonexistent payments in 4 years, and an attempt \nto mischaracterize this embarrassing record are hardly just a single \n``administrative oversight'' unless by that Mr. Griffith means to \nindicate that his single admitted error is that he does not comply with \nthe law.\n\n  What may be more disturbing than Mr. Griffith's failure to pay his \nD.C. dues, for whatever reason, is his lack of concern about the \nimplications of having practiced law in D.C. without proper licensure. \nWhen I asked him if he had notified his clients from the period he was \nsuspended, whether he had told his partners or even the law firm's \nliability insurance carrier, he brushed me off, telling me that his \nmembership in good standing was reinstated once he paid his dues. Of \ncourse, that ignored my real question about the ramifications of having \nbeen suspended for 2 separate periods totaling more than 2 years. \nClients should be notified, partners should be told, and courts should \nbe contacted.\n  The Department of Justice apparently agrees that suspension for \nfailure to pay bar dues is a serious matter. Recent newspaper reports \ndisclosed that the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility \ntakes such a matter seriously enough to have opened an investigation \ninto the case of a longtime career attorney there who, like Mr. \nGriffith, was suspended from the D.C. bar because he did not pay his \ndues. Unlike Mr. Griffith's case, the Department is concerned enough \nabout such a suspension that they filed notices with the courts in \nevery case this attorney worked on during the period of his suspension, \nnotifying them that he was not authorized to practice at the time. This \nmay impact the matters that Government attorney was supervising, which \nincluded the treatment and proper compensation of black farmers. \nPracticing law without a license is a serious matter.\n  The facts surrounding Mr. Griffith's membership, or lack thereof, in \nthe Utah bar are even more disturbing. Thomas Griffith began his \nservice as assistant to the president and general counsel of BYU in the \nsummer of 2000. At that time he was not a member of the Utah bar, he \nwas suspended from membership in the bar of the District of Columbia, \nand he was an inactive member of the North Carolina bar. He apparently \ndid not have a valid license to practice from any jurisdiction.\n  According to BYU, its general counsel ``is responsible for advising \nthe Administration on all legal matters pertaining to the University.'' \nIn addition:\n\n       All contracts, other legal documents and legal questions \n     pertaining to the University or its personnel shall be \n     presented to the Office of General Counsel or its staff \n     members as directed for approval and/or recommendation. The \n     General Counsel directs and manages all litigation involving \n     the University and decides when to engage outside counsel and \n     the terms and duration of outside counsel's representation. \n     The General Counsel delegates the University's legal work \n     among the lawyers in the office and supervises the work of \n     the office.\n     --https://bronx.byu.edurystlife/prod/Handbook/University/\n     Organization/President.html\n\n  Mr. Griffith gave us a similar description of his duties, telling the \ncommittee:\n\n       When University policy involves legal matters, I advise the \n     President's Council and its members on the legal issues \n     implicated . . . In addition, I supervise the work of the \n     Office of the General Counsel, which includes interpreting \n     University policy, participating in transactions involving \n     the University and outside entities, overseeing litigation, \n     assuring compliance with law, and coordinating activities \n     with other University offices whose work involves legal \n     issues such as human resources, risk management, and internal \n     audit.\n     --Responses of Thomas B. Griffith to the Written Questions of \n     Senator Russell D. Feingold, Dec. 3, 2004, Q.1.\n\n  But Utah law prohibits the practice of law in Utah by any person not \n``admitted and licensed to practice law within this state.'' Rule 5.5 \nof the Utah Rule of Professional Conduct holds that, ``[a] lawyer shall \nnot practice law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the \nregulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction.''\n  So, what made Mr. Griffith think he could practice law and not be a \nmember of the Utah bar? Mr. Griffith testified to the committee that, \n``it was my understanding that in Utah in-house counsel need not be \nlicensed in Utah, provided that when legal advice is given, it is done \nso in close association with active members of the Utah bar.'' When I \nasked him in writing to explain how he came to that understanding, and \nto point out which Utah laws or bar rules might apply, Mr. Griffith \ntold us only that this, ``understanding was formed over the course of \nthe years of practicing law and as I had interacted with in-house \ncounsel in a variety of settings including other Utah in-house counsel \nwho were not members of the Utah bar.''\n  Mr. Griffith testified that he relied on an in-house counsel \nexception that does not exist in Utah statutes and is not recognized by \nthe Utah Supreme Court, as Mr. Griffith was forced to concede. It was a \nmost convenient and self-serving excuse. There is no such ``general \ncounsel'' exception in Utah and there never has been. He could not \npoint to any Utah statute or Utah Supreme Court pronouncement allowing \nthis behavior because it does not exist as a matter of law. Moreover, \nhis predecessor at BYU and the general counsels of the other \nuniversities in Utah are all members of the Utah bar.\n  Previously, in his April 2003 letter to John Adams, then the \npresident of the Utah bar, Mr. Griffith explained the matter \ndifferently and relied specifically on a former BYU general counsel and \non unnamed persons at the Utah bar, saying that, ``I was told by my \npredecessor that the Utah bar had created'' what he referred to as a \n``general counsel exception'' and that ``I didn't need to become a \nmember of the Utah bar to perform my responsibilities. Subsequent \nconversations with people in your office as well as discussions with \nother general counsel around the state confirmed that understanding.''\n  Mr. Griffith has never been able to identify who at the Utah bar he \nclaims advised him that he did not need to join the bar. This \nfundamental refusal to abide by the law is all the more troubling by \nMr. Griffith's obstinate behavior in refusing to take the bar in order \nto cure his failure. This is not complicated: Get licensed. Indeed, \nduring the course of committee consideration he admitted that when he \nasked a second-year law student to research the matter she came back to \nhim and advised that he should take the bar. Yet here we are, with the \nSenate being urged to confirm someone to a lifetime appointment as a \nFederal judge on a court with jurisdiction over important cases that \ncan have nationwide impact and that nominee has adamantly refused to \nfollow legal requirements in his own legal practice.\n\n  Mr. Griffith did respond for the first time in his December 3, 2004 \nanswers to some of our written questions that he had spoken to Bar \nPresident Adams in March 2002. But in his answers, Mr. Griffith \nreported the subject of that conversation was whether or not, in order \nto join the bar, he would need to take the bar examination, rather than \nwhether or not he needed to become a bar member in the first place. Mr. \nGriffith explained to the committee that he took Mr. Adams' silence on \nthe unasked question to be an endorsement of his self-serving position \nthat he did not need to be a member of the Utah bar to carry out his \nresponsibilities at the University.'' To Mr. Griffith, Mr. Adams' \nsilence on this unarticulated question apparently overrode all of the \nrules of the Utah bar and the laws of the State of Utah.\n  There was one official representative of the Utah bar who told Mr. \nGriffith in no uncertain terms what to do; namely, take the Utah bar \nexamination. Asked by Mr. Adams to respond to the April 10, 2003 \nletter, Katherine Fox, Utah bar general counsel, wrote to Mr. Griffith \non May 14, 2003, telling him she was ``surprised'' he thought there was \na general counsel exception, and explaining that in his circumstances \nthere was no way to waive into the Utah bar and become a member without \ntaking the bar exam. In her letter, and in plain, simple-to-understand \nwords, Ms. Fox instructed Mr. Griffith to take the bar examination at \nthe earliest opportunity. Ms. Fox wrote Mr. Griffith: ``You are \nfortunate, however, to have a\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\nviable option remaining, i.e., admittance by examination and I would \nencourage you to start preparing your application as soon as \npossible.'' In addition, she ``strongly'' encouraged him to, ``review \n[his] current duties,'' and to either limit his work to non-legal \npractice or, if legal activities were unavoidable in the interim until \nhe could pass the exam, be admitted to the Utah bar and cure his \ndeficiency, ``to closely associate with someone who is actually \nlicensed here and on active status.'' She closed by reminding him that \nthe character and fitness portion of the evaluation of prospective \nmembers of the Utah bar could be affected by ``[p]racticing law without \na Utah license.'' I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Griffith's letter to \nthe Utah bar and Katherine Fox's response be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                               Utah State Bar,\n\n                               Salt Lake City, Utah, May 14, 2003.\n     Thomas B. Griffith,\n     Assistant to the President, Office of the General Counsel, \n         Brigham Young University, Provo, UT.\n       Dear Mr. Griffith: I have been provided with a copy of your \n     letter dated April 10, 2003 and would like to respond on \n     behalf of the Bar to a few issues which you raised. First, I \n     was somewhat surprised that you were informed by your \n     predecessor at Brigham Young University's Office of General \n     Counsel and perhaps others that Utah had created a ``general \n     counsel rule exception.'' As you are now aware from speaking \n     with Joni Dickson Seko, the Bar's Deputy General Counsel in \n     charge of admissions, Utah does not have and has never had \n     such a rule. Second, although we were optimistic that the \n     Utah Supreme Court would approve the proposed reciprocity \n     rule, there was no guarantee that it would happen or that the \n     rule would emerge in the format we submitted.\n       It is unfortunate that you anticipated relying on the rule \n     without having an understanding of the restrictions it \n     imposed. However, I know of no other jurisdiction where a \n     reciprocity rule has no conditions or restrictions such as a \n     years of practice requirement. For instance, North Carolina's \n     reciprocity rule requires applicants to have been physically \n     practicing law elsewhere for at least four out of the last \n     six preceding years.\n       Your reading of the new reciprocity rule is accurate and \n     admission to the Utah State Bar requires a minimal number of \n     years of active practice in the reciprocating jurisdiction. \n     As both Ms. Seko and her assistant Christy Abad have informed \n     you, the Rules for Admission do not provide for Bar staff or \n     our governing body, the Board of Bar Commissioners, to make \n     any exceptions to uniform application of the rules. If an \n     applicant seeks a waiver of a rule it can only be granted \n     by the Utah Supreme Court through a petition. This route, \n     however, historically has not proven very fruitful for \n     those seeking waivers. See, e.g., In re Larry Gobelman, 31 \n     P.3d 535 (Utah 2001).\n       You are fortunate, however, to have a viable option \n     remaining, i.e., admittance by examination and I would \n     encourage you to start preparing your application as soon as \n     possible. The application is an extensive one and it takes \n     time to complete including making arrangement for the \n     necessary supporting documentation. While I know you spoke \n     with Joni about your inability to meet the May 1st deadline, \n     I wanted you to realize that the final (and again, non-\n     waivable) deadline (with a $300 late fee) is December 1st for \n     the February 2004 exam. Earlier deadlines are October 1st (no \n     late fee) and November 1st ($100 late fee).\n       Finally, while I regret any misunderstandings or \n     assumptions that may have occurred, I also would strongly \n     encourage you to carefully review your current duties as \n     Assistant to the President in the Office of General Counsel. \n     As noted above, we have no general counsel exception rule \n     allowing individuals who serve in such positions to actually \n     practice law without Utah licensure. Towards that end, it \n     would be a prudent course of action to limit your work to \n     those activities which would not constitute the practice of \n     law. If such activities are unavoidable, I strongly urge you \n     to closely associate with someone who is actually licensed \n     here and on active status. Finally, just so you know, all \n     applicants are required to undergo a character and fitness \n     assessment prior to being permitted to take the examination. \n     Practicing law without a Utah license has been an issue for \n     some applicants in the past and has resulted in delayed \n     admission or even denial.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Katherine A. Fox,\n     General Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Office of the General Counsel,\n\n\n                                     Brigham Young University,\n\n                                      Provo, Utah, April 10, 2003.\n     John Adams,\n     President, Utah Bar Association, c/o Ray Quinney & Nebeker, \n         South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah.\n       Dear John: I need your advice. When I moved to Utah to \n     accept the position of Assistant to the President and General \n     Counsel of Brigham Young University, I was told by my \n     predecessor that the Utah Bar had created what he referred to \n     as a ``general counsel exception'' and that I didn't need to \n     become a member of the Utah Bar to perform my \n     responsibilities. Subsequent conversations with people in \n     your office as well as discussions with other general counsel \n     around the state confirmed that understanding. I have, \n     however, always been active in bar associations where I have \n     practiced--Washington, DC and North Carolina--and I \n     determined that I wanted to be admitted to the Utah Bar. To \n     that end, I prepared to take the bar exam last summer. During \n     the course of preparing my application materials, I learned \n     that the Utah Supreme Court was then actively considering the \n     reciprocity rule that it has only recently adopted. In \n     discussions with the Utah Bar Association (maybe even you--my \n     memory is not entirely accurate on this point), I was advised \n     that the conventional wisdom was that the Court would in fact \n     promulgate a reciprocity rule. For that reason, I suspended \n     my preparations and did not submit my application nor take \n     the bar exam last summer.\n       I have now read the reciprocity rule recently adopted by \n     the Court and. as far as I can tell, it may not be helpful to \n     me. The requirement that an applicant for admission under the \n     reciprocity rule has been practicing law in the jurisdiction \n     from which he or she is seeking reciprocity for three of the \n     last four years is a bar to me inasmuch as I have been in \n     Utah and not practicing in Washington, D.C. or North Carolina \n     for the last two and one-half years. I am writing you to see \n     if there might be some interpretation of which I am unaware \n     that would allow me to be admitted to the Utah Bar without \n     taking the exam. If there is not, I will prepare to take the \n     bar exam next summer.\n       I look forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas B. Griffith,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. This response from a career lawyer in the Utah bar made \nbefore political pressure was ratcheted up to defend a Republican \nnominee, seemed pretty straightforward to me. That was almost 2 years \nago and still Mr. Griffith has not taken the bar exam, has not made \narrangements to take the bar and, according to his testimony in answer \nto my questions last month, has no intention of taking the bar and \nbecoming a member of the Utah bar despite having practiced law there \nfor 5 years.\n  In an interpretation worthy of the Queen of Hearts from Alice in \nWonderland, Mr. Griffith and his supporters have defied logic and \nreason by turning Ms. Fox's letter upside down in an attempt to \ncharacterize it as something other than it is and to condone his \nconduct. If he will make this self-serving interpretation in this case, \nwhat makes anyone think that he will not be the same sort of ends-\noriented judge that will twist facts and law in cases he rules on from \nthe federal bench? Ms. Fox's recommendation that he ``closely \nassociate'' himself with a Utah lawyer until he takes the bar and \nbecomes a member of the bar was not offered as an indefinite safe \nharbor that permits him to violate Utah law. Ms. Fox's letter is being \nmisused and mis-char-acterized as an invitation to flout the law. This \nis the kind of reinterpretation in one's own interest that \ncharacterizes judicial activism of the worst sort when employed by a \njudge.\n  Although he can point to no time before having read Ms. Fox's letter \nwhere he used the phrase ``closely associate,'' and can show us no \nevidence that he arranged his work at BYU in accordance with this \nadvice, Mr. Griffith has in hindsight tried to assert that he somehow \nalways knew he needed to ``closely associate'' with Utah lawyers. \nIndeed, he variously responded to the committee that in his view he \n``closely associated'' if he first gave legal advice to a University \nofficial in a private meeting and then sometime later told a member of \nhis staff who was admitted to the Utah bar about it.\n  He points to former bar president John Adams' letter of June, 2004, \nand to Utah bar executive director John Baldwin's letter of July, 2004 \nas support for his position, but these letters do not bolster his case. \nFirst of all, each is written long after Mr. Griffith's inquiry of the \nbar, and long after Katherine Fox told him to take the bar, but \nconveniently provided by his friends and supporters in the summer of \n2004 as the investigation into his bar membership was beginning. In any \ncase, neither of the letters says anything to undermine Ms. Fox's \nletter. Indeed, the support letters only speak in the vaguest, most \nnoncommittal terms. Mr. Adams says that Ms. Fox's letter ``accurately \nanswered your questions, and\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\n. . . recommended a course of action to follow in your work so long as \nyou were not licensed in the State of Utah.''\n  Mr. Baldwin's letter is even stronger, telling Mr. Griffith: \n``[T]hose who engage in the practice of law in Utah must be licensed by \nthe Utah Supreme Court through the Utah State bar. There is no general \ncounsel exception rule.'' Likewise, the letter Mr. Griffith produced \nfrom five former presidents of the Utah bar is of no effect. Aside from \ntheir obvious interest in supporting Senator Hatch's candidate who \nPresident Bush nominated and who is affiliated with one of the State's \nmost powerful and influential institutions, their letter does not say \nmuch. They reiterate that there is no general counsel exception to the \nUtah bar membership rules, and say only that if a lawyer is not \npracticing Utah law he may closely associate himself with a Utah lawyer \nto do those parts of the job. They make no judgment about the sort of \nwork Mr. Griffith is doing, or even whether, in their words, he ``lived \nup to this standard'' or whether his vague implementation of how he \n``closely associated'' was ever explained to them, let alone whether \nthey would have viewed it as passing muster.\n  The other person we know of who looked at this question for Mr. \nGriffith was a second-year law student he asked to research the Utah \nlaws and practice on bar admissions regarding in-house counsel in \nJanuary 2004. By that time, Mr. Griffith had already been practicing \nlaw in Utah for 4 years. One can suspect he made this request at that \ntime because his subsequent nomination was then under consideration at \nthe White House. According to Mr. Griffith, who now seeks to claim \nattorney-client privilege and refuses to provide the committee and the \nSenate with the materials, she did not definitively complete her \nresearch: ``She recommended, therefore, that the safest course for a \nUtah corporation would be to ask its in-house lawyers to join the Utah \nbar.'' When we asked for the memorandum written by this law student, we \nwere stonewalled by Griffith and BYU, which claimed privilege for this \ndocument. It is not clear to me why the university would be able to \nclaim privilege for a document prepared in response to Mr. Griffith's \npersonal problems with bar membership, or why once he himself revealed \nits contents we are not now entitled to see it. Nonetheless, we have \nnot been able to see it.\n  But, whatever the status of the specific memo, it comes down to this: \nA second-year law student in a truncated research assignment had enough \nsense to recommend that in-house counsel join the Utah bar. If she had \nknown that such in-house counsel admits to practicing law in Utah, I \nsuspect her advice would have been even more definitive. Of course, \nthat is the prudent course and the one consistent with Utah law. After \n5 years, Mr. Griffith has refused to take the normal steps taken by \nscores of others every year in Utah and thousands of lawyers around the \ncountry and take the State's bar exam in order to gain admission to the \nState bar.\n  Mr. Griffith has offered nothing in the way of legal authority or \nanalysis that might begin to refute the common-sense conclusion one \nmust reach after an examination of the law. Mr. Griffith has been \npracticing law in Utah without a Utah license. His excuses to the \ncontrary are insufficient and wrong. He admits that he is practicing \nlaw in Utah. He does not have a Utah license to do so. After 5 years, \nhe would appear to be in violation of Utah Code Section 78-9-101, and \nRule 5.5 of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct. There is no \n``general counsel'' or ``in-house counsel'' exception on which he can \nrely to justify his practice of law in Utah since 2000 without having \nbecome a member of the Utah bar.\n  In addition to that threshold matter of practicing law without being \na member of the Utah bar, there are other reasons for serious concern \nabout Mr. Griffith's fitness to be a member of the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I have already alluded \nto his creative, ``activist'' reading of the facts in law in connection \nwith his bar admission problems. In addition, he has spoken in \nFederalist Society circles of his judgment that President Clinton was \nproperly impeached and that he would have voted for his conviction and \nremoval from office. Given his role as Senate Legal Counsel at the \ntime, these public musings are unseemly and unsound. Rather than \ncampaigning for this nomination, Mr. Griffith would have better spent \nhis time preparing for and taking the Utah bar exam.\n  His judgment is likewise brought into serious question by his views \non title IX of our civil rights laws. This charter of fundamental \nfairness has been the engine for overcoming discrimination against \nwomen in education and the growth of women's athletics. I urge all \nSenators to think about our daughters and granddaughters, the pride we \nfelt when the U.S. women's soccer team began winning gold medals and \nWorld Cups, the joy they see in young women with the opportunity to \nplay basketball and ski and compete and grow.\n  With the recent reinterpretation of title IX being imposed by this \nadministration in ways that will no doubt be challenged through the \ncourts, we may now understand why the Bush administration sees the \nappointment of Mr. Griffith to the D.C. Circuit Court as such a \npriority. His narrow views on title IX were unveiled during his efforts \nas a member of the Bush administration Secretary of Education's \nCommission on Opportunity in Athletics, to constrict the impact of \ntitle IX. Does anyone doubt that he would rule that the Bush \nadministration's revision through regulations should be upheld?\n  The U.S. Supreme Court recently decided that whistleblowers are \nprotected in the title IX context. That was a close 5-4 decision in \nwhich Justice O'Connor wrote for the majority. Just the other day the \nJustices refused to hear a challenge to an appellate court decision \nthat essentially found that title IX could not be blamed for cutbacks \nin men's athletic programs. These recent legal developments regarding \ntitle IX serve to remind us how important each of these lifetime \nappointments to the Federal courts is. In light of the record on this \nnomination, I am not prepared to take a chance on it and will vote \nagainst it.\n  It is my understanding we are voting at 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not yet been requested.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be given equal \ntime as the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sorry. I could not hear.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask that I be given the same amount of time that the \nSenator from Vermont had to speak on Mr. Griffith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I probably would not object. I would point \nout that I was responding to the distinguished Republican leader who \nhad spoken an equal amount of time on Mr. Griffith. I had spoken \nyesterday considerably less time, on the same nomination, than the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Utah. I also know both the Republican \nand Democratic cloakrooms have notified their Members that we are going \nto vote at 10. There are a number of hearings that have been \nestablished based on that. As a matter of courtesy, I am not going to \nobject, but I wanted the distinguished Senator from Utah to know I took \nthe same amount of time the distinguished Republican leader did on the \nsame thing, and overall less time than the distinguished Senator from \nUtah has taken. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague not objecting, \nand I will limit myself to about half the time that he has taken this \nmorning just out of courtesy to him.\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\n  I know Tom Griffith. We all know Tom Griffith. Tom Griffith was \ngeneral counsel of the Senate. He served the Senate well. He did it in \na nonpartisan way, even though he is a Republican. He helped all of us \nduring the impeachment. Both sides acknowledge that he was terrific. He \nhas all the academic and legal credentials necessary to fulfill this \nposition. He is a person who is a consensus builder, someone who tries \nto get along with everybody and who, I think, will be perfect on this \nparticular court.\n  So I hope everybody will vote for Tom. He is a member of our family. \nHe served us all. As a general rule, in the past, people who have \nserved us such as Tom Griffith has would pass this body 100 to zip. \nUnfortunately, we have had some very forceful partisan politics rear \nits ugly head in some of these judgeship issues, and from time to time \nit may have been on both sides, but in this particular case it has been \nall on one side.\n  I get a little tired of hearing the same arguments over and over \nagain. The fact is, when President Bush 1 left office there were 54 \nholdovers with the Democrats in control of the Senate, and he only \nserved 4 years. One could imagine how many there would have been if he \nserved 8 years. The fact is, the all-time confirmation champion was \nRonald Reagan who had 382 judges confirmed in his 8 years, but he had 6 \nyears of a Republican Senate to help him. President Clinton got almost \nthe same number, a total of 377, with only 2 years of his own party to \nhelp him.\n  As chairman of that committee, I know I did everything in my power to \ngive the Clinton nominees an opportunity to get an up-or-down vote, and \nwhen they reached the floor I think virtually all of them got an up-or-\ndown vote without any delays or filibusters.\n  The Clinton administration was treated very fairly. There were people \nleft over at the end of his administration, and he had 8 years, no more \nthan were left over basically when President Bush I left the \nPresidency.\n\n  Getting back to Tom Griffith, as most of my colleagues know, Tom \nserved as Senate legal counsel for 4 years so many of us have had \nfirst-hand experience with him.\n  Because the D.C. Circuit reviews cases involving Federal statutes, \nregulations, and other important matter, this is a tough assignment. \nMany observers believe that the D.C. Circuit's jurisdiction makes it \nsecond in importance to that of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Tom Griffith is up to the task of sitting on this court.\n  At some length yesterday, I detailed his qualifications.\n  Time is short today, so I will make only a few summary comments.\n  In order to become the exceptional lawyer that he is today, Tom \nGriffith had to gain an exceptional educational foundation.\n  He accomplished this first as an undergraduate at my alma mater, \nBrigham Young University. He graduated summa cum laude and was the \nvaledictorian of the BYU College of Humanities.\n  Tom then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, where he \nwas a member of the law review.\n  Upon graduation, Tom joined the leading Charlotte, NC, law firm of \nRobinson, Bradshaw, and Hinson where he was an associate specializing \nin commercial litigation.\n  In 1989, Tom moved to Washington, DC, to become an associate, and \nthen a partner, in the firm of Wiley, Rein and Fielding--by all \naccounts, a highly-regarded law firm.\n  He began his four year stint as Senate legal counsel in 1995 and \nserved through the very challenging impeachment trial of President \nClinton that concluded in early 1999.\n  Upon departing from the Senate, Tom returned to Wiley, Rein and \nFielding for a period of time before he went to Utah in 2000 to serve \nas assistant to the president and general counsel of Brigham Young \nUniversity. He serves in that capacity today.\n  This is a bare bones sketch of a distinguished professional career. \nAlong the way, Tom Griffith has faced many challenges and he has \nimpressed many with his legal skills.\n  Here is what associate dean and professor of law, Constance Lundberg, \nof the J. Reuben Clark School of Law has to say about Mr. Griffith:\n\n       [Tom] is also a lawyer of unexcelled ability. He \n     understands the differences between law and policy and has a \n     deep understanding of the powers and prerogatives of each of \n     the three branches of government. He is immensely fair and \n     compassionate. The laws and Constitution of the United States \n     could not be in better hands.\n\n  These comments do not stand alone in academic circles. Harvard Law \nProfessor William Stuntz has said the following about Tom:\n\n       I know a great many of talented men and women in America's \n     legal profession. I have taught more than three thousand \n     students at three top law schools, and I have friends \n     scattered across the country in various kinds of law practice \n     and in academics. I do not know anyone whom I would rather \n     see on the federal bench than Tom Griffith. If he is \n     confirmed, he will not be a good judge. He will be a great \n     one.\n\n  I think that both of these professors have made assessments that we \nwould be wise to take into account.\n  Over the past 10 years, Tom has demonstrated his commitment not only \nto the legal profession but to the broader justice system. He has \nvolunteered a great deal of time in training judges and lawyers in \nEastern Europe, impressing many, including Mark Ellis, the executive \ndirector of the International Bar Association, who had this to say \nabout Tom Griffith:\n\n       The duty of a judge is to administer justice according to \n     the law, without fear or favor, and without regard to the \n     wishes or policy of the governing majority. Tom Griffith will \n     fervently adhere to this principle.\n\n  We in the Senate have ample evidence that Tom Griffith will place the \nlaw over partisan politics. Tom was Senate legal counsel during the \nClinton impeachment trial and won praise from those on both sides of \nthe aisle. Yesterday, I quoted from Senator Dodd's speech in tribute to \nTom on his departure from the Senate. Senator Bennett, my colleague \nfrom Utah, has already explained the constructive role that Tom played \nin keeping the Senate together during the impeachment trial. I agree \nthat the reputation of the Senate was enhanced rather than degraded \nthrough that time, in part because of the steady hand and solid \nguidance of Tom Griffith.\n  Few nominees that come before the Senate are as well-known by \nSenators as Tom Griffith and we know that he can handle complex \nproblems in a charged atmosphere in a manner that brings consensus.\n  I think that the qualities that Tom displayed as Senate legal counsel \nare exactly those that we need on the Federal bench.\n  Many agree with this assessment. For example, here is what one of our \nNation's leading appellate lawyers, the Clinton administration's \nSolicitor General Seth Waxman, had to say about Mr. Griffith:\n\n       I have known Tom since he was Senate Legal Counsel and I \n     was Solicitor General, and I have the highest regard for his \n     integrity . . . For my part, I would stake most everything on \n     his word alone. Litigants would be in good hands with a \n     person of Tom Griffith's character as their judge.\n\n  This strong sentiment in favor of Tom Griffith's competence and \ncharacter is shared, not surprisingly, by his former law partners and \nmentors. Fred Fielding, former White House Counsel to President Reagan \nand former chairman of the American Bar Association's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary, has described Tom Griffith as ``a \nvery special individual and a man possessed of the highest integrity. \nHe is a fine professional who demands of himself the very best of his \nintellect and energies.''\n\n  Another law partner of Mr. Griffith, Richard Wiley, has this to say \nabout his qualifications:\n\n       Tom is an outstanding lawyer, with keen judgment, congenial \n     temperament and impeccable personal integrity. He would bring \n     great expertise and fair-minded impartiality to the bench \n     and, in my judgment, would be a considerable credit to the \n     D.C. Circuit and the Federal Judiciary as a whole.\n\n  Tom Griffith has the education, experience, judgment, and character \nto make an outstanding member of the Federal judiciary. I commend \nPresident Bush for nominating an individual from Utah who has a proven \ntrack record as a lawyer and has strong bipartisan support.\n  In addition to this affirmative discussion of Tom Griffith's \nqualifications and bipartisan support, I do need to respond to the few \narguments that have been raised against his nomination by some on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  First, my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, referred to Mr. \nGriffith\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\nyesterday as someone who ``admittedly practiced law illegally first in \nthe District of Columbia and then in Utah.'' Mr. President, this \nstatement is patently false.\n  Mr. Griffith has admitted no such thing because he did no such thing.\n  No court or administrative body, including no bar association, \nanywhere has ever concluded that Mr. Griffith has, in the Senator from \nVermont's ill-chosen words, practiced law illegally.\n  Neither have they found that Mr. Griffith engaged in the unauthorized \npractice of law, either in the District of Columbia or in Utah.\n  Let me once again set this record straight with respect to both of \nthese jurisdictions.\n  In 2001, Mr. Griffith discovered that his D.C. bar membership had \nbeen suspended for failing to pay his annual dues. As soon as he became \naware of the problem, he rectified it. He paid his dues in full and was \npromptly reinstated as a bar member in good standing.\n  He remains a member in good standing today.\n  This matter involving Mr. Griffith's bar dues does involve several \nunfortunate mistakes. In the early 1990s, Mr. Griffith worked for a \nlarge law firm in Washington and became accustomed to the firm's \npractice of paying its attorneys' bar dues.\n  When he returned to that firm following his service as Senate legal \ncounsel, he wrongly assumed the firm was once again paying his bar \ndues. He accepts full responsibility for the oversights and, as I said, \nis today a member in good standing.\n  Mr. President, the only, I repeat, the only question is whether this \nerror was anything other than inadvertent. And Mr. Griffith has \nanswered that question with a clear and resounding no. No one, \nincluding the Senator from Vermont, has offered a shred of evidence to \nsuggest otherwise.\n  Each year, more than 3000 lawyers in the District of Columbia alone--\nand, I understand, a number of sitting judges--similarly see their law \nlicense suspended for failure to pay bar dues.\n  As in Mr. Griffith's situation, this is an administrative suspension, \nnot a disciplinary suspension.\n  Despite the rhetoric from the Senator from Vermont, we do not have \nthousands and thousands of lawyers practicing illegally in the Nation's \nCapital.\n  In a letter to the Judiciary Committee dated June 14, 2004, former \nABA Presidents Bill Ide and Sandy D'Alemberte wrote:\n\n       By immediately paying his dues when he became aware of the \n     oversight, Tom took the proper course of action. According to \n     D.C. bar counsel, such an oversight is entirely common and of \n     no major concern.\n\n  Yesterday the Senator from Vermont was trying to turn something \nentirely common and of no major concern into something untoward and of \nvery grave concern. It will not work.\n  The story is no different with respect to the Utah chapter of this \nstory.\n  Mr. Griffith graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law \nand practiced law in North Carolina and Washington, DC, for 15 years, \nincluding service as Senate legal counsel.\n  The position he accepted of general counsel of Brigham Young \nUniversity was very different, in both content and location, than his \nprevious experience. He consulted with Utah attorneys requiring Utah's \nrequirement for in-house counsel, and he has always complied with the \nadvice he has received in this regard.\n  Simply put, the advice he received was that he need not become a \nmember of the Utah bar, so long as he worked with a bar member when \nengaged in legal practice activities. No one, including the Senator \nfrom Vermont, has documented that he has not met this standard.\n  In a letter to the Judiciary Committee dated June 28, 2004, five \nformer presidents of the Utah bar affirmed that ``a general counsel \nworking in the state of Utah need not be a member of the Utah bar \nprovided that when giving legal advice to his or her employer that he \nor she does so in conjunction with an associated attorney who is an \nactive member of the Utah bar.''\n  In a letter dated July 2, 2004, John Baldwin, executive director of \nthe Utah bar, similarly affirmed that ``those who follow that advice \nare not engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.''\n  Mr. Griffith not only complied with the letter of the advice he \nreceived, his actions are consistent with the spirit of that advice as \nwell.\n  In a letter to the editor of the New York Times dated July 4, 2004, \nlaw professors and legal ethics experts Monroe Freedman of Hofstra \nUniversity and Thomas Morgan of George Washington University, \nemphasized that the requirement of bar membership is not a rule of \nlegal ethics. Rather, it assures the public--those to whom lawyers \noffer their services--that lawyers are competent.\n  Their letter states:\n\n       The requirement of membership in a particular bar is not in \n     itself a rule of ethical professional conduct, but a lawyer's \n     guild rule . . . designed to restrict competition . . . At \n     best, the requirement of a license is intended to assure that \n     one who holds himself out to the public as a lawyer is indeed \n     competent to serve as a lawyer. In that regard, there is \n     no question about Mr. Griffith's competence, which is the \n     only ethical issue that is material.\n\n  Obviously, this does not apply to an in-house counsel who does not \nhold himself out to the public. Brigham Young University, Mr. \nGriffith's employer, was well aware that he was not a bar member and \nwas thoroughly satisfied with both his status and his service.\n  The unsubstantiated charge that Mr. Griffith has practiced law \nwithout a license is pure hokum. Or as I explained yesterday, in the \nopinion of Abner Mikva, a former Democratic Congressman, White House \nCounsel to President Clinton, and former Chief Judge of the D.C. \nCircuit, this charge amounts to ``a whole lot of nothing.''\n  Judge Mikva has it right. My friend from Vermont is simply wrong.\n  The other area of criticism involves Mr. Griffith's views on title \nIX, a statutory provision which provides equal opportunities for women \nin college sports. Tom has proven that he is a strong supporter of \ntitle IX and women's rights.\n  In fact, he was appointed to the Secretary of Education's Commission \non Opportunity in Athletics by Rod Paige in part because of his \noutspoken support of title IX's objectives.\n  In response to written questions from members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Tom Griffith expressed his personal convictions about title \nIX. He wrote:\n\n       I am deeply committed to Title IX in particular and to \n     expanding and advancing opportunities for women in all areas \n     of our society. I am committed to that because it is the \n     right thing to do. But it is also personal for me. I am the \n     father of five daughters and a son. My entire adult life, I \n     have been an outspoken advocate for expanding opportunities \n     for women in part because it means more opportunities for my \n     daughters and a better society for my son. Those who know me \n     best know that about me.\n\n  Let us consider what those who know Tom Griffith say in this regard. \nBrian Jones, former title IX commissioner and general counsel of the \nDepartment of Education, said:\n\n       During the Commission's months of deliberation it was quite \n     clear that every member of the Commission--including Tom--\n     strongly supports Title IX and is immensely proud of the \n     progress brought about by its passage. . . . Tom was \n     consistently a member of the Commission who was not only \n     willing but also eager to engage every commissioner's \n     opinions--listening and deliberating in a thoughtful manner, \n     in a sincere effort to bridge disagreements and seek \n     consensus where possible.\n\n  Graham Spanier, president of Penn State University and another former \ntitle IX commissioner, had this to say:\n\n       During the many months that Mr. Griffith served on the \n     Commission charged with reviewing Title IX, I found him to be \n     supportive of the law that established Title IX. He was, in \n     fact, outspoken in his support for the law while thoughtfully \n     reflecting on matters of interpretation and commenting on \n     potential refinements to enforcement protocols. . . . During \n     our work, Mr. Griffith stated his belief that Title IX was \n     one of the great landmarks in civil rights in our Nation.\n\n  Ted Leland, former cochair of the title IX commission and director of \nathletics at Stanford University, affirms Tom's clear commitment to \ntitle IX:\n\n       During our numerous public meetings, I found Mr. Griffith \n     not only a diligent commission member, but a staunch \n     supporter of Title IX.\n\n  The list goes on, but because these baseless allegations linger, I \nwant to also offer the views of Tom's colleagues at Brigham Young \nUniversity. The executive director of BYU Women's Athletics, Elaine \nMichaelis, applauded Tom's efforts:\n\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\n\n       Tom has been very supportive of our women's athletic \n     program, the coaches, and the athletes. I believe that he is \n     committed to women and minorities and to fairness in all \n     aspects of the law.\n\n  B.R. Siegfried, an associate professor of English literature and \nWomen's studies at BYU, said the following:\n\n       I am an especially fierce advocate of equality for women, \n     and of the civil liberties that lend themselves to the \n     expansion and development of women's opportunities. . . . Tom \n     is and has been a steadfast and enthusiastic advocate for \n     women. In a local context in which there is tremendous social \n     pressure to gloss over gender issues, he has spoken out \n     repeatedly in support of fairness and justice. His support \n     has been constant and resolute, and his words are founded on \n     deeds of practical service.\n\n  As a member of a commission overseeing a review of title IX's \napplication, Tom recommended some changes. He is the kind of person to \ntake such a role seriously; I am sure he did not consider it sufficient \nto fill a chair and not bring his considerable judgment, insight, and \nexperience to bear in a constructive way.\n  In some respects, however, Tom's recommendations are beside the \npoint. As the many lawyers who now serve here in the Senate, lawyers \nwear many different hats over the course of their careers.\n  When Stephen Breyer, for example, was chief counsel to my friend, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, believe me, we did not always see eye to \neye on issues. But when he was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nand later to the Supreme Court, I was confident that he would be able \nto put politics aside, apply the law to the facts, and make fair and \nobjective judgments.\n  I hope there is no partisan double-standard at work here. Tom \nGriffith is also a fair, reasonable, and accomplished lawyer who has \nserved us well here in the Senate and who will properly move into a \njudicial role. There is no justification for treating him differently \nbecause he happens to be the nominee of a Republican President.\n  Now let's address Tom's supposedly radical policy views. The Office \nof Civil Rights at the Department of Education uses a three prong test \nto determine an educational institution's adherence to title IX. That \ntest requires that an institution demonstrate one of the following: \nthat the male to female ratio of athletes is substantially \nproportionate to the male to female ratio of student enrollment; that \nthe institution has a continuing practice of program expansion for \nmembers of the under-represented gender; or that the institution is \nfully and effectively accommodating the athletic interests and \nabilities of the under represented gender.\n  The first prong, the substantial proportionality test, has been \ndesignated by the Office of Civil Rights as a safe harbor. If an \ninstitution meets the requirements of a numeric formula, the university \ncan avoid liability under title IX. The commission found that many \ninstitutions have transformed substantial proportionality into strict \nproportionality.\n\n  The problem represented by this legalese is clear. This automatic \nadherence to a numeric formula means that a quota system has been \nestablished. Regardless of the number of young women interested in \ncollegiate sports, colleges and universities must offer equal numbers \nof athletic slots.\n  This is a radical revision of title IX's intention, which was to \nprovide equal opportunity for participation in college sports, not \nequal results.\n  The perverse result of shifting from equal opportunity to equal \nresults has been documented on numerous occasions. It has required \nclosing down men's sports teams in swimming, wrestling, gymnastics, and \nbaseball. In 1999, for example, Providence College cut its 78-year-old \nbaseball program to bring it within the proportionality requirement.\n  In 1996, California State University at Bakersfield's wrestling \nprogram, a two-time PAC 10 champion, was eliminated to conform to the \nproportionality requirement. A General Accounting Office study found \nthat from 1985-86 to 1996-97, no less than 21,000 male athletic spots \ndisappeared, a 12-percent drop overall.\n  Carol Zaleski, the former president and executive director of USA \nSwimming, had this to say:\n\n       The unfortunate truth is that Title IX has evolved into \n     something never intended. The act was intended to expand \n     opportunity. The interpretation by the Office of Civil Rights \n     and the evolved enforcement has turned into a quota system. \n     Title IX is a good law with bad interpretation.\n\n  Tom Griffith argued that while such rigid numerical quotas may be \neasy to administer, they fail actually to provide women with more \nathletic opportunities and that using this quota went beyond the powers \nCongress had allocated to the Department of Education.\n  Tom has hardly been the only individual opposed to this quota \napproach. Our former colleague, Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, said:\n\n       The word quota does not appear [in Title IX] . . . What we \n     were really looking for was equal opportunity for young women \n     and for girls in the educational system.\n\n  Despite divergent views over the best application of the law, Tom \nGriffith wholeheartedly joined the recommendations of the commission to \nstrengthen title IX and ensure that the test did not simply become a \nquota. Specifically, he joined recommendations calling for clearer \nguidelines for implementation of title IX and a method of \n``demonstrating compliance with Title IX's participation requirement \nthat treats each part of the [three-part] test equally.''\n  The question here is not whether Tom Griffith agrees with a \nparticular policy evaluation. The real question is whether he supports \nwomen's rights and is committed to equal opportunity. The answer to \nthat is a resounding answer is yes.\n  Three Associate Deans at Brigham Young University Law--Constance \nLundberg, Katherine Lund and Mary Hoagland--wrote to me and had this to \nsay about Tom Griffith:\n\n       In specific instances of which we have personal knowledge, \n     [Mr. Griffith] has fought for the promotion and recognition \n     of women, including ethnic minorities. His support has been \n     vigorous even when faced with substantial administrative \n     roadblocks. . . . In our experience, some men in similar \n     roles are not comfortable working with women as colleagues. \n     Tom, on the other hand, seeks out and respects women's \n     opinions. Indeed, if every person in university \n     administration were as evenhanded on gender issues as Tom, \n     Title IX and other ameliorative measures would be moot.\n\n  In both of these areas of criticism--whether he engaged in the \nunauthorized practice of law and whether he supports equal opportunity \nfor women--the pattern is the same. The allegations bear no \nrelationship whatsoever to the facts, and those who know Tom Griffith \nbest and have worked with him most strongly support his nomination to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  I do think that this nominee has been treated badly, and I hope \nSenators will do the right thing and allow him to take this very \nimportant position. He will be a consensus builder and will work to \nmake sure the law is implemented as the law was intended to be.\n  At one time, when another person was being nominated for this \nposition, I had those in the minority say: You ought to nominate \nGriffith. Some of the chief staff people said: Why not nominate Tom \nGriffith? These senior staff members said that Tom would be a slam dunk \nbecause everybody knows how great he is and what a good person he is.\n  Well, I fought to get him nominated all the way to the White House \nitself. Almost immediately after he was nominated, we instead hear some \nof these ridiculous arguments that, if not frivolous, certainly off the \nmark. What is important is we have a man of integrity, ability, and \ncapacity who could fulfill this position in a way that might bring \nother people together. We all know it because we have seen him for four \nsolid years right here in the Senate doing the Senate's business.\n  I appreciate my colleagues on the other side, and especially those \nwho are willing to vote for Tom Griffith. I think he deserves their \nvote. He deserves the vote of all of us, and I hope everybody in this \nbody will give him a fair vote today.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote no on the nomination of \nThomas Griffith to be a Judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The D.C. Circuit is widely regarded as the most important Federal \ncircuit. It has jurisdiction over the actions of most Federal agencies. \nMany of the highest profile cases that have been decided in recent \nyears by the Supreme Court concerning regulation of economic activity \nby federal agencies in\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\nareas such as the environment, health and safety regulation, and labor \nlaw, went first to the D.C. Circuit. In the area of administrative law \nand the interpretation of the major regulatory statutes such as the \nClean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct, and the National Labor Relations Act, the D.C. Circuit is often \nthe last word, as the Supreme Court reviews only a tiny minority of \ncircuit court decisions.\n  After the confirmation of Judge Janice Rogers Brown last week, there \nare 6 judges on the D.C. Circuit who were appointed by Republican \nPresidents, and four by Democrats, and there are two vacancies. \nPresident Clinton, of course, made two nominations that were never \nacted upon by the Senate Judiciary Committee. In one case, the \ncommittee held a hearing but never scheduled a vote on attorney Alan \nSnyder, and in another case, Clinton nominee and now Harvard Law School \nDean Elena Kagan wasn't even given the courtesy of a hearing.\n  I am disappointed that the Bush administration has not been willing \nto seek a compromise on judicial nominees, and on this circuit in \nparticular. At the beginning of President Bush's first term, there were \nenough vacancies to accommodate the two nominations by President \nClinton who were treated so badly in the 106th Congress and allow \nPresident Bush to nominate additional judges to the circuit. The \nadministration squandered an opportunity to change the tone and repair \nsome of the damage done to the nomination process by previous \nCongresses.\n  In light of this history, and the importance of this circuit, I \nbelieve it is my duty to give this nomination very close scrutiny. \nAfter reviewing Mr. Griffith's record and his testimony at two \ndifferent Judiciary Committee hearings, I do not believe he should be \nconfirmed to a lifetime appointment to this important court. Let me \ntake a few minutes to outline the concerns that have caused me to reach \nthis conclusion.\n  Mr. Griffith's adherence to professional rules of conduct and State \nlaws regarding bar membership has been less than scrupulous. In the \nDistrict of Columbia, Mr. Griffith twice was administratively suspended \nfor failure to pay his bar dues, one time for over 3 years. During that \ntime, Mr. Griffith continued to practice law in the District and then \nin Utah. This might not be all that troubling if he had later been \nhonest about the administrative suspensions he received for failure to \npay his dues. Instead, Mr. Griffith failed to note those suspensions in \nanswering two separate questions on his Utah bar application in \nNovember 2003.\n  First, he answered ``no'' when asked if he had ``ever been disbarred, \nsuspended, censured, sanctioned, disciplined, or otherwise reprimanded \nor disqualified, whether publicly or privately, as an attorney.'' At \nhis hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Griffith claimed that \nhe interpreted the question as referring only to disciplinary \nsuspensions, and that he considered his suspension from the D.C. bar to \nbe administrative. Given the clear language of the question, and the \nfact that the application gives an applicant the opportunity to explain \na yes answer, Mr. Griffith's no response is cause for concern.\n  In addition, Mr. Griffith answered yes when asked whether he had \n``ever given legal advice and/or held himself out as an attorney, \nlawyer, or legal counselor in the state of Utah.'' He stated:\n\n       Since August 2000, I have served as Assistant to the \n     President and General Counsel at [BYU]. When called up to act \n     in my capacity as an attorney, I have done so as a member of \n     the bar of the District of Columbia.\n\n  At the time he answered this question in 2003, Mr. Griffith certainly \nwas aware that his license in D.C. had been suspended from November \n1998 to November 2001.\n  Even more disturbingly, Mr. Griffith has practiced law in Utah \nwithout a Utah law license, and still does so to this day. Utah law \ndoes not provide that in-house counsel do not need to obtain a Utah law \nlicense. Yet Mr. Griffith failed to seek guidance from the Utah bar for \nalmost three years on what he could and could not do without a Utah law \nlicense when he began working for BYU. Instead, according to this \ntestimony, Mr. Griffith relied on his own professional experience and \ndiscussions with other in-house counsel in Utah. None of these people \ntold him such an exception existed, yet he did not make inquiries to \nthe bar until 2003. In 2003, Mr. Griffith received a letter from \nKatherine Fox, general counsel to the Utah bar, which indicated that he \nshould limit himself to work that would not constitute the practice of \nlaw, and if he had to practice law, he should do so only in close \nassociation with members of the Utah bar. She also advised him to sit \nfor the bar exam as soon as possible, and warned him that lawyers \nwho have practiced in the state without a Utah license have later had \ndifficultly obtaining such a license.\n\n  Since he received that letter, Mr. Griffith has had four \nopportunities to sit for the Utah bar, but has instead insisted that he \nmay practice law in Utah without a law license so long as he works in \nclose association with members of the Utah bar. He made it abundantly \nclear at his second hearing that he does not intend to sit for the Utah \nbar exam. I suppose that since he is now about to be confirmed to a \nD.C. Circuit seat for life, he won't have to. But his attitude toward a \nbasic responsibility of every practicing lawyer was disturbing.\n  In response to these concerns, Mr. Griffith stated at his hearing \nthat from the very beginning of his work as general counsel at BYU he \nhas worked in close association with attorneys in his office who were \nlicensed to practice in Utah. When I questioned him about his adherence \nto this close association requirement during his time in Utah, I was \ntroubled by what I learned. Although Mr. Griffith insists that he has \nalways worked in close association with members of the Utah bar when \ndispensing legal advice, he can provide no documentation of that \npractice whatsoever. It is not even clear how Mr. Griffith interprets \nthe close association requirement. He testified, for example, that he \ndoes not require a licensed member of the Utah bar to be present on \nphone calls where he dispensed legal advice.\n  Mr. Griffith's failure to document his close association with other \nattorneys is disturbing and revealing, in light of the letter from \nKatherine Fox, which warned him about the consequences that practicing \nlaw without a license might have on his eventual application to the \nbar. It also makes it even more difficult to believe that when he began \nworking for BYU he was aware of the issue and was taking steps to \nensure he involved members of the Utah bar in activities that would be \nconsidered giving legal advice.\n  Mr. Griffith did submit several letters written beginning last summer \nfrom current and former officers of the Utah bar, to support his \nposition that he has not violated bar rules so long as he works in \nclose association with members of the Utah bar. These letters were \nwritten, however, long after Mr. Griffith approached the bar about a \ngeneral counsel exception, and long after he received notice from Ms. \nFox of the Utah bar's position on it. Furthermore, these letters \nreiterate that there is no general counsel exception to the requirement \nthat a lawyer practicing law in Utah must be a member of the Utah bar.\n  Mr. Griffith's entire approach to the issue of his Utah bar \nmembership has been to suggest that he knew all along what he was doing \nand took care to avoid any improper conduct. But a prudent and careful \nperson, aware of and being careful to abide by restrictions on his \nactivities, would have documented his actions. It seems clear to me \nthat much of Mr. Griffith's argument is simply a post hoc \nrationalization. He has chosen to stick to his story and try and \nconvince the Senate that he was fully aware of the Utah license issue \nfrom the beginning and acted at all times in accordance with part of \nthe advice he received only in 2003. I find Mr. Griffith's explanations \nnot credible and disdainful of his professional obligations. This is \nnot the kind of conduct that the public has a right to expect from \nsomeone who will sit on the second most important court in the land.\n  Mr. President, I am not predisposed to vote against judicial \nnominees. In fact, I have voted for over 90 percent of this President's \nchoices. Mr. Griffith served the Senate with distinction, and his \nforemost supporter is the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee,\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\nfor whom I have great regard. But we have an affirmative duty to place \non the bench judges who adhere to the ethical standards of the legal \nprofession. I am not satisfied that Mr. Griffith meets that test, and I \nwill vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Thomas B. Griffith, of Utah, to be United \nStates Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia? The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to wish the U.S. Army \nhappy birthday. It was 230 years ago today, June 14, 1775, that the \nContinental Army of the United States was born. Over the past 230 \nyears, millions of men and women have served in the oldest branch of \nour Armed Forces. Their honor, courage, sacrifice, and service are \nwoven into the culture of this great, country.\n  The principles of duty, honor, and country have been the foundation \nof our Army and of our country. Their honor, their courage, their \nsacrifice, and service are woven into the culture of this great Nation. \nIt is America. Every generation of Americans who have served in the \nU.S. Army, from the Continental Army to our fighting men and women \nserving today in Iraq and Afghanistan, have been shaped by these \nprinciples, have molded lives in ways that are hard to explain.\n  Just as the U.S. Army has touched our national life and history, it \nhas touched the lives of citizens of the world.\n  The U.S. Army has protected American values of liberty, freedom, and \ndemocracy and made the world a more secure, prosperous, and better \nplace for all mankind.\n  It is only appropriate we recognize the monumental contributions of \nthis great institution, contributions to America and the world.\n  On this 230th birthday of the U.S. Army, we also recognize and thank \nthose who have sacrificed and served. We thank their families. Their \nexamples are an inspiration to those who have had the privilege to \nserve in the U.S. Army. They will continue to inspire future \ngenerations.\n  On this, the 230th birthday of the Army, I say happy birthday to the \nArmy. In the great, rich tradition of the U.S. Army, and as a proud \nU.S. Army veteran, I proclaim my annual Senate floor ``hoo-haw.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as the senior Senator from Nebraska said, \ntoday, June 14, is the 230th birthday of the U.S. Army.\n  Although we commend the service of the men and women of all branches, \nActive Duty and Reserve components, on this day the Senate Army Caucus, \nwhich I cochair with my colleague, Senator Akaka, particularly \ncelebrates the soldiers of the U.S. Army as they answer the Nation's \ncall to duty.\n  These brave men and women are giving something back to their country \nevery day through the sacrifices they and their families make. Mr. \nPresident, 230 years ago, the Army was established to defend our \nNation. Today, its mission remains the same as throughout the Army's \nhistory. America's soldiers have always answered the call to end \ntyranny, free the oppressed, and light the path to democracy.\n  As citizens and lawmakers, we appreciate our freedoms and our \ninalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But \nwe know our freedoms are not free and should not be taken for granted. \nThe men and women of the Army and the other branches of the Armed \nForces shoulder the load of being on freedom's frontier, defending our \nvery way of life.\n  On this day, it would be easy for us as citizens of this great Nation \nto take for granted our God-given rights. In our daily routines, we all \ntoo often overlook the selfless commitment the American soldier is \nmaking to protect our national interests and freedoms around the globe \nin over 120 countries. Each mission is contributing to our safety and \nwell-being here at home. For this reason, we should remember that June \n14 is the day the U.S. Army was established and celebrates its \nbirthday.\n  The men and women serving in the U.S. Army embody the ideals set \nforth in the Soldier's Creed and Warrior Ethos. They have the \nunwavering belief that they will be victorious in whatever they do. \nThis belief stems from knowing that the American people support them, \nand from the confidence they have in their leaders at every level. They \nare well equipped and well led, and they will perform their sacred \nduty. Just listen to these words our soldiers live by every day:\n\n       I will always place the mission first.\n       I will never accept defeat.\n       I will never quit.\n       I will never leave a fallen comrade.\n\n  It is kind of interesting. Many years ago, I served in the U.S. Army. \nIt is the same thing we said at that time. We have been living those \nwords not just since the time I was in the Army but for 230 years. Both \nSenator Akaka and I, the cochairmen of the Senate Army Caucus, were \nsoldiers in the U.S. Army. The principles we learned then--the timeless \nprinciples of discipline, pride, integrity, honor, and sacrifice--have \nhelped guide us throughout our lives. They still characterize the Army \ntoday.\n  So on behalf of Senator Akaka and the rest of the Senate Army Caucus, \nI\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\nwish the U.S. Army a happy 230th birthday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the birthday of \nthe United States Army. The Army celebrates 230 years of service to our \ngreat Nation on June 14. On this momentous occasion, I ask that we all \npause to pay tribute to the fine men and women of the Army who have \nserved both around the world and at home during the U.S. Army's \ndistinguished history. During the history of the U.S. Army, the \nbattlefield location has changed and the warfighting technology has \nchanged, but the spirit of the men and women of the U.S. Army has \nremained as consistent as the cause that they fight for--to protect, \ndefend, and promote freedom at home and abroad. The selfless service \ngiven by each and every member of the U.S. Army is an inspiration to us \nall.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, 230 years ago on, June 14, 1775, our \nFounding Fathers formed the United States Army. The Continental Army \nemerged in the midst of a war for liberty and freedom.\n  Today, America's Army, serving worldwide in a global war on terror, \nis once again deeply engaged in fighting tyranny and ensuring the light \nof liberty shines around the world. It too is transforming just as it \ndid in 1775.\n  The Nation stands united on the 230th birthday of the U.S. Army \nsupporting our soldiers deployed around the globe. Each and every one a \nvolunteer, who left behind the comforts of home to serve their fellow \ncitizens and the Nation. Their courage, compassion, and selfless \ndevotion to duty stand as clear examples to all of us and to nations \nthe world over.\n  The American soldier has always been the centerpiece of the Nation's \ndefense. Today, the focus remains as it always has: every soldier is a \nlink to those past heroes. Moreover, our modern warfighters remain the \npreeminent land combat force in the world.\n  From Bunker Hill to New Orleans, from Gettysburg to the Marne, from \nNorth Africa and the beaches of Normandy to Inchon and the Ia Drang, \nfrom Desert Storm to Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, the \nAmerican soldier: brave, professional and determined has taken the \nfield of battle in defense of those who hunger for freedom.\n  In light of the new threats of this century, the U.S. Army is \ntransforming itself once again to remain on the leading edge of \nwarfighting technology and combat skill. The change from musket to \nrifle, from horse to motorized vehicle, from aircraft to missiles has \nin the past 230 years demonstrated the resolve of our Army and its \nleaders to adapt in the face of change. New units of action, enhanced \nglobal mobility, infusion of precision weapons, and the responsiveness \nfound in Army UAVs along with real-time sharing of intelligence and \ninformation are the hallmarks of the U.S. Army today. What will never \nchange is the courage, determination, and professionalism of the \nultimate weapon in the Nation's arsenal: the American soldier.\n  No tribute to our men and women in uniform, whether they are from \nAlabama or elsewhere, would be complete without mentioning their \nfamilies. America salutes our military families and the silent burden \nthey bear when their loved ones: husbands and wives, fathers and \nmothers or sons and daughters are called away to distant shores to \ndefend this great Nation and our way of life. The love and support our \nsoldier's families provide gives each soldier the comfort and respite \nfrom the danger and long hours spent away.\n  As Americans, completing life's daily tasks, we should be ever \nmindful that the peace and freedom we enjoy in this great Nation were \nsecured time and time again by the valor of countless soldiers serving \naround the globe over the past 230 years.\n\n  From forward positions in Korea to the streets of Baghdad to the \nmountains of Afghanistan soldiers stand ready at their posts. They \ncontinue to guarantee the peace that has been handed down from \ngeneration to generation of Americans. We should be proud and humbled \nby the standards set and the sacrifices borne by these Americans.\n  Happy 230th Birthday United States Army. May your successes be many \nand your burdens light. General Patton once said, ``Wars may be fought \nwith weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of men who \nfollow and of the man who leads that gains the victory.'' So it was in \nPatton's time, so it is today. Ours is the greatest Army ever fielded \nbecause of the men and women who wear its uniform make it so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6439-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 6\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I do not want the Senator to \nmisunderstand, but I am going to object to the request, not because I \ndo not want that to be the order. I would like very much to understand \nthat is probably going to be the order, but I do not want to lock it in \nthat way right now.\n  What we are going to do, if the distinguished minority leader agrees, \nis I will make an opening statement. If, in fact, Senator Bingaman is \nready, somebody will get him here to make his, and then, if the Senator \nfrom Florida desires, we will let him proceed. Then we will work with \nyou to get the other two amendments lined up.\n  The reason I say that, I say to the Senator, is there is going to be \na long debate and many amendments with reference to ethanol, and I \nwould like to get it out here and see how it is going. It will be ready \npretty soon. Then you will be right after that in order, as we have \nbeen discussing. I hope that is satisfactory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has the bill been laid down yet?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6439-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6439-S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 10 a.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. 6, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6) to ensure jobs for our future with secure, \n     affordable, and reliable energy.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, so the Senate will have an idea what we \nare trying to do, the first amendment we are trying to offer up is in \nthe process of being completed in a bipartisan manner, the ethanol \namendment. We don't know exactly when that will be ready. It looks as \nthough they are working on the last clearances or clarification of \nwords. I was told a while\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\nago it may be an hour, it may be less. That will give us a chance to \nspeak. In Senator Bingaman's absence, we agreed that after our \nstatements, Senator Nelson will speak.\n  Mr. President, I think the most important thing to start with here is \nthat this bill before us cleared the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, after years of stalemate, by a rather incredible vote of 21 \nto 1. Some would think perhaps that doesn't mean a great deal. But to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, as chairman of this committee, I think it \nis very important. I think it means that, for once, Republicans and \nDemocrats have seen an American problem of real significance and have \ntried very, very hard to see if they could cooperate at every level, \nwith every amendment, and give everybody a chance to argue, present, \nwin, lose, and produce a bill.\n  I will start by saying that is one of the big differences between why \nwe are here today and what we are here about. I think it means that \neventually the American people and their great concern finally bubbles \nup, and I hope partisanship disappears and we try to get a bill. \nPartisanship might not be over because when you get to the floor, there \nis still a chance to be partisan, and that is all right. The thing is, \nwe want very much--and I use ``we'' because I speak for my friend, \nSenator Bingaman--to get a bill. That means the Senate is going to have \na lot of time but perhaps not as much as last time or the time before, \nwhen we had literally hundreds of amendments left when we finished \ndebate. And only through good fortune were we able to go to conference, \nin a very unordinary way, and we lost on the floor for reasons that the \nChair and others understand.\n  Having said that, let me say there is no question that this great \ncountry, with this rather fantastic economy, with its leadership role \nin terms of security, is in a position where we need a bill that \nenhances America's energy supply, maximizes conservation, and that \nproduces clean energy. So what we are talking about is an American \nClean Energy Act that will produce security of supply, affordability \nand, ultimately, national security and prosperity.\n  It sounds as though that is a rather auspicious hope for a bill, and \nI am not here saying everything about it is perfect, nor am I saying \nsome could not find ways to criticize it and say that perhaps it could \nbe done a better way. But remember, we are in the Senate, where \nSenators have to get a chance to work their will, where there is a \nmyriad of ideas about how America should move through this very, very \ndifficult time.\n  I want to say right up front that I wish we were here saying we could \ngo back 25 years and make some big changes so we were not having such a \nserious problem with reference to crude oil and the requirement that we \nimport so much. Of that importation, a huge amount, 75 percent, goes \nto transportation. Americans should know that means automobiles, that \nmeans SUVs, trucks, and everything that has to do with moving us \naround. We decided years ago that cheap oil, even if it came from \noverseas, should come to America and feed this desire for prosperity \nand mobility and transportation, which was one of our ways of providing \nour freedom. Now, 25 to 30 years later, we are in one gigantic bind, in \nthat we cannot produce enough oil to meet this need.\n\n  As a matter of fact, today, as we stand here, the United States has \ndiminished regularly its ability to produce the quantity of oil that it \nproduces so that in the world we are no longer a major producer; we are \nNo. 6. If you look out in the world, we are the sixth largest \nproducer--and fading. There is nothing we can do about it, in terms of \ngigantic steps forward. We can, and this bill attempts to, enhance our \nability to produce oil on American soil, where oil exists. We attempt \nto create a better format for permitting and drilling and acquiring \nAmerican oil, and then, as an aside, there will be a major debate \nlater--not on this bill--as to what we do, if anything, with the oil of \nAmerica that is in Alaska, which we frequently call and discuss as \n``ANWR''.\n  Nonetheless, in this bill, we have tried, with a degree of \nreasonableness, to say we are going to insist that we save 1 million \nbarrels of oil a year, as far as what we use, by saying to the \nPresident: You use whatever means at your disposal to save a million \nbarrels. And we give him that authority. Anybody who thinks we can do \nway more than that--I hope everybody understands that that is a \ndiscussion that doesn't have a great deal of merit, and it is beyond \nthe realm of the responsible and reality.\n  Having said that, in addition to that 1 million barrels, this bill is \nladen with opportunities for additional savings because we are \npromoting hybrid cars, and I am sure the tax bill, which would be \nattached to this, will further enhance the use of hybrid cars, which is \na great energy saver.\n  In addition, while some are critical, we will produce a very major \nethanol bill before we are finished. The finishing touches are being \nput on it now. That particular bill will say to America, produce the \nmaximum amount of ethanol, and ethanol will be used to mix with \nderivatives of crude oil and, yes, indeed, that will have a tremendous \nimpact on how much oil we have to import from overseas from foreign \ncountries. I will get to the specifics on that shortly.\n  At the same time, that particular aspect of the bill produces a lot \nof jobs. As a matter of fact, as I spoke of this bill at the inception \nand I spoke about prosperity, I spoke about security, I should have \nsaid to Americans it also will produce jobs because, with an abundance \nof energy, we are more competitive; with an abundance of alternative \nsources of energy, we get stronger in terms of our ability to compete, \nwhich means this is a jobs bill.\n  So it is a jobs bill, a security bill, a clean air bill, and a clean \nenergy bill. Add all of that up, it is a tremendous step forward for \nthe United States.\n  I will speak for a minute about one of the most important commodities \nthat we use in the United States: it is that marvelous product called \nnatural gas. We are very grateful and fortunate in America that we do \nproduce a lot of our own natural gas, but I regret to say that we have \nbegun to use it in such abundance because we started about 8, 9, or 10 \nyears ago putting natural gas in all of our new electric powerplants.\n  Understand that powerplants in America and in the world produce \nelectricity that goes into a grid that is distributed out. If anyone is \nwondering how important it is, turn on the lights, and that is \nelectricity that came from some far away power company. In the United \nStates, powerplants receive their basic energizing from a number of \nsources. Currently, 20.5 percent of America's energy comes from nuclear \npower. We have not built a new nuclear power plant in almost two \ndecades. Energy from nuclear power is undergoing a renaissance. It is \nbeginning to percolate up as something that many more people think is a \nreal, bona fide source of electricity and energy for the future.\n  I am well aware that the occupant of the chair, the distinguished \njunior Senator from New Hampshire, is a staunch proponent of nuclear \npower. I recall vividly his father, who had been Governor of the \ngranite State many years ago, discussing with this Senator way before \npeople were talking about it that we ought to move ahead with nuclear \npower. That is one source.\n  This bill, in a number of ways--and when the tax bill is finished and \ngets before us, that will finish the requirements--will push us in the \ndirection of saying let us move ahead with nuclear power, provided we \nfollow all of the rules, regulations, and laws because we have \nconcluded that it is as safe, if not safer, than any other source of \nenergy.\n  In addition, this bill would be a producer of clean energy. Nuclear \nis one of them. Secondly, we are a country while on the one hand not so \nblessed because we use so much crude oil and do not have enough, we are \na country that is laden with coal. Right now the largest source of \nelectricity produced in America comes from coal.\n  In numerous ways, this bill is a boost and sends a real powerful \nsignal that we want to invest in new technology to produce clean coal \nfor clean powerplants. We even provide incentives for the production of \nnew coal transformation plants where we will begin to produce clean \nenergy and capture the carbon that is one of the negative aspects of \nburning coal today.\n  Harkening back to natural gas, this bill does another very important \nthing.\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\nWe must bring down over time, if we can, the price of natural gas. \nPeople wonder what we can do in other areas, but natural gas is a \nfeedstock in America. It is fertilizer, it is jobs, it is agriculture, \nit is the feedstock for many other products in our country. I believe \nwe are paying the highest price in the world today for natural gas.\n  In this bill, we provide for a better way to site and locate \nliquefied natural gas--commonly called LNG--ports in the United States. \nWe say they cannot be delayed indefinitely. If they are safe, then the \nFederal Government ultimately can get involved and see that we do them. \nIt is important that we do that.\n  I did not mention everything. There are so many other aspects of this \nbill, but I want to talk about conservation because there are some who \ndo not think conservation is the kind of thing that is important in an \nenergy bill. It is vitally important, and I compliment those who have \npursued it with vigor, led by my good friend, Senator Bingaman, who has \npursued conservation for a long time.\n  This bill has very major conservation aspects. The amount of \nconservation that will be forthcoming in this bill is astounding. From \nwhat we understand, this bill will give us an opportunity, with \nreference to the use of energy from powerplants, to have the \nequivalent, if I am correct, of 50 powerplants of 1,000 megawatts over \ntime. Just think of that. That is rather major. We could go on and talk \nabout many other aspects, but Senator Bingaman will talk about the bill \nfrom his vantage point.\n\n  I close by saying that renewables are important. This bill recognizes \nrenewables in many aspects and ways. Clearly, we promote fuel cells. We \nfund it. We encourage its research. Clearly, it is an energy source of \nthe future. It will be part of making us more independent and clearly \nhelp us even in our transportation problems with reference to fuel.\n  Likewise, there is a section of this bill that I believe is about as \ninnovative as anything we have done, and it has to do with incentives \nfor building new and innovative sources of energy. In this bill, we \ncall that title incentives. What we have done in the bill is provided \nfor a new way for the United States, through the Secretary of Energy, \nto make decisions about new technology applied to pilot projects that \nmight be built in various kinds of new technological breakthrough \nactivities. It will be a provision that will be known as the loan \nguarantee provision, but it is different in that whoever applies will \npay the risk insurance costs, and then they will borrow on an 80/20 \nbasis. That means the U.S. Treasury should come through this with no \nactual cost to the Government.\n  According to our budget provisions and the law that provides for loan \nguarantees, it will not cost the Treasury and will be a very big source \nof new and exciting applications for the United States of new \ninnovation, which among all the things we have mentioned--the \nbreakthroughs in coal gasification, the breakthroughs in many other \nareas of technology--are really going to be important in making America \nmore secure, producing more jobs, producing a society that indeed \ncontinues to be prosperous. So this is a bill that has great efficiency \nand conservation built in.\n  On the electric front, I mentioned production of electricity, but I \nalso want to remind everybody this bill also should provide for a \nframework where we will not have blackouts in the future. That is an \neasy one to remember. Even the young people here remember blackouts \nbecause they just occurred a while ago.\n  We have a reliability section which everybody in the business says is \nhigh time we have because everyone will have the same reliability \nstandards, and we hope blackouts will become a thing of the past.\n  I mentioned ethanol. I note there is one of the strongest proponents \nof ethanol on the floor, and I say to the distinguished Senator, I hope \nwe get a good ethanol bill. Thanks to his efforts and many others, we \nshould get one that produces literally thousands of jobs, billions of \ngallons of gasoline, and millions of barrels of oil saved from \noverseas.\n  When we add that all together, the hybrid cars that will be \nproduced--and I just heard the other day that if we continue to \nstimulate the purchase of hybrids, and if indeed they are produced as \nthey have been, and if American manufacturers will get to where they \nare producing them so that it is not just Japanese hybrids, we should \nhave in the not too distant future the equivalent of a million cars a \nyear that would be hybrids. That will be a huge saver along with the \nother things that we are doing.\n  I want to add two things that are not in this bill that are very \nimportant to our future. Separate and apart, as everybody remembers, we \nproduced a proposal that should bring natural gas down from Alaska into \nChicago, a huge pipeline, one of America's major construction projects. \nI do not want to overstate the case because it is not in this bill, but \nwhat we are trying to say is everything put together, this is where we \nare going. When that is completed, there will be a huge new supply of \nnatural gas coming into our country, along with what we are discussing \nin this bill regarding other fronts. I will not give the details of \nwhat the ethanol provisions will do for our country, but it is obvious \nthat will be discussed many times over.\n\n  I can get it now. It will reduce crude oil imports by 2 billion \nbarrels and reduce the outflow of dollars to foreign oil producers by \n$64 billion. It will create 234,000 new jobs. It will add $200 billion \nto the GDP between 2005 and 2012, and it will create $6 billion in new \ninvestment, much to go to States that are currently called rural States \nthat truly need the economic development that will come with it.\n  Actually, because it is agricultural products and because of the add-\non that will occur in the development of ethanol, U.S. household \nincomes could, indeed, go up substantially overall, as much as $43 \nbillion.\n  This bill has provisions and ideas that came from every Senator. \nSenator Bingaman remembers on his side of the aisle four or five \nSenators have major provisions they got in this bill. Senator Bingaman \nand I negotiated out a number that were his ideas. I worked hard on the \nnuclear section. As I said, I think this bill, with the tax provisions, \nis going to cause a renaissance in nuclear power. In fact, I believe it \nis fair to say we will have a nuclear powerplant started in this \ncountry, ground turned, within 5 years--and I think that is the \noutside.\n  Three consortia applied for pre-permitting under our rather new law \nfor the expeditious handling of nuclear power permits. I mean \nexpeditious only in that they will not have to stop over so many times. \nIt will be clearly reviewed and have to meet standards, but they will \nnot stop six or eight times from the construction until the end.\n  And we do provide some assurance to those who will fund those \npowerplants that they will not get stuck midway through construction; \nthat they will be able to complete the powerplants.\n  I hope I have not neglected important issues, but the most important \nis we have done our very best to get a bipartisan bill. We have done \nour very best to send the right kind of messages to the world that, if \nwe get this, America is alive in terms of our energy security, our jobs \nfor the future, our competitiveness and reduction in the costs of some \nof the major basic energy sources, and, yes, cleaner air, cleaner \ncoal--cleaner electricity production. If you add it up, it is truly an \nAmerican Clean Energy Act.\n  With that, I understand my fellow colleague from New Mexico would \nlike to give his statement on the bill and I yield at this time.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Could the distinguished chairman or ranking \nmember of the committee inform the Senator from Florida at what point--\nmaybe after the caucus lunch--we will be able to huddle up to finalize \nthe suggested colloquy that we have been discussing?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The time got away. It is almost 12.\n  How long will my colleague take?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I should not take more than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Unless there is something intervening, the Senator can \nspeak right after that.\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Chairman, but I was asking a \ndifferent question. I was wondering when we would be able to have some \nsubstantive discussion on a future colloquy that we would have on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We all agreed that the next issue, the next item is \ngoing to be an amendment on ethanol. It is being gotten ready. We would \ntake it up, but you understand when you do ethanol it is not one \nperson, it is both sides of the aisle and 10 or 15 Senators. They are \nalmost finished. That will be the next item.\n  If you are referring to a colloquy with respect to coastal offshore \ndrilling, we are working on something with you and Senator Martinez, \nboth sides, and I don't know when we will have that ready. It is being \nworked on right now. But this side does not have any desire to delay \nthat. We have to bring Senator Landrieu and other Senators in on that--\nSenator Vitter--and we will do that as soon as we can, I assure you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first congratulate our chairman, \nSenator Domenici, on successfully bringing this bill through the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, and to the Senate floor. As \nhe indicated, the vote to report the bill from committee was 21 to 1--\nnearly unanimous. That vote is a testament, not only to what is \ncontained in the bill but also to the process he followed when moving \nthe bill to the Senate floor.\n  It has been over 4 years since President Bush released his energy \npolicy plan. I believe President Bush was right to want to fashion a \ncomprehensive energy policy for the Nation. President Clinton had such \na policy document put together by a task force under Secretary of \nEnergy Federico Pena. The first President Bush also had a national \nenergy strategy document that was put together by then-Secretary of \nEnergy James Watkins, after numerous public hearings around the \ncountry.\n  The fact that three successive Presidents have seen the need for \ncomprehensive energy policy illustrates an important fact; that is, a \ngood energy policy does not happen automatically. Energy markets are \nnot inherently free markets and the short-term thinking that drives \nmuch corporate behavior in America is often mismatched to the long-term \nenergy needs of the country.\n  As one example, if you look at the utility sector, you can see that \nour generation mix in recent years has strongly skewed toward new \nplants based on natural gas. But we now find that our long-term supply \npicture for natural gas cannot accommodate this additional demand \nwithout significant increases in price for all gas consumers.\n  Energy policy is something that requires intentional forethought and \nplanning. I remember former Chairman Bob Galvin of Motorola saying at \none point that there are certain things a country needs to set out to \ndo on purpose. I believe, along with my colleagues on the Democratic \nside, a good, comprehensive energy policy is one of those things. I \nbelieve what we should try to do on purpose can be summarized under \nfour basic principles.\n  The first principle is that we need to increase our supplies of \nenergy from all available sources. Every potential source of energy \nwill be required in order to meet our energy needs in the future. We \nneed to make sure that resources that have not yet been as extensively \ndeveloped as they might otherwise be, such as renewable energy, get the \npolicy assist they need to make their maximum contribution.\n  The second principle is we need to ensure that the energy we do \nproduce is transported as effectively as possible and is consumed as \nefficiently as possible. Our national energy system depends on a \ncritical infrastructure of ports and pipelines and transmission wires \nand other modes of moving energy from one place to another. Building \nand maintaining that infrastructure is difficult and it is expensive. \nWe need to make sure we have policies so consumers are not hurt by \nprice spikes and other problems caused by bottlenecks in the energy \nsystem.\n  Once energy reaches its point of end use, it is important that it not \nbe wasted. Improving the efficiency of energy use in appliances, in \ncommercial equipment, in industrial processes, and in transportation \nwill lead to two important goals: lowering the price for all energy \nusers and less strain on our energy infrastructure.\n  The third principle of a good, comprehensive energy policy is that we \nneed to make sure it meshes well with other important national \npolicies. It is especially important the energy policy have good \nsynergy with environmental policy. Nowhere is this more clear, in my \nview, than in the case of global warming. Mr. President, 98 percent of \nthe carbon dioxide produced in the United States is associated somehow \nwith energy production and use. We cannot afford an energy policy that \ndoes not take into account environmental and climate impact, just as we \ncannot afford to have a climate policy that ignores energy impacts.\n  Finally, because we rely heavily on market forces and signals to \nshape our energy choices, we need to be sure that we have energy \nmarkets that are transparent and that are fair to consumers. I believe \nwhen we have competitive energy markets that work fairly, everyone in \nthe energy chain, from the producer to the consumer, benefits.\n  As the California electricity crisis a few years ago showed--and not \njust the California crisis but the crisis that afflicted most of the \nwest coast--when energy markets are not structured properly, when those \nmarkets allow for hidden and manipulative practices, great economic \ndamage can be done.\n  These four principles are the foundation I hope we have before us in \nthis energy bill that is coming to the Senate for consideration. I \nbelieve the Senate will ultimately be judged in the area of energy \npolicy, first by whether our bill makes a concrete difference in \nbringing new energy resources and technologies into the mix; second, by \nwhether we make sure that we use advanced technology to save as \nmuch energy as possible; third, by our ability to protect the \nenvironment and respond to challenges such as global warming; and, \nfinally, by our ability to shape energy markets for the future that \nprotect and empower consumers.\n\n  At the beginning of the markup of the bill in the Energy Committee, I \nexpressed my appreciation to my colleague, Senator Domenici, for the \nway he and his staff had worked with Democratic Members and staff in \npreparing for the markup. I told him that he deserved great credit for \na good start, and I looked forward to working with him to see if we \ncould have a similarly good finish in the committee.\n  We had a very good finish in the committee. We are now having a good \nstart on the Senate floor. This bill is a good starting point, but \nthere are several important issues with which we need to deal in the \nfull Senate that we were not able to address in committee. Three of \nthese issues deal with providing more certainty to all those associated \nwith our energy system so that they can make rational investments in \nthe energy technologies of the future.\n  First, we need to provide renewable energy with a more certain place \nin our future. Renewable energy provides nowhere near the contribution \nto our energy mix today that it could or that it should. In the last \nCongress, we expanded the scope of production tax credits for renewable \nenergy, but these tax credits expire after only a very short time. \nThus, they do not provide the needed long-term market signals. I \nbelieve we need to supplement these tax credits with a long-term \nnational renewable electricity standard. By having a clear, certain \nrequirement that 10 percent of all electricity generation comes from \nrenewables in the year 2020, we would give industry the certainty it \nneeds to successfully undertake new projects to improve the diversity \nof our electricity generation mix and to relieve some of the pressure \nthat is leading to high natural gas prices.\n  Second, we need to deal responsibly with global warming. The electric \nindustry and many other sectors of our economy are gripped with \nuncertainty about the future of carbon-based energy and products in a \nworld that is increasingly concerned about global warming. There is a \nneed for certainty about the regulatory framework that would be in \neffect regarding future investments to ameliorate the threat of global \nwarming. Under our current voluntary approach to the problem we will \nlikely never see these new investments,\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nnot because they are not needed but because the economic picture is so \nclouded.\n  Third, we need more clarity on how we plan to deal with our \ndependence on foreign oil. We need to see if we can spur additional \npetroleum production in a way that is environmentally responsible, and \nwe need to see if we can find ways to use less oil in the American \neconomy. If we can trim the growth in our national demand for oil, we \nwill relieve both our dependence on imports and the pressure on our \nnational infrastructure of oil terminals and pipelines and refineries, \nall of which are operating near their capacity today.\n  An energy bill is a place for clear purposes. I hope that when the \nfull Senate has completed its consideration of this measure, it will \nhave expressed a willingness to take clear and forceful new action to \nensure that our energy future is clean and abundant and affordable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will address some initial \ncomments to both the chairman and the ranking member of the committee. \nSenator Bingaman and the chairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, \nhave been very kind as we have discussed what is in the interests of my \nState and other coastal States. I will lay out my case. I want everyone \nto understand this is the initial laying out of the case. I hope the \nversion I will give, over the next 15 or 20 minutes, will be the only \nspeech I have to give on the subject of oil drilling off the coast of \nFlorida. I hope we are not going to have to address this issue. I hope \nI will not have to address this because somebody--a Member of this \nSenate--will not be coming forth with an amendment to change the \nexisting moratorium on oil drilling off the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  The United States is depicted on this map in green; the Outer \nContinental Shelf area subject to the moratorium is off the Pacific \ncoast from Washington in the North down to the southern end of \nCalifornia; on the Atlantic coast, off the tip of Maine all the way \ndown to Florida; and the Outer Continental Shelf off of the gulf coast \nof Florida. This area depicted in blue is where there are existing, \nactive leases for oil and gas drilling off of the coast of Alabama, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.\n  A better description of this is depicted in this map. Before I get to \nthe details, I hope this Senator from Florida and this Senator's \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Martinez, do not have to give lengthy \nspeeches. We are prepared to utilize the rules of the Senate in order \nto keep this moratorium in place. It is not only the Senators from \nFlorida who are interested in this, but the Senators from Georgia, \nSouth Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New \nJersey, New York, and all the way up into New England, as well as the \nSenators from California, Oregon, and Washington State.\n  There are a lot of Senators who, particularly when the geology shows \nthere is not much oil and gas, have other interests we have to face in \na tradeoff. What are those? In Florida, obviously, it is the \nextraordinary $50-billion-a-year tourism industry, as evidenced by some \nof the most pristine beaches in the world which spawn a major part of \nthe attraction to our guests that come to Florida to enjoy this kind of \nenvironment. Or this kind of environment: An extraordinary place of \nclear water, of beautiful beach sand--places that people love to come \nto for vacation and to enjoy the bounty of our extraordinary nature in \nour State.\n  That, of course, is one reason we do not want oil rigs out there. We \ndo not want oil rigs because of the chance of despoiling that \nenvironment. Think of the Senators from Georgia. They have a place \ncalled Sea Island. They have a place called Jekyll Island. They have a \nNational Park in a place called Cumberland Island. Beautiful beaches.\n  Imagine the Senators from South Carolina looking at the extraordinary \npart of the economy of their State that comes in from those beautiful \nbeaches they have. Myrtle Beach is an example.\n  Or look at the Senators from North Carolina, the extraordinary beauty \nthey have. Guests to their State, including their own citizens, want to \ngo to beaches like that.\n  Oil rigs off the beaches are not compatible with keeping a site like \nthat or like that. But there are many more reasons I will get into. I \nhope this is the only speech I will have to make. I take the chairman \nand the ranking member at their word, that they have, in fact, been \ndealing with me in good faith. We are trying to work out the language \nof a colloquy that assures the Senators from these coastal States that \nthe leadership of the committee handling the bill before the Senate \nwould not support a lifting of the moratorium that allows the drilling.\n  However, it is particularly important to me and to Senator Martinez \nfrom the State of Florida because the place the administration wants to \ndrill is a place called Lease Sale 181, a place drawn back years ago, \nincluding about 6 million acres. In 2001, along with then-Senator \nGraham, this Senator from Florida, the Governor of Florida, the \nGovernor negotiated a line that is the Alabama-Florida line, an \nimaginary line due south from the border of Alabama and Florida, near \nPerdido Key, and that there would not be any part of that lease sale \nthat would be agreed to.\n  Thus, as to that 6 million acres in Lease Sale 181, 4 years ago in \n2001, what was agreed was there would be approximately 1.5 million \nacres offered for lease but this would be off the coast of Alabama, not \noff the coast of Florida. Since then, that 1.5 million acres has been \noffered for lease and that is proceeding through exploratory wells. \nHowever, it is not off of Florida.\n  Why are these coastal Senators so exercised, especially the two \nSenators from Florida? Because the administration wants to expand now \ninto the rest of that 4.5 million acres that begins what we see as an \ninevitable march toward the coast of Florida. That was not the \nagreement in 2001. But the administration is now trying to change that \nagreement.\n\n  That is where we are prepared, as the Senators from Florida, to take \nour stand and not allow additional drilling.\n  I return to where I started. I hope this is the only major speech I \nhave to make in the Senate on the discussion of the Energy bill, other \nthan other amendments I am involved in. This Senator and his colleague, \nSenator Martinez, are prepared to use the rules of the Senate--\nincluding extended debate, if necessary--in order to prevent drilling \noff the coast of Florida.\n  It is instructive to look at the entire Gulf of Mexico on this map \ngenerated by the Minerals Management Service, MMS, that shows in green \nthe active oil and gas leases. As this shows, clearly, they are west of \nthe State of Florida. There is a reason for that. The reason, \nprimarily, is that the geology shows this is where the oil and gas is \nlocated. We can see by the darkness of the green that a lot of that is \nright off the coast of the State of Louisiana.\n  There is also a reason we do not see this area with active leasing \noff the coast of Florida. Because where there were leases, they have \nbeen bought back, either under agreements with the administration and \nthe Governor of Florida, as in the case of the Destin Dome, which is \nright here off Pensacola and Fort Walton--although there are two tracks \nor blocks there that are still available for lease after the year 2012.\n  There is a reason why we do not see any here. All of those leases off \nthe southwest coast of Florida have been bought back under the \nadministration of the previous President Bush.\n  There is another reason we do not see any, and that is because of the \ngeology. They have done a bunch of test wells in the eastern gulf and \nthey have come up dry.\n  And there are more reasons. In the course of my explaining all of \nthese reasons, let me say this is not the first time this Senator has \nbeen involved in trying to keep drilling off the coast of Florida. When \nthis Senator was a Member of the House of Representatives, in the \nmiddle 1980s, representing a district that included east central \nFlorida--Orlando, Cape Canaveral, my hometown of Melbourne, this \ngeneral area of the east coast of Florida--there was a Secretary of the \nInterior named James Watt, under President Reagan, who was bound and \ndetermined he was going to offer for sale leases for oil and gas \ndrilling from Cape Hatteras, NC, all the way south to Fort Pierce, FL. \nThis\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\nSenator, then a member of the House of Representatives, went to work to \ndefeat it, and defeated it in the Appropriations Committee of the \nHouse.\n  But 2 years later, under the next Secretary of the Interior named Don \nHodell, they came back with the same plan in the mid-1980s. At that \npoint, they were bound and determined they were going to start \ndrilling. They were going to start drilling off the coast of the State \nof the Presiding Officer sitting in the chair of the President of the \nSenate right now. They were going to drill all the way down to Fort \nPierce. We finally beat it but it was a tough fight.\n  But the way we did it was we explained that you simply cannot have \noil and gas rigs out in the Atlantic where you are dropping the solid \nrocket boosters from the space shuttle and where you are dropping the \nfirst stages of the expendable booster rockets coming out of the Cape \nCanaveral Air Force Station.\n  A major national asset: our Eastern Test Range, where we fire our \nrockets into equatorial orbit and where, in our manned space program, \nlikewise, we are launching the space shuttle into equatorial orbit.\n  Well, we have a similar reason now of why we want to keep oil and gas \nrigs on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico because one of the major \nnational assets of the United States is called restricted airspace. It \nis where we train our military pilots. We have--this area here is just \nthe State of Florida, but the State of Florida is so key, off of the \nnortheast coast of Florida and off of the State of Georgia--restricted \nairspace, but particularly here in the Eglin Gulf Test and Training \nRange, which you can see, as depicted by the white on the map, is \nalmost the entire eastern section of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Why is this a major national asset? Because it is hard to create \nrestricted airspace in order to train our military pilots. When Vieques \nclosed down--that was the little island off of the eastern end of \nPuerto Rico where the Navy trained its pilots, all for the Atlantic \nregion--when that was shut down because of the government and the \npeople of Puerto Rico wanting it shut down, where do you think most of \nthat training had to come? It had to come right here, and it is \noperating out of these military facilities all along the panhandle.\n  It includes ranges actually in the State of Florida. But with the \nadvance of technology, computers can now create virtual battlefields on \nthe surface of the ocean--in this case, the surface of the Gulf of \nMexico--in which these pilots can then train for their missions.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot be training by dropping your \nordnance in an area of the Gulf of Mexico where there are oil and gas \nrigs. You cannot have coordinated training exercises with the Navy on \nthe ocean surface, the Navy underwater, and the Navy in the air, if you \nare having to deal with oil rigs. So it is another reason we simply \nhave to have other considerations when the administration says they \nwant to come in with lease sale 181, which is a place, almost in the \nmiddle of this Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range.\n\n  By the way, why is it that most of the Navy concentrated student \npilot training is now at Pensacola Naval Air Station and Whiting Field? \nWhy is it that the joint service fighter, the F-35, training for all \nbranches of the service is being done at Eglin? And why is the training \nfor the new stealth fighter, the F-22, being done at Tyndall Air Force \nBase? Why? Because they have plenty of restricted airspace in which to \ntrain. So that is another reason we do not want to have oil rigs off \nthe coast of Florida.\n  In the lengthier version of my remarks, which I hope I do not have to \ngive, I can give you additional reasons why we do not want it. I can \nshow you all kinds of pictures that are imprinted in our memories of \nwhat oil does to a beach, of what oil does to sea life and waterfowl, \nand of what oil does in spills that are trying to be contained and yet \ngoing out of control.\n  In the lengthier version of these remarks that I hope I do not have \nto give, I can show you plenty of pictures that are not the kind of \npictures that any one of us coastal State Senators who now have a \nmoratorium on oil and gas production want to have--none of us. Yet it \nis real. The possibility is there.\n  So what we are facing is a situation that if we cannot get agreement \nfrom the chairman and the ranking member that they will oppose a change \nin the moratorium on this oil and gas drilling off the coast of and on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf, we have no choice but to use the tools \navailable to us in the Senate rules to prolong debate and to utilize \nvarious parliamentary procedures in which to get our point across.\n  I do not think that is going to be necessary because of the good will \nof the chairman and the ranking member. As I speak, there are \nnegotiations going on with our staffs in order to come to an agreement \non colloquy language between Senator Martinez and me and the chairman \nand the ranking member stating that they would oppose any of these \namendments that would allow this expansion of drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf and lease sale 181, which is off the coast of \nFlorida.\n  Mr. President, there is another reason; that is, Florida is this \nunique environment where all the forces of nature come together along \nour coast. If it is not the barrier islands that have the beautiful, \npristine beaches that you have seen in these pictures, it is the parts \nof Florida that are the critically delicate estuaries and mangroves \nsuch as in the Big Bend of Florida and down south of Marco Island in \nthis incredible area of mangroves called the 10,000 Islands that is so \nabsolutely necessary as a part of the ending of the sheet flow of water \nthat is called the River of Grass, known as the Everglades of Florida--\na unique environmental feature in the world itself.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield without losing \nhis right to the floor?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will yield to the chairman. You caught me in \nmidsentence. I was about to talk about the fragility of the Keys of \nFlorida, but I want to yield to my chairman because he is such a great \nchairman and he is such a good friend.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Go ahead, Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. No, I want to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I was just wondering, we \nunderstand your genuine concern. You are going to have plenty of \nopportunity as this bill moves along to make sure that your State is \nprotected. What I would like to do, since we are going to have to go \nout because of your caucus--we do not have ours today--I wonder if you \nmight consider making this first statement of yours kind of abbreviated \nso Senator Dorgan could have a little opportunity before we break. Then \nwe would take our break, and, hopefully, we would have ethanol ready. \nYou would not lose anything, obviously. The floor is going to be open \nto you, and you can state what you wish to state beyond what you have \nspoken here today.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Well, of course I want to work with the \nchairman. Over the weekend, this Senator sprained a muscle in his right \nleg, and the last thing he wants to do is have to stand on his feet \nwith this injured leg for hours and hours. So I want to work in good \nfaith with the Senator from New Mexico in working out the colloquy. \nThis Senator would clearly want that colloquy to come sooner rather \nthan later, as soon as our staffs finish it.\n  I, of course, will yield for Senator Dorgan to make his statement, \nsince we are going out in just a few minutes.\n  I will just conclude by saying, I don't think there are many \nAmericans who do not know the beauty and the fragility of the Florida \nKeys and the coral reefs there. That is another one of the reasons we \nhave to be so sensitive about drilling off the coast of Florida.\n  So at the chairman's request, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to say to the Senate, the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Florida, Mr. Martinez, has spoken \nwith this chairman on numerous occasions about this issue. He continues \nto be as concerned as Senator Nelson about this issue. We are working \nwith him--I am not sure how it is all going to turn out in terms of a \ncolloquy, but we do not intend to do anything to harm Florida. We have \nalready told everybody that. It is very hard to make broad-based \ncommitments in advance, and it is not just up to me. There are other \nSenators, including Senator Bingaman. But we are doing our best.\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\n  I want everybody to understand that both Senators are working very \nhard at this.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges of the floor \nbe granted to members of staff who will be listed hereinafter. They are \nmembers of the committee who will have to spend time, from time to \ntime, on the floor. And I ask unanimous consent that their names be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list of names is as follows:\n\n       Karen Billups, Colin Hayes, Lisa Epifani, Kelly Donnelly, \n     John Peschke, Frank Macchiarola, Frank Gladics, Dick Bouts, \n     Carole McGuire, Marnie Funk, Kathryn Clay, Josh Johnson, \n     Clint Williamson, and Amy Millet.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of \nfellows and interns of the Democratic staff of the Finance Committee be \nallowed on the Senate floor for the duration of the debate on the \nEnergy Bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n       Brian Townsend, Cuong Huynh, Richard Litsey, Jorlie Cruz, \n     Mary Baker, Stuart Sirkin, Andrea Porter, Ashley Sparano, \n     Drew Blewett, Jake Kuipers, Rob Grayson, Katherine Bitz, \n     Danny Shervin, Paul Turner, Heather O'Loughlin, Julie Golden, \n     Julie Straus, and Adam Elkington.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator, \nMr. Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senate is about to \ngo out for the caucus on our side. It is customarily held on Tuesdays. \nMy thought is, perhaps when we come back--I believe at 2:15, by \nprevious consent; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am wondering if it might be appropriate for me to be \nrecognized at 2:15 for 15 minutes. Then, at that point, Senator \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman will proceed with whatever agreement they \nare going to have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no objection, as long as it is understood I \nhave the floor when we return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request would be that \nSenator Dorgan--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from New Mexico would have the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. At 2:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would start at 2:15. That is my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I heard the statement by my colleague from \nFlorida. He is aggressive and persuasive. I must say, in the committee \nwe have already had some of these discussions by some who would want to \nopen the Outer Continental Shelf and have more drilling and have a \nState election and so on. We already had some of that discussion, and I \ndo not know whether anybody can agree in advance to prohibit \namendments. You cannot agree to that, certainly, or agree to oppose \namendments you do not know exist.\n  But I would say to the Senator from Florida, I do not think there is \na ghost of a chance of us finishing this energy bill and having it \ncarry some new mandate for Outer Continental Shelf production. That is \njust not going to happen, in my judgment. I think the reason it is not \ngoing to happen, at least in part, is for the reasons my colleague from \nFlorida has described with his charts of what it would do to Florida. \nAnd it also relates to some concerns in other areas as well dealing \nwith the Outer Continental Shelf and areas that have been set aside.\n  I just want to say, I understand the presentation. I did not mean to \nbe here to interrupt it. I would like to make a general statement at \n2:15 about the bill which, incidentally, I think is an excellent bill. \nIt is the best energy bill we have brought to the Senate for several \ndecades, in my judgment. I am going to support a couple of additions to \nit here and there. We have not done the energy independence approach, \nwhat is called the renewable portfolio standard. We will do that and \nsome other things.\n  I am proud of this bill. This is a bipartisan effort, which is \nunusual in the Senate. I hope this starts a new habit. This legislation \nmoves this country in the right direction in a significant way. \nAcknowledging the concern of my colleague from Florida, when the dust \nsettles, I think he will understand that the battle he wages is one he \nwill win because I don't believe the Senate is going to add the \nconcerns he expresses about Outer Continental Shelf production.\n  I am pleased to come back at 2:15 and make a more general statement. \nI thank my colleagues from Florida and New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6445-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I will be \nrecognized for the first 15 minutes and at 2:30, I believe, Senator \nDomenici will be recognized; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make a brief opening comment \nabout the Energy bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  First, I think the product of the Energy Committee is a bill that \nadvances this country's interests. I think the work done by Senator \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman is quite extraordinary. At a time when \nthere is so much partisanship and division and so much difficulty in \ngetting together, this bill was the product of two Senators--\ncoincidentally, from the same State--who decided to write a bipartisan \nbill. So the result was a vote in the committee of 21 to 1 for this \nEnergy bill.\n  I think the bill is progressive and strong and advances our country's \ninterests. First, I wanted to say thanks to both of them. I think what \nwe have is a good bill. I am going to vote for some amendments that I \nthink will strengthen it. Such as one we did not include in committee \nthat would move us toward energy independence by requiring 10 percent \nof the electricity to be produced from renewable sources of energy. We \ncall that a renewable portfolio standard. That needs to be in the bill. \nI will vote for an amendment to deal with that. There are other issues \nas well that would advance us toward greater energy independence that I \nwill support.\n  The question for us is how do we remove for America the addiction to \nforeign sources of oil? If I were to have a barrel of oil on the floor \nof the Senate--and we use over 20 million of them every single day--and \nthat barrel of oil were transparent, you would find out the first 40 \npercent of that barrel was oil we produced in this country, and the \nnext 60 percent is oil we get elsewhere. From where does it come? It \ncomes from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Venezuela--very troubled parts \nof the world. We are hopelessly and dangerously addicted to oil from \ntroubled parts of the world. God forbid, tomorrow morning a terrorist \nwould interrupt the supply of oil coming into this country. Our \neconomy--the American economy--would be in deep trouble.\n  I remember listening and watching the Indianapolis 500 this year, as \nI have done ever since I was a young boy. This year was different \nbecause a woman was a race car driver, Danica Patrick, who drove her \nrace car 220 miles an hour. I believe it was seven or eight or nine \nlaps from the end of the race, and guess who was winning. The only \nwoman who was racing in the Indianapolis 500; this young 23-year-old \nwoman was leading the race. But they worried she was going to run out \nof fuel because she had not had a pit stop, and they worried she would \nnot make it to the end. So she had to back off a little, worried about \nrunning out of gas. I think she took fourth place in the Indianapolis \n500, and she captured the hearts of the country. We are going to hear a \nlot about her.\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\n  But her future in the Indianapolis 500 in the final laps had to do \nwith whether she had enough gas to finish the race? It is an \nappropriate question for the country. Will we run out of gas? It is \ndangerous for our country to be this addicted to oil from off our \nshores. So we need now to find a way to change that. Every moment, from \nthe time we wake up in the morning until we go to bed at night, we take \nenergy for granted. Energy comes in the form of a light switch. It \ncomes in the form of pressing on the accelerator of your car. It is the \ngas pump, the air conditioner, the furnace, the refrigerator. Energy is \nall around us, and we take it for granted. We use it every day, and we \ndon't think about it.\n  But wonder for a moment what would happen if that energy were not \navailable. We use a prodigious amount of energy. We live on Earth and \nwe circle the Sun and there are 6 billion of us living on this planet--\n6 billion. And every single month, we add to this planet the equivalent \nof the population of a New York City. There is only one place on the \nplanet that resembles the United States of America, and we are lucky to \nbe living here and living now. But, we use an enormous amount of \nenergy. We use a great deal of energy--more per capita, by far, than \nany other country on Earth.\n  Meanwhile the Chinese have 1.4 billion people. They now have 20 \nmillion cars and they are going to have 120 million cars by 2020, they \nsay. They want more energy and will need more.\n  So the question for this country is: Can we, and will we, maintain \nthe standard of living, maintain the kind of country we want to be, and \nproduce the opportunity we want for our children, being as dependent as \nwe are upon oil from sources outside our country? The answer clearly is \nno. Things have to change.\n  They must change. We put gasoline in cars now the same way we did 100 \nyears ago. Nothing has changed. This piece of legislation begins moving \nus down the road toward change. This legislation has parts that include \nproduction. We incentivize additional production of fossil fuels and, \nyes, we are going to produce more coal, oil, and natural gas. Yes, we \nwill use more fossil fuels. But, if that is all we do--if all we do is \ndig and drill, I call that ``yesterday forever.'' That is a strategy, \n``yesterday forever,'' and every 25 years we will hang around this \nChamber and wear our blue suits and slough around the halls and come to \ntalk about an Energy bill that is ``yesterday forever''--dig and drill, \ndig and drill. It doesn't work.\n  We are digging and drilling, and we have 60 percent of the oil coming \nfrom off our shores. We must, and we do, incentivize additional fossil \nfuels production in this bill. We want to get, through clean coal \ntechnology, to zero emissions, coal-fired electric generating plants, \nand I think we can and will. So fossil fuels are important--oil, coal, \nand natural gas. This bill does much, much more than that.\n\n  This bill has a very robust conservation proposal. Saving a barrel of \noil is the same as producing one, and we waste an enormous amount of \nenergy. The bill has an efficiency title that is very important, with \nstandards on everything we use every day, such as appliances and so on. \nIt also has a renewables provision that is very important. We want to \nsupport and encourage renewable energy. Growing energy in our farm \nfields makes a lot more sense than requiring energy from under the \nsands of Saudi Arabia. There are biodiesel, ethanol, wind, geothermal, \nsolar, and so many other forms of renewable energy.\n  Finally, there is a title that I played a significant role in helping \nto write, in addition to ethanol and others, and that is the hydrogen \ntitle. I believe we will ultimately have to pole-vault to a different \nkind of energy future. If our grandchildren are still running gasoline \nthrough carburetors, such as in the old cars or the fuel injectors that \nare on the new cars, then we have failed. If the automobiles on our \nroads are still consuming gasoline through the fuel injectors, then we \nhave failed. That is why I believe the hydrogen and fuel cell future is \nour future. Hydrogen is everywhere. The fact is, with hydrogen and fuel \ncells, you get twice the efficiency of power to the wheel and water \nvapor off the tailpipe. We will get twice the efficiency of power to \nthe wheel, and we can escape the addiction to gasoline for our \nvehicles. That is the futuristic approach to the title in this bill \nthat deals with hydrogen and fuel cells.\n  Mr. President, we have done some awfully good work here, in my \njudgment. I will support an amendment that sets targets and timetables \nto be even more aggressive and to reduce dependence on foreign oil by \n40 percent in 2020. We went to the Moon in 10 years, so we can \ncertainly achieve this in almost 20 years. It is kind of a fixation \nwith this ``black gold,'' as they call it, that we have had in this \ncountry, for a long, long time. We need it. We need it desperately to \nrun our economy.\n  I remember when I was a small boy--and I grew up in a town of 300 \npeople--they drilled an oil well 2 miles outside of town. In a town of \n300 people, there is not a lot going on, except on a Saturday night \nwhen the bars are open and the barber gives haircuts until midnight and \nthe cafe; stays open until midnight and the town is full of cars from \nfarmers. There is not a lot going on in that town of 300 people, except \nfor that Saturday night, when an oil well was drilled, and they put up \nthe oil rig 2 miles from town. I remember that everybody from town \nwould drive out there almost every day to look at the oil rig and all \nthose lights. It was exciting. Nothing happened, nothing moved. It \nshined. It was the only thing around that shined. So you would drive \nout there and sit and watch that oil well. As they were digging with \nthat big rig and all of the flashing lights, we thought this is going \nto change our life forever. It turns out it was a dry hole. I have \nnever forgotten the excitement of the search for oil, the building of \nthe rig, the lighting of the rig.\n  This country has been transfixed by that for well over a century and \na half now. But the fact is, we are living on borrowed time for the \nkind of economy we have produced in this country, if we believe we can \ncontinue without change. That is why this bill is such an important \npiece of legislation.\n  I have mentioned a few of the areas in this legislation that are \nimportant. I don't want to go into great detail, but ethanol is a \ncritically important alternative source of energy. As I said, growing \nenergy in the fields is a wonderful way to extend America's energy \nsupply. Biodiesel, exactly the same. Wind energy--taking energy from \nthe wind in this country and turning it into electricity, using the \nelectricity through the process of hydrolysis to take hydrogen from \nwater and use it in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles--what a wonderful \npromise for this country's energy future.\n  That is exactly what we do in this legislation. We set targets and \ntimetables in this legislation to try to convert America's vehicle \nfleet to hydrogen fuel cells. That is why this is so important. We have \nhad now several years of stop and start and kind of stuttering around \non energy. It is time for all of us, the President and the Congress and \nboth political parties to understand the urgency of the need to get a \nworkable energy bill. Not just any other energy bill, but one that \nlooks to the future and relieves this dangerous addiction that we have \nfor foreign oil. I would love, someday, to be able to tell the Saudis \nyou can drink your oil, we don't need it; we are no longer dependent \nupon oil under the sands of the Middle East. I would love to have that \nopportunity. But we cannot now. If we are smart, and if we write an \nenergy bill, including the one that now comes to the floor of the \nSenate and one we can improve, one that came out of the Energy \nCommittee by a vote of 21 to 1--if we stick to this through conference \nand get a bill to the President, a good bill, I think this country will \nrecognize good work, and this country will recognize that its future is \nfar more secure because of what we have done.\n  I know the White House, today, issued a letter that said they are \ngoing to oppose what is called a renewable portfolio standard; that is, \nthe move toward independence by requiring 10 percent of your \nelectricity to be made from renewables. Look, we understand there are \npeople who are going to oppose everything. That is the way it is. Mark \nTwain once said he would always be happy to debate as long as he could \ntake the opposing side. He said it doesn't matter what the subject is, \nthe opposing side will take no preparation.\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\nWe understand about all these people who oppose everything. The White \nHouse is opposing this standard that would require 10 percent of our \nelectricity to come from renewables. That makes no sense. What are they \nthinking about?\n  Let us just write the best bill we can write. We have an awfully good \nstart on that thanks to Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman. When we \nare done, we will have done something very significant for this \ncountry's future.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 775\n\n            (Purpose: To provide a substitute for the bill)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the committee substitute is at the desk. \nI ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 775.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the substitute is \nagreed to and is considered as original text for amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 775) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I am going to depart the floor and let the managers manage \nthis bill, as they should. They are some of our most experienced \nSenators. The only thing I want to make sure is that the record is \nclear that following the offering of the amendment the Senator from New \nMexico, or someone in his stead, is going to offer an ethanol \namendment, and that the next amendment in order would be the Cantwell \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, does the Senator \nunderstand there may be some amendments to ethanol?\n  Mr. REID. Of course, I certainly understand that. I am only talking \nabout first-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am waiting now momentarily for the final text of the \nethanol amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 779\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration. This amendment is the ethanol \namendment. It is bipartisan in nature. I offer it in behalf of myself \nand Senators Thune, Harkin, Lugar, Dorgan, Frist, Obama, Grassley, \nBayh, Bond, Nelson of Nebraska, Brownback, Hagel, Conrad, DeWine, \nDayton, Talent, Stabenow, Coleman, and Salazar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. Thune, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n     Obama, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bond, Mr. Nelson of \n     Nebraska, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Conrad, \n     Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Talent, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n     Coleman, and Mr. Salazar, proposes an amendment numbered 779.\n\n  (The Amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am sure this matter will take a little \nbit of time this afternoon, and from what we understand--I am not \nassured--there may be one, maybe two, perhaps even three amendments. \nBut this is an amendment that has been worked on by Republican and \nDemocrat members of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee. Essentially, from the energy \nand natural resources bill it has the 8 billion gallons, but the rest \nof the language has been worked out with most of the jurisdiction going \nback to the Environment and Public Works Committee rather than the \nEnergy Committee.\n  Let me say I am pleased with the agreement, the improvement that is \nincluded in it. For that I am grateful to Chairman Inhofe and his \nstaff. They have helped immeasurably. Senators Talent and Johnson and \nFeinstein and Cantwell have been very helpful during the Energy \nCommittee considerations. Chairman Inhofe's assistance has been \ninvaluable after we had done our work in our committee.\n  We now have before us what I think is a very important amendment, one \nthat helps us make a significant step forward in the development of a \ndomestic renewable resource.\n  This represents progress toward developing transport fuels made from \ndomestic sources that can lessen dependence on foreign oil to meet our \nfuel needs. Congress has been working on the renewable fuel standard \nfor nearly 6 years. I hope this will be the year that it passes. I \nfully support our raising the expectations that we have by including a \ngoal of 8 billion gallons of ethanol in the national motor fuel mix by \n2012. It is my firm belief that we must take every opportunity \navailable in order that we help ourselves to produce more of the fuel \nthat is part of our transportation activity in this great country.\n  In addition to making us less dependent on foreign sources for \nenergy, increasing the production of domestic ethanol will help keep \nwithin our economy dollars that would otherwise be spent acquiring \nenergy from overseas. And it will create jobs. One important analysis \nsuggests that an 8 billion gallon renewable fuel standard will benefit \nthe economy greatly. That analysis suggests it will reduce crude oil \nimports by 2 billion barrels; that, coupled with the 1 billion we have \nmandated in our bill, makes 3 billion, and it will reduce the outflow \nof dollars to foreign oil producers by $64 billion. It would create \n234,000 jobs in all sectors of the economy, and clearly in many of the \nvery large rural States of the West and Southwest.\n  It would add about $200 billion to the GDP between 2005 and 2012. It \ncould create $6 billion in new investments. That is a significant \ninfrastructure addition to our country. And it could increase--in fact, \nthis study says it would increase--household incomes by about $43 \nbillion.\n  The amendment also makes provision for increasing our output of \nbiofuels from cellulosic biomass. Many in industry and the scientific \ncommunity believe that this area holds enormous promise for vastly \nincreasing domestic production of ethanol from this renewable resource.\n  The Energy Information Administration estimates that oil consumption \nand crude oil and finished petroleum product imports will continue to \nrise. Further, with gasoline prices hovering at record levels and \ndomestic crude oil production declining, it strikes this Senator that \nwe should be doing everything we can to maximize the production and use \nof clean, renewable, domestically produced energy such as ethanol and \nbiodiesel.\n  Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that in our spirit of \nbipartisanship on the Energy Committee that amendments were included \nallowing a seasonal adjustment for California and increases in the use \nof biofuels sponsored by Senators Feinstein and Cantwell, respectively.\n  Now, we are prepared to begin consideration of any amendments our \ncolleagues would like to offer to this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor and designate on our side that Senator \nLarry Craig manage the bill.\n  I have checked this with the other side. There was a unanimous \nconsent request that this amendment would be introduced now as the \nfirst amendment.\n  The unanimous consent request said then the Cantwell amendment would \nbe introduced. I ask that be vitiated.\n  So we know what will happen, instead of that, the record reflects we \nwill follow this tradition of the Senate, and after the ethanol \namendment we\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\nwill go to the Democrat side, to the distinguished minority leader or \nhis designee, for offering of an amendment of their choosing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Is there an objection to \nvitiating the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I encourage all of our colleagues who wish \nto engage in the debate on this major national energy policy from the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources to come to the Senate.\n  We have the ethanol section that came out of committee with some \nidentification now on the floor for debate and ultimately a vote that \nallows anyone who chooses to come to debate this or the whole \nlegislation.\n  I will become involved with my colleagues over the course of the \nafternoon and tomorrow in debating not only the total substance of the \nbill, which is tremendously positive and puts this Nation on a path \nforward toward an abundance of energy sources, but it also recognizes \nall of the technologies are involved.\n  If I were to give this bill a title that the American public ought to \nrefer to it as, I would call it ``America's Clean Energy Act'' because \nI think all we are about now and into the future as we adjust \ntechnologies, as we improve old forms of energy, as we bring old forms \ninto the new economy, all of them by definition, we are going to ask on \nbehalf of the American people for the cleaner source, and in many \ninstances, very clean sources.\n  I yield the floor for any who wish to debate the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nleadership and work on this issue.\n  I note the Senator from Florida is here. I will make my remarks on \nthe bill if he has time for me to do that. A lot of hard work has gone \ninto it.\n  I like the title the Senator from Idaho suggested, ``American Clean \nEnergy Act.'' I hope to explain why.\n  Let me step back a little bit and try to put what we are debating in \nsome context. September 11 was a terrible surprise for this country. \nBut we now know it shouldn't have been. During the 1980s and the 1990s \nterrorists attacked American interests around the world. If we had paid \nmore attention then, we might not have been surprised on September 11, \n2001.\n  The next big surprise to the United States will be to our \npocketbooks, to our ability to keep our jobs, and our high standard of \nliving in a more competitive world marketplace. We can avoid this \nsurprise if we pay attention to the warning signs. Many of these \nwarning signs have to do with energy. Suddenly, instead of the lowest \nnatural gas prices in the industrialized world, we have in our country \nthe highest natural gas prices in the industrialized world. Gasoline \nprices at the pump are at record levels. China and India are increasing \ntheir demand for energy and their purchases of oil reserves to supply \nit, which drives prices up. Because of high natural gas prices, \nmanufacturing and chemical jobs are moving overseas, farmers are taking \na pay cut, and consumers are paying too much to heat and cool their \nhomes.\n  We can avoid this next big surprise, a surprise to our pocketbooks, \nby enacting, as the Senator from Idaho called it, an American Clean \nEnergy Act that does the following things: First, lowers the price of \nnatural gas to American consumers. The price of natural gas to American \nconsumers is at about $7 a unit. Our economy was built on natural gas \nthat cost $2 or $3 a unit. If you work at Eastman Chemical in eastern \nTennessee, an area which has thousands of chemical jobs where blue-\ncollar workers and white-collar workers have had good wages for a long \ntime, this causes a massive problem because natural gas is the raw \nmaterial producing chemicals. If natural gas can be purchased overseas \nat one-half, 60 percent, or 70 percent of the cost here, and if natural \ngas is 40 percent of the cost of producing the chemical, where do you \nsuppose the 1 million blue-collar chemical industry jobs are going to \nbe 10 years from now? Not in Kingsport, TN. Not around this country.\n  First we need to lower the price of natural gas for blue-collar \nworkers. We need to lower it for farmers who are paying expensive \namounts for fertilizer. We need to lower it for homeowners.\n  Second, we need to help to increase the supply of oil worldwide and \nreduce the growth of our dependence on oil. The Senator from North \nDakota mentioned earlier we need to get over our addiction to foreign \noil. It would be nice if we could just forget it, but we are not going \nto be able to forget it. What we need to do, realistically, is to \nincrease the supply of oil worldwide because China and India and Brazil \nand Singapore and Malaysia all look over here and see we have 5 percent \nof the people, a third of the money, and we are consuming 25 percent of \nthe energy. They want some of the action, too. So they are buying up \noil reserves and keeping their smart people home and creating a demand \nthat raises our prices. And for the foreseeable future we will have to \ndepend upon some foreign oil. But we need to begin to reduce the growth \nof our dependence on oil. This bill does that.\n  Third, we need to move our country toward a more reliable supply of \nlow cost, American-produced energy, especially nuclear power, which \nproduces 70 percent of all of the carbon-free energy produced in the \nUnited States today. Let me repeat that: Nuclear power, a technology we \ninvented in the United States, produces 20 percent of our electricity, \nbut produces 70 percent of all of the carbon-free energy we have in the \nUnited States today.\n  Coal gasification and carbon sequestration are such long words that \nit took me a long time to figure out what we were talking about. We are \ntalking about taking coal--which we have a 400-year supply of in this \ncountry--turning it into gas, and then making electricity out of the \ngas.\n  For States such as Ohio, where the Presiding Officer is from, or \nTennessee, where I am from, and where we struggle with air pollution \nproblems, it gets rid of the sulfur air pollution problems and gets rid \nof nitrogen and mercury and just leaves carbon. If we can advance our \nresearch and development for carbon sequestration--that is, capturing \nthat carbon and putting it in the ground--then we will have for \nourselves and for the world a transformed way of producing electricity \nthat will provide a low-cost, reliable supply of American-produced \nclean energy in the amounts we need.\n  Finally, we need to produce energy in a way that as much as possible \nclears our air of sulfur, of nitrogen, of mercury, and of carbon. This \nshould all add up to an American Clean Energy Act of 2005, legislation \nthat puts our country on the path toward an adequate, low-cost supply \nof reliable, American-produced clean energy.\n  To accomplish this goal we must have aggressive changes in policy--\nand many of those are in this legislation as it is reported to this \ncommittee--aggressive energy efficiency and conservation, aggressively \ntransforming the way we produce electricity, such as advanced nuclear \nor coal gasification and carbon sequestration, aggressively researching \nfor new domestic supplies of energy, aggressively importing for the \ntime being liquefied natural gas and aggressive research and \ndevelopment into new forms of energy.\n  I believe we were fortunate we could not pass an energy bill last \nyear because circumstances have changed, and they have made this a \nbetter piece of legislation more likely to reach the broad goals I just \nmentioned. Specifically, high natural gas and oil prices this year make \nthe situation more urgent.\n  Next, because of this urgency, perhaps we better understand the \nthreat to our jobs from the growing demand for energy in India and \nChina and other parts of the world. Next, because of the time we have \nspent in hearings and debates--and Senator Craig and I and Senator \nMartinez and Democrat members, Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, we \nhave had long hearings on coal, long hearings on nuclear, long hearings \non gas--we have a better understanding of the new technology and what \nthe emerging consensus is in this country, especially regarding nuclear \nand coal gasification and carbon sequestration.\n\n  I think, in our committee, we have a near consensus about the \ndirection in which we ought to go on this very new way of going. That \nis an important development. We also see more clearly\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\nthe essential relationship between a clean Energy bill, which this is, \nand clean air legislation. So we come to the floor for debate not only \nwith a better clean Energy bill, but, as Senator Cantwell from \nWashington said at the end of our marking up of the committee bill, \nwith a cleaner process.\n  Everyone on the committee has had his or her say. Now, not all of us \ngot our way, but all of us had our say. And we had many votes. As \nSenator Bingaman said, they were almost never party-line votes. But \nthey reflected the different opinions and different regions of the \nmembers of the committee. As a result, we come to this floor with only \none dissenting vote in the committee of 22.\n  This bipartisanship, which has been mentioned many times, is the \nresult of a lot of hard work and patience by the chairman and ranking \nmember of our committee, Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman. They \nhave shown patience, they have shown tolerance, they have swallowed \nhard sometimes, and they deserve a lot of thanks for this legislation. \nThey have led us down a very good path.\n  Now we have a chance to make the bill even stronger. The Finance \nCommittee will recommend to us later this week tax incentives to \nfurther our goals. We will debate those. Then there are some important \nissues to be resolved about which we have some very different opinions, \nsuch as the Senator from North Dakota said we need to get rid of our \naddiction to foreign oil. Some people like CAFE standard increases. \nSome people like, as I do, incentives for hybrid cars, the efficient \ndispatch of natural gas; meaning encouraging States to send out of the \nmost efficient natural gas plants, first, the gas we use. The committee \ndid not adopt that, but I still think it is a good idea. We may hear \nfrom it again, maybe in an amended form.\n  A proposed renewable portfolio standard: The Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman, may propose that or others may. He thinks it is a \ngood idea. I think it is a bad idea. I think it is a tax on lots of \npeople around our country who will not be building windmills and who do \nnot need to pay higher taxes. They cannot afford it. I think it is an \nunnecessary Federal rule, when we have 17 States which, in their own \nways, already have renewable portfolio standards. But we will have a \nchance to debate that and vote on it and come to a conclusion.\n  We will be talking about carbon and global warming. There are a great \nmany ideas afloat within this Senate about that. I think it is fair to \nsay there is a growing consensus about needing to produce carbon-free \nor low-carbon energy. There is not a consensus yet on what to mandate \nor what to order. There is a debate about the proper allocation of \nresources to encourage renewable energy. Renewable fuel is about 2 \npercent of all the fuel we use in the United States. Renewable energy, \nother than hydro dams--water over dams--is about 2 percent of all that \nwe use. It is not going to be that much more. So we need to make sure \nthat, within the renewable fuels, we equitably allocate the dollars \nthat are spent as between geothermal and solar, for example, or solar \nand wind, for example, and that we make sure we are spending scarce \ndollars for programs and policies and incentives that will produce the \nlargest amount of carbon-free or low-carbon energy.\n  So I am confident we can deal with these issues and create an even \nstronger bill as we go to conference with the House of Representatives.\n  It is fashionable and correct to say these days that to help us get a \nbill through our committee to meet our energy needs, we need every kind \nof energy. I suppose if somebody proposed subsidizing building bonfires \nin the front yard to heat our house, we would probably put it in just \nto get a consensus in trying to move it all the way through.\n  But it is also correct, and I believe more important, especially when \nwe are challenged, as we are today, economically, to say we need \npriorities. So let me say, briefly, after participating in these 2 \nyears of discussions and hearings, what this one Senator believes our \npriorities ought to be if we really want to have an adequate, reliable \nsupply of American-produced clean energy so we can keep our jobs and \nour high standard of living and a more competitive world marketplace.\n  First, energy efficiency and conservation. Coming from the Republican \nside of the aisle, someone might say: That sounds a little odd. Maybe \nyou don't really mean that. Maybe you are just saying that to make \nDemocrats feel better. No. Energy efficiency and conservation is the \nbest strategy for immediately moderating natural gas prices and \nstabilizing longer term markets. In other words, if we really want to \nlower the price of natural gas from $7, the place to start is \nconservation and energy efficiency. It will do it quicker and faster \nthan anything else.\n  For example, the appliance efficiency standards in this legislation, \nwhich are twice as strong as last year's bill, should avoid the \nbuilding of 45 natural gas powerplants of 500 megawatts each and will \nsave consumers and businesses more than $57 billion through 2030, \naccording to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. So \n45 natural gas powerplants avoided.\n  The legislation also includes a 4-year national consumer education \nprogram that, when used in California, helped produce a 10-percent cut \nin peak demand, the equivalent of power produced by another 11 500-\nmegawatt powerplants. If we were to strengthen the bill by adding a \nprovision to encourage utilities to use first the electricity most \nefficiently produced from natural gas, we could save even more.\n  The oil savings amendment in this legislation will encourage the \nsavings of 1 million barrels of oil per day--per day--by the year 2015, \nabout the amount of energy produced by the projected drilling in ANWR. \nIt is also about the same amount of oil produced in onshore drilling in \nthe State of Texas. It is my hope that the tax incentive provisions \nrecommended by the Finance Committee will include the proposal of the \nNational Commission on Energy Policy, which Senator Bingaman has talked \nabout, to encourage the purchase of hybrid and advanced low diesel \nvehicles with a $2,000 tax deduction, as well as tax incentives to \nencourage the retooling of plants in the United States to build those \nvehicles, which would add another 39,000 auto manufacturing jobs.\n  In other words, we do not want to create an incentive to build hybrid \nvehicles and have them all built in Japan. We would like to have those \n39,000 manufacturing jobs in Minnesota and Tennessee and other States.\n  A second priority would be increased supply of domestic natural gas. \nThe next section of this legislation that would have the most immediate \nimpact on natural gas prices is the section streamlining the permitting \nof facilities for bringing liquefied natural gas, LNG, from overseas to \nthe United States. It gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \nFERC, we call it, the authority for siting and regulating these \nliquefied natural gas terminals.\n  It preserves States' authorities under the Coastal Zone Management \nAct and other acts. This would make it easier to import, for the time \nbeing, LNG from overseas, which is then added to our pipelines. To do \nthis, requires large terminals in which to temporarily store the gas. \nWe only have four such terminals. There are nearly three dozen \napplications pending for more terminals--some onshore, some offshore--\nbut the application process is laborious. This legislation accelerates \nthe decisionmaking process, while preserving a proper amount of input \nfrom local governments about the location of these terminals.\n  In addition, I believe it is time to explore, where appropriate, more \nof the vast natural gas reserves that we have offshore. This can be \ndone in ways that do not harm the coastlines or the landscapes. \nDrilling rigs can be put far offshore so they cannot be seen. States \ncan be given the option of deciding whether they will permit such \ndrilling and, in the process, collect some of the revenues.\n  I see the Senator from Florida waiting to speak. I saw his map a \nlittle earlier, and I know he is likely to talk about this subject. My \nfeeling about this is that if Virginia or North Carolina or Florida \nagree that they would like to put oil and gas rigs so far offshore they \ncannot see them, and use some of those revenues to build up their \nuniversities or lower their property taxes, I think they should be able \nto. But if the State of North Carolina\n\n[[Page S6450]]\n\nor Florida does not want to see those things and does not want them at \nall, I think they should have that option as well. Those are a number \nof things that would increase the supply of natural gas.\n\n  After conservation, after increased supply of LNG and domestic gas, \nmy third priority would be a new generation of nuclear power. This \nlegislation needs to include $2 billion for research and development \nand loan guarantees to help start at least two new advanced technology \nnuclear powerplants. The Senator from Idaho is a leader in this work. \nSo are both Senators from New Mexico. After conservation and increased \nsupplies of natural gas, expanding and building new nuclear powerplants \nstands virtually alone as America's best option for an immediate, \nsubstantial, and reliable supply of American-produced clean energy.\n  Why is that? One hundred and three nuclear powerplants today produce \n20 percent of America's energy, almost 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity. This is a technology we invented. Since the 1950s, the \nU.S. Navy has operated dozens of reactors--does so today--without ever \na single incident, regularly docking at ports on our coasts. France is \ntoday 80 percent powered by nuclear power. Japan is adding a nuclear \npowerplant a year. Yet the Tennessee Valley Authority's Browns Ferry \nplant is the first substantial nuclear startup since the 1970s.\n  If we are talking about carbon-free electricity, nuclear power is \nalready 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity. In an economy this \nbig, after we get through with conservation, after we import more LNG, \nnuclear power stands alone as our best option to have large amounts of \ncarbon-free electricity, and we need to get on with it.\n  Fourth, waiting in the wings is coal gasification and carbon \nsequestration. It is often said that America is the Saudi Arabia of \ncoal. We have a 500-year supply. Some say 400; some say 500. We have a \nlot. We have the technology to turn the coal into the gas and then burn \nthe gas to make electricity in a way that eliminates most of the \nnitrogen, sulfur, and mercury. That would put every county in Tennessee \nin compliance with Federal clean air standards. The Smoky Mountains \nwould still be smoky, but they wouldn't be smoggy. It would clean the \nair.\n  We are on the edge of being able also to recapture the carbon \nproduced in this process and store it underground. If we can add this \nclean coal process to nuclear power, one, we will lower natural gas \nprices for farmers, homeowners, and blue-collar workers because it will \nnot be as necessary to use natural gas to make electricity; and, two, \nwe will have an adequate supply of low-cost, carbon-free energy that is \nmuch less dependent on foreign sources.\n  If we want to do as the Senator from North Dakota indicated earlier--\nget rid of our addiction to foreign oil--we know the way to do it. A \nlot of the provisions are in this bill: First, conservation and \nefficiency; second, increased supplies of natural gas, which is clean; \nthird, nuclear power; and fourth, coal gasification and sequestration. \nIf we did that, we would transform the way we produce energy, and we \nwould have a true American clean energy bill.\n  Coal gasification and carbon sequestration would clean the air of \nmajor pollutants and, importantly, show the rest of the world how to do \nit. A point I learned not long ago was that some of the major \nenvironmental groups support a coal strategy to clean the air. Because \nif the United States perfects coal gasification and sequestration, then \nChina and India and Singapore and others will do it. If we do not, they \nwill go ahead building conventional coal plants which are dirtier. If \nwe are really interested in clean air, in carbon-free air around the \nworld, this is the strategy we will follow.\n  It is my hope that the loan guarantees and tax incentives in this \nlegislation will include $2 billion in tax incentives for the \ndeployment of six coal gasification plants by 2013 and loan guarantees \nfor industrial site commercial applications. For carbon capturing \nsequestration from coal plants, we need $1.5 billion in research to \ndemonstrate commercial-scale carbon recapture and geologic \nsequestration at a variety of sites. Substantially, these provisions \nare in the legislation Senator Johnson of South Dakota and I offered \nwhich we called the Lower Natural Gas Prices Reduction Act of 2005, and \nmany of the provisions are in this bill.\n  I have a couple of more priorities, and then I will be glad to yield \nthe floor. I see others waiting.\n  Fifth, research and development--if we are to transform the way we \nmake electricity, we have to accelerate research and development of \nthese projects. Developing advanced nuclear reactors with a lower \nconstruction cost should be the first priority, if we really want \ncarbon-free electricity. Next should come demonstration projects for \nlarge-scale carbon sequestration because if it succeeds, it could \ntransform clean energy not just here but everywhere. Accelerated \nresearch into hydrogen production, as Senators Dorgan, Akaka, and \nothers have advocated, should come next, keeping in mind that it is \nseveral years down the road. It will require nuclear or coal or natural \ngas powerplants to produce the hydrogen. Then for the longer term \nshould come fusion.\n  Finally, a word on renewable fuels and energy as a final priority. \nAbout 2 percent of fuel for our vehicles is renewable fuel, chiefly \nfrom corn-based ethanol. About 2 percent of our electricity is produced \nby nonhydro renewable energy, chiefly biomass, which we burn, wind, \nsolar, and geothermal, hot air coming out of the ground. Our objective \nshould be to encourage R and breakthroughs that help these small \nnumbers become bigger so that renewables make greater contributions. \nThis legislation includes authority for such research. For example, new \nadvances in solar technology suggest that solar shingles on house tops \nand businesses may have significant potential.\n  It is important to make our financial subsidy for these renewable \nsources equitable among themselves. For example, the renewable \nproduction tax credit in the Federal Tax Code today has already \ncommitted billions over the next 5 years--I believe the accurate figure \nis about $2 billion for the next 5 years--almost all to wind power, \nalmost nothing to solar. That is not right. We should have advances in \nsolar. And to the extent we want to put money behind renewable energy, \nsolar and geothermal, as well as wind, should have an opportunity to \nsucceed. Hopefully, this legislation will correct that by creating a \nnew investment tax credit for solar energy such as the one Senator \nJohnson and I introduced earlier this year which would make it \navailable to homes and businesses and would cost $380 million over 5 \nyears.\n  We also need to make sure that these tax dollars are spent for \nrenewables to help launch new technologies, not permanently subsidize \nthem, and that the amount of money spent bears some relationship to our \ntotal energy. For example, extending the production tax credit for 3 \nmore years, as it is written, would mean taxpayers would be spending a \ntotal of about $3 billion over the next 5 years building huge windmills \nthat when the wind blows provide little more than 1 percent of our \nelectricity needs.\n\n  By comparison to that $3 billion over 5 years, the Budget Committee \nhas told us we can only spend $11 billion on the entire Energy bill. I \nwould suggest we seriously consider instead of allocating $3 billion to \nwindmills, we might spend $500 million to extend the $2,000 tax \ndeduction for the purchase of a million new hybrid and advanced diesel \nvehicles, provide $750 million for retooling the plants in which to \nmake the vehicles and make sure they are here in the United States. \nThat is 39,000 new auto manufacturing jobs, according to the National \nCommission on Energy Policy. We might provide a half a billion dollars \nfor carbon sequestration demonstrations, and we might have $1.25 \nbillion left over to launch advanced nuclear reactors and a new \ngeneration of clean coal gasification plants.\n  There are many ways to add up these dollars. We need to make sure the \nnumbers I am talking about are exactly right. But basically that is $3 \nbillion for windmills. I am suggesting we might be able to spend it \nmore effectively if we really want carbon-free electricity.\n  These are one Senator's priorities for producing an American Clean \nEnergy Act of 2005. Only steps like these will produce adequate \nconservation and an adequate supply of reliable, low-cost,\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\nAmerican-produced clean energy. Only steps like these will lower \nnatural gas prices, which we can and must do, reduce the growth of our \ndependence on oil, and save the United States from the next big \nsurprise, the surprise to our pocketbooks if we fail to prepare for the \noncoming energy crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Alexander, \nfor the tremendous level of involvement and importance he placed on \nthis issue of energy, as a full participant in the committee, there to \ntalk about, look at, research, and find answers for many of the \nproposals that are embodied in this critical piece of legislation. I \nthank him as a major contributor to this issue. He has well laid out \nthis afternoon the importance of this legislation and getting this \ncountry back into the business of producing energy but also under that \ncritical new caveat of clean energy that we see and believe to be so \nimportant to all of us.\n  I see the junior Senator from Florida on the floor, who, like the \nSenator from Tennessee, has been a major participant as a new member of \nour Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Already his important \nfingerprints are on this major piece of energy legislation.\n  I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. I \nappreciate the opportunity that the chairman, ranking member, and other \nmembers have given me to work on this important piece of legislation.\n  As the Senator alluded, I came late to the work of this committee on \nthis bill, having joined the Senate just this year. Much of the work \nhad previously been done. I am grateful for this opportunity and for \nthe deference the chairman has shown and for the opportunity to work on \nthese important issues.\n  I compliment the Senator from Tennessee for his comments. I thank him \nfor doing a thorough review of the entire bill. I appreciate the \ncomprehensive way in which he analyzed it. I have appreciated greatly \nhis passion on certain aspects of this bill and his great understanding \nof all of the issues that it raises. I appreciate very much his review \nof the entire bill.\n  Today, as he forecasted, I rise to speak on an issue which is of \ngreat concern to the people of Florida. The people of my State are very \nconcerned about development of offshore energy resources in what has \nbeen known as the Eastern Planning Zone of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  As my colleagues are aware, in this bill is an inventory amendment \nthat I will work to strike from the bill. There are also efforts to \nattach additional language to the Energy bill that I believe would be a \npoison pill and counter to what this bill is all about; namely, this \nbill is about conservation, new technologies, and jobs.\n  I further thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Bingaman, for the fine work they have done \nin crafting a bipartisan, comprehensive, and significant package that \ndiversifies America's energy supply, increases conservation and \nproduction, and employs innovative technologies to meet America's \nenergy needs. I thank the chairman and ranking member for allowing me \nto be part of this process and this legislation.\n  As the chairman himself has said, this bill will make a real \ndifference in America's energy landscape. I am proud to have voted for \nthis legislation in committee, and I look forward to voting for it on \nthe floor--if we can address some areas that are critical to my State's \nfuture, environmentally, economically, and even militarily.\n  Mr. President, in the Energy bill that we are considering, there is a \nprovision that requires an inventory of oil and natural gas resources \non the Outer Continental Shelf. I opposed this amendment in committee \nbecause it contains something we in Florida don't want, it starts \nsomething that we in the United States do not need, and it opens the \ndoor to a number of problems--environmental problems, economic \nproblems, and unnecessary challenges for our military. Why would we \ninventory an area where we are never going to drill?\n  The inventory language in the Energy bill is a huge problem for \nFlorida. It tantalizes prodrilling interests. Allowing an inventory is \nlike saying to prodrilling States, ``Come and get it.'' I have received \nassurances from my friends on the other side of this issue that States \nsuch as Florida--States that do not want drilling on their coast--will \nnot have to take it. Fine. That is Florida's position. I can clearly \nstate that we do not want drilling now, and I do not see a scenario \nanywhere on the horizon where we could change that position. So why, \ngiven our objection to drilling, would we spend the resources and \ndamage the environment on the Eastern Planning Zone to do this \ninventory?\n\n  An inventory is not a benign thing. It involves detonating \nexplosives, enough to shake the crust of the Earth, listen to what \ncomes back, and, in the meantime, we may also destroy fragile sea life.\n  Just briefly, if you look at the cost of this inventory, people in \nthe Minerals Management Service tell me that to use the most up-to-date \ntechnology to perform any inventory of this magnitude, the cost \nestimate would run between $75 million and $125 million for each \nfrontier planning area. Nowhere in this legislation can I find a \nsection that suggests how we recoup the cost of such an inventory.\n  So I look forward to working with Senator Domenici and my colleagues \nto find a solution to this question of the inventory--something that \nwould preserve the inventory option for those States that want it and \nlet States such as Florida remain unaffected.\n  But worse than the inventory is what are being called the ``coastal \nkiller'' amendments. We don't know when these amendments will be \noffered or if they will be offered, but the language first came up in \ncommittee, eventually withdrawn, and the nature of these amendments \ncould be so devastating to Florida that I believe they ought to be \naddressed today. I am pleased that my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida, addressed them today. These amendments should be \nexplained, and I am here to argue that these amendments must be and \nought to be rejected.\n  The amendments aim at three things: drawing brandnew, unprecedented \nboundaries for each State, allowing States to opt out of the \nmoratorium, and creating huge incentives for States to opt out of the \nFederal moratorium. If these amendments were to become law, that buffer \nzone shrinks to just 21 miles--well below what it is today. Let me be \nclear: 21 miles is no buffer zone, and it is of no comfort to \nFloridians.\n  If we open additional drilling in the Eastern Planning Zone, it will \ndamage the fragile ecosystem, Florida's economy, and it will pull the \nrug out from under the military that has made the commitment--an \nincreased commitment--and made the investments and moved a majority of \ntheir training operations from Vieques and other places to the clear \ncoastal waters of Florida.\n  Mr. President, to say that these coastal killer amendments are giving \nStates the freedom to choose is ignoring the fact that Florida will be \nlosing its choice. We will stay in the moratorium, but if Alabama opts \nout, you bring drilling to Florida's shores--whether we like it or not. \nIt is this aggressive effort to wade into what has traditionally been \nFlorida's buffer zone that has drawn opposition. The Eastern Planning \nZone must not be opened.\n  For those who do not know the location of the Eastern Planning Zone \nin the Gulf of Mexico, let me show you this chart. The Eastern Planning \nZone is in this area, which is clean and clear, as you can see. There \nare active leases in the gulf. Note that this portion of the gulf is \nliterally tapped out. This is the area where drilling and leases are \nactive at the current time--off Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, \nwhere it is literally covered up. When we think about this area, the \nEastern Planning Zone, which is right here, we just don't care in \nFlorida to see this kind of encroachment on our pristine coastline, our \necosystems, as it is over here. So for those of us who believe our \nboundary is here and that east of this we should exercise some control \nand some mandate, we simply do not care to see any change in the status \nquo.\n  Oil and gas companies are now looking at this portion of the map--\nFlorida's coastal area--and thinking, Let's\n\n[[Page S6452]]\n\nopen that area. To my colleagues, I say, as Senator Nelson said before \nme, the answer to that is simply no.\n  Last year, more than 74 million people visited Florida to enjoy its \ncoastline and wonderful climate. Families return year after year to \ntheir favorite vacation spots to relax under our brilliant blue skies, \nat powdery white beaches, and our crystal-clear emerald waters.\n  The people of Florida share a love and appreciation of the Atlantic \nOcean and the Gulf of Mexico, its coastal habitat and our wetlands, \nwhich make a very complex ecosystem, and also a very special place to \nlive.\n\n  I share these facts for one reason: The people of Florida are \nconcerned their coastal waters are coming under increased pressure to \nexploit possible oil and gas resources. The people of Florida do not \nwant that to happen. Floridians are adamantly opposed to oil and gas \nexploration off our coastal waters. We have serious concerns that \noffshore drilling will increase the threat of potential oil spills, \nseriously damaging and threatening marine wildlife and their coastal \nhabitat.\n  In addition, Floridians are extremely concerned that drilling \noperations would produce massive amounts of waste mud and drill \ncuttings that would be generated and then sent untreated into the \nsurrounding waters.\n  Of the 74 million people who have visited the Sunshine State in 2004 \nto enjoy its beautiful beaches, exciting amusement parks, and \nwonderfully abundant wildlife and natural splendor, I daresay not a one \nof those people came to Florida without spending some of their hard-\nearned dollars.\n  Here is what tourism means to Florida: 840,000 people directly \nemployed in the industry and an economic impact of $46 billion a year \nto our State's economy. If the unforeseeable happens, whether it is a \nhurricane, an industrial accident, an intentional or terrorist act, and \nour coastlines become soaked with oil, there is no amount of relief aid \nthat can clean up the economic disaster that would be Florida's. Entire \ncommunities would be totally devastated.\n  At the end of the day, what I would like to see is for us to codify \nin law positions that are supported by me, the senior Senator from \nFlorida, Bill Nelson, and Florida's citizens. Our view is that we must \nprevent any further encroachment into Florida's waters and coastline. \nThis is necessary to protect our tourism industry and the pristine \nbeaches and coastal areas that would be ruined if an unfortunate oil \nspill or disaster took place.\n  Perhaps one of the most compelling arguments entails what drilling in \nthe area of the Eastern Planning Zone would mean to national security. \nWe cannot ignore the fact that lifting Florida's protections will put \nour military at a training disadvantage. Let me repeat: Lifting \nFlorida's protections will put our military at a training disadvantage.\n  Let me highlight just some of the military operations that use this \nplatform-free zone for training. We have to allow our military to \ncontinue training for battle preparedness. Our young men and women \ndeserve the best training we can afford. Vieques gave them that \ncapability. Now that Vieques in Puerto Rico is closed, Florida's \nPanhandle plays an increasingly significant role. Oil and gas \noperations must not be allowed to impede on that training.\n  Keep in mind, drilling in Florida's part of the gulf is not a new \nargument. This is something that has been attempted for some time. Here \nis what MG Michael Kostelnik, the base commander of Eglin Air Force \nBase, said in May of 2000:\n\n       We continue to place the most severe restrictions in the \n     eastern portion of the proposed sale area where oil and gas \n     operations would be incompatible with military training and \n     testing operations.\n\n  If we allow drilling there now, the military will be set back in \ntheir training, their preparedness, and moved back to square one in \ntrying to find an area suitable for this kind of massive military joint \noperation.\n  This is a question of national security, and it is why in this area \nof Florida, where there is great land mass available to the military, \nas well as this entire gulf area, for training operations, that in this \nBRAC process Florida did rather well, and in fact we saw increases of \ntraining commands coming to this area of Florida for the very reason of \nwhat we have to offer, the environment and the pristine and open areas \nfor them to train.\n  I want to take a moment to discuss how we arrived at the position we \nfind ourselves in today. The distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, has stated publicly that she wants to be very respectful of \nStates that do not want drilling off their coast--they do want drilling \nin Louisiana. I appreciate that sentiment and I feel the same respect \nfor the rights and privileges of the various States. In fact, that is \nwhy we are here today.\n  The coastal killer amendments will weaken Florida's protections. \nUnder these amendments, the will of the people of Florida, which is to \nkeep drilling away from our shores, will be thwarted.\n  Senator Landrieu says she also wants to leave an option open for \nStates that might want to drill off their shore. There is much work to \ndo, but we must work to solve our Nation's energy problems without \nlooking to Florida's coasts. They are not open for consideration.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Senator Nelson and I are working \ntogether to engage a coalition of Senators to help beat back any \nefforts to encroach upon our coastal waters. I am proud to say in doing \nso I follow in the footsteps of our predecessors, former Senators \nConnie Mack and Bob Graham, and a bipartisan Florida delegation, in our \nfirm opposition to drilling off our coasts.\n  Let me again take a moment to praise Chairman Domenici and Ranking \nMember Bingaman for putting together a comprehensive, bipartisan, and \nsignificant energy policy that is forward looking, forward thinking, \nand a road map of where we as a nation need to go in order to address \nthe challenges that confront us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nFlorida for an excellent and comprehensive statement where he has \ntouched on the things that threaten Florida--not only the environment, \nnot only the economy, particularly the pristine beaches, or our guests \nwho come as tourists, the military, but he has given an overview that I \nthink is excellent, and why in the process of debating this very \nimportant Energy bill we need to come to a resolution that the existing \nmoratorium in the Outer Continental Shelf will not be lifted.\n  Senator Martinez and I represent the State of Florida, but there are \nmany other coastal Senators--I will name one whom I had breakfast with \nthis morning, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who also has an \neconomy in part based on tourism, the Myrtle Beach area. It is well \nknown. Does he want oil rigs off the coast of South Carolina? Of course \nhe does not.\n  We will find on the Pacific coast, on the Atlantic, as well as us, \nconcern about this eastern planning area, which includes this lease-\nsale 181, that there are a bunch of Senators who see this as a direct \nthreat to us. Interestingly, the geology shows that there is not much \noil and gas there. We have had innumerable dry holes in the attempts at \ndrilling out in the gulf.\n  So I wanted to take the opportunity to thank Senator Martinez for an \nexcellent statement.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the kind comments. I \nalso would like to say that I know Senator Burr is greatly concerned. \nWe sat side by side in the committee, and he shares the concerns for \nthe State of North Carolina and its coastline. What we see is a number \nof Senators who choose to protect their own interests, their own \neconomies, and I also know the distinguished Senator from Louisiana is \nlooking out for their own economy. So what we have to do is find a way \nthat we can live and let live, not encroach, and allow each of the \nStates to make decisions based on their own perceived self-interests. \nFor a long time, Florida has been keeping our coastline clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator from South Dakota yield \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Certainly.\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask my colleagues to consider that the ethanol title is \nnow before us. I believe there are several amendments out there, and we \nwould like to move this through in the next day or so. We would hope \nthat some of our colleagues who have those amendments would come to the \nfloor this late afternoon and evening and offer those amendments. So \nfor those listening and for those staffs who are aware, we would ask \nthem to bring those amendments forward so that we could consider them \nas we move, we hope, in a timely fashion through this legislation.\n  I thank my colleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank my friend and colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, during the last 4 months, the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, on which I serve, has worked diligently \ntoward completing a balanced and comprehensive Energy bill. Through the \nleadership of Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman, the \ncommittee moved forward in a bipartisan fashion toward improving the \nreliability of our Nation's electricity grid, adopting provisions to \nencourage Indian tribes to develop clean energy projects and took steps \ntoward addressing past manipulation of western electricity markets, all \nthe while moving to improve the energy efficiency of our economy.\n  The committee also adopted an amendment I offered along with \ncommittee members--Senators Talent, Dorgan, and Salazar--in a \nbipartisan fashion, once again, to increase the amount of renewable \nfuels used in the Nation's gasoline supply.\n  The amendment before the Senate today creates an 8-billion-gallon \nrenewable fuel standard, RFS, that will lessen our dependence on \nforeign sources of energy while increasing the availability of a clean \ngasoline fuel extender. Implementing a renewable fuel standard is part \nand parcel of our goal in producing a balanced and forward-looking \nenergy bill.\n\n  Why must we do more to promote and develop renewable fuels?\n  In 2003, net imports of crude oil accounted for 56 percent of our \ndomestic petroleum consumption. Americans will spend over $120 billion \nin 2005 on foreign imports of oil. According to the Department of \nEnergy's Energy Information Administration, petroleum imports are \nprojected to reach 68 percent in 2025. This is simply untenable. We \nneed to harness new supplies and conserve better if we are to break \nthis dangerous dependence on foreign oil.\n  Renewable fuels--ethanol, biodiesel, and cellulosic biomass--are \ngrown, produced, and refined here in the United States. Those on the \nright and the left of the political spectrum agree that we need to \nincrease the production of renewable fuels as one important tool toward \nlessening our dependence on foreign oil.\n  In 2004, the United States produced almost 3.5 billion gallons of \nethanol. That level of renewable fuel production directly replaces \nmillions of barrels of foreign oil annually and reduces our trade \ndeficit, all the while creating jobs at home in the United States.\n  As States look for solutions to reduce petroleum fuel use, renewable \nfuels keep appearing as a critical component to any strategy. Thus it \nis no surprise that a May 2005 staff report by the California Energy \nCommission determined that increasing to 10 percent the amount of \nethanol blended into a gallon of gasoline in California would reduce by \n28 percent the amount of petroleum used in that State by 2025.\n  In addition to displacing imported oil, renewable fuels also lower \nretail gasoline prices--lower gas prices for Americans. Contrary to \nsome of the falsehoods that some have tried to peddle, if these clean-\nburning fuels disappeared from the marketplace tomorrow, your \nconstituents would pay more at the pump for a gallon of gasoline. At \nthe end of April, the average nationwide price for a gallon of gasoline \nwas $2.25, and the spot market for a gallon of wholesale ethanol is at \na price of $1.24 per gallon of ethanol--$2.25 per gallon for gasoline, \n$1.24 per gallon of ethanol. It doesn't take a genius to figure that \nthe more ethanol blended in the gallon of gasoline, the lower the price \noverall to consumers.\n  Perhaps the better question to ask is not why gasoline prices are so \nhigh, but why isn't ethanol used more widely in the marketplace? \nApparently, there are many starting to ask that question, and not just \nfarmers and ethanol producers. On May 5, the California Independent Oil \nMarketers Association wrote to the California Air Resources Board \nseeking approval to use up to 10 percent ethanol blended gasoline in \nthe California market. In the letter to the California Air Resources \nBoard, the Independent Marketers state that using a 10-percent blend as \nopposed to California's current 5.7-percent blend would provide more \nstability to the State's fuel supply.\n  It is not just marketers seeking greater use of ethanol. The Consumer \nFederation of America, in a May 2005 analysis on the difference between \ngasoline and ethanol prices, concluded that because of the difference \nbetween the wholesale price of ethanol and the average wholesale price \nof gasoline, the consumers purchasing gasoline blended with 10 percent \nethanol are saving as much as 8 cents a gallon versus fuels not blended \nwith ethanol, lowering the price at the pump by 8 cents a gallon. \nRenewable fuels, therefore, extend supplies, reduce dependence on \nforeign oil, and lower prices at the pump for consumers.\n  The amendment before the Senate would phase in, over 7 years, a \nnationwide renewable fuels standard of 8 billion gallons. Let me put \nthat in some perspective. In 2004, the United States consumed about 160 \nbillion gallons of gasoline, and the U.S. domestic ethanol production \ntopped out at about 3.5 billion gallons--160 billion gallons of \ngasoline, 3.5 billion gallons of ethanol.\n  With nearly a billion gallons of production under construction, the \nprevious effort to implement a 5-billion RFS by 2012 is woefully \ninadequate to meet growing production. Phasing in an 8-billion-gallon \nrenewable fuel standard over 7 years can be accomplished. Increasing \nproduction will meet the requirement, all the while creating 234,000 \njobs and adding $20 billion in gross domestic production between 2005 \nand 2012.\n  This amendment will also create opportunities for cellulosic ethanol \nand sugar cane ethanol and spurs biodiesel production in the South and \nWestern United States. The amendment includes language championed by my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Cantwell of Washington, which will \nfurther incentivize cellulosic ethanol.\n  With record-high gasoline prices, with an ever-growing dependence on \nforeign sources of energy, our Nation must do more to promote and \nutilize renewable fuels. Creating a strong renewable fuel program that \ncaptures biodiesel, ethanol, and other renewable energy sources must be \na cornerstone to the comprehensive energy bill.\n\n  Mr. President, it is with great satisfaction that I have this \nopportunity to speak to the 8-billion RFS provision that was added to \nthe Energy Committee's bill which was voted out on a 22-to-1 passage of \nthe total bill and with great support of the ethanol provision in that \nbill. I am confident that this body will maintain that 8-billion RFS \nrequirement.\n  All the more so, it is important because the House Energy bill \ncontains only a 5-billion-gallon RFS, a level that is simply \ninadequate, that the ethanol industry is on the verge of outstripping \nalready even without an RFS. If we are going to be serious about \ndisplacing billions of gallons of foreign petroleum, if we are going to \nbe serious about reducing the dependence on foreign petroleum, of \nreducing our trade imbalance--which is imbalanced, in large measure, \nbecause of the massive importation of petroleum--if we are going to \nhave a foreign policy and a military policy that is not impacted by the \nneed to protect and defend the oil lanes around the world in unstable \nThird World areas, if we are going to create more jobs--not just in a \nhandful of communities but in rural communities across this country--if \nwe are going to drive up the prices that farmers get for their product \nwhile at the same time giving them an opportunity to benefit from the \ndividends of the stock they own in these ethanol plants, then it ought \nto be obvious, whether you come from farm areas or urban areas, that \nthis RFS makes all the sense in the world, for the sake of our economy, \nfor the sake of clean air, for the sake of our foreign policy, for the \nsake of trade policy, for the sake of jobs.\n  I am pleased this particular legislation with its broad-based \nbipartisan 22-\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\nto-1 vote out of the Senate Natural Resources Committee is on this \nfloor and within the coming week or so we will be able to pass this \nbill, go to conference, and, I am confident, work out the differences \nwith our colleagues on the House side and get this bill to the \nPresident's desk. Finally, after years of turmoil and effort, we will \nhave a comprehensive energy bill that will benefit the entire Nation.\n  I am pleased we have reached this point. I am pleased with the great \nsuccess of the 8-billion RFS amendment. I look forward to its passage \nand urge my colleagues to be supportive of this RFS requirement \ncontained in the bill coming to us from the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I congratulate the leadership of the Energy \nCommittee, the leadership of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, coming to an agreement on this particular amendment we have \nunder consideration here today. This, as my colleague from South Dakota \nnoted, is an issue of great importance to the energy security of our \nNation and to our economy.\n  We have an opportunity here today to put together a bill and meld on \nthe floor of the Senate a couple of different provisions that have come \nout of different committees of the Senate. The Energy Committee and the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, on which I serve, dealt with \nthe renewable fuel and ethanol provisions that we reported out this \nyear. What this does is enable us to reconcile, here on the floor, the \nconflicting or competing, if you will, jurisdictions between those \ncommittees. It puts into place an 8-billion-gallon renewable fuel \nstandard.\n  We are at this point, we are here, and it is long overdue. This \nEnergy bill has been kicking around for several years. Back when \nPresident Bush was first elected, the task force was composed, they \nmet, came up with recommendations submitted to the Congress. The \nCongress subsequently acted in the last session of Congress, only to \nhave the wheels fall off toward the end of the Congress in an \nenvironment that probably was more highly politically charged than \nanything else.\n  However, the reality is we are here today in the Senate--after the \nHouse having passed an Energy bill--with an opportunity to pass an \nEnergy bill in the Senate, to get it into conference, and to come out \nwith a conference report that we can send to the President to be signed \ninto law.\n  This is an important piece of legislation for a lot of reasons, one \nof which is the JOBS bill. This is about creating economic opportunity \nfor people in this country. We passed a comprehensive Energy bill which \nis long overdue. We will have the opportunity to create a lot of jobs \nfor Americans across the country with the various provisions in the \nbill by adding to the supply of existing energy sources we have, \ncreating new energy sources and diversifying our energy supply in areas \nI am very interested in, such as renewable fuels. The conservation \nincentives in this bill are good for America, both for people who \npurchase cars and for manufacturers who produce cars. There are a lot \nof things about this bill that are necessary, if we are going to get \nour country back on track toward the path of energy independence.\n  Having grown up 30 years ago now, I remember going through an energy \ncrisis, with everyone wringing their hands about how dependent we are \non foreign sources of energy. At that time, we were over 50-percent \nreliant on foreign sources of energy, saying we have to do something \nabout it. Here we are, 30 years later, at 55-percent dependent upon \nforeign sources of energy.\n  We still have to get much of our energy supply from other places \naround the world, places that are very unstable, which create \ntremendous pressures on us not only in terms of our economy but also \nour military commitments that are necessary in order to protect those \nareas of the world that are primary conduits of energy for our country.\n  It is about the economy. It is about energy security. It is about \njobs and about reducing the cost of energy for Americans. Look where \ngas prices are today. That is why we are where we are. This is a time \nwe have the impetus for getting an Energy bill passed because people \nare frustrated and are looking to the Congress to act. They go to the \npump, and pay over $2 a gallon--in some places well over $2 a gallon--\nfor gasoline. They are looking for Congress to take action that will \nhelp address the long-term supply problems we face as a Nation, which \nare creating this demand today for energy that continues to push prices \nhigher and higher.\n  This comprehensive Energy bill is an approach which I believe \naddresses many of the components. Parts of this bill address many of \nthe needs out there, one of which, of course, is additional supply. Not \ntoo long ago I had the opportunity to join with a number of my \ncolleagues in the Senate and travel to the North Slope of Alaska. \nEarlier this year, during debate of the budget, we authorized \nexploration for energy in Alaska. In my view, when we have a million \nbarrels a day of additional production we could bring online with ease, \nwhich will reduce the pressure we have on oil supplies in this country \nand continue to lessen our dependence upon foreign sources of energy, \nit is an important part of this debate. So additional supply is part of \nthis discussion.\n  More particularly, what this amendment deals with, is the \ncomprehensive need for diversifying our energy supply in this country \nand moving more toward renewable sources of energy. In my State of \nSouth Dakota, in the State of Minnesota, in the State of Iowa, and all \nacross the Midwest, we have rows and rows and rows of corn and rows and \nrows and rows of soybeans. I look at that as a food source, and it is. \nWe feed it to cattle. We use it in a lot of different ways. However, it \ncan also be converted to energy. A bushel of corn can be converted to \n2.5 gallons of ethanol. That puts energy in the pipeline for this \ncountry that will lessen our dependence upon foreign sources of energy.\n\n  What this amendment does is create a market. It says we are going to \nhave, phased in over a 7-year period, an 8-billion-gallon market \nopportunity for ethanol producers in this country. That is good for the \nfarmers of the Midwest, the farmers of South Dakota. It puts more money \nin their pocket. They can take their corn down to an ethanol plant and \nreceive 10 or 15 cents a bushel more for it than they would if they put \nit on a rail car headed to some terminal elevator somewhere. That is \ngood for the economy and for the farmers of this country. It is good \nfor the consumers of this country, the people who have to buy energy.\n  Ours is a State with long distances. We are very reliant upon tourism \nand reliant upon the farm, ranch, and agricultural economy. We are very \nreliant upon our small businesses who have to get to their \ndestinations. We are a State which is very energy dependent and energy \nintensive. Our State, similar to many others in the Midwest, spends a \nlot of money on energy. When gas skyrockets to well over $2 a gallon, \nit has a profound impact on the ability of our State to attract \neconomic development, to bring the tourists to our State, and to \nsupport the economy there. So this is an important issue not only for \nthose who are producing the crops that can be converted into energy but \nalso for those people across this country, those families, those small \nbusiness people, those farmers, and those ranchers who are faced with \nhigher and higher energy costs. This is an issue that is about our \neconomy.\n  I would also say that when an ethanol plant is created, it brings a \nwhole new vitality to rural areas. There are a lot of rural areas of \nour country and many in my State of South Dakota. We have a number of \nethanol plants in my State. Each time another comes online, and every \ntime we build another ethanol plant that produces 40 million, 50 \nmillion, or 80 million gallons of ethanol a year, it creates 40, 50, or \n60 new direct jobs. It also creates a lot of ripple-effect jobs \nthroughout the economy, indirect jobs that help restore and revitalize \nrural areas of this country, which are struggling for their very \nsurvival every day.\n  This is about the economy of rural areas. It is about the economic \nimpact that passage of this legislation could have on consumers in this \ncountry. It is about the jobs that are going to be created in America. \nThat is why, from so many different perspectives, this is\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\ngood policy. This is something we, as a Congress, ought to be doing. We \nought to be looking at those rows and rows and rows of soybeans and \nthose rows and rows and rows of corn and the renewable things we grow \nevery year.\n  We have a finite petroleum-based product--hydrocarbons and fossil \nfuels--that compose our energy supply today, but every year we can \ngrow, because of the good work of the farmers in this country. We can \ncontinue to grow these products, these commodities, that can be \nconverted into energy sources that will make America more secure going \ninto the future.\n  An 8-billion renewable fuel standard--and as my colleague from South \nDakota mentioned earlier, the House is at 5 billion gallons in their \nbill--it is important. I would like to see a 12-billion or 15-billion \ngallon threshold, maybe to the chagrin of some of my colleagues in the \nSenate who maybe are not as favorably disposed to renewable energy. \nHowever, the reality is this is good, clean energy. This is energy that \nlessens our dependence upon foreign sources of energy that makes our \ncountry more energy independent. That is good for the economy of the \nMidwest.\n  With all the jobs involved with this, with all the impacts I have \nmentioned--I also add that it is good for the environment in this \ncountry--this is good policy in creating a permanent 8-billion-gallon \nrenewable fuel standard market for ethanol in this country that will \nput us on a path toward energy independence. It is something we ought \nto have a lot more of in this country.\n  I hope, as this legislation moves forward in this process, the 8-\nbillion-gallon renewable fuel standard will be adopted by the Senate \nand will be part of the bill we send into conference with the House. \nAnd when we get to the negotiations with the House, I hope we will be \nable to retain that level of renewable fuel standards because it is \nimportant to America's future.\n  I urge my colleagues, not only on this amendment but as the bill \nmoves forward, to support this amendment and to resist other amendments \nthat could lessen, in any way, the commitment we are going to make to 8 \nbillion gallons of ethanol for America's future.\n  It is about jobs. It is about the economy. It is about more dollars \nin rural areas that will help our farmers and ranchers survive. It is \nabout keeping our small communities going. It is about energy \nindependence for America's future. It is about a stronger, cleaner, and \nbetter environment. For all those reasons, I support this amendment.\n  I am happy to be a part of bringing this to the floor and working \nwith our leadership on the two committees--on the Energy Committee and \non the Environment and Public Works Committee--with Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Domenici, and Senator Bingaman, and with our \nleadership in the Senate to get to where we are today.\n  I hope we can push this bill forward, get a bill through the \nconference, on the President's desk, and signed into law so that the \nAmerican people will have what they have needed for some time and what \nthis Congress has failed to deliver--and it is high time we did \ndeliver--and that is a comprehensive energy policy for America's \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise briefly to continue the \nconversation my friend from South Dakota started about the importance \nof renewable fuels. I thank him for his work on the amendment that is \ngoing to be offered that I hope will not only be a bipartisan \namendment--I know it is going to be that--I hope it becomes virtually a \nconsensus amendment. It ought to be that for the reasons my friend from \nSouth Dakota said. I am going to discuss them for a few minutes myself.\n  I also join him in congratulating the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee in bringing out a very strong Energy bill, a bill that is \ndesigned, in its entirety, to be a pro-energy bill, a proproduction \nbill, but also a proconservation bill and a pro-environment bill. I \nbelieve very strongly that it is not a question of ``energy or \nconservation or the environment,'' but a question of ``energy and \nconservation and the environment.'' The American people want all three, \nand they can have all three. I believe the bill is a long step toward \ngiving them all three.\n  The renewable fuels standard which is part of the bill, and will be \npart of an amendment that is offered by the Senator from New Mexico, is \nan important part of the bill.\n  We all know that America has been importing more and more oil from \nforeign countries. In 1999, America was importing over 55 percent of \nits oil and petroleum products. Just 2 years later, our dependency had \nincreased to over 59 percent. And by the year 2025, the Energy \nInformation Administration estimates that the United States will import \nnearly 70 percent of its petroleum, unless something is done. And \nsomething needs to be done.\n  We cannot continue in a world where we are fighting a war against \nterror, in a world where there are many countries that, from time to \ntime, express their dislike for us, to rely on foreigners for our \nenergy. We do not rely on them for our food, and we should not rely on \nthem for basics such as energy.\n  The good news is that the same people who are producing our food for \nus, and have given us the safest, highest quality, and most abundant \nand least-expensive food supply in the world, are well on the way to \ndoing the same thing with regard to energy.\n  I am pleased to report that renewable fuels are not just the future--\nalthough I think they are part of the future--but they are the present. \nThey are now. They are a ``here and now.'' This year, we will use 3.8 \nbillion gallons of ethanol in the Nation's fuel supply. That is about 3 \npercent of the Nation's fuel supply which is being produced in scores \nand scores and scores of ethanol plants around this country, many of \nwhich are owned and operated by the same farmers who are producing the \ncorn which we then turn into ethanol.\n  Renewable fuels are here, and we need to make certain they are here 5 \nyears from now and 10 years from now, and in greater and greater \nsupplies so we can protect our national security. That is what the \nrenewable fuels standard is about.\n  An amendment is going to be offered by the Senator from New Mexico. \nIt is going to be a thoroughly bipartisan amendment. We have worked it \nout. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, for working out an arrangement with the \nSenator from New Mexico to have a consensus amendment as between the \ntwo of them. I appreciate the hard work of the Senator from South \nDakota. That amendment will reflect the basics of the renewable fuels \nstandard that we put on in committee with very strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n\n  It will increase, from 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 8 billion gallons \nin 2012, the amount of biofuels or renewable fuels that are in the \nNation's energy supply. That is not just ethanol. It is important to \nmake that clear. It is partly ethanol, and probably will be mostly \nethanol, but it will also be biodiesel, which we make from soybeans, \nand it will be biomass. There are provisions to develop the technology \nso we can turn sugar into energy. And I would expect, at 8 billion \ngallons, all those various kinds of renewable fuels will be present in \nsubstantial supply in the Nation's fuel supply by the year 2012.\n  Now, I said it was good for energy independence. I think that is \npretty clear. Which one of us would not rather be dependent upon our \nfarmers for their energy than upon, let's say, Saudi oil producers? It \nseems to me to be pretty self-evident that we can rely more on our own \nagricultural producers than we can on foreigners. I come from a farm \nfamily. I know a lot of farmers. They can get stubborn now and then, \nbut they are not going to embargo us from energy.\n  The Senator from South Dakota mentioned the oil embargo in the early \n1970s. I am glad he is old enough to remember that. I am barely old \nenough to remember that oil embargo. I do not want my kids and \ngrandkids to go through what I went through as a stripling. And they \nwill not have to, to the extent we are relying on renewables.\n  It is also a tremendous hedge against rising oil prices. At the \ncurrent price for oil, $55, $56 a barrel, you can buy a gallon of \nethanol for less than you can\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\nbuy a gallon of gasoline. So this is exerting now a downward pressure \non the price of fuel, and will do so in the future. It is a hedge \nagainst increased costs of oil, obviously, because it is an alternative \nsource--you increase the supply and you decrease the price over time. \nIt is important for that reason as well.\n  It is also important because it is good for the environment. Again, \ncommon sense tells us, if we are burning in our engines what we are \ngrowing from the ground, that is going to be better for air than \nburning petrochemicals. And it is. The use of ethanol-blended fuels--\nand this is the same for biodiesel--reduces greenhouse gas emissions by \n12 to 19 percent compared with conventional gasoline. The American Lung \nAssociation of Metropolitan Chicago credits ethanol-blended \nreformulated gasoline with reducing smog-forming emissions by 25 \npercent since 1990. So again, this is an example not of ``energy or the \nenvironment'' but ``energy and the environment.''\n  It certainly is good for jobs in the United States. I already \nmentioned there are scores and scores of ethanol plants. We are \nbuilding biodiesel plants, as well, and building a new biodiesel plant \nin Missouri. These plants are located, by and large, in the more rural \nareas. They are good jobs for those communities. The plants are often \nowned by people who live in the communities.\n  It is a tremendous hedge against lower farm prices. So people who are \nconcerned about the cost of the farm bill need to understand that this \namendment that is going to be offered on the floor of the Senate will \nsave us $1 billion over the next few years from the price of the farm \nbill because this is an additional market for our commodities and, \ntherefore, it tends to sustain the price of corn and soybeans and the \nother products that we use to make this kind of energy.\n  People who want us to use more solar energy, I ask them: Where do you \nthink we get the ethanol and the biodiesel? What is the energy that we \nuse to produce that? It is solar energy. The farmers grow the corn and \nthey grow the sugar and they grow the soybeans and they grow the other \nbiomass. They grow that using solar energy. You grow food by combining \nsunlight and water, along with pretty good soil. We have a lot of good \nsoil in Missouri. So it is a way of getting solar energy into the \nenergy mix for the country as well.\n  I could go on and on about the advantages of this kind of fuel. I \nthink it is pretty self-evident. We can have it and have it without any \nkind of significant market distortions. I believe this renewable fuels \nstandard that we are offering today is something that the market would \nprobably reach on its own. But what it does is offer an assured market \nfor this kind of product so that the investment in these plants and the \ninvestment in the distribution network that we need to get this energy \nout to people will continue. And it is going to continue.\n  I started off by saying that renewable fuels are the future. But they \nare also the present. And that is true. There are hundreds and hundreds \nof stations around the country that are already pumping an ethanol \nblend. Those within the sound of my voice may be using ethanol now \nalmost without knowing it because you can use a blend of up to about 50 \npercent ethanol in gasoline without even changing the existing engines. \nAnd there are millions of cars that have been purchased that can use up \nto 85 percent ethanol. We just do not have enough stations pumping that \nnow, but that is coming as well for the future.\n  It is here and now. It is good for the environment, it is good for \ncreating jobs, it will hold down the price of oil and gasoline, and it \nwill help protect us and our national security and our energy supply \nagainst foreign oil embargoes.\n  I congratulate everybody involved with this amendment. I am glad we \nwere able to save the 8-billion-gallon standard that we put on in \ncommittee. I appreciate very much the work of the chairman and ranking \nmembers of both committees. People look at what we do here and they \noften see the conflict or the partisanship or sometimes the \npersonalities. We have all those things. But there is a whole lot that \ngoes on on the Senate floor that involves people working together. \nDisagreements that may exist are honest disagreements. They are \nhonestly debated, and then we vote on them.\n  The renewable fuels standard is an outstanding example of that. It \nwas offered 2 years ago at a lower level in an amendment offered by the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader jointly. I can't think of \nanything else we did in the last Congress like that. It got almost two-\nthirds of the vote. I believe this amendment will get a similar vote in \nthe Senate today. I am pleased to have been a part of it. Now we need \nto pass the amendment, then go into conference, and hold this renewable \nfuels standard for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Talent for his \nexcellent work in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He was \nthe leader of a group that put together the new 8 billion barrels that \nwe are going to have as our new American goal for ethanol. That was not \neasy to put together. It got a very large vote in committee. That \nmomentum brought it here. I think he is to be congratulated for his \neffort.\n  I appreciate Senator Craig's managing the bill for me. I would like \nto say to the Senate, there are two or three amendments that people \nwant to offer to this bill. I wish they would bring them to the floor. \nWe are prepared now, from what I understand, to debate amendments. I \nunderstand Senator Boxer has one. Maybe Senator Feinstein has one. \nThere may be one other. If we could get them up, we are going to be \nhere for a while tonight. Even though we are leaving early, we could \nget those debated and voted on, and then the next thing that we would \ndo would be to take up the amendment the distinguished minority leader \nchooses to bring up. We hope that can come up tomorrow morning before \nSenators leave for the Exon funeral, which means we might get the \namendment for Senator Cantwell offered that the minority leader wants \nto have brought up, get that up tomorrow before we leave. That would \nget two very major issues behind us, plus the amendments on this bill.\n  Again, if Senators have amendments on the ethanol provision, bring \nthem down so we can debate them. I ask the minority leader in short \norder if he would help me try to get that accomplished.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me speak to the underlying bill and the \nprovision in the amendment that is before us now before yielding the \nfloor. The senior Senator from Florida is here to discuss the issue of \noffshore drilling and a very important part of our overall energy \nconsiderations.\n  First and foremost, the chairman has called our colleagues forward to \nthe floor on ethanol amendments. That is the provision that is on the \nfloor now. I thank the junior Senator from South Dakota for his \nthoughts and laying out a comprehensive explanation as to the \nimportance of renewable fuels to our country as we strive toward a \ngreater sense of self-reliance. Self-reliance is security. Self-\nreliance is national security. The ability to determine for ourselves \nour own energy destiny is critically important, whether it is today or \ntomorrow or for our children's future. To know that there is going to \nbe an abundance of energy of all types, both for transportation \npurposes, electrical generating purposes--all of that is critical. \nFinally, that is why we are here on the floor of the Senate with this \ncritical legislation.\n  Whatever we call this legislation--a few moments ago I called it \nAmerica's Clean Energy Act--the reality is that it has taken us decades \nto begin to understand that the supply we had is not what we now have; \nthat as our country grew and we failed to meet those growth levels with \nadditional energy sources, we became increasingly reliant on other \nnations for our energy, and energy prices began to go up.\n  We as a country, in the last decade, have had to make some critical \nchoices about our future and our job markets based on a supply of \nenergy. Could we afford to produce it in this country, creating jobs \nhere, or were those who invested in those kinds of jobs going to look \nsomewhere else in the world to\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\ncreate that new production plant for the purposes of supplying our \nconsumer needs? All of those became a necessary and important part of a \ndecisionmaking process in America's business because America's \nGovernment was increasingly standing in the way of our ability to \nproduce.\n  And Congress--and I was a part of it--for the last decade \nconsistently looked at these issues but failed to come to the necessary \nagreements to produce a comprehensive policy that put us back into the \nbusiness of exploring for hydrocarbons on public lands, enhanced our \nability to produce renewable sources, caused us to look at nuclear as \nan important part of our overall electrical blend, and allowed those \nplants to be built, and so on and so forth.\n  Finally, as a result of extremely high gas prices, as a result of \nblackouts, as a result of catastrophic meltdowns in energy markets, and \na lot of finger-pointing--and some of it justified--we find ourselves \non the floor of the Senate today debating what most can call a strongly \nprovided-for bipartisan national energy policy. It begins this \ncountry's effort to march again toward self-reliance. It causes us to \nlook at a variety of options, of alternatives, to recognize that it \nisn't just one source of energy that will fuel the future, it is \nmultiple sources; that it is a balanced portfolio that is going to be \ncritically necessary to assure, whether it is transportation needs and \nit is hydrocarbons or it is hydrogen or a combination of all of those, \nand electrical power certainly for our base loads--and those are \nelectrical loads that don't just for a moment light your house but for \na long period fuel your production facilities and plants--that we are \ngoing to have to have those kinds of generating capacities that \nultimately produce that type of energy.\n  Natural gas is a critical hydrocarbon fuel, a cleaner hydrocarbon \nfuel than any available today. It was once thought to be the ideal fuel \nfor drying and space heat, but under the Clean Air Act we didn't have \nclean coal technologies, and we wouldn't build nuclear. So we began to \nsay: Gee, we can run this through turbines and provide electrical \npower. And we began to do so, at a time when we weren't bringing new \ngas to the market.\n  Over the decade of the 1990s, as electrical companies were trying to \nmeet the demand of their consumer ratepaying base, they built gas \nturbine electrical generators. Gas went from $2 a gallon until early \nthis spring to over $7 a gallon--excuse me, $7 per thousand cubic feet. \nWe are not talking gas at the pump; we are talking gas in the pipe, and \nwe are talking thousands of cubic feet. Now it is, as of today, \n$6.66. And those marvelous gas turbines we built have been turned off \nbecause their cost of operation, feeding power into the national power \ngrid, is simply too expensive. We should not have gone there in the \nfirst place, but the absence of good, well-thought-out national energy \npolicy for this country caused, in large part, that to happen.\n\n  Now we are scrambling as a country to find new gas sources. We have \njust recognized and facilitated the building of a national gas pipeline \nout of Alaska to feed the lower 48. We are trying to look at how we \nbring gas ashore in the form of liquefied types, and all of that in \nblend, but recognizing that we desperately need it. We now recognize it \nand are moving in that direction.\n  Coal powers over 50 percent of our generation today. And we have, as \nmany have stated, hundreds of years of supply. But it is not as clean \nas we would like it. This particular piece of legislation incentivizes \ncleaner coal technology and the gasification of coal in the generation \nof power. All of it is moving in the right direction.\n  You just heard a robust discussion about renewables. It is not just \nethanol that renews. I believe hydropower renews--that little flow of \nwater through the pin stock that turns the turbine, that turns the \nlights on in the Pacific Northwest. Nearly 75 percent of all of the \nlights in the Pacific Northwest are generated by hydropower. Yet over \nthe last good number of years, we have been very frustrated because \nalmost all of these dams on rivers that produce hydropower are \nfederally licensed. In 1986, we created legislation that began to bog \ndown the licensing process, or make it so complicated that in a few \ninstances, as the licenses were attempted to be renewed, they simply \nwere not. We have had a few dams torn down, which were no longer viable \nunder certain scenarios. We have said we are going to change that and \ncreate a better process, and we are. It is in this legislation and it \nis important because, over the course of the next good number of years \nin the States of California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, \nover 92 hydro facilities need to be relicensed. We want them to be \nefficient and environmentally sound, but they are an important part of \nthe overall electrical base load of this country.\n  Well, there are a good many issues that I will talk about over the \ncourse of the next several days as we debate this critical piece of \nlegislation. I am going to spend some time with alternative sources and \na good deal of time with nuclear. Why? Because the world has awakened \nto the fact. As the Senator from Tennessee so clearly said, in this \ncountry nearly 70 percent of our electrical base that is carbon free, \nnonemitting, is generated by nuclear power. It is the only true clean \nsource today of energy, outside of hydro, and we all recognize we are \nprobably not going to be damming up a lot more rivers in our country to \nproduce hydropower to meet that base load.\n  Every major utility in this country that has a responsibility to the \nconsuming public to turn on the lights in the home and fuel the \nproduction plants of the facilities of our country is looking forward \nfor 10 years now and saying: How do we build a base for 10 years out? \nIt takes that long in the construction process. All of them recognize \nthere is largely only one source with which you do that, and that is \nnuclear. We recognize it in this bill. I do believe our Nation and the \nworld are in what some could call, and what I hope is a nuclear \nrenaissance, a recognition of this very clean and very safe source of \nenergy. This legislation recognizes it and begins to facilitate it in \nways that we have not done in the past. There seems to be a growing \ngeneral acceptance to the recognition of the importance of nuclear in \nour national energy base and the role it plays.\n  A good deal more can be said about a very bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. I thank Senator Pete Domenici and Senator Bingaman. Both \nhave worked as chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee, on \nwhich I am a senior member, to craft and create balance in this \nlegislation. There are going to be a good many amendments. Some will \nfail, some will not. But they are a general expression of a concern, I \ndo believe, and a recognition of the very important nature of this \npiece of legislation that can become public policy and put this country \nback into the business of producing energy. We are no longer able to \nafford the selectivity that some have argued for some time--a little \nbit of this but none of that; some of this but never go there--in the \ngeneral debate about energy.\n  Largely, the American consuming public today is saying: Congress, get \nyour act together. Five years of debate is long enough. Get this \ncountry back into the business of producing energy--all forms, all \ntypes, an abundant market basketful of it. Keep it clean, explore new \ntechnologies, provide for conservation. But in the end, Congress, get \nit together and get it to the President's desk.\n  I believe this bill embodies that philosophy. It was clearly \nrecognized in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on which I \nserve. I hope that over the course of the next several weeks, as we \nwork ourselves through the amendment process, we will have a bill, that \nwe can work out our differences with the House in conference, and see \nit on the President's desk and be able to very proudly and responsibly \nsay to the American consumer: We have heard you. We recognize the needs \nof this country, and we are creating public policy to put this country \nback into the business of self-reliance for national security purposes, \nfor future economic purposes, but most importantly, a clear recognition \nthat we must, as a country, stand on our own two feet in the business \nof producing energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have been discussing this \nEnergy bill. At 10 o'clock this morning, I\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\nhad discussions with the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember. They were trying to work out some language to solve the problem \nwith regard to drilling off the coast of Florida, and it is 6\\1/2\\ \nhours later, and I still don't see any of that language. So I was going \nto go on and continue to explain the background on this amendment, \nunless the chairman of the committee had something he wanted to share. \nI will yield to him without giving up my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's attitude and \nhis willingness to cooperate. I remind the Senator, in all \ngraciousness, that we are going to be on this bill for about 2 weeks. \nSo nothing is going to happen. We have our own initiative, and we have \nprepared something. There is a Senator who wants to see it from my \nstandpoint before we submit it. It is en route to her now--Senator \nLandrieu. She has been working in our committee. She is looking at what \nI suggest. It is what I have in mind. We should be ready soon.\n  I thank the Senator for inquiring, and I hope he will let us take up \nan amendment on ethanol. It will not take very long, and we will be \nback to the Senator very soon.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator clarified \nthat. I think it is curious why, since this Senator made the initial \nrequest and did so last Thursday when I told the chairman of the \ncommittee I would not object to the motion to proceed, and did so \nyesterday in my conversation with the Senator on the telephone, and I \ndid so in a personal conversation with Senator Bingaman. Again, at 10 \no'clock this morning, I renewed both of those requests. I think it is \ncurious that language is being shared with other Senators and not with \nthis Senator. It is 6\\1/2\\ hours after we had these conversations on \nthe floor.\n  So one starts to wonder, is someone traipsing around trying to avoid \nshowing this Senator from Florida the language which was going to be \nagreed to by all of us? So it is my intention--if we are not going to \nhave the sharing of this information with this Senator, then this \nSenator clearly wants to continue explaining the emergency nature for \nthe 18 million people of Florida.\n  So I would just continue to do that. I wish to show again what--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, could I say to you, please let us proceed. The \nreason I am showing it to a Senator is to try to make sure you get \nsomething quicker rather than later. It is not an effort to avoid you. \nWe are not just discussing Florida. We greatly respect you, but some \nother Senator would like to look at this, which would make it easier \nfor you.\n  I can make a deal with you, Senator, and I have to show it to some \nother Senator. I am trying to show it to one who I know wants to see \nit. Now, we cannot just drop everything. I very much am sorry about \nthat. I am going to do my best, but if you would like to talk tonight, \nwe will all leave and you can talk tonight. If you would like us to get \na little bit of work done, please relax. We know you are going to win. \nNothing is going to happen to Florida. How many more times do you want \nus to say it? We are hiding nothing from you. We have some other work \nto do. You are terrific. You are a great advocate. You are going to win \nfor Florida. You have got the most terrific Senator. Please understand \nyou are going to win.\n  Senator Martinez, you are going to win. You do not have to come down \nhere every minute. You are going to succeed. Floridians, do not worry. \nThis bill will be here 2 more weeks. It cannot pass without you two. So \nwould you give us a little leeway? I just beg you.\n  Now having said that, I ask the Senator from California to offer an \namendment that is relevant.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from \nFlorida has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from New Mexico has the floor. I did not \nask him to give me the floor. I got the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from Florida has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida obtained consent that \nhe might yield while retaining his right to the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not care if I have the floor or not. You can have \nthe floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator, and I thank the \ndistinguished chairman.\n  I take the distinguished chairman at his word, but this Senator \ncannot evaluate any language unless he sees it. For some reason, it is \nbeing shared with everyone in the Senate except this Senator from \nFlorida. So the Senator from Florida is going to proceed with the \nexplanation of why this is so critical to 18 million Floridians.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I want to tell you one more time, I cannot \nshare--Mr. President, I ask if he would yield for a moment without \nlosing his right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Without losing the floor, yes, I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are 100 Senators. I am not trying to do anything \nbut get the Senator a proposal as soon as humanly possible. Now, if you \nchoose to delay us further, we are going to get nothing done tonight. I \nwant you to know that accomplishes nothing. If you think it \naccomplishes something, just go right ahead. I would say you can have \nthe floor back--I will ask consent that you can have it--as soon as the \nBoxer amendment is disposed of. Would you let us take it up, and then \nyou can have the floor back? In the meantime, we are trying to get your \nlanguage--not your language, the language so we can share with those \nSenators who have the concern that you have. If you let us do that, we \nwill proceed in that manner. We have done everything bipartisan on this \nbill. There is no intention otherwise. I ask you one more time if you \nwould do that, Senator. I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from Florida will yield the floor \nwhen I see a good-faith effort of sharing the language. The Senator \nfrom Florida has been waiting for 6\\1/2\\ hours. I have made innumerable \nrequests to the Senator's staff, both majority and minority. It has not \nbeen provided to me. The Senator from Florida is going to continue to \ntalk until it is.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, would you yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would yield without losing the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, you can talk all night. There will be no \nlanguage for you tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is what we have in \nFlorida, and it is one of the things we are trying to protect.\n  This is one of the things that could result.\n  There is a $50 billion-a-year tourism industry. This, we cannot \nwithstand.\n  This is what we want to protect--some of the most pristine waters, \nsome of the most pristine beaches.\n  That is what can happen to our tourism industry. That is not what we \nwant.\n  As has been stated before by the Senator who is the Presiding Officer \nand this Senator, we also have a military conflict. Drilling for oil in \nthe eastern gulf is incompatible with weapons testing and combat \ntraining.\n  We have a statement that has been made by the Secretary of Defense. \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld stated to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee:\n\n       Encroachment is a problem that is real, it is serious. The \n     United States needs bases, it needs ranges, it needs test \n     ranges. And it cannot provide the training and testing that \n     people need before they go into battle unless those kinds of \n     facilities are available.\n\n  To further quote:\n\n       Each year that goes by, there are greater and greater \n     pressures on them.\n\n  This was testimony by the Secretary of Defense to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. It is, in fact, the case. This is where major \nmilitary training occurs. It is in the Gulf of Mexico off the eastern \nseaboard, just with regard to our State. There are other places in the \ncountry. One can see all of this eastern area of the Gulf of Mexico is, \nin fact, restricted airspace for military aircraft training. This has \ntaken on an increased importance since the Navy Atlantic Fleet training \nthat used to occur down in the little island of Vieques off of the big \nisland of Puerto Rico--at the request of the Puerto Rican Government, \nthe Navy shut that\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\ndown, and a lot of that training has come here. A lot of that training \nis occurring out of these military bases. Plus, the aircraft carriers \ncome into the Atlantic region for training as well as they come into \nthe gulf and do training with other surface warfare ships, coordinated \nwith U.S. aircraft.\n  It is this Senator's contention, and has been stated likewise by my \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Martinez, that it is an incompatible \nactivity to have oil and gas rigs on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico \nunderneath where all of this military training is occurring. That has \nbeen recognized all the more in plans by the Department of Defense.\n\n  Whereas, the student pilot training is now being concentrated at \nPensacola Naval Air Station and at Whiting Field, northeast of \nPensacola, north of Milton, the training for the Joint Strike Fighter, \nwhich will be used by all branches of the military, that F-35, they \nwill train those pilots at Eglin Air Force Base, near Fort Walton \nBeach. The new stealth fighter, the F-22, will have its pilots being \ntrained out of Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City.\n  Why are those three major training commands--one Air Force, one a \njoint military fighter, and then student pilots, where they train not \nonly Navy but Coast Guard, as well as Air Force--why is that in that \nlocation?\n  It is because of this national asset that we have, which is called \nrestricted airspace, which has become so much more important now that \nthe Navy is denied training down in the Caribbean and that training, in \nlarge part, is being done right there.\n  So is it any wonder, then, that drilling for oil in the eastern Gulf \nof Mexico is incompatible with weapon testing and combat training? It \nis.\n  I would not have to underscore, very much, the delicacy of Florida's \nenvironment to tell you about the extraordinary sensitivity of the \nmangroves, the sensitivity of the estuaries, the bays where the rivers \nflow. Here in the State of Florida, down in this portion, Ten Thousand \nIslands--they are all mangrove islands. They border the Everglades.\n  Up in this section of Florida, the Big Bend--again, no sand beaches \nbecause it is a part of our ecology that is so delicately balanced, \nwhere all of the water life comes in and reproduces in those shallow \nwaters. It is a place where one of Florida's major rivers, the Suwannee \nRiver, dumps into the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Likewise, up here near Apalachicola, a place where the major river of \nFlorida, the Apalachicola River, comes in and dumps into Apalachicola \nBay, is a place where it produces extraordinary, world-famous \nApalachicolan oysters because of the unique environment and brackish \nwater that allows these delicacies of oysters to be able to grow and \nthen be harvested.\n  In fact, there is a reason why this part of the gulf you see does not \nhave any drilling in it, when, in fact, an imaginary line, directly \ndown from the Florida-Alabama line, everything to the west of there is \nwhere you see the drilling. One of the first reasons for that is that, \nin fact, that is where the oil and the gas is. That is where the mother \nload of oil has been and is being drilled. You can see the color here \non this map. Less so off of Texas; very much so off of Louisiana; \nlikewise off of Mississippi; and likewise off of Alabama. It was this \n1.5 billion acres, in what was a part of Lease Sale 181, that was \nagreed to by the Governor of Florida, back in 2001, that it would not \ncross the longitude line that separates the border of Alabama and \nFlorida.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator will be glad to yield to my \nleader, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator to yield so the Senator from California \ncan offer an amendment. She will speak for up to 20 minutes. In the \nmeantime, Senator Domenici has a piece of paper you are probably \ninterested in, and that would probably move this thing along rather \nquickly.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Is it my understanding you are saying there is \nsome language at which the Senator would be able to look?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, there is some language I have to give you to look \nat.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent Senator Boxer be allowed to offer \nher second-degree amendment to the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Without losing my right to the floor. I thank \nthe leader. It is merely what I had asked. I have been waiting for 6 \nhours and 45 minutes from when this request was initially made and was \nnot provided any language. I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say, through the Chair to my friend from Florida, \nthe Senator from New Mexico has worked very hard on this bill. Both \nSenators from New Mexico worked very hard. This is an issue that is \ndifficult for reasons it probably should not be, but it is a difficult \nissue. I know the Senator from New Mexico has done everything he can.\n  I appreciate everyone's cooperation. This is an important bill to \nRepublicans and to Democrats. One reason I feel some anxiety is there \nis an event downtown tonight that is going to cause us to have a short \nnight. Unfortunately, when people die, it is always at a bad time. \nSenator Exon's funeral is tomorrow. It will make us have an afternoon \nwithout any votes. And we have a longstanding Senate retreat this \nFriday. So we need to get as much done as we can.\n\n  I appreciate everyone's cooperation, especially the two managers of \nthe bill and Senators Martinez and Nelson and Landrieu, for helping us \nwork through this.\n  I ask my unanimous consent request be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Since the Senator from Florida still has the \nfloor, I thank Senator Reid for working this out. I acknowledge that \nthe chairman of the committee has had enormous pressure. But as the \nSenate Rules provide, each Senator has an opportunity to stand up and \nfight for the interests of his or her State. That is what this Senator, \nas well as my colleague, intend to do.\n  I agree to the Senator's request, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, in order \nthat we might reach a conclusion, my understanding is that Senator \nBoxer will offer the amendment, speak for 10 or 15 minutes or whatever \nshe speaks. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 4 minutes in \nopposition to her amendment following that. Then, my guess is, it will \nbe disposed of.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Inhofe will desire to speak. Let's put it all \ntogether, and then we can finish.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will allow me to speak for 4 or 5 minutes \nafter he speaks?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And then we will vote on or in relation to it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make sure, since it is my amendment--I don't \nwant to lose total control of this. I would like to get to close after \nI have heard the opposition. I would love to have 2 minutes to rebut. \nIf I could have 15 minutes to speak in favor of the amendment, have my \ncolleagues lay out the argument against it, and if I could have 4 \nminutes to wind up, that will be good for me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we understand the unanimous consent request? After \nall of that has happened, the Senator from New Mexico would be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the Senator proceeds--but you have the floor--\ncould you yield to me for 1 minute?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to say the distinguished Senator from Florida, \nwho has been speaking, submitted a proposal quite a few hours ago, an \nidea, a thought piece. I want everybody to know that was not acceptable \nnot only to the Senator from New Mexico, it was not acceptable to \nDemocratic Senators on his side of the aisle. So we have not tried to \nhide anything.\n  I regret the Senator has even implied that we tried to do that. It is \nnot right. We have been working as hard as we can. It is not much to \ntake 4 or 5 hours. Sometimes around here you have to take a dictionary \nwhen you are working on something because people do not understand \nwords. That is how hard it has been in the past.\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\n  Having said that, I yield the floor, and I will give the Senator this \nstatement. I hope he understands--the senior Senator and the junior \nSenator--I would like both of you to read it. I don't think it is \nanything fabulous, but I hope the Senators will feast their eyes on it.\n  Mr. REID. Do we have consent on the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consent has been granted for the Senator to \noffer her amendment, and a series of Senators will be recognized for a \nset amount of time in the said order. Then the Senator from New Mexico \nwill be recognized.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding there will be a vote after that on \nor in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that part of the request?\n  Mr. REID. That was Senator Domenici's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My understanding, after that, I have 15 minutes at this \npoint; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once the amendment has been sent up, yes.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 781 to Amendment No. 779\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 781 to amendment No. 779.\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that ethanol is treated like all other motor \n vehicle fuels and that taxpayers and local governments do not have to \n            pay for environmental damage caused by ethanol)\n\n       Beginning on page 20, strike line 25 and all that follows \n     through page 22 line 3.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. As you can tell from the clerk's reading, it is a very \nstraightforward amendment. What I am offering in this amendment is to \nrecommend to my colleagues we strike out the liability waiver granted \nto the makers of ethanol.\n  The purpose is stated very clearly in the beginning. It says: To \nensure that ethanol is treated like all other motor vehicle fuels and \nthat taxpayers and local governments do not have to pay for \nenvironmental damage caused by ethanol.\n  The amendment before the Senate, to which I have authored this \nsecond-degree amendment, brings, once again, to the Senate an ethanol \nmandate. Some think mandates of ethanol are a good idea. Others think \nit is a bad idea. I hope we all agree taxpayers and local communities \nshould not have to pay to clean up any mess caused by ethanol.\n  The point of the bill is to force States--whether they want to or \nnot, frankly--to utilize more and more ethanol, not as a crowning blow \nto the States that did not want to do this, by virtue of the fact there \nis a safe harbor for ethanol, meaning that no liability can be found \nfor the makers of ethanol, but we are saying to cities, States, and \ncommunities, even if you do not want to use it, A, you are forced to \nuse it; and, B, if there is a problem, we, the ethanol makers, will not \nbe there to help you. It will fall to the local communities to pick up \nthe tab.\n  A lot of people say ethanol is totally safe. I ask a commonsense \nquestion to the people of the United States of America who are going to \nhave to make sure they are pumping their cars with ethanol in greater \nand greater proportion: If it is so safe, why are the companies seeking \na liability exemption?\n  I have been around enough years to know if somebody says, Step right \nup, step right up, try this product; this product is completely safe; \nit can bring no harm to you; it is perfect, never a problem; but, by \nthe way, before you ingest it or use it, sign a form that says you \nwon't hold us responsible if you choke or you get cancer or you die. If \nsomebody does that to you, I will say as the daughter of a lawyer, the \nwife of a lawyer, and the mom of a lawyer, do not sign away your \nrights. Do not sign away your rights. A light bulb should go on: What \nis wrong with this picture? If this product is so safe, why should I \nsign this liability waiver?\n  That is what is happening in this bill. We have had a vote on this \nbefore, and we have gotten anywhere from between 38 and 42 votes. It is \nimportant to go on the record again.\n  Why do I say that? We have had a terrible problem with MTBE where, \nthank goodness, there was no safe harbor. Communities such as Santa \nMonica and Lake Tahoe, communities in New Hampshire, and all across \nthis country have been able to go back and hold the companies \naccountable for MTBE. The courts have said yes, communities, you have a \nright to hold these companies accountable for the damage done by MTBE.\n  Now we have a new mandate--ethanol. My colleagues who love ethanol, \nwho want ethanol, who dream of ethanol morning, noon, and night--and \nthis is not a partisan issue; it cuts across party lines--are giving \nthe makers of ethanol a pass. This is a special interest loophole.\n  The exemption language starts off with this: ``Notwithstanding any \nother provision of Federal or State law''--and then they talk about the \nwaiver. When you see that in the bill, put up your antenna. It raises \nred flags. You know then the public is losing rights.\n  ``Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law''--and \nthen they do harm and put the waiver in there. It goes on to say that \nrenewable fuels--that is ethanol--cannot be found to be defectively \ndesigned or manufactured.\n  This is the Senate of the United States of America. I did not know we \nwere expert scientists and doctors who deal with environmental damage. \nWe are saying renewable fuels--ethanol--cannot be found to be \ndefectively designed or manufactured. Compliance with laws and \nregulations is not necessary to getting the liability waiver except for \nlimited compliance requirements under the Clean Air Act.\n  My colleagues are going to say--I am sure the Senators from North \nDakota, from Oklahoma--Senator Boxer is wrong. This is a narrow waiver.\n  Not true. The special interests and the people who represent ethanol \nwill say the waiver is not really broad. It only protects these makers \nof ethanol from one type of lawsuit.\n  But let me state the type of lawsuit they are protected against. It \nis the only lawsuit that has standing in the courts of the United \nStates of America. How do we know this? Look at MTBE. Lake Tahoe won \ntheir MTBE suit. Why? Because they were able to use the defective \nproduct liability claim. The judge, as a matter of fact, threw out the \nnegligence claim, the nuisance claim.\n  So when my colleagues get up here and say, Senator Boxer is \nexaggerating, we are not throwing out the ability of people to sue--\nyes, we are because the only pathway for the public, for our cities, \nfor our counties, for our States to hold people accountable for a \ndefective product is the defective product cause of action. Losing that \nright to bring defective product liability lets the polluters off the \nhook entirely.\n  Again, I will talk about a San Francisco jury in a landmark case \ndecided in April of 2002. The jury found that based on the theory that \nMTBE is a defective product, several major oil companies are legally \nresponsible for the environmental harm to Lake Tahoe's groundwater. The \njury also found many of these major oil companies acted with malice \nbecause they were aware of the dangers but withheld information. We did \nnot have this safe harbor provision when MTBE was, essentially, \nmandated. Therefore, my communities in California and communities \nacross the country are able to recover the damages.\n  Not so with ethanol. The makers of ethanol have made sure they are \ngoing to be covered and protected. It is an embarrassment we would do \nthis. This is the place we are supposed to protect the public interest. \nThis is the place we are supposed to protect our people from defective \nproducts, not put in language that waives all the ability of people to \nsue on a defective product claim.\n\n  It is a scary thought if this were in place for MTBE--by the way, \nthere is still a move to do that on MTBE, which is another issue for \nanother day. It is a scary thought if we had done this for MTBE. My \npeople in Lake Tahoe, the good people there, could be left holding the \nbag, and your towns and cities could be left holding the bag. If \nethanol\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\nharms public health or the environment, the loophole in the Energy bill \nrisks leaving our communities with a mess. Polluters, not taxpayers or \nvictims of pollution, should pay for harm to public health and the \nenvironment.\n  When gasoline leaks today, there is no loophole. The polluter pays. \nWhy should the oil companies and the ethanol producers get off the hook \nif they cause harm? They should not.\n  So again, you are going to hear a lot of doubletalk when people stand \nup. They are going to first say ethanol is safe, there is no problem. \nAnd I say you say to them: If ethanol is so safe and you feel so \ncomfortable with it, why do you need a liability waiver for the makers \nof ethanol? And then they are going to say: Oh, don't worry, we are \nonly saying you can't sue because of a defective product. That is all. \nYou can still sue for nuisance, negligence, all the other things, when, \nin fact, we know from legal history that the only claim that has \nstanding here is a defective product lawsuit.\n  Now, to talk about ethanol's safety--Mr. President, I ask, how many \nminutes do I have of my 15, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  According to EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in gasoline, which \ninclude ethanol and MTBE, ethanol is extremely soluble in water and \nshould spread if leaked into the environment at the same rate as MTBE. \nIt may spread plumes of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene \nbecause ethanol may inhibit the breakdown of these toxic materials. \nAlthough ethanol contributes some clean air benefits, it also increases \nthe formation of nitrogen oxides, which lead to increases in smog.\n  So I think if you listen to the experts and you forget the special \ninterests, you will support my amendment. We need to ask ourselves, are \nwe in the business of letting people off the hook, people who have a \nresponsibility for what they are putting into our gasoline, into our \nair, into the ground?\n  We mandated airbags, and we did not say to those manufacturers that \nthey should not be liable. If there is a defective product problem with \nan airbag, people can hold the companies responsible if it does not \nwork or it harms them. Why would we give a free pass to ethanol? There \nis only one answer: special interests, powerful, powerful special \ninterests. There is no other answer that you can come up with.\n  If we do not learn from our mistakes, we are doomed to repeat the \nmistakes of the past.\n  My amendment will eliminate the special interest liability exemption \nfor ethanol in this amendment. It means that ethanol will not be \ntreated any better or any worse than other fuels. It will mean ethanol \nwill be treated the same way as any other fuel. We should not shift the \nburden of cleaning up any problems caused by ethanol to our \ncommunities. The polluters should pay. The safe harbor liability \nexemption for ethanol should be taken out of this amendment.\n  I have to say to my friends, I know how anxious you are to have \nethanol. I know it means a lot to the corn producers, and, frankly, it \nmeans a lot to my agricultural people. I have some good language in \nthis bill dealing with ethanol made from other materials. But I still \nbelieve that my people who will produce this ethanol should not be left \noff the hook if there is a serious problem to the health of the people \nof the United States of America.\n  So the amendment is simple. I hope we can have a good vote, a solid \nvote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor with the understanding that I will close the \ndebate. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment by my \ncolleague from California. I regret that we are on different sides on \nthis issue, but this amendment is unnecessary. It addresses a problem \nthat does not exist, in my judgment. And my guess is, the Senate will, \nas it has in the past, vote to oppose this amendment. But I do wish to \nmake a couple of comments about the issue of ethanol more generally.\n  I was listening to my colleague, and I was thinking about energy and \nthinking about that old country western song that was titled ``When Gas \nWas 30 Cents a Gallon, Love Was 60 Cents Away.'' We are a long way from \n30-cent-a-gallon gas, and I don't expect we will ever see 30-cent-a-\ngallon gas any longer.\n  Sixty percent of the oil we use in this country comes from off our \nshores, much of it from very troubled parts of the world--Saudi Arabia, \nKuwait, Iraq, Venezuela, and more. It is estimated that it is going to \ngrow to 69 percent in a relatively short period of time. We are \nhopelessly addicted to foreign oil, much to the detriment of this \ncountry.\n  The use of ethanol is not going to solve that, but it moves us in the \nright direction in addressing it. Ethanol is a simple proposition--it \nis being able to grow our energy in our farm fields. Think of it: Take \na kernel of corn, extract a drop of alcohol from the kernel of corn, \nand still have the protein feedstock left to feed the cows.\n  This is about growing our energy. It is about making us less \ndependent on the Saudis and the Kuwaitis and the Iraqis. I have \nindicated we have this huge addiction to foreign sources of oil.\n  Now, I did not know too much about ethanol before I came to the \nSenate. I have learned a lot about it since and have been involved in \ntrying to make certain that we support ethanol production. But I \nlearned enough about it from a full-page ad that I read by a major oil \ncompany one day in a daily newspaper. This major oil company had spent \nenough money to take out a big old advertisement saying how bad ethanol \nwas for America. I looked at that and I thought: Well, now, if this big \noil company thinks it is bad, maybe I ought to take a good, hard look \nat it because I figure it is probably good for this country.\n  You see, they do not want competition. They have been trashing \nethanol for a long time. But the fact is, we are not only addicted to \nforeign oil, we have this enormous growth in the size of energy \ncompanies through mergers and acquisitions, and so now there are just a \nfew companies left. And between OPEC and the few larger energy \ncompanies these days, I do not have any great confidence that there is \nnot market manipulation going on. However, I don't know, but I saw what \nhappened in California with electricity because they could, because \nthat kind of market power allowed them to do that.\n  So I am very interested in trying to see if we can diversify the \nproduction of fuel. This capability, through ethanol, gives farmers a \nnew market, allows us to grow fuel in our farm fields and rely on less \nof it from under the sands of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Iraq, for \nexample. It is a winner all the way around, in my judgment.\n  This 8-billion-gallon requirement that we have in this bill is \ncarefully constructed. It moves this country in a very important \ndirection. It will reduce crude oil imports by 2 billion barrels. Think \nof that--a 2-billion-barrel reduction in crude oil imports. It will \nreduce the outflow of dollars largely to foreign oil producers by $64 \nbillion. It will create about 240,000 new jobs, it has been estimated. \nIt will increase U.S. household income by $43 billion.\n  The fact is, this makes sense for everybody. And so I stand here to \nsupport ethanol, as I have on many occasions in the past. I was able to \nbe here earlier today to give an opening speech on energy and touched \non it. But my hope is we will turn back the Boxer amendment and \nstrongly support the ethanol provisions in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I agree with \nmy friend from North Dakota, although I do not agree with him on the \nwhole idea of the mandated ethanol. We have talked about that. We had \nthat debate. That is already behind us now, and this is where we are.\n  I would suggest that many years ago, when I was in the State \nlegislature, my first trip to Washington was to protest Ladybird \nJohnson's Highway Beautification Act of 1965. So I do not like mandates \nto start with, but what I don't like more than the mandates is the fact \nthat you mandate something and then open them up to exposure and expose \nthem to lawsuits. We drafted in my committee this very narrow safe \nharbor provision which is included in\n\n[[Page S6462]]\n\nthe underlying amendment. It was a product of very careful \ndeliberation. It was a compromise. It was a piece of the overall \npackage.\n  The amendment requires the use of a set and increasing amount of \nrenewable fuels. Because the Government requires the use of a \nparticular additive, the Government should not allow compliance with \nthat requirement to be the basis of a lawsuit. That is just common \nsense.\n  I have a great deal of respect for my colleague from California, but \nwhen she talks about the powerful interests we are protecting, is a \nfarmer from Gage, OK, or from Woodward, OK, a powerful special interest \ngroup? No, he is not. He is someone who has a law. There is a law out \nthere. He is complying with the law. He says: I guess I will have to go \nahead and supply the corn for ethanol. Then he finds out, down the \nroad, he is being named in a lawsuit. We know this happens. It may not \nbe the intent of the law, but it is the effect of the law. That is what \nhappens.\n  On April 22, trial lawyers in the City of Merced v. Chevron have \nalready filed an MTBE-style case attacking ethanol. The plaintiff's \ndrafting in their lawsuit is purposely different and includes the term \n``other oxygenates and ethers.'' This careful inclusion necessarily \nincludes ethanol because the only other ``oxygenate'' per se is \nethanol.\n  Any of those trying to use the argument that if you do this, this \nsomehow affects MTBE and would reduce their responsibility, it does not \naffect them. The renewable fuels safe harbor does not relate to MTBE. \nThe text of the renewables liability provision is clear. Only renewable \nfuels, as defined elsewhere in the amendment, can qualify for the safe \nharbor. MTBE is not within the renewables definition.\n  I would hope, as people cast their vote, they would keep in mind \nthere is one great issue, and that is a fairness. For Government to \ncome along and mandate something is bad enough. But for Government to \ncome along and mandate something and then say there is no protection \nfor complying with the law, that is not right. It is a fairness issue. \nI believe we should defeat the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am not asking unanimous consent. I am asking for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is not subject to an objection.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this time, there is not.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Does the Senator withhold the quorum call request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the status of the bill \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes remaining to the Senator \nfrom California on her amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I won't take the 4 minutes, but I had \nasked for 4 in the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the quorum call was charged \nagainst the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am glad we are going to vote on my \namendment. I understand that Senator Domenici will move to table. That \nis fine with me, as long as we have a vote.\n  Again, this is a very interesting issue in terms of what our \nresponsibility is. As Members of the Senate, we have a responsibility \nto protect the health and safety of the people of our country. Why on \nEarth would we give a waiver of liability to the makers of ethanol \nwhen, in fact, we are not sure what is going to happen with heavy use \nof ethanol? We are not sure whether it is going to cause a problem for \nour people and who is going to have to pay to clean up the mess.\n  We know what happened with MTBE. We know it was in communities such \nas Lake Tahoe, Santa Monica, and communities in the Northeast and all \nacross the country. I remember I had a map that showed where MTBE was a \nproblem. It is practically in every State in the Union. The courts have \nmade it clear that the people who made the MTBE have to come into these \ncommunities and clean it up. Now we are saying with ethanol, on the one \nhand, it is safe. Well, if it is so safe, why do we have to give it a \nspecial safe harbor and people give up their right to recover in their \ncommunity in Tennessee or communities in California?\n  The fact is, they will say the waiver of liability is very narrow \nbut, in fact, what they have waived is the only course of action a \ncommunity can pursue.\n  Then you will hear: This is different because we are mandating \nethanol. Therefore, we should protect the people who make it. We \nmandated airbags, and we didn't give a liability waiver to the people \nwho make airbags. We mandate pollution control devices, but we don't \ngive a liability waiver to the people who make it. So this is about the \nsheer power of special interests.\n  Let's not put our communities at risk. We could debate whether we \nought to have this ethanol mandate. As we will see how it comes out, \nsome people favor it, some don't. We should agree to protect our \npeople.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against the motion to table the Boxer \namendment. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 781 and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Ohio (Mr. DeWine).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 782 To Amendment No. 779\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 782 to amendment No. 779.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the reliable fuels subtitle of the amendment)\n\n       Strike subtitle B of the amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment that has been put before the Senate by my good friend and \ncolleague from New Mexico and offer a second-degree amendment to it. \nNow, I do so not only out of the sincere belief that the provision will \nhurt consumers in New York, but that it will hurt consumers throughout \nthe country, and that it is anticompetitive and not the way a free \nmarket ought to go.\n  The amendment of my good friend from New Mexico is one of those \namendments that, while well-intentioned, could come back to haunt every \none of us. I have been in Congress for 23 years, and every so often \nthere is an amendment that people vote for, confident on the surface \nthat it seems like the right thing to do, and a few years later it \nturns out to be a big disaster. Then our constituents turn to us and \nsay: What the heck have you done? How could you have done this?\n  This is one of those amendments, like a catastrophic illness. My \ncolleagues, beware. If there was ever an amendment quietly put in a \nbill that should really have a skull and crossbones label on it, at \nleast to those of us from States without a large amount of ethanol, \nthis amendment is it.\n  So today I rise to join my colleague from New York, my colleagues \nfrom California and elsewhere, mainly on the coasts, but not \nexclusively so, to debate an unprecedented new ethanol gas tax that \nwould be levied on the American people by the amendment we are now \nconsidering.\n  So many are against any kind of gas tax. I understand that. I have \nopposed many gas taxes, too. But why, when the gas tax comes in the \nform of an ethanol mandate but has the same effect--causes the price of \ngasoline to those under its yoke to rise--do we not oppose it?\n  The amendment offered by Senator Domenici does accomplish two goals \nthat I consider very worthy and which my amendment would let stand. One \nis restricting the use of MTBEs, which has resulted in groundwater \npollution all over the country. The second is scrapping the oxygenate \nmandate that led so many States to make such heavy use of MTBE in the \nfirst place.\n  The proposal in the amendment also provides an antibacksliding \nprovision to require continued efforts on clean air. That is another \ngoal that I support. The number of people who are living longer and \nliving better because our air is cleaner is enormous. We all benefit \nfrom that. So the antibacksliding proposal is a good measure, and I \napplaud it.\n  I believe that eliminating the oxygenate requirement and letting each \nregion meet clean air standards in the way that suits it best is smart \nenergy policy. If that is all my friend from New Mexico did, I would be \non the floor supporting his amendment and cheering it on.\n  But as they say, Mr. President, there is always a catch. This \namendment adds an astonishing new anticonsumer, anti-free-market \nrequirement that every refiner in the country, regardless of where they \nare located, and regardless of whether the State mandates it and \nwhether the State chooses a different path to get to clean air, must \nuse an ever-increasing volume of ethanol.\n  If they do not use the ethanol--and this is the most amazing part of \nthe bill--they still have to pay for ethanol credits. If your State \ndoes not want to use ethanol because it is so expensive to transport \nit--there are no pipelines--on the barges and on the boats and in the \ntrucks--so let's say it is too expensive to do that--you still have to \npay for it.\n  If there were ever an onerous, anticompetitive, anti-free-market \nprovision, this is it. Where else do we mandate that people pay for \nsomething when they do not use it? Why are we saying to the car drivers \nof America, the motorists of America, You have to pay for this stuff \neven though you do not use it? It is nothing less than an ethanol gas \ntax levied on every driver--the employee driving to work, the mom who \nis driving kids to school, a truck driver earning a living. Every \ngasoline user in this country will pay.\n  Now, in 2003, the United States consumed only 2.8 billion gallons of \nethanol. Starting in 2006--a mere year away--they would be required to \nuse 4 billion gallons of ethanol. Where are my friends from the free \nmarket when we need them? We hear about the free market. Is this a free \nmarket? Are we letting everyone decide how to meet a worthy clean air \nstandard? Absolutely not. So 2.8 billion last year; in 2006, you have \nto use 4 billion; and by 2012, you have to use 8 billion gallons of \nethanol and increase it every year by a percentage equivalent to the \nproportion of ethanol in the entire U.S. gas supply after 2012 in \nperpetuity.\n  If production does not happen, if we do not have enough ethanol--I \ndon't know how the sponsors came up with 4 billion or 5 billion or 8 \nbillion--guess what happens. We get a big price spike. At a time when \ngasoline is expensive enough, do you want to be accused of passing \nlegislation that will raise the price more? I know there are corn \ngrowers in some States, and I know that Archer Daniels Midland and all \nthese other ethanol producers are pretty powerful. But what about all \nthe drivers and motorists throughout the country? What about them? \nThere are many more of them than the rest, and every one of them will \nbe at risk. Even in the Middle West where there is plenty of ethanol, \nif there is not enough to meet the mandate, there is going to be a \nprice spike for everybody.\n  Now, there are a lot of estimates out there that try to predict what \nthe new mandate is going to cost motorists at the pump. In some of the \nmore conservative estimates, it is a few pennies a gallon. But others \nhave pegged the cost significantly higher. Even though the size of the \nincrease may be open to discussion, it is generally agreed that this \nmandate is going to cause an increase in the price of gasoline.\n  Last year when we had a bill, gasoline was about $1.60 or $1.70 a \ngallon. Now it is $2.25 a gallon. Do we still want to do this? Aren't \ngas prices high enough? The fact that we do not know how severe the \nincrease is going to be should give us pause. As we have seen time and \ntime again, there is not much more of an effective way to stifle an \neconomy or place burdens on families across America than by causing a \nprice spike, a hike in gasoline prices.\n  I know the supporters of this ethanol gas tax are going to argue that \nthe claims I am making are not accurate, and the cost of forcing the \nentire country to use 8 billion gallons of ethanol is a mere pittance. \nRemember, ethanol is very hard to transport. It cannot be carried \nthrough our existing pipeline infrastructure. It must be put on a \ntruck, a barge, sent down the Mississippi, then sent by boat all around \nthe country, then loaded back into a truck, taken to a local refinery, \nand put into the gasoline. That will be the added expense passed on to \nthe driver. That is why this is a regional proposal more than it is a \nparty proposal.\n  To forecast how much a 6-year, 8-billion-gallon ethanol mandate is \ngoing to cost consumers across the country, you first have to look at \nthe interplay of a host of complex factors--the growth in auto travel, \ngasoline prices, corn prices, ethanol prices, how many ethanol plants \nwill come on line--and all of these are inextricably linked to how high \nthe price of ethanol is going to go.\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\n  If ethanol prices are high and manufacturing ethanol profitable, the \nprivate sector will build ethanol plants. If ethanol prices are low, \nthey will not. So I think the numbers my opponents are using make an \nunrealistic set of assumptions, basically that ethanol prices will be \nunusually low for the next 10 years, and yet at the same time the \nprivate sector will be building new plants all over the country. You \ncan't have it both ways. If the price is high, yes, there will be more \nethanol plants. If the price is low, there are not likely to be any, \nand the price is going to go up either way. But in truth, whether it \ncosts a penny a gallon or a dollar a gallon, consumers should not be \nforced to pay an ethanol gas tax at all.\n\n  There is no sound public policy reason for mandating the use of \nethanol, other than political might of the ethanol lobby. The new \nethanol tax will contribute to market volatility and price spikes, \nespecially because the ethanol industry is highly concentrated within a \nfew large firms located in the Middle West. In fact, ADM alone controls \nalmost 30 percent of the market, according to CRS.\n  My opponents also argue that the ethanol gas tax is needed to help \nfamily farms. I take these arguments seriously. I know how many of my \ncolleagues from the Middle West want to help family farmers who are \nstruggling. I want to help those farmers, too. I have stood by my \nSenate colleagues and voted for billions of dollars in agricultural \nsubsidies to help the farmers in the South and West, even though those \ncommodity subsidies don't help my farmers in New York. But as I have \nsaid, the ethanol gas tax money will not be going mostly into the \npockets of family farmers, it will go into the pockets of ADM and the \nother big ethanol companies. All of a sudden, are the farmers going to \nget the big benefit? They don't get it for milk. They don't it for \ncorn. They don't get it for meat. Is the beneficent rule of ADM going \nto give our corn growers the benefits of this or do you think ADM and \nthe other big companies will take the benefit for themselves?\n  If you want to help our family farmers, take the money you are using \nthat will cost this and give it to them, and you will spend a lot less \nmoney and help the family farmer a lot more without all the middlemen \nwho don't need the help.\n  The final argument my opponents will make--and this is a cynical \none--is that if New York and California and other States want to clean \nup their water by banning MTBEs and maintaining clean air, they should \nhave to pay the price of an ethanol gas tax, and it is political \nnaivete to think otherwise. My State has already banned MTBE. So have \nothers, such as California, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Illinois, \nIowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, \nOhio, South Dakota, and Washington. Every one of these States has \nenacted its own MTBE bans or taken steps to restrict its use. A number \nof other States are in the process of taking action as well. Because \nwhat we have learned is that MTBEs pollute the ground water.\n  Every one of those States that has banned MTBE is going to find \nitself in an impossible dilemma. Their citizens are demanding they ban \nMTBE, but with the oxygenate requirement in place, they can't do so. \nRecently, the EPA denied the application of New York and California for \na waiver from the oxygenate requirement, putting States with MTBE bans \nbetween a rock and a hard place. Our citizens' health and the \nenvironment are being held hostage to the desire of the ethanol lobby \nto make ever larger profits. Why didn't the EPA grant the waiver? It \ndidn't affect clean air or clean water. Raw politics, trying to suck \nmoney out of one region and put it in another. That is not fair. That \nis not right.\n  Our citizens' health and environment are being held hostage to the \ndesire of the ethanol lobby to make ever larger profits. The \nadministration has already gone along. Will this Senate?\n  It is an outrage. For Congress to tell Americans across the country \nthat we refuse to clean up the air and water unless they pay off ADM is \nunconscionable. There is no public policy reason on Earth not to allow \nStates to ban MTBEs and remove the oxygenate requirement and keep clean \nair standards in place without requiring them to buy ethanol.\n  In New York, we have been forced to for over a year and a half. Our \ngasoline prices are too high already, and the unnecessary ethanol \nrequirement we face is not helping.\n  In conclusion, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment to strike \nthe ethanol mandate. If you believe that Congress has the obligation to \nprotect the health of our citizens and the environment, support banning \nMTBE, getting rid of the oxygenate requirement, and maintaining clean \nair standards. Don't support forcing American consumers to pay for \nethanol in exchange. If you believe the Congress has an obligation to \nprotect consumers and keep our free market running as efficiently as \npossible, then, again, I ask Members, please, do not support forcing \nAmerican consumers to raise their gas prices and to pay for ethanol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield for a brief question to my good \nfriend from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Since my friend mentioned----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe I have the floor. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thought he still had the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I didn't think I had yet yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York still has the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I was about to, but I am finished with my statement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just wanted to respond to my friend from New York. Is \nmy friend from New York aware of the fact that right now, the price of \ngasoline is around $2.03, or $2.05 a gallon? Ethanol right now is about \n$1.60 a gallon. My question to my friend from New York is, if the free \nmarket is at work, why aren't the oil companies blending more ethanol \nsince they would make more money?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, let me answer my friend. The cost of ethanol \nvaries greatly depending on what region of the country the ethanol is \nproduced in. What makes it so expensive for New Yorkers is not the cost \nof actually making it in Iowa or Illinois or Kansas. What makes it so \nexpensive is there is no cheap way to get it from the cornfields of \nIowa to the gas stations of New York and, as a result, the cost of \ntransporting the ethanol. Sure, it can be made out there. We don't have \nmany ethanol plants in New York. They have to put on it barges. They \nhave to ship it slowly down the Mississippi. They have to unload it \nonto boats. The boats have to go round the gulf coast, go around Key \nWest, up the east coast. They have to dock in New York City. It then \nhas to be loaded onto trucks and sent to gas stations--a lengthy and \nexpensive process.\n  Let me say in all seriousness to my good friend from Iowa, I have \ntalked to some of the major refiners in the Northeast. They are able to \nmeet the clean air standard more cheaply and better without ethanol \nthan with it. And by our requiring them to put the ethanol in the \ngasoline is the only reason they do it. If we didn't require them but \nkept the clean air standard, we would have gasoline that is just as \nclean but a lot cheaper for constituents.\n  I want to help your corn farmers, but I don't want the housewife who \ndrives the kids to school or the salesman who has to go door to door to \nbe subsidizing your corn farmers. Let the whole government do it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield for another question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My friend talked about the transporting of ethanol going \ndown the Mississippi and then on barge around this and that. Has my \nfriend ever considered how you get the oil from the Mideast over here? \nYou have to go over there with a big tanker. You have to load it up. \nThen that tanker has to go across the oceans, and it has to come into \nNew York or wherever the port is and unload it. Then it has to be \nshipped to a refinery to refine it.\n  Then, in order to protect that oil pipeline from the Mideast, we have \nto send 130,000 troops, our military. We have to protect our sea \nlanes--the billions of dollars that it costs to protect\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\nshipping that oil from the Mideast and all that. I can assure my friend \nfrom New York that they will never have to send our young men and women \nto Iowa to fight.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We would like to send them to Iowa on vacation to help \npick the corn, but, certainly, we hope that this ethanol fight, as \nfractious as it is--I can state that the citizens of New York will not \ndeclare war on the citizens of Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You will never have to worry about that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Although the bill declares economic war on the citizens \nof New York, Connecticut, California, and other places which don't have \nthe ethanol.\n  By the way, I say to my good friend from Iowa, I would not make the \nanalogy that what the ethanol producers are doing is the same as what \nOPEC is doing with the oil, both causing the price to go way up. I \ndon't like the big oil companies in terms of what they do, but I don't \nthink Archer Daniels Midland is much better.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have 16 ethanol sites in Iowa; 11 are predominantly \nowned by farmers. There is one that Cargill owns, and ADM owns one. \nAlmost all of the new ethanol plants being built in the United States \nare owned and operated by farmer-owned enterprises. It so happens that \nADM was there in the beginning.\n  But what is happening now--and especially with this legislation--is \nyou are going to see more and more farmer-owned plants. That is what is \nhappening. My friend is talking about the past. We are talking about \nthe future.\n  The way to break the OPEC cartel is to get a lot of farmers around \nthe country, using new technologies, making ethanol out of corn and \ncornstalks, and a variety of other feedstocks--and we will soon be \nmaking ethanol in the State of New York, as well as in New England. \nThat is what this is about. It breaks the back of the OPEC cartel.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say to my friend, I would like nothing better than to \nbreak the cartel. Some say one of the ways to break the cartel is to \nput a tax on gasoline. The higher you tax the gasoline, the less you \nwill need OPEC. That is true. But the reason we reject that high tax on \ngasoline is the burden it puts on average people. Well, if that burden \nis placed on the average driver in New York to pay a lot more to the \nethanol producers rather than OPEC, what have we gained? Fifty cents \nout of your pocket? If faced with a choice, I would rather have it go \nto an American company--although there is ExxonMobil and others--I \nwould rather it go to an American producer in the cornfields in Iowa \nthan to the oilfields in Saudi Arabia. But neither is a very good \nchoice. Both of them cause huge hardship on the consumer by raising the \nprice.\n  So all I say to my friend from Iowa, who I know has the interests of \nthe average worker at heart--all I say to him is, if ethanol is better \nthan gasoline and cheaper for people in Iowa or Illinois, God bless \nyou, use it.\n  Let me ask my friend a question. Is it fair--because we won't use the \nethanol in a lot of instances--to say to us, as this amendment does, \nyou have to pay for it whether you use it or not?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond that that is not the case. I will say more \nabout that in my remarks following my friend. That is not the case at \nall. I wanted to correct something. I made a mistake. In all good \nfaith, and in making sure that I speak correctly, I said earlier that a \ngallon of gasoline was $2.03 and ethanol was $1.60. What is it in New \nYork?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is $2.25.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was wrong about ethanol. A gallon of ethanol is only \nabout $1.22. I point out that it would be great if more people used it. \nIt is only $1.22 and $2.25 for gasoline.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague can get the price of whatever it takes \nto drive a car down to $1.22 in New York and have the same efficiency--\nit is almost as efficient, not quite, at 90 percent--and the same level \nof cleanliness in the air, I would be all for it. But everyone knows, \nagain, whether it is $1.20 or $1.60, the basic cost for us is the \ntransportation cost.\n  My colleague from New Mexico has been waiting very patiently. I \nappreciate the spirit of my good friend from Iowa in this dialog, which \nwe have disagreed on over the years. I don't know if we will ever agree \non it.\n  I am happy to yield the floor so my colleague from New Mexico can \nmake his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New York, maybe \non this one we disagree, but we have another big issue that we agree \non. We are going to do something about the art community in your State \nand collectible items.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Maybe under the chairman's leadership--if the chairman \nwill yield--we should add that wonderful amendment to this bill and \npass it right now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know what would happen if we went to the House \nwith it. Maybe we could hurry it up that way. In any event, a number of \nSenators want to speak. I will not address the issue that was spoken to \nbecause many others are going to--except I remind everybody that \nsomething was said here about a monopoly, lack of competition. The \nSenator from New York made the case for lack of competition. When we \nuse gasoline, let's not forget we have been subjected to the most \nmonopolistic control mechanism for the price of almost anything this \ncountry has ever seen. The cartel is strangling us.\n  As we drive down the road, we are driving on gasoline that is indeed \nnoncompetitive. It is competitive for a few cents because the filling \nstations might be competitive, but the basic price is the monopolistic \nissue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the energy bill that we \nwill consider over the next 2 weeks. Senators Domenici and Bingaman \nshould be commended for their bipartisan work in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to bring us to this point today.\n  The events over the last 4 years have highlighted what Americans have \nknown since the 1970s--our national security and our economic security \ndepend on our energy security. Americans need and deserve an energy \nbill that truly moves us toward energy independence.\n  Seriously addressing our national security means kicking our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Today, we import 58 percent of our oil.\n  Our dependence on imported oil poses a risk to our national security \nand our economic well-being.\n  We will consider a number of additional proposals that can help make \ngreater energy security a reality for future generations of Americans.\n  There will be amendments offered to the bill regarding energy \nsecurity, renewable energy, biofuels, climate change, and fuel economy.\n  We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil and make a commitment to \nclean, renewable energy.\n  If we choose to invest in energy efficient technologies and renewable \nenergy, we will create thousands of new jobs . . . we will protect our \nenvironment . . . and we will bolster our national security.\n  That is the vision our Nation needs. That is the leadership we must \nprovide.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I first thank Chairman Domenici and the \nranking member, Senator Bingaman, as well as both of their staffs on \nthe Energy Committee for all of their hard work in preparing an energy \nbill. Their leadership has allowed the Senate to come together today \nand discuss an issue that is paramount to our Nation's quality of life \nand our homeland and economic security.\n  As this body considers omnibus energy legislation, it is crucial that \nwe formulate an energy bill that meets several criteria. The \nlegislation must reduce the United States' unhealthy dependence on \nforeign oil; address the United States' skyrocketing gas prices; invest \nin environmentally friendly technology and research; protect the \nmoratorium on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf; address global \nwarming; and promote energy efficiency.\n  The Department of Energy currently projects that coal and natural gas \nwill be used to meet most of our Nation's increasing electricity energy \ndemand over the next 20 years. It is my firm belief, however, that as \nwe increase generation, the United States must ensure that its energy \nportfolio is well diversified. New Jersey, which is already suffering \nfrom the effects of poor air quality--one-third of which is traced to\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\nout-of-State sources--would not be well suited by increasing our \nreliance on coal. In addition, considering the spiking price of natural \ngas, this source is not the cure-all that it was envisioned to be a few \nyears ago. We must, therefore, consider all forms of electricity \ngeneration to meet our demand, including other clean and domestic forms \nof energy.\n  I am proud to note that New Jersey currently generates 75 percent of \nits electricity from low-polluting sources. Nuclear energy contributes \nalmost 53 percent of the electricity on New Jersey's power grid. \nHowever, the need to protect diverse electricity generation is \nparticularly profound in New Jersey. In addition to rapidly increasing \nelectricity demand, seven generation facilities are scheduled for \nretirement and the license of one nuclear facility expires within the \nnext 5 years--leaving a huge void, since this facility currently meets \n10 percent of New Jersey's peak demand.\n  Promoting renewable energy will help the United States increase its \nenergy security by reducing our dependence on foreign energy sources. \nExpanding our renewable energy resources will also allow us to rely on \ncleaner, more diverse sources of energy. It will also allow us to \ndecrease our reliance on fossil fuels, which in turn could protect \nenergy prices from the volatility of fossil fuel markets. Finally, we \ncan reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution and encourage \neconomic development around renewable energy industries. It is truly a \nwin-win for our country.\n  New Jersey has been a national leader in renewable energy. My State \nalready has its own 20 percent renewable portfolio standard. New Jersey \nis not only the first mid-Atlantic State to adopt renewable energy \nrequirements for all retail energy suppliers, but it also has one of \nthe most aggressive funding mechanisms in the Nation for promoting \nrenewable energy.\n  Protecting our coastlines is another priority of mine when \nconsidering our energy future. Jersey shore tourism, the second largest \nindustry in my home State, generates $31 billion in spending. This \nspending directly and indirectly supports more than 836,000 jobs--more \nthan 20 percent of total State employment--generates more than $16.6 \nbillion in wages, and brings in more than $5.5 billion in tax revenues \nto the State. I am, therefore, deeply concerned about a provision added \nin committee that would allow an inventory of the offshore oil and gas \nresources. While on the surface, an inventory sounds harmless, the \nexplosive impulses associated with seismic exploration of sensitive \ncoastal waters threatens marine life and can be detrimental to \nfisheries. Even more concerning is the fact that the inventory is sure \nto be just a first step on a slippery slope toward offshore drilling. \nWith so much of my State's economy dependent on the cleanliness of our \nbeaches, it is imperative that we stop all efforts to weaken the \nmoratorium on OCS drilling. I am prepared to fight any amendment that \nwould threaten it, including those allowing States to opt out or \nopening up designated areas off our coast. Senator Martinez, Senator \nNelson, and I plan to offer an amendment that would remove the \ninventory provision, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of our \namendment so that we can protect our Nation's coastlines as well as our \nStates' economies.\n\n  It is also my hope that we create an energy policy that adequately \npromotes a clean and healthy environment. It is time that our Nation \nconfronts the serious problem of global warming. Increasing CAFE \nstandards for automobiles and reducing powerplant emissions can go a \nlong way in reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. I was a leader \non this issue during the 107th Congress when the Senate included in the \nEnergy bill the greenhouse gas registry amendment that Senator \nBrownback and I offered. The registry was also a part of the Senate \nEnergy bill that was agreed to by the Senate in the 108th Congress.\n  I was, however, disappointed that an amendment offered by my friend \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, to close the SUV loophole and \nimprove the fuel economy of passenger vehicles failed in committee. I \nbelieve this amendment would have been effective in reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil, cutting global warming emissions, and saving \nconsumers thousands of dollars annually at the gas pump.\n  Another way we can start reducing greenhouse gas emissions is by \npromoting energy efficiency standards for homes and appliances. I am \nproud to say that this bill includes language that I successfully added \nto the 107th Congress Energy bill encouraging the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development and the public housing authorities--PHAs--it \noversees to increase energy efficiency in public housing projects. HUD \nand the PHAs currently oversee approximately 1.3 million units of \nresidential low-income public housing across the country. The Federal \nGovernment spends approximately $1.4 billion total for utility usage in \nthese units. HUD has conservatively estimated that improved energy \nmanagement processes throughout all of its public housing programs \ncould save between $100 and $200 million annually.\n  In addition the Department of Energy has estimated that if energy \nmanagement was improved in all public and assisted housing programs the \nFederal Government could save between $300 million and $1 billion \nannually.\n  My provisions address the absence of resources at HUD to help PHAs \nmanage their utility expenditures and the lack of incentives for \nimplementing energy efficient systems and technologies both contribute \nsignificantly to high energy expenditures. I again thank the chairman \nand ranking member of the Energy Committee for working with me to \ninclude these important energy efficiency provisions in the bill.\n  While there are many issues we need to address in this bill, I also \nwant to make clear my opposition to several amendments that have come \nup in the past in this body. I am adamantly opposed to any special \nfavors for oil and gas producers that would be harmful to many of my \nconstituents. I am especially concerned, therefore, about a provision \nthat was included in the House bill that would shield from \naccountability the manufacturers of MTBE.\n  Finally, when it comes to the renewable fuel standard--RFS--I am very \nconcerned about the 8-billion-gallon RFS included in the Senate bill. \nWith the cost of living in New Jersey being one of the highest in the \nNation, an increase in the mandate would essentially be a gas tax for \nmy constituents.\n  I look forward to the debate on this important bill. It is time that \nwe passed an energy bill that will take the vision of future U.S. \nenergy policy in the right direction--toward energy independence, \ninnovation and conservation.\n\n\n                   moratoria for oil and gas drilling\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, under the chairman and ranking \nmember's leadership, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nproduced an energy bill that passed out of the committee by a vote of \n21 to 1. It is a bill that has a lot going for it. I continue to have \nconcerns about it, including a major concern about a provision that \nrequires an inventory of oil and gas reserves in the Outer Continental \nShelf, which my colleague from Florida and I will attempt to remove. \nAnd I am aware of other important amendments that will be offered by my \ncolleagues to improve the bill. But I want to indicate to the \ndistinguished chairman that I think he has gotten his bill off to a \ngood start.\n  However, the progress of this bill would be jeopardized if we begin \nto debate amendments that would change the status quo with respect to \nthe sale of leases for oil and gas drilling in the Outer Continental \nShelf. Vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf are under moratoria \nfor oil and gas drilling, and other extremely sensitive areas, such as \nLease Sale 181 in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico off of Florida, have been \nmade unavailable for leasing by the Department of the Interior.\n  I am aware that there are differences of view among my colleagues on \nhow we should proceed with respect to the Outer Continental Shelf. My \ngood friend and colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, and I have \ndebated our different views on this at length, and have agreed to work \ntogether on a plan to increase the flow of revenue to States that \ncurrently allow drilling off their coasts, without opening up new areas \nfor drilling. I can tell my colleagues that in Florida, this is a \nconsensus issue. Florida's pristine beaches\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\nand clean coastal environment are so important to our State's tourism-\nbased economy that there is no support--zero--for drilling in the \nwaters off Florida in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. For that reason, I am \ncompelled to ask the chairman and ranking member for their commitment \nthat they will oppose, and work to defeat, any amendments to this bill \nthat would change the status quo in the Eastern Planning Area. That \ncommitment would apply to amendments proposing any change in the areas \nnow under moratoria, any additional leasing activity in Lease Sale 181, \nbeyond what was agreed to in 2001, and includes opposing the drawing of \nlateral seaward boundaries into the Eastern Planning Area.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their leadership and for engaging us in this colloquy. For \nFloridians, there is simply no margin for error when it comes to \noffshore oil and gas drilling. Our $50 billion tourism industry is the \nlifeblood of our economy, and our tourism is based on people coming to \nenjoy the clean water, sugar-white sands, and excellent fishing that \ncan be found up and down our coasts. The risk of even one offshore \ndrilling accident to this economic engine is simply too great for us to \ntake.\n  I will seek to strike the section that permits an inventory of oil \nand gas reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf. We are very concerned \nin Florida that an inventory is simply the first step down a slippery \nslope toward expanded drilling. But I will also join my colleague in \nseeking the commitment of the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nto oppose any amendments that would change the status quo in the \nEastern Planning Area.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my position that it is unfair to \nprejudge any hypothetical amendment, ruling it in or out without \nknowing the substance of the provision. Furthermore, I do not want to \nbe in a position to preclude any of my colleagues from offering what \nthey think are improvements to this legislation.\n  That having been said, I assure my colleagues, Senator Nelson and \nSenator Martinez, that I will not support any amendment that alters \ncurrent OCS moratoria with respect to submerged lands off of Florida's \ncoast or that affects lands in Lease Sale 181, not so much because of \nthe substance of any amendment of the sort, but because it would bog \ndown this bill.\n  I want it to be clear that restricting development of our natural \nresources is not a policy view that I share, particularly in these \ntimes of severe shortages and high prices. I am on record supporting \nthe principle that individual States should have greater input in \npetitioning the Federal Government to allow oil and natural gas \nproduction on the OCS. I am also on record stating that I believe that \nthe time has come for the executive branch to draw boundaries and \npublish these boundaries as previously required under the Outer \nContinental Shelf Lands Act. I also believe that it is imperative that \nwe increase our production on the OCS in order to decrease our \ndependence on foreign sources of oil. Finally, I think that it is \nimportant that we work toward recognizing, in real financial terms, the \nsacrifice that certain coastal States make toward helping our Nation \nmeet its energy needs.\n  Having said all of this, I understand the importance of this issue to \nmy colleagues from Florida. Although we do not agree, I respect their \ndifference of opinion. I respect their passion on this issue and I make \nthis concession because I understand the necessity of moving forward \nwith this energy bill. This bill in its totality is more important than \nany one part. And, to that end, I extend this offer to my colleagues.\n  It should be noted, however, that this position does not apply in any \nway to any provision currently contained in this bill as reported out \nof the Energy Committee, including the comprehensive OCS inventory. \nWhile I will assist Members in working toward what I think are \nimprovements to the inventory section, I will strongly oppose any \nattempt to strike the section. Furthermore, I will oppose any amendment \nthat I think weakens any of the OCS provisions already contained in \nthis bill. I thank my colleagues for their attention to this issue and \nlook forward to working with them on this in the future.\n  As I said at the outset, I will not support any amendment that alters \ncurrent OCS moratoria with respect to submerged lands off of Florida's \ncoast or that affects lands in Lease Sale 181.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I join the chairman in his reluctance to \nprejudge amendments that we have not yet seen here in the Senate. We \nare trying very hard on this bill to consider and work out issues on \ntheir merits, which is how I think energy legislation should be \nconsidered in the Senate.\n  I can assure my colleagues, Senator Nelson and Senator Martinez, that \nin order to move forward expeditiously with this legislation, I will \nlikewise not support an amendment that alters current OCS moratoria \nwith respect to submerged lands off of Florida's coast or that affects \nlands in Lease Sale 181, and that I will work very closely with them on \nany amendment that they believe affects Florida's interests with \nrespect to the Outer Continental Shelf. Senator Nelson has been a \nstrong leader and advocate for preventing oil and gas development off \nof Florida's coasts. He is a passionate defender of the pristine \nbeaches, estuaries, and native mangrove ecosystems of Florida. I am \nkeenly aware that he and his colleague, Senator Martinez, have \nconsiderable rights under the Senate rules to impede the progress of \nthis bill if amendments threatening these important Florida resources \nwere in fact offered. But, I think it is unlikely that any Senator will \noffer an amendment to lift OCS moratoria off of Florida, or open areas \notherwise unavailable for leasing, during our consideration of this \nbill.\n  I have somewhat different policy views than those of Chairman \nDomenici with respect to the role of States and the OCS. I certainly \nagree with his desire to see additional environmentally responsible \nenergy development on the Outer Continental Shelf. Any policy \ndifferences regarding how that is to be accomplished are probably best \nleft to another occasion. I also have a very different policy view on \nLease Sale 181 from the Senators from Florida. I have supported \ndrilling in the Lease Sale 181 area in the past and am likely to do so \nin the future.\n  I do believe that oil and gas production on the OCS can and will play \nan important role in meeting our Nation's energy needs, and that we \nneed to craft appropriate national policies in that regard. For that \nreason, like the chairman, I support the inventory proposal contained \nin the bill now, and would support attempts to improve it. But I do not \nthink that such provisions necessarily would operate to the detriment \nof Floridians. I appreciate the diligence being shown by our colleagues \non these topics, given the importance that Floridians place on \nmaintaining a pristine coastal environment. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them on these issues as this bill progresses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6467-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

JAMES EXON, NEBRASKA GOVERNOR AND SENATOR\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I am here today to pay tribute \nto a great American and a great Nebraskan. J. James Exon served with \ndistinction in the United States Senate from 1979 to 1996 an as \nGovernor of Nebraska from 1970 to 1978. Senator Exon passed away in his \nhometown of Lincoln, NE last Friday at the age of 83. His funeral \nservices are tomorrow in Lincoln.\n  Jim Exon understood Nebraskans like no one else which explains his \npopularity with the people of his State. He loved them and they loved \nhim back.\n  He was a Democrat in a highly Republican State, yet he never lost an \nelection in 2 campaigns for Governor and 3 for United States Senate. He \nunderstood that Nebraska is a populist state more than it is a partisan \nstate. Most Nebraskans judged him on what he said and what he did, not \non his political registration.\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\n  Jim Exon was a common man. Nebraskans will remember Jim Exon as one \nof the greatest leaders Nebraska ever had. Anyone who travels around \nNebraska today can see the continuing legacy from his quarter century \nof public service.\n  Jim Exon built on the Nebraska tradition of working together. In that \nway he carried on the legacy of another giant in Nebraska history, \nSenator George Norris. Norris founded the unicamera legislature in an \neffort to improve the workings of government and to achieve results. \nJim Exon had the same philosophy.\n  I had the honor of serving in then-Governor Jim Exon's cabinet as \nNebraska Director of Insurance. He has been a friend and mentor ever \nsince even as I have followed him as Governor and U.S. Senator. I would \nfrequently call him to seek advice and he would often call to offer it. \nNow, those calls will cease but I don't think I'll ever stop learning \nfrom Jim Exon.\n  The people of Nebraska always appreciated Jim Exon in life as they do \nnow in death. We will miss him but we can all take comfort in the fact \nthat his fingerprints are on more than a quarter century of our history \nand Nebraska and the United States of America are far better places \nbecause of his generous service.\n  As a former poker partner of Jim Exon, I can say that the man was \ndriven to win. He was surprised by those who didn't try to beat him. \nThat attitude carried over into his public life and is ``part and \nparcel'' of the reason so many Nebraskans are fond of him. He made you \nfeel like he was on your side. He made you feel your issues were \nimportant. And most of all, he made you feel proud to be a Nebraskan.\n  Those in public life must face the last great scrutiny when they \nleave this world for the next. Their careers are examined again. Their \nfriends and foes get one last unanswered say. In the case of Big Jim \nExon, who liked to have the last word, I know this must be driving him \ncrazy.\n  In the case of Jim Exon the last word goes to Nebraska, the State and \nthe people he loved so dearly. The State of Nebraska will miss Jim \nExon, his wisdom, his humor and his common sense. He is one Nebraskan \nwho from start to finish, and through every day, truly did lead ``the \ngood life.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two editorials \nfrom Nebraska newspapers that captured the essence of Jim Exon so \neloquently, one from my hometown paper, the McCook Gazette and another \nfrom the Omaha World Herald.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the McCook Gazette, Jun. 13, 2005]\n\n                ``Common Man'' Exon in Touch With State\n\n       The former editor and publisher of the McCook Daily \n     Gazette, Allen Strunk, played a key role in the political \n     career of J.J. Exon, the former Nebraska governor and senator \n     who passed away Friday at age 83.\n       Strunk, a conservative Republican, broke with tradition in \n     1970 when he became the only daily newspaper publisher in the \n     state to endorse Exon in the race for governor against \n     Norbert Tiemann.\n       Contacted at his Las Vegas home this morning, Strunk said \n     he was moved to support Exon because he was a ``common Joe'' \n     who was in touch with the people. ``Exon had been a \n     businessman in Lincoln and the 1970 campaign was his first \n     run for office,'' Strunk said. ``He impressed me as being \n     much more in tune with the wishes of the people than did \n     Tiemann, who came across as pompous.''\n       The endorsement of Strunk was helpful in the hard-fought \n     race. Another factor was the negative feedback which Tiemann \n     received following passage of state sales and income tax \n     legislation.\n       Exon's victory in 1970 launched a political career that \n     continued through two terms as governor and three terms as a \n     United States Senator. Whenever he was in Southwest Nebraska, \n     Exon made it a point to stop by the Gazette office for visits \n     with Strunk.\n       Exon also was an important figure in the lives of two other \n     former McCook residents: the late Frank Morrison, a former \n     governor of Nebraska; and Ben Nelson, a former governor and \n     current U.S. Senator from Nebraska.\n       Nelson struck the same theme as Strunk, saying, ``Jim Exon \n     was a common man who dearly loved the state of Nebraska and \n     that's why the people loved him. He was one of them and they \n     knew it and were proud of it. His fingerprints are all over \n     the history of Nebraska and he'll go down as one of the \n     greatest leaders this state has ever known.''\n       During this lifetime, Morrison spoke highly of Exon, as did \n     Exon of Morrison. Exon was among the many mourners when \n     Morrison passed away in 2003 at age 98.\n       Other than George W. Norris of McCook, Exon was the only \n     Nebraskan to win five consecutive elections. The state will \n     miss him, as will the McCook area, which had a significant \n     role in Exon's long political career.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Omaha World Herald Jun. 12, 2005]\n\n                             J. James Exon\n\n       Perhaps someone else would have made Nebraska a two-party \n     state in the second half of the last century if John James \n     Exon hadn't appeared on the scene.\n       But it's hard to imagine anyone else doing the job nearly \n     as effectively, and with as much pure joy, as did the former \n     governor and U.S. senator, who died Friday at age 83.\n       Starting in the 1950s J. James Exon breathed life into the \n     moribund Democratic Party with the force of his personality, \n     the clarity of his vision and the relentlessness of his \n     energy.\n       He was a force in the candidacy of Govs. Ralph Brooks \n     (1959-60) and Frank Morrison (1961-67). He was guide and \n     mentor to Govs. Bob Kerrey (1983-87) and Ben Nelson (1991-\n     99). In his own right, Exon was the first Nebraska governor \n     to serve two four-year terms (1971-79) and followed that with \n     an 18-year career in the U.S. Senate.\n       Exon has earned lasting honor in the councils of his party. \n     He helped show Democrats how they could succeed in Nebraska: \n     be true to the better nature of their party while respecting \n     the political traditions and impulses of all Nebraskans. \n     Above all, be a straight shooter. Don't pussyfoot.\n       But he belongs to all Nebraskans. Exon's presence on the \n     political scene demonstrated the wisdom of evaluating a \n     candidate's knowledge, character and ideas ahead of narrow \n     partisanship. Competition between the parties makes for a \n     better examination of ideas and philosophies, but only if the \n     voters are willing to listen before deciding.\n       Exon simply would not be put down because the Republicans \n     had a big lead in voter registrations. He said what was on \n     his mind, and the electorate could not help but pay \n     attention.\n       And thus when the time came to ask Nebraskans for their \n     votes, Republicans stepped forward by the thousands to cast a \n     vote for Jim.\n       As governor, Exon embraced the mantra of holding the line \n     on spending. He was known for his strongly worded veto \n     messages. He fought his political battles with a gusto that \n     approached celebration.\n       However, though he was a conservative on spending, he was \n     no skinflint. His dislike of careless spending was balanced \n     by an abiding sense of stewardship over the institutions of \n     state government. He was a man of moderation.\n       In the Senate, Exon positioned himself as a proponent of a \n     strong national defense and as a knowledgeable source on \n     geopolitical matters. A veteran of World War II, he could \n     thus claim a legitimate share in the victory in the Cold War.\n       He followed his stars, loved the outdoors, maintained the \n     loyalty of strong men and never wavered in his commitment to \n     fairness and his concern for ordinary people.\n       Carved in the south facade of the Nebraska State Capitol, \n     facing the Governor's Mansion where the Exons resided for \n     eight years, are the words of Aristotle: ``Political society \n     exists for the sake of noble living.''\n       Surely Big Jim Exon used that thought, or something very \n     similar, as part of the code by which he lived his life.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I heard the remarks of the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska. I don't have time tonight to make my comments \nabout the distinguished Senator, Governor Exon, but tomorrow I will.\n  Suffice it to say, it was my privilege to serve with him. He was \neverything the Senator from Nebraska said and more.\n  Tomorrow I will elaborate on my years of service on various \ncommittees. He truly was a wonderful man, a hard worker, a man of great \ncommon sense, and he contributed immensely to the years I knew him in \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take a minute, also, and \nunderscore the comments our colleague from Nebraska and Senator \nDomenici have made about Jim Exon. He was a great U.S. Senator and one \nwith whom I was fortunate to serve on the Armed Services Committee for \nmany years. He contributed a tremendous amount to his home State and to \nthis country. He will be missed by all who served with him in the \nSenate.\n  There is a service for him tomorrow in Nebraska, which I hope to \nattend. I will also have extensive comments to offer at a future time. \nIt is a great loss to the country and a great loss, of course, to all \nthose who knew him. He will be fondly remembered in this Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6467-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6467-S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              J. JAMES EXON, NEBRASKA GOVERNOR AND SENATOR\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I am here today to pay tribute \nto a great American and a great Nebraskan. J. James Exon served with \ndistinction in the United States Senate from 1979 to 1996 an as \nGovernor of Nebraska from 1970 to 1978. Senator Exon passed away in his \nhometown of Lincoln, NE last Friday at the age of 83. His funeral \nservices are tomorrow in Lincoln.\n  Jim Exon understood Nebraskans like no one else which explains his \npopularity with the people of his State. He loved them and they loved \nhim back.\n  He was a Democrat in a highly Republican State, yet he never lost an \nelection in 2 campaigns for Governor and 3 for United States Senate. He \nunderstood that Nebraska is a populist state more than it is a partisan \nstate. Most Nebraskans judged him on what he said and what he did, not \non his political registration.\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\n  Jim Exon was a common man. Nebraskans will remember Jim Exon as one \nof the greatest leaders Nebraska ever had. Anyone who travels around \nNebraska today can see the continuing legacy from his quarter century \nof public service.\n  Jim Exon built on the Nebraska tradition of working together. In that \nway he carried on the legacy of another giant in Nebraska history, \nSenator George Norris. Norris founded the unicamera legislature in an \neffort to improve the workings of government and to achieve results. \nJim Exon had the same philosophy.\n  I had the honor of serving in then-Governor Jim Exon's cabinet as \nNebraska Director of Insurance. He has been a friend and mentor ever \nsince even as I have followed him as Governor and U.S. Senator. I would \nfrequently call him to seek advice and he would often call to offer it. \nNow, those calls will cease but I don't think I'll ever stop learning \nfrom Jim Exon.\n  The people of Nebraska always appreciated Jim Exon in life as they do \nnow in death. We will miss him but we can all take comfort in the fact \nthat his fingerprints are on more than a quarter century of our history \nand Nebraska and the United States of America are far better places \nbecause of his generous service.\n  As a former poker partner of Jim Exon, I can say that the man was \ndriven to win. He was surprised by those who didn't try to beat him. \nThat attitude carried over into his public life and is ``part and \nparcel'' of the reason so many Nebraskans are fond of him. He made you \nfeel like he was on your side. He made you feel your issues were \nimportant. And most of all, he made you feel proud to be a Nebraskan.\n  Those in public life must face the last great scrutiny when they \nleave this world for the next. Their careers are examined again. Their \nfriends and foes get one last unanswered say. In the case of Big Jim \nExon, who liked to have the last word, I know this must be driving him \ncrazy.\n  In the case of Jim Exon the last word goes to Nebraska, the State and \nthe people he loved so dearly. The State of Nebraska will miss Jim \nExon, his wisdom, his humor and his common sense. He is one Nebraskan \nwho from start to finish, and through every day, truly did lead ``the \ngood life.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two editorials \nfrom Nebraska newspapers that captured the essence of Jim Exon so \neloquently, one from my hometown paper, the McCook Gazette and another \nfrom the Omaha World Herald.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the McCook Gazette, Jun. 13, 2005]\n\n                ``Common Man'' Exon in Touch With State\n\n       The former editor and publisher of the McCook Daily \n     Gazette, Allen Strunk, played a key role in the political \n     career of J.J. Exon, the former Nebraska governor and senator \n     who passed away Friday at age 83.\n       Strunk, a conservative Republican, broke with tradition in \n     1970 when he became the only daily newspaper publisher in the \n     state to endorse Exon in the race for governor against \n     Norbert Tiemann.\n       Contacted at his Las Vegas home this morning, Strunk said \n     he was moved to support Exon because he was a ``common Joe'' \n     who was in touch with the people. ``Exon had been a \n     businessman in Lincoln and the 1970 campaign was his first \n     run for office,'' Strunk said. ``He impressed me as being \n     much more in tune with the wishes of the people than did \n     Tiemann, who came across as pompous.''\n       The endorsement of Strunk was helpful in the hard-fought \n     race. Another factor was the negative feedback which Tiemann \n     received following passage of state sales and income tax \n     legislation.\n       Exon's victory in 1970 launched a political career that \n     continued through two terms as governor and three terms as a \n     United States Senator. Whenever he was in Southwest Nebraska, \n     Exon made it a point to stop by the Gazette office for visits \n     with Strunk.\n       Exon also was an important figure in the lives of two other \n     former McCook residents: the late Frank Morrison, a former \n     governor of Nebraska; and Ben Nelson, a former governor and \n     current U.S. Senator from Nebraska.\n       Nelson struck the same theme as Strunk, saying, ``Jim Exon \n     was a common man who dearly loved the state of Nebraska and \n     that's why the people loved him. He was one of them and they \n     knew it and were proud of it. His fingerprints are all over \n     the history of Nebraska and he'll go down as one of the \n     greatest leaders this state has ever known.''\n       During this lifetime, Morrison spoke highly of Exon, as did \n     Exon of Morrison. Exon was among the many mourners when \n     Morrison passed away in 2003 at age 98.\n       Other than George W. Norris of McCook, Exon was the only \n     Nebraskan to win five consecutive elections. The state will \n     miss him, as will the McCook area, which had a significant \n     role in Exon's long political career.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Omaha World Herald Jun. 12, 2005]\n\n                             J. James Exon\n\n       Perhaps someone else would have made Nebraska a two-party \n     state in the second half of the last century if John James \n     Exon hadn't appeared on the scene.\n       But it's hard to imagine anyone else doing the job nearly \n     as effectively, and with as much pure joy, as did the former \n     governor and U.S. senator, who died Friday at age 83.\n       Starting in the 1950s J. James Exon breathed life into the \n     moribund Democratic Party with the force of his personality, \n     the clarity of his vision and the relentlessness of his \n     energy.\n       He was a force in the candidacy of Govs. Ralph Brooks \n     (1959-60) and Frank Morrison (1961-67). He was guide and \n     mentor to Govs. Bob Kerrey (1983-87) and Ben Nelson (1991-\n     99). In his own right, Exon was the first Nebraska governor \n     to serve two four-year terms (1971-79) and followed that with \n     an 18-year career in the U.S. Senate.\n       Exon has earned lasting honor in the councils of his party. \n     He helped show Democrats how they could succeed in Nebraska: \n     be true to the better nature of their party while respecting \n     the political traditions and impulses of all Nebraskans. \n     Above all, be a straight shooter. Don't pussyfoot.\n       But he belongs to all Nebraskans. Exon's presence on the \n     political scene demonstrated the wisdom of evaluating a \n     candidate's knowledge, character and ideas ahead of narrow \n     partisanship. Competition between the parties makes for a \n     better examination of ideas and philosophies, but only if the \n     voters are willing to listen before deciding.\n       Exon simply would not be put down because the Republicans \n     had a big lead in voter registrations. He said what was on \n     his mind, and the electorate could not help but pay \n     attention.\n       And thus when the time came to ask Nebraskans for their \n     votes, Republicans stepped forward by the thousands to cast a \n     vote for Jim.\n       As governor, Exon embraced the mantra of holding the line \n     on spending. He was known for his strongly worded veto \n     messages. He fought his political battles with a gusto that \n     approached celebration.\n       However, though he was a conservative on spending, he was \n     no skinflint. His dislike of careless spending was balanced \n     by an abiding sense of stewardship over the institutions of \n     state government. He was a man of moderation.\n       In the Senate, Exon positioned himself as a proponent of a \n     strong national defense and as a knowledgeable source on \n     geopolitical matters. A veteran of World War II, he could \n     thus claim a legitimate share in the victory in the Cold War.\n       He followed his stars, loved the outdoors, maintained the \n     loyalty of strong men and never wavered in his commitment to \n     fairness and his concern for ordinary people.\n       Carved in the south facade of the Nebraska State Capitol, \n     facing the Governor's Mansion where the Exons resided for \n     eight years, are the words of Aristotle: ``Political society \n     exists for the sake of noble living.''\n       Surely Big Jim Exon used that thought, or something very \n     similar, as part of the code by which he lived his life.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nUniversity of Kentucky's College of Pharmacy. Today at the Kennedy \nCenter the college is being awarded the American Pharmacists \nAssociation's 2005 Pinnacle Award to recognize the success of UK's \nDiabetes Education and Management program in helping Kentuckians with \ndiabetes.\n  Over the past 30 years, doctors have been able to treat more and more \nconditions with prescription medication. While this revolution in \npharmaceuticals is overwhelmingly positive, the incorrect use of \nmedication can result in harmful side effects, ineffective treatment, \nand unnecessary costs. This is of particular importance in Kentucky, \nwhere citizens use significantly more prescriptions than the national \naverage.\n  The UK College of Pharmacy has created a comprehensive Center for \nImproving Medication Related Outcomes to educate physicians, \npharmacists, and consumers about the appropriate use of medication. \nThis is something I believe in, and since 2002, I have been proud to \nsecure $3 million in Federal funding to help the center become a leader \nin promoting the safe use of prescription drugs throughout the \nCommonwealth and the Nation.\n  The Diabetes Education and Management Program is an important \ncomponent of the UK Center for Improving Medication Related Outcomes \nthat focuses on diabetes control. I am proud that the UK College of \nPharmacy and the Diabetes Education and Management Program have become \nvaluable resources for our Nation's healthcare system. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing the University of Kentucky College \nof Pharmacy for their exceptional work in the field of prescription \nmedication safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6469-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     APOLOGY TO VICTIMS OF LYNCHING\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, over 4,700 people, mostly African \nAmerican, were victims of lynching in the United States between 1882 \nand 1968. This represents one of the low points in our history as a \nNation--a time when our Nation turned away from its responsibility to \nour fellow citizens and failed to do the right thing. We condemn these \nterrible crimes and ask forgiveness for the failure of the Senate to \nact. We are reminded that our history is not perfect and that the \nSenate made a costly mistake, calculated not in dollar figures but in \nhuman lives. I am deeply saddened by the fact that during a time when \nour commitment to justice for all Americans was tested the U.S. Senate \nfailed to enact antilynching legislation to stop this brutal, tragic, \nand senseless violence. And so I join my colleagues in this apology.\n  It would be a mistake to see lynching as distant history for that is \nsimply not the case. Lynching occurred in the United States until 1968 \nand was committed in 46 States, including New Jersey. Lynching was used \nto kill, humiliate, and dehumanize African Americans and, to a lesser \nextent, other minorities. It was intended to teach minorities a \nlesson--that if they did not follow the established social code of \nconduct between the races and classes, they too might suffer this fate. \nIndeed, there are countless stories of African American teenage boys \nwho were allegedly lynched for talking back to a White man or looking \nat a White woman. Those acts were seen as transgressions in the eyes of \nlynch mobs who failed to understand one of the most central tenets of \nour great Nation--that we are all equal under the Constitution and laws \nof the United States of America.\n  In reality, it was not only the lynch mobs that failed to understand \nthat we are all equal. State and local governments also failed to \nuphold this democratic principle. Although State and local laws \nprohibited murder and other violent crime, State and local officials \nfailed to enforce these laws when they applied to lynching victims. And \nso lynching continued through the first half of the 20th Century as our \nsociety and government failed to hold the people who committed these \ncrimes accountable.\n  Mr. President, lynching also continued because many communities \nimplicitly sanctioned such events. We are not talking about secret \naffairs held under cover of darkness by men wearing hoods to hide their \nidentity. We are talking about public spectacles held in town squares \nduring broad day-light with no attempt by the participants to shield \ntheir identity. Indeed, there are countless stories of community \ncelebrations surrounding lynching: of businesses closed so locals could \nattend, of postcards sent out commemorating these horrific events, and \nof souvenirs such as pieces of hanging rope sold to onlookers.\n  American Presidents asked the Senate, on seven separate occasions, to \nenact antilynching legislation to stop the violence. From 1900 to 1950, \napproximately 200 antilynching bills were introduced in Congress. And \nbetween 1920 and 1940, the U.S. House of Representatives passed three \nsuch bills. But the Senate remained silent and it was that silence that \nprevented the enactment of a Federal antilynching law.\n  This resolution is an acknowledgement that the Senate, in failing to \npass a Federal antilynching law, ceased to protect many American \ncitizens. While Federal legislation may not be the ideal solution in \nall areas of criminal justice, it has been essential in the realm of \ncivil rights. When States have failed to enforce their own criminal \nlaws because of local pressure or bias, the Federal Government has \nfrequently established laws to vindicate the civil rights of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that it is not enough for us to \nstand here and apologize for things that happened in the past. We must \nuse this recognition of the Senate's past inaction to motivate us to \nenact laws today that protect the basic civil rights of all Americans, \nsuch as the Local Law Enforcement Act of 2005. This bill, which I am \nproud to cosponsor, will strengthen the ability of the Federal, State, \nand local governments to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on \nrace, ethnic background, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and \ndisability. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, a true test \nof the commitment of the Senate to do the right thing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6469-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHANGES TO H.

Mr. President, for the past several weeks, the Senate has \nbeen consumed with President Bush's judicial nominations. We have \ndebated the constitutionality of the nuclear option, and we have \ndebated the merits of the judicial nominees themselves. In the past 2 \nweeks, the Senate has confirmed 6 nominees bringing the total of \nconfirmed judges to 214 out of 218.\n  I voted for two of these nominees: Richard A. Griffin and David W. \nMcKeague, both of whom were nominated to the Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit. These two individuals were highly rated by the American \nBar Association, and, although I disagree with their politics, I \nbelieve they will be fair and impartial jurists.\n  I voted against the other four nominees, none of whom I believe \ndeserved lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. Each one has \ndemonstrated an unwillingness to follow the law when it\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nconflicts with his or her extreme conservative political ideology, and \neach one embraces a judicial philosophy which would severely curtail \nconstitutionally protected civil rights and civil liberties. Confirming \nthese nominees was a mistake, and their appointments diminish the \nstrength and integrity of the Federal judiciary.\n  Take, for example, Priscilla Owen. While on the Texas Supreme Court, \nPriscilla Owen repeatedly attempted to rewrite the law from the bench \nas her dissent in an abortion case concerning parental consent and \njudicial bypass clearly demonstrates. Justice Owen did not like the \nfact that the Texas law permitted abortions without parental consent in \ncertain circumstances. As it turns out, she was not the only one. The \nmajority did not like the law either, but, unlike Justice Owen, they \nhonored their sworn duty to uphold it. In their words, they:\n\n     recognize that judges' personal views may inspire \n     inflammatory and irresponsible rhetoric. Nevertheless, the \n     [abortion] issue's highly-charged nature does not excuse \n     judges who impose their own personal convictions into what \n     must be a strictly legal inquiry. We might personally prefer, \n     as citizens and parents, that a minor honor her parents' \n     right to be involved in such a profound decision. But the \n     Legislature has said that Doe may consent to an abortion \n     without notifying her parents if she demonstrates that she is \n     mature and sufficiently well informed. As judges, we cannot \n     ignore the statute or the record before us. Whatever our \n     personal feelings may be, we must respect the rule of law.\n\n  Then Justice--and now Attorney General--Alberto Gonzales was much \nmore direct in his criticism of Justice Owen's decision in this matter. \nHe chastised Owen for rewriting the Parental Notification Act in a way \nthat created nonstatutory hurdles to obtaining a judicial by-pass. He \ncalled it ``an unconscionable act of judicial activism'' and noted \nthat:\n\n     [a]s a judge, I hold the rights of parents to protect and \n     guide the education, safety, health, and development of their \n     children as one of the most important rights in our society. \n     But I cannot rewrite the statute to make parental rights \n     absolute, or virtually absolute, particularly when, as here, \n     the Legislature has elected not to do so.\n\n  Entrusting Priscilla Owen with a lifetime appointment to the Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit did not strengthen the Federal judiciary, \nMr. President, it weakened it.\n  Janice Rogers Brown has not only shown her willingness to re-write \nour Federal laws but has also indicated a desire to re-interpret the \nU.S. Constitution, even if doing so would reverse 70-year-old \nprecedent. Justice Brown has publicly supported a return to the era of \nLochner v. New York, one of the most discredited Supreme Court cases in \nhistory. Without going into the details, it is fair to say that even \nstaunch conservatives view Lochner as a clear case of the worst kind of \njudicial activism. Justice Scalia has criticized it, stating that \nLochner was discredited because it\n\n     sought to impose a particular economic philosophy on the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Justice Brown thinks Justice Scalia is wrong. She explained, I quote, \nthat it\n\n     dawned on me that the problem may not be judicial activism. \n     The problem may be the world view--amounting to altered \n     political and social consciousness--out of which judges now \n     fashion their judicial decisions.\n\n  Justice Brown brought that same kind of activism to bear on her lone \ndissent in the 2001 case of San Remo Hotel v. California, when she \ninterpreted the Constitution--in this case the Takings Clause--to \nadvance her personal economic theories.\n  Placing Janice Rogers Brown on the Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit did not strengthen our Federal judiciary, Mr. \nPresident, it irreversibly damaged it.\n  William H. Pryor Jr. has been a constant and outspoken advocate for \nscaling back constitutionally guaranteed rights. Pryor opposes abortion \neven in cases of rape or incest, and has called Roe v. Wade a creation\n\n     out of thin air of a constitutional right to murder an unborn \n     child.\n\n  As the attorney general of Alabama, Pryor filed an amicus brief with \nthe Supreme Court equating private consensual sex between same-sex \ncouples with activities like prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, \nbestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest and \npedophilia.\n  The Supreme Court rejected Pryor's arguments when it found the Texas \nlaw criminalizing private, consensual sexual intimacy between same-sex \nadults to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court also rejected Pryor's \nargument, filed in another amicus brief, that the eight amendment \npermits the execution of mentally retarded offenders.\n  William Pryor's consistent pursuit of extreme and incorrect legal \nviews should have been a red flag for my colleagues. It should have \ndemonstrated how dangerous placing him on the Federal bench with \nlifetime tenure would be. Unfortunately, Mr. President, it did not. As \na result, our Federal judiciary will have less ability to protect the \nconstitutional rights we hold so dear.\n\n  Thomas B. Griffith presents a similar threat to our constitutional \nrights, particularly to the rights of women. As a member of the \nPresident's Commission on Opportunity and Athletics, Mr. Griffith made \na radical proposal to eliminate the ``proportionality test'' in title \nIX cases. The proportionality test has long been used for determining \ncompliance with title IX and requires that the school in question \ndemonstrate that the athletic opportunities for males and females are \nin substantial proportion to each gender's representation in the \nstudent body of the school. As support for his proposal, Mr. Griffith \nstated that he was unilaterally opposed to the use of numeric formulas \nto evaluate title IX compliance. He added that, in his view, the \nproportionality test--and the use of numeric formulas--violates the \nequal protection clause, despite the fact that eight Circuit Courts of \nAppeals have rejected that very position.\n  Mr. Griffith's statement demonstrates a lack of respect for previous \ncourt rulings and raises questions about whether, as a judge, he would \nfollow established precedent. In fact, the ABA has rated him partially \nnot qualified. With legal views so clearly out of the mainstream, Mr. \nGriffith's confirmation seriously undermines the strength of the \nFederal judiciary. His confirmation is particularly problematic given \nthe fact that his voice will be added to that of Janice Rogers Brown, \nboth of whom have been confirmed to the D.C. Circuit.\n  Thus, after months of debate, we are left with a Federal judiciary \nless likely to protect individual rights and more likely to undermine \nthe legal principles which Americans hold so dear. And, because we have \nspent so much time debating these unqualified judges, we, as U.S. \nSenators, have not been able to address the very real problems facing \nthe American people. Problems like ensuring people have adequate health \ncare and top-notch educations. Problems like securing our energy \nindependence and providing for our Nation's military families.\n  Currently, 44 million Americans do not have health care, and as a \nresult, many middle-class Americans are one doctor's bill away from \nbankruptcy. This is particularly troublesome given that eleven million \nof those uninsured are children--sons and daughters of working parents.\n  Our education system is terribly underfunded. Teachers are being \nasked to provide more with less, and, as a result, students of every \nage from head start to higher education--are getting sub-par \neducations.\n  Our Nation is now more dependent on foreign oil than ever before. We \nrely heavily on Middle East countries that do not share our values--a \nreliance that makes us more vulnerable every day--yet still, Americans \nare suffering at the pump, paying $2.12 a gallon.\n  Our military families, the people who are the front line in the war \non terror and allow us to live life as we know, struggle unnecessarily \nto pay the bills and deal with lost benefits when loved ones are called \nto duty.\n  Our country has amassed record deficits, mounting debts that cede a \ndangerous amount of control over America's economic future to central \nbankers in Asia and oil cartels in the Middle East.\n  These are the issues that we should be debating. These are the \nproblems that plague Americans daily. The judicial confirmation process \nshould be quick and easy, allowing us the time we need to work on the \nreal problems facing this great Nation. All we need is for the \nPresident to take seriously the Senate's role of providing advice and \nconsent. We need the President to nominate more individuals like \nRichard A. Griffin and David W. McKeague,\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\nprincipled jurists who are committed to following the law and upholding \nour constitutional rights, and less individuals like Priscilla Owen, \nJanice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, and Thomas Griffith, conservative \nideologues who are not afraid to rewrite our laws to further their \npolitical agenda. I can only hope that he will do so in the future, \nsparing the Senate from endless hours of debate on unqualified, \ndangerous judges.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6471-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6471-S6473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AGAINST RACE-BASED GOVERNMENT IN HAWAII\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to ask unanimous consent that \nthe following analysis of the 1993 Hawaii apology resolution, prepared \nby constitutional scholar Bruce Fein, be entered into the Record \nfollowing my present remarks.\n  To be sure, I do not think that the nature of the events that led to \nthe end of the Kamehameha monarchy is relevant to the question whether \nwe should establish a race-based government in Hawaii today. I believe \nthat America is a good and great Nation, and that all Americans should \nbe proud to be a part of it. The United States does not deserve to have \nits government carved up along racial lines.\n  Nevertheless, proponents of racially separate government in Hawaii \nhave advanced their arguments for S. 147, the Native Hawaiian \nGovernment Reorganization Act, in terms of history. It is thus \ninstructive to take a close look at that history.\n\n           [The Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, Jun. 1, 2005]\n\nHawaii Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand--An Analysis of the Apology \n                               Resolution\n\n                            (By Bruce Fein)\n\n\n      THE 1993 APOLOGY RESOLUTION IS RIDDLED WITH FALSEHOODS AND \n                          MISCHARACTERIZATIONS\n\n       The Akaka Bill originated with the 1993 Apology Resolution \n     (S.J. Res. 19) which passed Congress in 1993. Virtually every \n     paragraph is false or misleading.\n       The opening paragraph declares its purpose as to \n     acknowledge the 100th anniversary of the January 17, 1893 \n     overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to offer an apology to \n     ``Native Hawaiians'' on behalf of the United States for the \n     event that ushered in a republican form of government and \n     popular sovereignty, in lieu of monarchy. The apology wrongly \n     insinuates that the overthrown 1893 government was for Native \n     Hawaiians alone; and, that they suffered unique injuries \n     because of the substitution of republicanism for monarchy. \n     There never had been a race-based government since the \n     formation of the kingdom of Hawaii in 1810, and only trivial \n     racial distinctions in the law (but for discrimination \n     against Japanese and Chinese immigrants). [Footnote: Minor \n     exceptions include jury trials, membership in the nobility, \n     and land distribution. In addition, the 1864 Constitution \n     mandated that if the monarch died or abdicated without naming \n     a successor, the legislature should elect a native Ali`i \n     (Chief) to the throne.] Native Hawaiians served side-by-side \n     with non-Native Hawaiians in the Cabinet and legislature. The \n     1893 overthrow did not disturb even a square inch of land \n     owned by Native Hawaiians. If the overthrow justified an \n     apology, it should have been equally to Native Hawaiians and \n     non-Native Hawaiians. Both were treated virtually the same \n     under the law by the ousted Queen Liliuokalani. Moreover, it \n     seems preposterous to apologize for deposing a monarch to \n     move towards a republican form of government based on the \n     consent of the governed.\n       Paragraph two notes that Native Hawaiians lived in a highly \n     organized, self sufficient, subsistent social system based on \n     communal land tenure with a sophisticated language and \n     culture when the first Europeans arrived in 1778. It errantly \n     insinuates that Native Hawaiians are not permitted under the \n     United States Constitution to practice their ancient culture. \n     They may do so every bit as much as the Amish or other \n     groups. They may own land collectively as joint tenants. The \n     paragraph also misleads by omitting the facts that Hawaiian \n     Kings, not Europeans, abolished communal land tenure and \n     religious taboos (kapu) by decree. [See Appendix page 3 \n     paragraphs 2, 3, 4]\n       Paragraph three notes that a unified monarchical government \n     of the Hawaiian Islands was established in 1810 under \n     Kamehameha I, the first King of Hawaii. It neglects to \n     mention that the King established the government by conquest \n     and force of arms in contrast to the bloodless overthrow of \n     Queen Liliuokalani. In other words, if King Kamehameha's \n     government was legitimate, then so was the successfu1l 1893 \n     overthrow. [See Appendix page 2 paragraph 1]\n       Paragraph four notes that from 1826 until 1893, the United \n     States recognized the Kingdom of Hawaii as an independent \n     nation with which it concluded a series of treaties and \n     conventions. But the paragraph neglects to note that the \n     United States extended recognition to the government that \n     replaced Queen Liliuokalani in 1893. It treated both \n     governments as equally legitimate under international law, as \n     did other relations.\n       Paragraph five notes the more than 100 missionaries sent by \n     the Congregational Church to the Kingdom of Hawaii between \n     1820 and 1850. But the missionaries did not cause mischief. \n     They brought education, medicine, and civilization to Native \n     Hawaiians for which no apology is due. [See Appendix page 2 \n     paragraphs 2, 3]\n       Paragraph six falsely accuses United States Minister John \n     L. Stevens as conspiring with non-Native Hawaiians to \n     overthrow the indigenous and lawful Government of Hawaii. The \n     Government, as previously explained, was not ``indigenous,'' \n     but included non-Native Hawaiians. The latter were treated \n     identically with Native Hawaiians and shared fully in the \n     society and governance of the kingdom. Moreover, Minister \n     Stevens, as a meticulous Senate Foreign Relations Committee \n     report (the ``Morgan'' report) established, remained \n     steadfastly neutral between the contesting political forces \n     in Hawaii in 1893. [See Appendix page 4 paragraph 1]\n       Paragraph seven falsely indicts Minister Stevens and naval \n     representatives of aiding and abetting the 1893 overthrow by \n     invading the Kingdom of Hawaii and positioning themselves \n     near the Hawaiian Government buildings and the Iolani Palace \n     to intimidate Queen Liliuokalani and her Government. The \n     ``Morgan'' report convincingly discredits that indictment. It \n     demonstrated that United States forces were deployed solely \n     to protect American citizens and property. [See Appendix page \n     4 paragraph 1]\n       Paragraph eight falsely insinuates that the overthrow of \n     the Queen was supported only by American and European sugar \n     planters, descendants of missionaries, and financiers. The \n     Queen was abandoned by the majority of Hawaiian residents, \n     including Native Hawaiians, because of her squalid plan to \n     alter the constitution by illegal means to make the \n     government more monarchical and less democratic. At best, the \n     Queen was able to rally but a feeble resistance to defend her \n     anti-constitutional plans. A Provisional Government was \n     readily established and maintained without the threat or use \n     of overwhelming force, in contrast to the force Kamehameha \n     brandished to establish the Kingdom of Hawaii. [See Appendix \n     page 1 paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n       Paragraph nine falsely asserts that the extension of \n     diplomatic recognition to the Provisional Government by \n     United States Minister Stevens without the consent of the \n     Native Hawaiian people or the lawful Government of Hawaii \n     violated treaties and international law. The international \n     community in general extended diplomatic recognition to the \n     Provisional Government. That was consistent with \n     international law, which acknowledges the right to overthrow \n     a tyrannical government. The Provisional Government received \n     the consent of Native Hawaiians every bit as much if not \n     more than did King Kamehameha I in establishing the \n     Kingdom of Hawaii by force in 1810. In addition, \n     international law does not require the consent of an \n     overthrown government before extending diplomatic \n     recognition to its successor. Thus, the Dutch recognized \n     the United States of America without the consent of Great \n     Britain whose colonial regime had been overthrown. \n     Similarly, the United States extended diplomatic \n     recognition to the new government regime in the \n     Philippines in 1986 headed by Cory Aquino without the \n     consent of Ferdinand Marcos. Finally, sovereignty in \n     Hawaii at the time of the 1893 overthrow resided in the \n     Monarch, not the people. Native Hawaiian and non-Native \n     Hawaiians alike possessed no legal right to withhold a \n     transfer of sovereignty from Queen Liliuokalani to the \n     Provisional Government. The Queen's own statement, \n     reprinted in the Apology Resolution, confirms that \n     sovereignty rested with the monarch, not the people. She \n     neither asked nor received popular consent for yielding \n     sovereignty to the United States. In any event, Native \n     Hawaiians enjoyed more popular sovereignty than did non-\n     Native Hawaiians. Accordingly, if the diplomatic \n     recognition was wrong, both groups were equally wronged.\n       Paragraph ten falsely suggests that Queen Liliuokalani \n     yielded her power to avoid bloodshed. She did so because her \n     anti-constitutional plans had provoked popular anger or \n     antagonism. The Queen forfeited the legitimacy necessary to \n     sustain power. Even Cabinet members she had appointed \n     abandoned her and advised surrender. [See Appendix page 1 \n     paragraph 5]\n       The Queen's statement itself is cynical and false in many \n     respects. She condemns the Provisional Government for acts \n     done against the Constitution, whereas she had provoked her \n     overthrow by embracing anti-constitutional plans for a more \n     monarchical and less democratic government. The Queen falsely \n     asserts that Minister Stevens had declared that United States \n     troops would support the Provisional Government. The Minister \n     insisted on strict United States military neutrality between \n     contending parties. And the Queen audaciously insists that \n     the United States should reinstall her to reign as an anti-\n     democratic Monarch in lieu of a step towards a republican \n     form of government, akin to Slobodan Milosevic's requesting \n     the United States to restore him to power in Serbia after his \n     replacement by a democratic dispensation. [See Appendix page \n     4 paragraph 2, 3]\n       Paragraph ten falsely insists that the overthrow of Queen \n     Liliuokalani would have\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\n     failed for lack of arms and popular support but for the \n     active support and intervention by the United States. The \n     United States provided no arms to the insurgents. The United \n     States did not encourage Hawaiians to join the insurrection. \n     The United States remained strictly neutral throughout the \n     time period and events that precipitated the end of Monarchy \n     and the beginning of a republic in Hawaii. [See Appendix page \n     4 paragraph 2]\n       Paragraph eleven falsely insinuates that Minister Stevens \n     proclaimed Hawaii to be a protectorate of the United States \n     on February 1, 1893 as a coercive action. Minister Stevens \n     had raised the American flag over government buildings at the \n     request of the Provisional Government to deter threats to \n     lives and property. The protectorate was requested, not \n     imposed. The Harrison administration revoked the protectorate \n     soon after, which refutes the Apology Resolution's assumption \n     that the United States government conspired to annex Hawaii.\n       Paragraph twelve neglects to underscore that Democrat \n     Congressman James Blount on behalf of Democrat President \n     Grover Cleveland conducted an investigation of events that \n     transpired under a Republican administration which both hoped \n     to discredit for partisan political purposes. Blount's \n     findings of abuse of diplomatic and military authority and \n     United States responsibility for the overthrow of the Queen \n     were meticulously discredited by the Morgan report the \n     following year. [See Appendix page 4 paragraph 3]\n       Paragraph thirteen fails to note that the actions against \n     the Minister and military commander were inspired by the \n     partisan politics of Democrats casting aspersion on the \n     predecessor Republican administration of Benjamin Harrison. \n     [See Appendix page 4 paragraph 1]\n       Paragraph fourteen misleads by omitting President Grover \n     Cleveland's partisan motivation for attacking the policies of \n     his predecessor, President Benjamin Harrison, and the Morgan \n     report that disproved President Cleveland's tenacious \n     chronicling and characterizations of Queen Liliuokalani's \n     overthrow. To trust in the impartiality of Democrat Cleveland \n     to evaluate the policies and actions of Republican Harrison \n     would be like trusting Democrat President William Jefferson \n     Clinton to evaluate evenhandedly the presidency of Republican \n     George H. W. Bush. [See Appendix page 4 paragraph 3]\n       Paragraph fifteen neglects that President Cleveland urged a \n     restoration of the Hawaiian monarchy for partisan political \n     reasons to discredit the Harrison administration and the \n     Republican Party. [See Appendix page 4 paragraph 3]\n       Paragraph sixteen notes that the Provisional Government \n     protested President Cleveland's celebration of the Hawaiian \n     monarchy and remained in power. Both actions were morally and \n     legally impeccable, and do not justify an apology.\n       Paragraph seventeen notes the hearings of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee into the 1893 overthrow; the \n     Provisional Government's defense of Minister Stevens; and its \n     recommendation of annexation. Neither the overthrow, nor \n     Minister Stevens' actions, nor the Provisional Government's \n     annexation recommendation was reproachable or justifies an \n     apology. [See Appendix page 4 paragraphs 2, 3]\n       Paragraph eighteen notes that a treaty of annexation failed \n     to command a two-thirds Senate majority, an event that does \n     not justify an apology from the United States. The paragraph \n     also falsely declares that the Provisional Government somehow \n     duped the Committee over the role of the United States in the \n     1893 overthrow, as though the Senators could not think and \n     evaluate for themselves. Finally, the paragraph wrongly \n     condemns the overthrow as ``illegal.'' It was no more illegal \n     in the eyes of domestic or international law than the \n     overthrow of the British government in America by the \n     United States in 1776. [See Appendix page 4 paragraphs \n     2,3]\n       Paragraph nineteen notes that the Provisional Government \n     proclaimed itself the Republic of Hawaii on July 4, 1894. The \n     proclamation was legally and otherwise correct. The \n     declaration did not justify an apology by the United States. \n     [See appendix page 4 paragraph 2,3]\n       Paragraph twenty declares that on January 24, 1895, the \n     Queen while imprisoned was forced by the Republic of Hawaii \n     to abdicate her throne. The forced abdication was thoroughly \n     defensible. The Queen had not accepted the new dispensation \n     after her overthrow. Thus, she was the equivalent of a Fifth \n     Columnist to the legitimate government of Hawaii until \n     abdication was forthcoming.\n       Paragraph twenty-one notes that in 1896, President William \n     McKinley replaced Grover Cleveland. That democratic event \n     provided no excuse for an apology.\n       Paragraph twenty-two notes that on July 7, 1898, in the \n     wake of the Spanish-American War, President McKinley signed \n     the Newlands Joint Resolution that provided for the \n     annexation of Hawaii. The annexation was perfectly legal and \n     enlightened. It was no justification for an apology.\n       Paragraph twenty-three notes that the Newlands Resolution \n     occasioned the cession of sovereignty over the Hawaiian \n     Islands to the United States. That is no cause for an \n     apology. The same occurred in 1845 when Texas was annexed to \n     the United States by joint resolution. The cession in both \n     cases was with the consent of the lawful governments of \n     Hawaii and Texas, respectively.\n       Paragraph twenty-four notes that the cession included a \n     transfer of crown, government, and public lands without the \n     consent of or compensation to the Native Hawaiian people of \n     Hawaii or their sovereign government. But there as no race-\n     based Native Hawaiian government, either then or previously. \n     The government was for Native Hawaiians and non-Native \n     Hawaiians alike. Further, the Newlands Resolution specified \n     that the revenues of the ceded lands generally ``shall be \n     used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the \n     Hawaiian Islands for educational and other public purposes.'' \n     Compensation was not paid because nothing was taken from the \n     inhabitants of Hawaii. Moreover, the United States assumed \n     over 3.8 million dollars of Hawaii's public debt, largely \n     incurred under the monarchy, after annexation. That debt \n     burden amounts to twice the market value of the land the \n     United States lawfully inherited [See Appendix page 3 \n     paragraph 4]\n       Paragraph twenty-five notes that Congress ratified the \n     annexation and cession of Hawaii, which required no apology.\n       Paragraph twenty-six notes that treaties between Hawaii and \n     foreign nations were replaced by treaties between the United \n     States and foreign nations, which is customary under \n     international law when one sovereign replaces another. For \n     example, Russia replaced the Soviet Union in its \n     international treaty obligations following the disintegration \n     of the USSR.\n       Paragraph twenty-seven notes that the Newlands Resolution \n     effected the transaction between the Republic of Hawaii and \n     the United States Government, an observation that required no \n     apology.\n       Paragraph twenty-eight misleads by declaring that Native \n     Hawaiians ``never directly relinquished their claims to their \n     inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands to \n     the United States, either through their monarchy or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum.'' But sovereignty in the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii resided in the monarch, not in the people. Further, \n     the Kingdom was a government for all the inhabitants of \n     Hawaii, not only for Native Hawaiians. Non-Native Hawaiians \n     enjoyed a much inherent sovereignty as Native Hawaiians, and \n     enjoyed an equal claim to national lands. Further, Native \n     Hawaiians overwhelmingly voted for statehood in 1959, which \n     constituted a virtual referendum on United States \n     sovereignty. Finally, neither domestic nor international law \n     recognizes a right to a plebiscite before a transfer of \n     sovereignty. In America, for example, sovereignty was \n     transferred from Great Britain to the United States without a \n     plebiscite or the consent of the British-controlled colonial \n     governments. The Akaka Bill's proponents themselves do not \n     advocate a plebiscite to grant sovereignty to the Native \n     Hawaiian people. [See Appendix page 3 paragraphs 2,3,4\n       Paragraph twenty-nine notes that on April 30, 1900, \n     President McKinley signed the Organic Act that provided a \n     government for the territory of Hawaii. The Act created a \n     representative system of government, a great credit to the \n     United States and far superior to what the residents of \n     Hawaii had previously enjoyed under the Monarchy. [See \n     Appendix page 5 paragraph 1]\n       Paragraph thirty notes that on August 21, 1959, Hawaii \n     became the 50th State of the United States. But it omits that \n     94 percent of voters in a plebiscite supported statehood, \n     including an overwhelming majority of Native Hawaiians. In \n     other words, in 1959 Native Hawaiians freely chose the \n     sovereignty of the United States. The elections could have \n     been boycotted if independence were desired. [See, appendix \n     page 5 paragraph 2]\n       Paragraph thirty-one declares that the health and well-\n     being of Native Hawaiians is intrinsically tied to their deep \n     feelings and attachment to land. But the same can be said of \n     every racial, ethnic, religious, or cultural group. Scarlet \n     O'Hara in Gone with the Wind was passionately tied to Tara. \n     Further, the observation does not deny that the United States \n     Constitution scrupulously protects the rights of Native \n     Hawaiians to honor their feelings and attachments to land \n     short of theft or trespass.\n       Paragraph thirty-two counterfactually declares that long-\n     range economic and social changes in Hawaii over the \n     nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have been \n     devastating to the population and to the health and well-\n     being of the Hawaiian people. The Native Hawaiian population \n     declined throughout the years of the Kingdom, but, since \n     annexation in 1898, the native population has achieved \n     steady growth. Senator Daniel Inouye himself celebrated \n     the health and prosperity of Hawaiians on the thirty-fifth \n     anniversary of statehood in 1994: ``Hawaii remains one of \n     the greatest examples of multiethnic society living in \n     relative peace.'' Indeed, no fair-minded observer would \n     maintain that Native Hawaiians would have been more \n     prosperous, free, and culturally advanced if foreigners \n     had never appeared in Hawaii and its people remained \n     isolated from the progress of knowledge. The Polynesian \n     nation of Tonga, which had a society and economy striking \n     similar to Hawaii's in the 1840s, chose to preserve its \n     Polynesian customs over progress. Today, Hawaii boasts a \n     per capita income twenty times that of Tonga. Moreover, \n     Native Hawaiians would probably have been swallowed up in \n     the wave of Japanese colonialism had they not become \n     citizens of the United States along with non-Native \n     Hawaiians after annexation. [See Appendix page 5 paragraph \n     2]\n       Paragraph thirty-three misleads by failing to underscore \n     that the United States Constitution fully protects the \n     determination of\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\n     Native Hawaiians to practice and to pass on to future \n     generations their cultural identity. The sole element of \n     cultural identity that the United States cannot and will not \n     tolerate is racial discrimination, whether practiced by \n     whites against blacks during Jim Crow or by Native Hawaiians \n     against non-Native Hawaiians today.\n       Paragraph thirty-four outlandishly asserts that the Apology \n     Resolution is necessary to promote ``racial harmony and \n     cultural understanding.'' Indeed, the Resolution has yielded \n     the opposite by giving birth to the race-based Akaka Bill. As \n     Senator Inouye acknowledged in 1994, Hawaii stands as a \n     shining example of racial harmony and the success of \n     America's legendary ``melting pot.'' [See Appendix page 5 \n     paragraph 2]\n       Paragraph thirty-five notes an apology by the President of \n     the United Church of Christ for the denomination's alleged \n     complicity in the illegal overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. \n     But not a crumb of evidence in the Blount report or the \n     Morgan report or Queen Liliuokalani's autobiography \n     substantiates the Church's complicity. Further, the overthrow \n     was as legal as was King Kamehameha's creation of the Kingdom \n     by conquest in 1810 or the overthrow of the British colonial \n     government in America by the United States. Finally, the \n     paragraph is silent on the substance of the ``process of \n     reconciliation'' between the Church and Native Hawaiians. \n     [See Appendix page 2 paragraphs 1, 2, 3]\n       Paragraph thirty-six repeats the false indictment of the \n     overthrow of the Kingdom as ``illegal.'' Congress absurdly \n     expresses its ``deep regret'' to the Native Hawaiian people \n     for bringing them unprecedented prosperity and freedom. As \n     noted above, even Senator Inouye in 1994 conceded the \n     spectacular Hawaiian success story after annexation and \n     statehood. And since the State of Hawaii and Native Hawaiians \n     have never been estranged--Native Hawaiians have invariably \n     enjoyed equal or preferential rights under law--the idea of a \n     need for reconciliation voiced in the paragraph is nonsense \n     on stilts. [See Appendix page 2 paragraph 1]\n       Section 1, paragraph (1) of the Apology Resolution falsely \n     characterizes the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii as \n     illegal, and falsely insinuates that sovereignty under the \n     Kingdom rested with the Native Hawaiian people to the \n     exclusion of non-Native Hawaiians. As elaborated above, \n     sovereignty rested with the Monarch; and, Native Hawaiians \n     and non-Native Hawaiians were equal in the eyes of the law \n     and popular sovereignty.\n       Section 1, paragraph (2) ridiculously commends \n     reconciliation where none is needed between the State of \n     Hawaii and the United Church of Christ and Native Hawaiians. \n     [See Appendix page 2 paragraphs 2, 3]\n       Section 1, paragraph (3) outlandishly apologizes to Native \n     Hawaiians for bringing them the fruits of democracy and free \n     enterprise. It also falsely suggests that Native Hawaiians to \n     the exclusion of non-Natives enjoyed a right to self-\n     determination when in fact all resident citizens of Hawaii \n     were equal under the law.\n       Section 1, paragraphs (4) and (5) preposterously assert a \n     need for reconciliation between the United States and the \n     Native Hawaiian people when there has never been an \n     estrangement. Indeed, a stunning majority of Native Hawaiians \n     voters supported statehood in 1959 in a plebiscite. [See \n     Appendix page 4 paragraph 3]\n\n\n                         Flag Burning Amendment\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, we celebrate Flag Day, honoring \nan enduring symbol of our democracy, of our shared values, of our \nallegiance to justice, and of those who have sacrificed to defend these \nprinciples.\n  On this day, I renew my support for S.J. Res. 12, a resolution that \nwould let the people decide whether they want a constitutional \namendment to protect the American flag.\n  Many moving images of the flag are etched into our Nation's \ncollective conscience. We are all familiar with the image of marines \nraising the flag on Iwo Jima, with the New York firefighters raising \nthe flag amid the debris of the World Trade Center and with the large \nflag that hung over the side of the Pentagon while part of it was \nrebuilt after 9/11.\n  It is more than a piece of material to so many of us. For our \nveterans, the flag represents what they fought for--democracy and \nfreedom. Today there are almost 300,000 troops serving overseas, \nputting their lives on the line every day fighting for the fundamental \nprinciples that our flag symbolizes.\n  Last December, I traveled to Iraq and met with some of the brave men \nand women in the Armed Forces who are stationed there. We flew out of \nBaghdad on a C-130 that we shared with a flag-draped coffin being \naccompanied by a military escort.\n  This was very moving. It showed clearly how significant the meaning \nof the flag is and why protecting it is so important.\n  In the 1989 case Texas v. Johnson, the Supreme Court struck down a \nState law prohibiting the desecration of American flags in a manner \nthat would be offensive to others. The Court held that the prohibition \namounted to an impermissible content-based regulation of the first \namendment right to free speech. Until this case, 48 of the 50 States \nhad statutes preventing burning or otherwise defacing our flag.\n  After the Johnson case was decided, Congress passed the Flag \nProtection Act of 1989, which sought to ban flag desecration in a \ncontent-neutral way that would withstand judicial scrutiny. \nNevertheless, the Supreme Court justices struck down that Federal \nstatute as well.\n  It is clear that without a constitutional amendment there is no \nFederal statute protecting the flag which will pass constitutional \nmuster.\n  S.J. Res. 12 would not ban flag burning. It would not ban flag \ndesecration. This amendment would do one thing only: give Congress the \nopportunity to construct, deliberately and carefully, precise statutory \nlanguage that clearly defines the contours of prohibitive conduct.\n  Some critics say that we are making a choice between trampling on the \nflag and trampling on the first amendment. I strongly disagree.\n  Protecting the flag will not prevent people from expressing their \npoints of view. I believe a constitutional amendment returning to our \nflag the protected status it has had through most of this Nation's \nhistory, and that it deserves, is consistent with free speech.\n  I do not take amending the Constitution lightly. It is serious \nbusiness and we need to tread carefully. But the Constitution is a \nliving text. In all, it has been amended 27 times.\n  Securing protection for this powerful symbol of America would be an \nimportant, but very limited, change to the Constitution. It is a change \nthat would leave both the flag and free speech safe.\n  Now it is time to give Americans the opportunity to amend the \nConstitution for something that we all agree is sacred to so many \npeople all across this country. It is time to let the people decide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6473-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6473-S6474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMBATING METHAMPHETAMINE EPIDEMIC\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is clear that legislation is needed to \ncombat the methamphetamine epidemic sweeping my State and much of the \ncountry. This drug is destroying the lives of the people abusing it, \ntheir families and their communities. For years, the problem has been \ntalked about, but not enough has been done.\n  To draw attention to Oregon's meth crisis, my colleague Senator Smith \nand I will be periodically coming to the Senate floor to talk about the \nmeth problem in our State.\n  Today, I would like to introduce a recent newspaper article from the \nOregonian. The June 1 article describes a police bust of ``a massive \nmethamphetamine lab capable of producing 400,000 doses of pure meth at \na time--enough to intoxicate the entire adult population of Portland.'' \nThe bust was one of the largest in Oregon history. This is the good \nnews. The bad news is that this lab had been in business for at least \nfive months--producing and distributing thousands of doses of meth.\n  Despite successes like this bust, the meth epidemic is getting worse, \nnot better. Congress cannot wait any longer to act--we have a duty to \naddress this crisis now. Enough is enough. It is critical that the \nCongress pass and the President sign the Combat Meth Act, on which \nSenator Smith and I are original cosponsors. We must also fully fund \nthe High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program and the Byrne Grant \nprogram. These initiatives provide much needed reforms and much needed \nfunds, which will help give communities in Oregon and across the Nation \nthe tools they need to fight this terrible problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Oregonian article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Oregonian, June 1, 2005]\n\n                       Police Bust Meth Superlab\n\n                             (By Steve Suo)\n\n       Oregon police and federal agents have dismantled a massive \n     methamphetamine lab capable of producing 400,000 doses of \n     pure meth at a time--enough to intoxicate the entire adult \n     population of Portland.\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\n       Officials said the ``superlab'' was discovered Thursday in \n     the Willamette Valley town of Brownsville. The lab was at a \n     mobile home on a rural, 10-acre property and was capable of \n     producing 90 pounds of pure methamphetamine in a 48- to 72-\n     hour period.\n       The lab had been in operation for at least five months, \n     according to indictments filed in federal court in Portland.\n       The find, which U.S. Attorney Karin J. Immergut described \n     as one of the largest labs in Oregon history, was extremely \n     unusual in a number of ways.\n       U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials say \n     superlabs operated by Mexican drug trafficking organizations \n     now produce about 65 percent of all meth sold in the United \n     States. But the number of superlabs seized in the United \n     States has been falling dramatically in recent years. There \n     were 53 seized last year, down from 244 in 2001, according to \n     the DEA. Agency officials say the reason is that Mexican \n     traffickers increasingly are moving their superlabs south of \n     the border.\n       In Oregon, only a handful of superlabs--defined as a lab \n     capable of producing at least 10 pounds a batch--are \n     uncovered each year, according to Sgt. Joel Lujan of the \n     Oregon State Police drug enforcement section.\n       ``Most of the labs that we're finding are going to be the \n     tweaker labs,'' Lujan said, referring to labs run by meth \n     users for their own consumption. Those labs typically produce \n     less than an ounce of meth at a time.\n       A single dose of meth is one-tenth of a gram. Ninety pounds \n     of pure meth would make 400,000 doses; if cut to street \n     purity of 50 percent, it would make 800,000 doses.\n       Drug agents arrested 15 people in connection with the \n     Brownsville case, according to Immergut's office. Most were \n     Mexican citizens living in Salem.\n       Details of how the investigation unfolded remained sketchy \n     Tuesday. Salem Police Sgt. Pat Garrett, a member of the U.S. \n     Drug Enforcement Administration task force involved in the \n     case, said agents were investigating some of the suspects for \n     several months. Surveillance led agents to the mobile home in \n     Brownsville.\n       ``We had people we believed to be involved in the \n     production of methamphetamine who led us to the lab site,'' \n     Garrett said.\n       Stains on the walls of the mobile home suggested the lab \n     operators were making meth inside, but much of the lab's \n     equipment and chemicals were in storage outside the home.\n       In addition to three pounds of finished meth and $195,000 \n     in cash, agents found 150 pounds of iodine and 20 to 30 \n     pounds of red phosphorous. Those chemicals make it possible \n     to convert pseudoephedrine, a common cold remedy ingredient, \n     to methamphetamine.\n       Garrett said the lab operators had finished their latest \n     batch Wednesday.\n       ``There was no more pseudoephedrine left,'' Garrett said. \n     ``They had done their cook and finished the product and were \n     waiting to do the next cook.''\n       Five 22-liter flasks, used to create the pseudoephedrine \n     reaction, were found in a nearby rental truck, where they had \n     apparently been stored.\n       Experts said each 22-liter flask can produce, at most, 15 \n     pounds of meth at a time, for a total of 75 pounds. But \n     Garrett said the lab operators had enough chemicals to make \n     90 pounds of meth if they ran the flasks simultaneously and \n     replenished some as the reaction unfolded.\n       Five of the 15 people arrested were charged with conspiracy \n     to manufacture meth. Sonia Violet Garcia, 20, of Brownsville, \n     was arraigned Friday.\n       Four others, all Salem residents, are scheduled to make \n     initial court appearances today: Arturo Arevalo-Cuevas, 22; \n     Miguel Silva Chava, 26; Venancio Villalobos-Soto, 40; and \n     Adriana Arevalo-Cuevas, 29.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6474-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL HISTORY DAY\n\n  Mr. SARBANES.

With an eye toward \nincreasing informed participation, National History Day--which as a \nnational program celebrates its 25th anniversary this year--promotes \nhistory-related education in Maryland and throughout the Nation. Each \nyear, the program allows students to use critical thinking and research \nskills and to create exhibits, documentaries and performances related \nto a particular historical subject. This year, 29 students were chosen \nfrom a pool of half a million to display their projects at various \nsites throughout the Nation's Capital.\n  Ryan Moore, a student at Mill Creek Middle School in Hughesville, \nMaryland, used his skills and critical thinking to create a project \nentitled ``Television: A Key Player in Communicating the Candidate's \nMessage.'' He will display and present his project at the White House \nVisitor Center.\n  Lauren White, a student at Plum Point Middle School in Huntington, \nMD, similarly stood out from the crowd in creating a project entitled \n``More Powerful than Words: The Photo Stories of Lewis Wickes Hine.'' \nShe will display and present her project at the Smithsonian American \nArt Museum.\n  I congratulate both Lauren and Ryan as they are honored for their \npresentations, and commend them for their dedication, commitment, and \ncreativity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6474-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6474-S6475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONFIRMATION OF THOMAS B. GRIFFITH\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, next week we will celebrate the 33rd \nanniversary of title IX. For 33 years, title IX has opened doors for \nwomen and girls in all aspects of education. I can say without \nreservation that I would not be a U.S. Senator today without this \ncritical law.\n  Unfortunately, today the Senate confirmed a vehement opponent of \ntitle IX--Thomas Griffith--to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit. I voted against this nominee because of \nhis record on title IX, the importance of the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals to title IX and other civil rights laws, and his disregard for \nthe rule of law in his own practice.\n  In 2002, Mr. Griffith served on the Commission on Opportunity in \nAthletics to evaluate whether and how current standards governing title \nIX's application to athletics should be revised. After the Department \nof Education spent nearly $1 million on the Commission, the Bush \nadministration made the determination to make no changes to title IX in \nathletics. However, as a member of the Commission, Mr. Griffith made \nclear his opposition and hostility towards the law and its enforcement.\n  As a member of the Commission, Mr. Griffith proposed weakening the \nstandard for meeting title IX's 25-year-old requirement of equality of \nopportunity in athletics for young women through the elimination of the \n``substantial proportionality'' test for compliance. This test, one of \nthe three alternative ways to comply with title IX, allows schools to \ncomply by offering athletic opportunities to male and female students \nthat are in proportion to each gender's representation in the student \nbody of the school.\n  Mr. Griffith claimed this provision constitutes a quota in violation \nof title IX and the Constitution and asserted that ``[i]t is illegal, \nit is unfair, and it is wrong'' and even ``morally wrong.'' He made \nsuch extreme statements despite the decisions of no fewer than 6 \nFederal appeals courts which have upheld the legality of the test. In \nfact, none has ruled to the contrary. And when this fact was pointed \nout to him, he did not respect the decisions of all the Federal courts \nthat have heard such cases--he said that ``the courts got it wrong.'' \nEliminating this test would clearly undercut title IX's effectiveness--\nand the Commission agreed. It rejected the Griffith proposal by a \nlopsided vote of 11 to 4.\n  During his confirmation process, Griffith tried to change his \nposition on title IX. Mr. Griffith now claims that he only wanted to \neliminate the proportionality test because some have ``misused'' or \n``misinterpreted'' the test. He now claims that the Commission \nrecommendations regarding the proportionality test that he supported--\nin addition to his own proposal to eliminate the test--were ``modest'' \nor ``moderate.'' If these claims were so moderate, why were they \nrejected entirely by the Secretary of Education?\n  Mr. President, every Federal court of appeals that has considered \nthis issue and every administration since 1979 have ruled that the \nthree-part test is legally valid and does not impose quotas. Mr. \nGriffith's statements and actions put him in complete opposition to six \nFederal appeals courts. If that doesn't show that Mr. Griffith is out \nof the mainstream, I don't know what does.\n  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals is an especially important court. I \nbelieve that we must be careful when confirming individuals to serve \nlifetime appointments on this court, the second most powerful Federal \ncourt in the land. This court has exclusive jurisdiction over a broad \narray of Federal regulations, including title IX, and is\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\noften the court of last resort in critical issues involving workers' \nrights, civil liberties, and environmental regulations. I am concerned \nthat, given his prior record relating to title IX, Mr. Griffith may not \nbe able to hear such cases with the impartiality required of a judge on \none of our Nation's highest courts.\n  Mr. Griffith's hostility to title IX and the importance of the DC \nCircuit are not the only problems with this nominee. He has, on more \nthan one occasion, failed to comply with the basic standards and \npractices of his profession by not paying bar dues and failing to get a \nlicense. He does not meet the high standards we must apply to any \nnominee for a lifetime appointment to the second highest court in the \nland.\n  The Senate has the constitutional duty to advise the President and \ndecide whether to consent to his nominations to the Federal bench. I \nbelieve that this role is one of the Senate's greatest \nresponsibilities. It is critical that Senators work with the President \nto find judicial nominees that meet the standards of fairness, even-\nhandedness and adherence to the law that we expect of judges in our \ncommunities.\n  I believe the Senate has the duty to ensure each nominee has \nsufficient experience to sit in judgment of our fellow citizens, will \nbe fair to all those who come before the court, will be even-handed in \nadministering justice, and will protect the rights and liberties of all \nAmericans. Unfortunately, Mr. Griffith's record shows his inability to \nserve in such a manner and, therefore, I opposed his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6475-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is with a sense of sorrow that I rise \ntoday to speak about the practice of abusive and exploitative child \nlabor, as well as to recognize the International Labor Organization's \nWorld Day against Child Labor, which occurred on June 12. \nUnfortunately, hundreds of millions of children are still forced to \nwork illegally for little or no pay. The ILO has set aside this day to \ngive a voice to these helpless children who toil away in hazardous \nconditions.\n  We should not only think about these children on June 12. We should \nthink about this last vestige of slavery every day. I have remained \nsteadfast in my commitment to eliminate abusive and exploitative child \nlabor. It was in 1992 that I first introduced a bill to ban all \nproducts made by abusive and exploitative child labor from entering the \nUnited States.\n  Since I introduced that bill, we have made some progress in raising \nawareness about this scourge. In June of 1999, ILO Convention 182, \nconcerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of \nthe Worst Forms of Child Labor, was adopted unanimously in the ILO and \nhere in the U.S. Senate. This was the first time ever that an ILO \nconvention was approved without one dissenting vote. In record time the \nSenate ratified ILO Convention 182 with a bipartisan, 96-0 vote.\n  For the first time in history the world spoke with one voice in \nopposition to abusive and exploitative child labor. Countries from \nacross the political, economic, and religious spectrum--from Jewish to \nMuslim, from Buddhists to Christians--came together to proclaim \nunequivocally that abusive and exploitative child labor is a practice \nwhich will not be tolerated and must be abolished.\n  Gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is an \nacceptable practice because of a country's economic circumstances. Gone \nis the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is acceptable \nbecause of cultural tradition. And gone is the argument that abusive \nchild labor is a necessary evil on the road to economic development. \nWhen this convention was approved, the United States and the \ninternational community as a whole laid those arguments to rest and \nlaid the groundwork to begin the process of ending the scourge of \nabusive and exploitative child labor.\n  In 2001, Congressman Engel and I, along with the international \nchocolate industry, negotiated the Harkin-Engel Protocol. This \nagreement was precipitated by news reports that same year on the abuse \nof children on cocoa farms. We knew that if consumers learned about the \nbrutal realities of cocoa production, their taste of chocolate would \nsour. Sales--and delicate African economies--would plummet. But that \nwas not our goal. We wanted to stop child slavery, not chocolate \nproduction.\n  We viewed a legislative remedy not as a first resort but as a last \nresort. So, in good faith, we engaged the major chocolate companies in \nlengthy, intense negotiations. The result was the Harkin-Engel \nProtocol. The companies agreed to join with other stakeholders to \nproduce an agreement for eliminating the worst forms of child and slave \nlabor throughout the chain of chocolate production, and to do so \nexpeditiously. They also agreed to implement an industrywide voluntary \ncertification system to give a public accounting of labor practices in \ncocoa-growing countries. This would enable consumers to make better-\ninformed choices.\n  There are an estimated 1.5 million small cocoa farms spread across \nfour desperately poor countries in Africa. The Protocol established a \npublic-private partnership enlisting government, industry, labor \nunions, nongovernmental organizations and consumer groups. The U.S. \nGovernment's role is to ensure that whatever certification plan emerges \nfrom this process is credible and effective in eliminating abusive \nchild and slave-labor practices in the cocoa industry and ensuring the \nrehabilitation of the victims.\n  Unfortunately, the chocolate industry has been slow to meet all of \nthe terms of the Protocol. July 1, 2005, is the deadline for full \nimplementation of the certification system. That is just 3 short weeks \naway. While I remain hopeful that industry will continue to engage in \nthe elimination of child labor beyond July 1, it is clear that the \nexact terms of the Protocol will not be met by July. No public \ncertificate has yet been issued. And only small regions of Ghana and \nCote d'Ivore have been monitored for child labor. Nevertheless, we are \ncontinuing discussions with the chocolate industry and continue to \nbelieve that the Harkin-Engel Protocol remains a possible framework for \nengagement to fix the enormous problem of abusive and exploitative \nchild and slave labor in the cocoa-growing countries of West Africa.\n  Forced child labor remains a significant problem. According to the \nILO, there are some 246 million child laborers in the world; 73 million \nof these are under the age of 10, and approximately 22,000 children die \nin work related accidents every year. Abusive and exploitative child \nlabor is prevalent in many parts of the world, including here in \nAmerica.\n  Abusive child labor should be a thing of the past.

Their deaths came as a result \nof the crash of a B-17C Flying Fortress, which proved to be the worst \naviation disaster of the Southwest Pacific theatre during World War II. \nMore soldiers died on that plane from my home State of Pennsylvania--\nsix--than from any other State. These six men were: Pvt. James E. \nFinney; T/Sgt. Alfred H. Frezza; Sgt. Donald B. Kyper; Pfc. Frank S. \nPenksa; Sgt. Anthony Rudnick; and Cpl. Raymond H. Smith.\n  Only recently has the Air Force shared the details of this incident. \nAs a result, most of the victims' families were left in the dark about \nthe specifics surrounding their loved ones' deaths in World War II. For \nover a decade, the members of the Bakers Creek Memorial Association, \nbased in Orrtanna, PA, led by George Washington University professor \nRobert S. Cutler, have worked to locate the victims' families and to \nnotify them of the circumstances of the tragic mishap. Because of the \ndedication of this small group of military veterans, the families of 36 \nof the 40 casualties now\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\nhave been contacted, including those of: Private Finney, Technical \nSergeant Frezza, Sergeant Kyper, and Private First Class Penksa. The \nBakers Creek Memorial Association continues to search for family \nrelatives of the remaining 4 victims.\n  The aircraft that crashed at Bakers Creek had been operated by the \nU.S. Army Air Force's 46th Transport Carrier Squadron, of the Fifth Air \nForce. The plane was one of several B-17 bomber aircraft that had been \nremoved from combat status and converted to transport service. Shortly \nafter take-off from Mackay airport, the B-17C lost altitude, fell to \nearth in a slow and steady bank, and crashed in a ball of flames, 5 \nmiles south at Bakers Creek. The 40 lost onboard included 6 crew \nmembers and 34 soldiers returning to their New Guinea battlefield posts \nafter being on R leave in Australia. The crash left one survivor, \nFoye K. Roberts, an Army corporal at the time of the accident. Mr. \nRoberts recently passed away on February 4, 2004, at the age of 83.\n  I understand that retired Major General Robert H. Appleby, former \ncommander of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, who lost an uncle in \nthe crash, and other members of the Bakers Creek Memorial Association, \nplan to place a wreath on June 14 at the National World War II Memorial \nin Washington, DC, to commemorate the 62nd Anniversary of the crash.\n  I applaud the members of the Bakers Creek Memorial Association and \nthank them for their efforts to help bring closure to the casualty \nfamilies and public remembrance of the forty forgotten American \nsoldiers of World War II in the Southwest Pacific, who perished at \nBakers Creek in Australia on June 14, 1943.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6476-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING HUGH O'BRIAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

TIEDE\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, for the past 64 years, Minnesota \nhas had the good fortune to be blessed with Dr. David L. Tiede.\n  When I was first elected Mayor of St. Paul, the first thing I did was \ntravel around and meet the men and women who made the city tick. I \nencountered ordinary men and women, working moms and dads, who had \ntipped the scales to make a real difference. It was the first time I \ntruly realized the ability of a single person to change the world \naround him for the better. David L. Tiede is such a person. He is a \nleader and a visionary, and thanks to his presence, Minnesota will \nnever be the same.\n  Recently, David announced that he is retiring from Luther Seminary. \nTimes like this are bittersweet. It is bitter because we are bidding \nfarewell to somebody who has meant so much to us. It is sweet because \nwe have an opportunity to pay tribute to someone who has given us so \nmuch and deserves acclaim.\n  A native Minnesotan, David earned his bachelor's degree at \nNorthfield's own St. Olaf College, only a few miles away from his home \nin Le Center. After earning his Master of Divinity degree from Luther \nSeminary in St. Paul, David left Minnesota to complete his graduate \nstudy and eventually earn his PhD.\n  After earning his doctorate from Harvard in 1971, Massachusetts' loss \nwas Minnesota's gain as he returned to serve as the associate pastor of \nTrinity Lutheran Church in Minneapolis. At Trinity, David was not only \na pastor, but also a teacher. Each Sunday he would teach Christ's \nlessons to his parish enabling them to realize God's calling and \ncommission.\n  This is David's genius. Too often we are told that there is no right \nand wrong, that everything is subjective. The truth is that there is a \nright and a wrong, and there is something called the good life, which \nis not an easy life. It can be hard to do the right thing and can be \neven harder to lead others to do the right thing. However, that is \nexactly what David did.\n  David continued his commitment of teaching God's lessons when he \njoined Luther Seminary to teach the New Testament. Working first as a \nmember of the faculty and then as president, David brought his \nexpertise of teaching and leadership to Luther Seminary, giving the \nschool a strong mission focus in the preparation of pastors and other \nprofessional leaders for the Lutheran church. David taught his students \nthat a pastor without a mission is just a guy talking. In other words, \nDavid realized that the old saying that a leader without followers is \njust a guy taking a walk is as true in a church as it is in life.\n  I remember shortly after being elected mayor of St. Paul being \ninvited by Dr. Tiede to be a part of a program launching Luther \nSeminary's new Islamic Studies program. It was worth noting that this \nwas probably the first time that a Jewish mayor of a Roman Catholic \ncity was speaking at a Lutheran seminary to inaugurate an Islamic \nstudies program.\n  David's leadership is recognized throughout the theological world. In \n2002, he became only the second Lutheran to be elected president of the \nAssociation of Theological Schools, an organization of accredited \ntheological schools in the United States and Canada. In addition, he \nserves on the board of IN TRUST, Inc., which provides resources for \ngoverning boards of theological institutions and has received the \nOutstanding Executive Award from the Association of Lutheran \nDevelopment Executives. This spring, Trinity Lutheran Seminary in Ohio \nawarded him the Joseph A. Sittler Award for Theological Leadership. \nMost recently, Augsburg College in Minneapolis named Dr. Tiede to the \nnewly established Bernhard M. Christianson Chair of Religion, the \ncollege's first endowed chair. In this capacity, Dr. Tiede will be able \nto teach, write and continue his study of the New Testament even as he \ncontinues to work to strengthen the institutions of the Lutheran \nchurch.\n  David Tiede's retirement will be a great loss to Luther Seminary and \nMinnesota. Certainly he has been one of the finest, most skilled \nreligious leaders in our state. David will be missed, but will never be \nforgotten as his teachings and philosophy have been passed on through \nthe Luther Seminary to a new generation of religious leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6476-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6476-S6477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JIM BRENT\n\n   Mr. CONRAD.

On June 23, \n2005, various veterans organizations and friends of Jim will host an \nappreciation dinner and program at the Fargo Teamsters Hall. This \nupcoming event is a real testament to how much Jim has contributed to \nthe veterans community and the Fargo community as a whole.\n  Jim Brent began his service to our great Nation in the United States\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\nArmy in 1967. He served as a Combat Infantry Soldier in Vietnam and as \na Training Instructor at various worldwide locations between 1967 and \n1977. He continued his honorable service to the Army in various \ncapacities until his retirement from active duty in 1987.\n  Following his retirement from active duty Jim worked for Northwestern \nMutual Life and Metropolitan Life Insurance in Bismarck, ND, and then \nserved as the Commander and Club Manager of the American Legion Lloyd \nSpetz Post No. 1 until 1996.\n  In 1996, Jim took on a new opportunity to serve our Nation and his \nfellow veterans by accepting his current position as the Cass County \nVeterans Service Officer. In his role as Cass County's Service Officer, \nJim has gained a reputation for tenacious advocacy on behalf of \nveterans. He is known for his abilities to work closely with veterans \nto determine any possible sources of assistance they may have earned \nfrom their honorable service in the Armed Forces. Jim and I have worked \ntogether to assist a number of veterans over the years, and I can \npersonally attest to his strong advocacy on behalf of those veterans \nthat need a helping hand. The veterans of my state have a true friend \nin Jim.\n  Jim Brent has spent the majority of his life serving others, \nincluding his country, family, friends, and most of all, veterans. He \ngoes above and beyond the call of duty. Jim is a great person, \nwonderful friend, a true patriot. I am honored to know him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6477-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING JUDGE ANNE E.

LA FOLLETTE, SR.\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I say a few words to honor the \nextraordinary life of Robert M. La Follette Sr., on the 150th \nanniversary of his birth. Throughout his life, La Follette was revered \nfor his tireless and deeply principled service to the people of \nWisconsin and to the people of the United States. His dogged, full-\nsteam-ahead dedication to his life's work earned him the nickname \n``Fighting Bob.''\n  Robert Marion La Follette, Sr., was born on June 14, 1855, in \nPrimrose, a small town southwest of Madison in Dane County. He \ngraduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1879 and, \nafter being admitted to the state bar, began his long career in public \nservice as Dane County district attorney.\n  La Follette was elected to the United States House of Representatives \nin 1884, and he served three terms as a member of that body, where he \nwas a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  After losing his campaign for reelection in 1890, La Follette \nreturned to Wisconsin and continued to serve the people of my state as \na judge. Upon his exit from Washington D.C., a reporter wrote, La \nFollette ``is popular at home, popular with his colleagues, and popular \nin the House. He is so good a fellow that even his enemies like him.''\n  He was elected the 20th Governor of Wisconsin in 1900. He served in \nthat office until 1906, when he stepped down in order to serve the \npeople of Wisconsin in the United States Senate, where he remained \nuntil his death in 1925.\n  As a founder of the national progressive movement, La Follette \nchampioned political reform, civil rights and workers' and women's \nrights throughout his career. As governor, he advanced an agenda that \nincluded the country's first workers compensation system, direct \nelection of United States Senators, and railroad rate and tax reforms. \nCollectively, these reforms would become known as the ``Wisconsin \nIdea.''\n  His terms in the House of Representatives and the Senate were spent \nfighting for women's rights, working to limit the power of monopolies, \nopposing pork barrel legislation, and rooting out political corruption. \nLa Follette also championed electoral reforms, and he brought his \nsupport of the direct election of United States Senators to this body. \nHis efforts were brought to fruition with the ratification of the 17th \namendment in 1913. Fighting Bob also worked tirelessly to hold the \ngovernment accountable, and was a key figure in exposing the Teapot \nDome Scandal.\n  La Follette earned the respect of such notable Americans as Frederick \nDouglass, Booker T. Washington and Harriet Tubman Upton for making \ncivil rights one of his trademark issues. At a speech before the 1886 \ngraduating class of Howard University, La Follette said, ``We are one \npeople, one by truth, one almost by blood. Our lives run side by side, \nour ashes rest in the same soil. [Seize] the waiting world of \nopportunity. Separatism is snobbish stupidity, it is supreme folly, to \ntalk of non-contact, or exclusion!''\n  La Follette ran for President three times, twice as a Republican and \nonce on the Progressive ticket. In 1924, as the Progressive candidate \nfor president, La Follette garnered more than 17 percent of the popular \nvote and carried the state of Wisconsin.\n  La Follette's years of public service were not without controversy. \nIn 1917, he filibustered a bill to allow the arming of United States \nmerchant ships in response to a series of German submarine attacks. His \nfilibuster was successful in blocking passage of this bill in the \nclosing hours of the 64th Congress. Soon after, La Follette was one of \nonly six Senators who voted against U.S. entry into World War I.\n  Fighting Bob was outspoken in his belief that the right to free \nspeech did not end when war began. In the fall of 1917, La Follette \ngave a speech about the war in Minnesota, and he was misquoted in press \nreports as saying that he supported the sinking of the Lusitania. The \nWisconsin State Legislature condemned his supposed statement as \ntreason, and some of La Follette's Senate colleagues introduced a \nresolution to expel him. In response to this action, he delivered his \nseminal floor address, ``Free Speech in Wartime,'' on October 16, 1917. \nIf you listen closely, you can almost hear his strong voice echoing \nthrough this Chamber as he said:\n\n       Mr. President, our government, above all others, is founded \n     on the right of the people freely to discuss all matters \n     pertaining to their government, in war not less than in \n     peace, for in this government, the people are the rulers in \n     war no less than in peace.\n\n  Of the expulsion petition filed against him, La Follette said:\n\n       I am aware, Mr. President, that in pursuance of this \n     general campaign of vilification and attempted intimidation, \n     requests from various individuals and certain organizations \n     have been submitted to the Senate for my expulsion from this \n     body, and that such requests have been referred to and \n     considered by one of the Committees of the Senate.\n       If I alone had been made the victim of these attacks, I \n     should not take one moment of the Senate's time for their \n     consideration, and I believe that other Senators who have \n     been unjustly and unfairly assailed, as I have been, hold the \n     same attitude upon this that I do. Neither the clamor of the \n     mob nor the voice of power will ever turn me by the breadth \n     of a hair from the course I mark out for myself, guided \n     by such knowledge as I can obtain and controlled and \n     directed by a solemn conviction of right and duty.\n\n  This powerful speech led to a Senate investigation of whether La \nFollette's conduct constituted treason. In 1919, following the end of \nWorld War I, the Senate dropped its investigation and reimbursed La \nFollette for the legal fees he incurred as a result of the expulsion \npetition and corresponding investigation. This incident is indicative \nof Fighting Bob's commitment to his ideals and of his tenacious spirit.\n  La Follette died on June 18, 1925, in Washington, D.C., while serving \nWisconsin in this body. His daughter noted, ``His passing was \nmysteriously peaceful for one who had stood so long on the battle \nline.'' Mourners visited the Wisconsin Capitol to view his body, and \npaid respects in a crowd nearing 50,000 people. La Follette's son, \nRobert M. La Follette, Jr., was appointed to his father's seat, and \nwent on to be elected in his own right and to serve in this body for \nmore than 20 years, following the progressive path blazed by his \nfather.\n  La Follette has been honored a number of times for his unwavering \ncommitment to his ideals and for his service to the people of Wisconsin \nand of the United States.\n  Recently, I was proud to support Senate passage of a bill introduced \nin the other body by Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin that will name the \npost office at 215 Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard in Madison in La \nFollette's honor. I commend Congresswoman Baldwin for her efforts to \npass this bill.\n  The Library of Congress recognized La Follette in 1985 by naming the \nCongressional Research Service reading room in the Madison Building in \nhonor of both Fighting Bob and his son, Robert, Jr., for their shared \ncommitment to the development of a legislative research service to \nsupport the United States Congress. In his autobiography, Fighting Bob \nnoted that, as governor of Wisconsin, he ``made it a . . . policy to \nbring all the reserves of knowledge and inspiration of the university \nmore fully to the service of the people. . . . Many of the university \nstaff are now in state service, and a bureau of investigation and \nresearch established as a legislative reference library . . . has \nproved of the greatest assistance to the legislature in furnishing the \nlatest and best thought of the advanced students of government in this \nand other countries.'' He went on to call this service ``a model which \nthe federal government and ultimately every state in the union will \nfollow.'' Thus, the legislative reference service that La Follette \ncreated in Madison served as the basis for his work to create the \nCongressional Research Service at the Library of Congress.\n  The La Follette Reading Room was dedicated on March 5, 1985, the \n100th\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nanniversary of Fighting Bob being sworn in for his first term as a \nMember of Congress.\n  Across this magnificent Capitol in National Statuary Hall, Fighting \nBob is forever immortalized in white marble, still proudly representing \nthe state of Wisconsin. His statue resides in the Old House Chamber, \nnow known as National Statuary Hall, among those of other notable \nfigures who have made their marks in American history. One of the few \nseated statues is that of Fighting Bob. Though he is sitting, he is \nshown with one foot forward, and one hand on the arm of his chair, as \nif he is about to leap to his feet and begin a robust speech.\n  When then-Senator John F. Kennedy's five-member Special Committee on \nthe Senate Reception Room chose La Follette as one of the ``Five \nOutstanding Senators'' whose portraits would hang outside of this \nChamber in the Senate reception room, he was described as being a \n``ceaseless battler for the underprivileged'' and a ``courageous \nindependent.'' Today, his painting still hangs just outside this \nChamber, where it bears witness to the proceedings of this body--and, \nperhaps, challenges his successors here to continue fighting for the \nsocial and government reforms he championed.\n  To honor Robert M. La Follette, Sr., on the sesquicentennial of his \nbirth, last week I introduced three pieces of legislation. I am pleased \nto be joined in this effort by the senior Senator from Wisconsin, \nSenator Kohl. The first is a resolution celebrating this event and \nrecognizing the importance of La Follette's important contributions to \nthe Progressive movement, the state of Wisconsin, and the United States \nof America.\n  We also introduced a bill that would direct the Secretary of the \nTreasury to mint coins to commemorate Fighting Bob's life and legacy. \nOur third bill would authorize the President to posthumously award a \ngold medal on behalf of Congress to Robert M. La Follette, Sr. The \nminting of a commemorative coin and the awarding of the Congressional \nGold Medal would be fitting tributes to the memory of Robert M. La \nFollette, Sr., and to his deeply held beliefs and long record of \nservice to his state and to his country.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nfor their assistance in passing our resolution honoring Fighting Bob \ntoday, on the 150th anniversary of his birth. And I thank my colleagues \nfor honoring Robert M. La Follette, Sr.'s character, his integrity, his \ndeep commitment to Progressive causes, and his unwillingness to waver \nfrom doing what he thought was right. No one has fought harder for the \ncommon man and woman, and against corruption and cronyism, than \n``Fighting Bob'' La Follette, and I consider it a privilege to speak in \nthe same Chamber, and serve the same great State, as he did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6479-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO TIFFANY MASON AS A SENATE PAGE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank Tiffany Mason, the most recent Senate page from \nMichigan, for her hard work, dedication, and enthusiasm in carrying out \nher daily responsibilities over the last several months. It is, in \npart, through the efforts of our Senate pages that the Senate is able \nto efficiently carry out its important work, which includes receiving \nmessages from the President and allowing for the introduction of bills. \nPages are also asked to complete a variety of other important tasks \nwhen the Senate is in session.\n  Senator Daniel Webster has the distinction of selecting the first \nSenate page more than 150 years ago. In those days, as is the case \ntoday, a page was chosen and sponsored by a Senator. During his or her \ntime in Washington, a page is not only expected to serve the needs of \nthe Senate but also to attend school and complete the necessary \nrequirements of high school juniors. Thirty pages from across the \ncountry serve as Senate pages each session. In May 1971 the first two \nfemale pages were selected to serve in the Senate.\n  Tiffany is a part of a fine tradition and a select group that has had \nthe great privilege to serve as a U.S. Senate page. She has proven \nthrough her work in the Senate and through her many successes in the \npast that she, like many of her peers, are some of our Nation's best \nand brightest. Tiffany has received several awards and has participated \nin many different activities over the course of her high school career. \nThese experiences have served her well and will continue to do so as \nshe continues to learn, grow, and mature.\n  The work that has been done by this page class is valued by all in \nthe Senate. I know my colleagues join me in thanking Tiffany Mason and \nthe rest of the page class for a job well done. I wish her the very \nbest in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6479-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DEPENDENCY COURT INTERVENTION PROGRAM\n\n Mr. NELSON Of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud \nthe work of the Dependency Court Intervention Program for Family \nViolence in Miami, FL. The Dependency Court Intervention Program for \nFamily Violence is designed to break the cycle of violence that occurs \nall too often in families suffering from domestic violence.\n  Approximately 6 years ago, Judge Lederman, from Florida's 11th \nJudicial Circuit, proposed to the Justice Department a new approach to \ndealing with domestic violence and dependency court proceedings. This \nnew approach was the Dependency Court Intervention Program. This court \nprogram, in addition to assisting victims of domestic violence through \nthe legal system, provides assistance and support to a parent \nattempting to rebuild his/her life and provides a secure home for their \nchildren.\n  Towards this end, the program has developed collaborative \nrelationships between the child welfare system, battered women \nadvocates, mental health and victim service providers, and law \nenforcement.\n  Again, I praise Judge Lederman and the other Floridians involved with \nthe good work done on behalf of victims and families in the Dependency \nIntervention Program for Family Violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6479-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6479-S6480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL THOMAS J.

Romig, The Judge Advocate General of \nthe Army, for his many years of exceptionally meritorious service to \nour country. General Romig will retire from the Army on September 30, \n2005, having completed a distinguished 34-year career. We owe him a \ndebt of gratitude for his many contributions to his Nation and the \nlegal profession, particularly during operations in support of the \nGlobal War on Terrorism.\n  As The Judge Advocate General since October 1, 2001, General Romig \nserved as the legal advisor to the Chief of Staff of the Army and the \nArmy Staff, as well as the military legal advisor to the Secretary of \nthe Army and the Assistant Secretaries. As such, he has been at the \nforefront of the most pressing issues affecting our Nation and the \nmilitary today.\n  General Romig's inventive and steady leadership is reflected every \nday in the superb legal services provided by each and every judge \nadvocate, civilian attorney, legal administrator, paralegal, and legal \nspecialist of The Judge Advocate General's Corps. His professional \nlegal advice has demonstrated his abiding concern for the Army's \nmission and his sincere interest in the welfare of soldiers and their \nfamilies. The Army and The Judge Advocate General's Corps have \nbenefited immeasurably from his leadership.\n  General Romig was born in 1948 at Manhattan, KS. He graduated from \nManhattan High School in 1966 and attended Kansas State University \nwhere he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1970. He was \ncommissioned through the ROTC program and entered active duty in \nOctober 1971. After graduating from the Infantry Officer Basic and \nAirborne Courses, he served almost 6 years as a Military Intelligence \nOfficer at Fort Bragg, NC, and Fort Huachuca, AZ.\n  In 1977, General Romig was selected for the Funded Legal Education \nProgram and attended the University of Santa Clara School of Law, Santa \nClara, CA, where he graduated with honors in 1980. During his 25 years \nof distinguished service as a judge advocate, General Romig served in \nmany positions of great responsibility, including service as a \nprosecutor with\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\nthe 2d Armored Division; an instructor at The Judge Advocate General's \nSchool; the Staff Judge Advocate of the 32d Army Air Defense Command; \nthe Chief of the Personnel, Plans, and Training Office; the Staff Judge \nAdvocate of V Corps; the Assistant Judge Advocate General for Civil Law \nand Litigation; and the Assistant Judge Advocate General for Military \nLaw and Operations.\n  He reached the top of his profession when he was appointed the 36th \nJudge Advocate General of the Army. General Romig is now completing his \nremarkable military career.\n  I know all my colleagues join me in saluting Major General Thomas J. \nRomig and his wife Pamela for their many years of truly outstanding \nservice to The Judge Advocate General's Corps, the U.S. Army, and our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6480-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SERVICE OF JOHN L.

In 1968, he acted as assistant principal and teacher at \nSt. Philip Neri School in Metairie, LA. And in 1975, he began a 30-year \ncareer as a social studies consultant for the Jefferson Parish Public \nSchool system.\n  Acting as the Louisiana Director of the Close Up Foundation, Mr. \nAlexander has led Louisiana's involvement in the Nation's largest \nnonprofit citizenship education organization.

A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act to modify provisions relating to the National Fund for \nExcellence in American Indian Education; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the National Fund for \nExcellence in American Indian Education Amendments Act of 2005 to \nrevise the Act.\n  In 2000, Congress authorized the establishment of a Federally-\nchartered non-profit foundation to further the educational \nopportunities for Native American students. This foundation, named the \nNational Fund for Excellence in American Indian Education, was \nestablished in July, 2004 and has the potential for success in \nproviding critical support to Native American students.\n  The legislation I introduce today will enable the foundation to \nbecome self-sufficient by authorizing appropriations for endowment or \nseed money and authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfunding for the foundation's operating costs on a reimbursement basis. \nThe legislation authorizes $5 million each fiscal year 2007 through \n2009 and increases the administration cost limit from 10 percent to 15 \npercent of donations and transferred funds. This bill will also allow \nthe Board to appoint the Chief Operating Officer who will be \nexperienced in Indian education.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will provide significant improvements \nfor the foundation in its mission of advancing Indian education and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in this effort. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Diana Gecaj Engstrom; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I and my colleague Senator Obama are \nintroducing a private relief bill on behalf of Diana Gejac Engstrom. \nThis bill would grant legal permanent residency status to Ms. Engstrom.\n  The Engstrom story is one of service. Both the late Todd Engstrom and \nhis widow, Diana, have spent their professional lives in service of \nhuman rights and American ideals. Todd served as a Commander in the \nUnited Nations Special Operations Group; Diana worked as a United \nNations translator in Kosovo. After their marriage in 2003, Diana filed \nfor legal permanent residency, with the ultimate goal of achieving \nAmerican citizenship.\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\n  After the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Todd joined EOD \nTechnology, Inc. as a Security Manager for Iraq. The U.S. Army assigned \nTodd to Iraq as a contractor to support our rebuilding efforts. Before \nleaving for Iraq, Todd asked Diana to raise his son, Dalton, in the \nevent of his death.\n  Assigned to an area just outside of Fallujah, Todd helped train Iraqi \nsecurity forces. On September 14, 2004, Todd died in a rocket-propelled \ngrenade attack on his convoy by Iraqi insurgents.\n  As it stands, in addition to the tragedy of losing her husband, Diana \ncan no longer continue the process of applying for legal residency and \nis in danger of deportation. Diana and Todd were not married for 2 \nyears and therefore our immigration laws will not allow her to apply \nfor permanent residency as a widow. The permanent residency application \nprocess for the surviving spouses of active duty soldiers who die in \nthe course of duty is allowed, under current immigration law, to \ncontinue after death, even if the couple has not been married for 2 \nyears.\n  Todd died in service of the American mission in Iraq; Congress should \ngrant Diana the right to stay on the path towards LPR status. Deporting \nDiana would unjustly deny Todd's wish that Diana raise his son Dalton.\n  Todd trained Iraq soldiers so the Iraqi government could one day \ndefend the country on its own. President Bush has made the training of \nIraqi security services a central goal in the reconstruction of Iraq. \nTodd died in pursuit of this goal. Todd's service to our country was \nsignificant. His wife should not be made to suffer both the loss of her \nhusband and deportation. This private bill will ensure that the \nsacrifice of Todd Engstrom is not forgotten.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1234. A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 2005, the \nrates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities \nand the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the \nsurvivors of certain disabled veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing today to provide a cost-of-living, COLA, \nadjustment for certain veterans benefits programs. This COLA adjustment \nwould affect payments made to nearly 3 million Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, beneficiaries, and would be reflected in beneficiary \nchecks that are received in January 2006, and thereafter.\n  An annual cost-of-living adjustment in veterans benefits is an \nimportant tool which protects veterans' cash-transfer benefits against \nthe corrosive effects of inflation. The principal programs affected by \nthe adjustment would be compensation paid to disabled veterans, and \ndependency and indemnity compensation--DIC--payments made to the \nsurviving spouses, minor children and other dependants of persons who \ndied in service, or who died after service as a result of service-\nconnected injuries or diseases.\n  The President's budget anticipates inflation to be at a 2.3 percent \nlevel at the close of this year as measured by the consumer price \nindex--CPI--published by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. If inflation is held to the 2.3-percent level, that will be \nthe level of COLA adjustment under this legislation since it ties the \nincrease directly to the CPI increase as measured by the Department of \nLabor. Whatever the CPI increase eventually turns out to be, however, \nveterans' and survivors' benefits payments must be protected by being \nincreased by a like amount. The Senate has already concurred with that \njudgment with passage of a budget resolution which assumes an increase \nequal to the CPI and which sets aside the funds necessary to finance \nthe COLA increase envisioned by this legislation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this vital legislation.\n  I request unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-\n     of-Living Adjustment Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND \n                   DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2005, the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance \n     with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November \n     30, 2005, for the payment of disability compensation and \n     dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions \n     specified in subsection (b).\n       (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be \n     increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:\n       (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar \n     amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.\n       (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the \n     dollar amounts under sections 1115(1) of such title.\n       (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section \n     1162 of such title.\n       (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving \n     spouse.--Each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a) \n     through (d) of section 1311 of such title.\n       (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children.--\n     Each of the dollar amounts under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of \n     such title.\n       (c) Determination of Increase.--\n       (1) Percentage.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), each \n     dollar amount described in subsection (b) shall be increased \n     by the same percentage as the percentage by which benefit \n     amounts payable under title II of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 401 et seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2005, \n     as a result of a determination under section 215(i) of such \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)).\n       (2) Rounding.--Each dollar amount increased under paragraph \n     (1), if not a whole dollar amount, shall be rounded to the \n     next lower whole dollar amount.\n       (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may \n     adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made \n     under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation \n     payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72 \n     Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter \n     11 of title 38, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.\n\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the \n     Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as \n     increased under that section, not later than the date on \n     which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to \n     be published by reason of a determination made under section \n     215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1235. A bill to amend chapters 19 and 37 of title 38, United \nStates Code, to extend the availability of $400,000 in coverage under \nthe servicemembers' life insurance and veterans' group life insurance \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation that I have introduced today that will improve insurance \nand housing benefits available for our Nation's servicemembers and \nveterans. The ``Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2005'' would \nincrease the maximum amount of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, \nSGLI, and Veterans' Group Life Insurance, VGLI, coverage from $250,000 \nto $400,000; would require the Secretary of Defense to notify spouses \nof insured servicemembers when those servicemembers elect an SGLI \nbeneficiary other than their spouse or when they elect to reduce SGLI \ncoverage amounts; would provide a two-year, post-discharge window \nwithin which totally disabled veterans might elect to convert their \ninsurance coverage from SGLI to VGLI; and would provide flexibility to \nVA's hybrid adjustable rate mortgage program so that servicemembers and \nveterans might use their VA home loan benefits in conjunction with this \npopular type of mortgage financing.\n  There already has been a great deal of discussion in the 109th \nCongress about the adequacy of benefits for the survivors of those who \nhave lost their lives in service. There has also been a great deal of \naction. Section 1012 of Public Law 109-13, the ``Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriation Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami \nRelief, 2005,'' made improvements to the SGLI program. However, section \n1012 also specified that the SGLI improvements made in the act be \nterminated effective September 30, 2005, and that the law as it existed \nprior to the enactment of Public Law 109-13 be revived on that date. As \nI understand it, the purpose of the termination language was to give \nthe committee of jurisdiction--in this case, the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, which I\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\nchair in the Senate--the opportunity to proceed with proposals that \nwould put a more permanent stamp on changes to the SGLI program.\n  Towards that end, and consistent with the changes enacted in Public \nLaw 109-13, section 2(a) of my legislation would increase the maximum \namount of SGLI and VGLI coverage from $250,000 to $400,000 effective \nOctober 1, 2005. SGLI coverage meets the insurance needs of \nservicemembers and Reserve members; VGLI coverage is available to meet \nthe insurance needs of veterans as they transition out of military or \nnaval service. The higher amount of coverage in my bill, in combination \nwith other Federal assistance provided by VA, the Department of \nDefense, and the Social Security Administration, would provide for a \nmore appropriate level of financial assistance for survivors of insured \nservicemembers and veterans. For example, the surviving spouse of an \nArmy Sergeant killed in action who has two dependent children would \nhave eligibility for up to $625,186 in lump-sum benefit assistance from \nthe Federal government.\n  In addition, section 2(a) of the legislation I have introduced today \nwould require the Secretary of Defense to notify, in writing, the \nspouses of servicemembers who elect either to name beneficiaries other \nthan their spouses, or who elect to reduce their SGLI coverage. Under \nexisting law, servicemembers have the right to name the insurance \nbeneficiary of their choice. There are, however, some incidences of \nspouses of married servicemembers being left without adequate insurance \nfor themselves or their children because they were unaware of the \ninsurance decisions the servicemembers had made. I believe the spousal \nnotification requirement in my bill strikes an appropriate balance \nbetween the long-standing rights of servicemembers to make their own, \nunfettered insurance choices, and the rights of spouses to be informed \nof matters that may impact on their future financial stability.\n  Turning to the insurance needs of severely disabled servicemembers, \nsection 2(b) of this bill would extend for 1 year the period within \nwhich totally disabled veterans discharged from service might apply to \nconvert their SGLI coverage to VGLI coverage. Under current law, \nservicemembers discharged from service have a 120-day grace period \nwithin which they are provided premium-free coverage under SGLI and may \nconvert to VGLI coverage without needing to meet underwriting \nrequirements. Servicemembers separated from service who are totally \ndisabled may apply for an extension of the free SGLI coverage and VGLI \nconversion benefit that lasts up to one year after military discharge. \nThere are two benefits of applying for the 1 year extension. The first \nis that SGLI coverage during the 1 year period is provided at no cost \nto the servicemember. The second is that the application for extension \nalso serves as an application for automatic conversion from SGLI to \nVGLI. The opportunity to convert life insurance coverage to VGLI is \nessential for totally disabled veterans, many of whom have no hope of \nobtaining commercial insurance coverage.\n  VA's Insurance Service conducts targeted outreach to severely \ndisabled veterans in an attempt to encourage them to apply for the 1 \nyear extension of SGLI and conversion to VGLI benefit. However, \ninformation obtained from this outreach effort reveals that many \nseverely disabled veterans are not taking advantage of the extension \nbecause they are precluded from post-separation financial planning by \nthe effects of their disabilities and their need to focus on \nrehabilitation. Preliminary data obtained from VA suggest only 45 \npercent of totally disabled servicemembers apply for the extension \ndespite VA's outreach effort. My legislation will provide 1 additional \nyear within which severely disabled veterans may apply. The extra year \nwill give VA more time--a total of 2 years after their discharge from \nthe military--to reach veterans when they are perhaps more able to \nfocus on their financial planning needs.\n  Finally, section 3 of the legislation I have introduced today would \nprovide VA with greater flexibility to set appropriate interest rate \ncap protections on hybrid ARM loans it guarantees. Under existing law, \nVA has the authority to guaranty hybrid ARM loans through fiscal year \n2008. Hybrid ARM loans are a new, and popular, financing option for \nborrowers that features a fixed period of interest on a loan for \nbetween 3 and 10 years followed by a period of annual adjustments \nthereafter. For VA hybrid ARM loans with an initial fixed rate of 5 or \nmore years, VA may prescribe the maximum increase of the initial \nadjustment and the maximum adjustment permitted over the life of the \nloan. These interest rate ``caps'' are common in the mortgage financing \nindustry, and serve to protect borrowers against wild upward swings in \ninterest rates that might make a borrower more likely to default. \nHowever, unlike the flexibility given to VA to set caps for the initial \nadjustment and for the aggregate adjustment for the life of a loan, the \nlaw specifically limits annual interest rate adjustments after the \ninitial adjustment to one percentage point. I am informed by industry \nand VA experts that without providing VA with greater flexibility to \nset an appropriate interest rate cap for annual adjustments, lenders \nwill either be reluctant to make VA hybrid ARM loans available to \nveterans, or will require that veterans pay higher interest rates than \notherwise would be required. My legislation would provide VA with the \nflexibility it needs to fix this problem.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of this legislation are important for \nveterans and their loved ones. We must give greater peace of mind to \nthe families of those serving in the military, especially during a \nwartime period, that their Government has made available to them life \ninsurance coverage to meet their basic financial needs in the event of \ndeath. We must give every opportunity for severely wounded \nservicemembers, many with war wounds, to remain insured under a \ngovernment life insurance policy if their injuries might preclude them \nfrom being covered at reasonable cost under a private policy. And we \nmust ensure that we remain flexible with mortgage industry standards so \nthat veterans have the greatest array of financing options available to \nthem when seeking to partake in the American dream of home ownership. \nMy bill will accomplish all of these things and I ask my colleagues for \ntheir support of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1235\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expedite the transition to digital television \nwhile helping consumers to continue to use their analog televisions; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nsupport the Nation's finest: our police, fire fighters and other \nemergency response personnel. The Spectrum Availability for Emergency-\nresponse and Law-enforcement to Improve Vital Emergency Services Act, \notherwise known as The SAVE LIVES Act. This bill is drafted in response \nto the 9-11 Commission's final report, which recommended the \n``expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum for public \nsafety purposes.''\n  To meet this recommendation, the SAVE LIVES Act would set a date \ncertain for the allocation of spectrum to public safety agencies, \nspecifically the 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band that Congress \npromised public safety agencies in 1997. This is a promise Congress has \nyet to deliver to our Nation's first responders. Now is the time for \ncongressional action before another national emergency or crisis takes \nplace. Access to this specific spectrum is essential to our Nation's \nsafety and welfare as emergency communications sent over these \nfrequencies are able to penetrate walls and travel great distances, and \ncan assist multiple jurisdictions in deploying interoperable \ncommunications systems.\n  In addition to setting a date certain, this bill would authorize \nfunds for public safety agencies to purchase emergency communications \nequipment and ensure that Congress has the ability to consider whether \nadditional spectrum should be provided for public safety communications \nprior to the recovered spectrum being auctioned. The bill contains \nsignificant language concerning consumer education of the digital \ntelevision transition. The bill would mandate that warning labels be \ndisplayed on analog television sets sold prior to the transition, \nrequire warning language to be displayed at television retailers, \ncommand the distribution at retailers of brochures describing the \ntelevision set options available, and call on broadcasters to air \ninformational programs to better prepare consumers for the digital \ntransition.\n  The bill would ensure that no television viewer's set would go \n``dark'' by providing digital-to-analog converter boxes to over-the-air \nviewers that have a household income that does not exceed 200 percent \nof the poverty line and by allowing cable companies to down convert \ndigital signal signals if necessary. I continue to believe that \nbroadcast television is a powerful communications tool and important \ninformation source for citizens. I know that on 9/11, I learned about \nthe attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon like most Americans--by \nwatching television. Therefore, this bill seeks to not only protect \ncitizens' safety but also the distribution of broadcast television.\n  Lastly, the bill would establish a tax credit for the recycling of \ntelevision sets and require the Environmental Protection Agency to \nreport to Congress on the need for a national electronic waste \nrecycling program.\n  The 9-11 Commission's final report contained harrowing tales about \npolice officers and fire fighters who were inside the Twin Towers and \nunable to receive evacuation orders over their radios from commanders. \nIn fact, the report found that this inability to communicate was not \nonly a problem for public safety organizations responding at the World \nTrade Center, but also for those responding at the Pentagon and \nSomerset County, PA, crash sites where multiple organizations and \nmultiple jurisdictions responded. Therefore, the Commission recommended \nthat Congress accelerate the availability of more spectrum for public \nsafety.\n  The SAVE LIVES Act would implement the important recommendation and \nensure that when our Nation experiences another attack, or other \ncritical emergencies occur, our police, fire fighters, and other \nemergency response personnel will have the ability to communicate with \neach other and their commanders to prevent another catastrophic loss of \nlife. Now is the time for congressional action before another national \nemergency or crisis takes place.\n  Several lawmakers attempted to act last year during the debate on the \nintelligence reform bill, but our efforts were thwarted by the powerful \nNational Association of Broadcasters. This year, I hope we can all work \ntogether and to pass a bill that ensures the country is not only better \nprepared in case of another attack but also protects the vital \ncommunications outlet of broadcast television. I believe the SAVE LIVES \nAct does just that.\n  Mr. President, in an effort to expeditiously retrieve the spectrum \nfor the Nation's first responders, to preserve over-the-air television \naccessibility to consumers and to ensure the adequate funding of both, \nI urge the enactment of the SAVE LIVES Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1238.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public \nLands Corps Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2005. I am introducing \nthis bill with Senators Domenici and Bingaman, whose cosponsorship I \ngreatly appreciate. I also understand that Congressmen Greg Walden and \nTom Udall are introducing an identical version of the bill in the \nHouse, which I also appreciate.\n  This bill authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to \nenter into contracts and cooperative agreements with qualified corps to \nperform appropriate conservation projects, assist governments and \nIndian tribes in performing research and public education associated \nwith natural and cultural resources, introduce young people to public \nservice and expand their educational opportunities, and stimulate \ninterest among the Nation's youth in careers in conservation and land \nmanagement.\n  Consistent with the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, this bill also \nidentifies a series of priority projects for corps to carry out \nincluding the restoration and protection of public lands threatened by \nsevere fire, insect or disease infestation or other damaging agents; \nthe protection, restoration, or enhancement of forest ecosystem \ncomponents to promote the recovery of threatened and endangered \nspecies; the improvement of biological diversity; and, the enhancement \nof productivity and carbon sequestration.\n  In general, the Secretaries may give a preference to those corps that \nenroll young people who are economically, physically, or educationally \ndisadvantaged. When it comes to the priority projects, the Secretaries \nshall ``to the maximum extent practicable'' give preference to those \ncorps that have a substantial number of members who are disadvantaged. \nIt also allows the Secretaries to grant noncompetitive hiring status to \ncorps alumni for future Federal hiring. Finally, the bill authorizes \n$15 million a year, of which $10 million is for the priority projects \nidentified in the bill and $5 million is for nonpriority projects.\n  I have named this legislation the Public Lands Corps Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act because it builds on both the Public Lands Corps Act of \n1993 and the recently enacted Healthy Forest Restoration Act. I also \nwant to note that last year the administration supported an earlier, \nbut substantially similar, version of this bill.\n  This bill uses the cost saving resources of youth corps to carry out \nprojects. It is estimated that youth corps generate $1.60 in immediate \nbenefits for every dollar in costs. This figure is important given both \nthe great need and great costs associated with fighting fires. The \nFederal Government is responsible for overseeing 689 million acres of \nland and five Federal agencies reported spending $1.6 billion in 2002 \non fire fighting suppression efforts--a whopping $300 million more than \nthe previous record.\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\n  As an example of what can happen in one State, consider 2003's \ncatastrophic wildfires in southern California. Before these wildfires \nwere contained, they scorched a total of 739,597 acres, killed 24 \npeople, and destroyed approximately 3,631 homes and thousands of other \nstructures. Not only did insurance payouts cost more than $3 billion, \nbut public expenditures for firefighting and recovery ran into the \nhundreds of millions of dollars. And California is certainly not the \nonly State to incur large costs from fires.\n  I want to reduce the chances of this type of catastrophe recurring in \nthe future. To do so, we must use every resource at our disposal. I \nknow that youth service and conversation corps can play a significant \nrole in reducing the physical and financial strain that public land \nmanagement agencies bear, and help protect our Nation's public lands \nfrom wildfires and other forms of devastation.\n  I have seen firsthand the benefits that service and conservation \ncorps bring to communities and the difference that they make in the \nlives of disadvantaged youth. In 1983, I founded the first urban youth \ncorps as mayor of San Francisco, and during that time I saw a great \nimprovement in the quality of life of the corps members and of the city \nitself. When the program started, it had a million-dollar budget and \nemployed 36 disadvantaged young people 18 to 23 years old. They needed \nsome direction, wanted a challenge, and to make themselves socially \nuseful.\n  That first year, we paid corps members $3.35 an hour to repair \nbathrooms in affordable housing for senior citizens and others, build a \npark in Hunter's Point, clear scotch broom from the Twin Peaks \nhillside, and fix up Alcatraz Island. In the subsequent 22 years, the \nSan Francisco Conservation Corps, SFCC, has grown into a multisite, \nmultifaceted agency that engages more than 500 young adults annually \nwho have completed over 3.5 million hours of community service.\n  The San Francisco Conservation Corps has also given thousands of \ncorps members a sense of personal pride, helped connect them with their \ncommunity, and prove that hard work pays off. I started the corps to \nhelp young people break out of the cycle of poverty and crime and \nimprove their job skills by giving them guidance and support through \nlabor-intensive activities.\n  I am introducing this bill with the hope that the success of the San \nFrancisco Conservation Corps can be duplicated nationwide. This program \nwill not reach every disadvantaged young person in need of guidance and \na second chance. But it is a start, and I urge my colleagues to join me \nin this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce the American Indian \nElderly and Disabled Access to Health Care Act of 2005 to revise the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  The legislation I introduce today will amend the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act to permit the Indian Health Service, an Indian tribe, \ntribal or Urban Indian organization to use their funding to pay the \nMedicare Part D premiums of eligible Indian beneficiaries. These \npremium payments are for the American Indians and Alaska Natives \nenrolled in the prescription drug plans under part D of title XVIll of \nthe Social Security Act. Currently, these funds can be used for paying \nMedicare Parts A and B premiums but not Part D, and this legislation \nwill enable eligible Indian beneficiaries to enroll and participate in \nthe Part D program when it begins in January, 2006.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will increase the ability of the \nelderly and disabled American Indians and Alaska Natives to access the \nprescription drug benefits available under Medicare Part D and assist \nthe Indian Health Service in achieving potentially significant cost \nsavings.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nan investment tax credit for the purchase of trucks with new diesel \nengine technologies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation critically \nimportant to our Nation's continued economic growth and future \nenvironmental progress. I am joined by my friend and colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Lincoln.\n  Nearly everything sold in the United States moves by truck at some \nstage of delivery. In fact, America's trucking industry is responsible \nfor moving nearly 70 percent of the tonnage of all products sold in the \nU.S.--a total of more than 9.8 billion tons of freight shipped in 2004.\n  If trucking serves as the circulatory system for the U.S. economy, \nthen diesel engines provide America's economic heartbeat. Because of \ntheir superior fuel efficiency, durability and reliability, diesel \nengines power 100 percent of the long-haul trucks responsible for the \nbulk of freight deliveries in the U.S. Engineers have revolutionized \nthis technology over the past decade by dramatically reducing emissions \nwhile maintaining diesel's inherent fuel efficiency. For example, a new \ntruck sold today produces 78 percent fewer smog-forming and particulate \nemissions than a similar truck built in 1987.\n  Even more advanced, cleaner technology is scheduled to begin rolling \non America's highways in 2007. Beginning that year, a new Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, regulation for diesel trucks will require \nfurther reductions in smog-forming and particulate emissions--\nreductions of over 90 percent compared to current levels. When fully \nimplemented in 2010, EPA's clean diesel rule is estimated to reduce \nsmog-forming emissions of nitrogen oxides by 2.6 million tons each \nyear, along with 110,000 tons of fine particulate matter annually.\n  These clean diesel trucks are expected to play a leading role in \nhelping cities and states meet strict new federal standards for ozone \nand fine particulates. And the technology is real; truck manufacturers \nand suppliers have demonstrated their commitment to delivering clean \ndiesel by 2007.\n  However, we must recognize that clean air comes at a price. Trucks \ncontaining clean diesel engines that meet the EPA regulation in 2007 \nwill include innovative emissions control technology that will increase \npurchase and\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nmaintenance costs. Additionally, the 2007 trucks will run on low-sulfur \ndiesel fuel that will be more expensive because of the added cost of \nsulfur removal. These additional financial burdens will fall upon \nAmerica's trucking industry--where 96 percent of companies are \ndesignated as small businesses.\n  Equally important for those of us concerned about clean air, we must \nrecognize that EPA's projected environmental benefits will materialize \nonly if trucking companies can afford to purchase the cleaner but more \nexpensive trucks equipped with the clean diesel engines. Federal \nregulation can require manufacturers to produce emissions compliant \nproducts, but the government cannot mandate the purchase of these clean \ndiesel trucks. Customers always have the option of holding on to older \ntrucks longer, rebuilding older engines, leasing older trucks, or \nturning to the used truck market. They can also simply buy more trucks \ntoday, with older design components and without the cleanest \ntechnology, and defer the purchase of cleaner trucks.\n  The bottom line is that the actual trucks in service on America's \nhighways in 2007 and beyond will not yield the emissions reductions \ncurrently projected by EPA's own air quality models unless trucking \ncompanies can afford to buy the new clean diesels. Absent a short-term \nincentive for the purchase of these new trucks in 2007, simple \neconomics will drive most trucking companies to either pre-purchase \ntrucks that do not meet the new EPA regulation or extend the lives of \ntheir current fleets. This ``pre-buy/low-buy'' scenario played out most \nrecently with the introduction of lower emission diesel trucks in \nOctober 2002.\n  Avoiding this problem, Mr. President, is the reason I am introducing \nthis legislation today. Truck manufacturers and suppliers have \nresponded to our clean air challenge and will be ready for the on-time \ndelivery of remarkably clean trucks in 2007. The Federal Government \nneeds to take the next step by helping to ensure the widest possible \ndistribution of this clean diesel technology into the U.S. trucking \nfleet.\n  Under the proposal I am introducing today with Senator Lincoln, \ntaxpayers would be allowed an investment tax credit equal to 5 percent \nof the cost of EPA-compliant diesel equipment for acquisitions after \nDecember 31, 2006 but before January 1, 2008. The credits could be used \nagainst the taxpayer's regular tax or AMT liability. The credit would \nbe part of the general business credit and thus credits unutilized in a \ntaxable year would be carried over to another taxable year.\n  In addition, taxpayers would be allowed to expense the acquisition \ncost of qualifying equipment acquired and placed in service after \nDecember 31, 2006 and before January 1, 2008, for purposes of both the \nregular tax and the AMT.\n  Enacting the short-term tax incentive that Senator Lincoln and I \npropose would put the cost of new clean diesel technology on at least a \nlevel playing field with the cost of today's trucks. It would ensure \nthat trucking companies have the financial ability to purchase these \nmodern clean diesels. Consequently, our legislation would ensure that \nAmericans can breathe easier because the full air quality benefits \nintended by EPA's clean diesel rule will be realized.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Lincoln and the rest of my \ncolleagues to see this important clean air legislation enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1241. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on fixed ratio speed \nchangers for truck-mounted concrete mixers; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which \nwould temporarily suspend the duty on fixed ratio speed changers for \ntruck-mounted concrete mixers.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals a deduction for qualified long-term care insurance \npremiums, use of such insurance under cafeteria plans and flexible \nspending arrangements, and a credit for individuals with long-term \nneeds; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term \nCare and Retirement Security Act. I am pleased to be sponsoring this \nbill with my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Blanche \nLincoln.\n  Our bill would ease the tremendous cost of long-term care for \nAmericans everywhere. First, it would allow individuals a tax deduction \nfor the cost of long-term care insurance premiums. Increasingly, \nAmericans are interested in private long-term care insurance to pay for \nnursing home stays, assisted living, home health aides, and other \nservices. However, most people find the policies unaffordable. The \nyounger the person is at the time the longcare insurance contract is \npurchased, the lower the insurance premium. Yet most people are not \nready to buy a policy until retirement. A deduction for long-term care \ninsurance premiums would encourage more people to buy a long-term care \ninsurance policy.\n  Our proposal would also give individuals or their care gives a $3,000 \ntax credit to help cover their long-term care expenses. This would \napply to those who have been certified by a doctor as needing help with \nat least three activities of daily living, such as eating, bathing or \ndressing. This credit--would help care givers pay for medical supplies, \nnursing care and any other expenses incurred while caring for family \nmembers with disabilities.\n  This year, I have been pleased to see our Nation turn its attention \nto the need to address the challenges of our aging population. The \nPresident has used the power of the Presidency to jumpstart a national \ndiscussion of the need to reform Social Security. Attention also has \nbeen focused on the need to increase our abysmally low savings rate and \nto ensure that workers' pensions are fully funded. At the same time, I \nhave been glad to see attention also focused on helping Americans' \nprepare for future long-term care expenses. Enactment of the bill we \nare introducing today would mark a giant step forward in doing just \nthat.\n  An aging Nation has no time to waste in preparing for long-term care, \nand the need to help people afford long-term care is more pressing than \never. I look forward to working with Senator Lincoln and our colleagues \nin the Senate to get our bill passed into law as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\n                                S. 1244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Long Term \nCare and Retirement Security Act of 2005 with the Chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee and my good friend from Iowa, Senator Charles \nGrassley.\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\n  The introduction of our bill coincides nicely with the debate we are \nabout to have in the Senate Finance Committee about Medicaid. Almost \none-third of Medicaid costs can be attributed to long term care of the \nelderly and disabled.\n  The first of the 77 million Baby Boomers turn 65 years old in 2011. I \nbelieve that Congress needs to help them prepare for their futures now \nby investing in a private long term care policy. We must also make them \naware that many long term care services are not covered by private \nhealth insurance or by Medicare. Historically, long term care costs \nhave been paid first by families out-of-pocket and then by Medicaid for \nthose who qualify and ``spend down'' to the income and assets limits.\n  Our legislation will create a tax credit for caregivers and \nindividuals faced with the immediate expense of long-term care. The \nbill would also help Americans better prepare for their future needs by \nproviding a tax deduction to help consumers pay long-term care \ninsurance premiums for policies that meet strong consumer protection \nstandards. Such plans will cover both medical and non-medical \nsupportive care and personal care assistance so that elders can age at \nhome.\n  Unless we encourage Americans to plan ahead, demand and costs for \nlong term care services could deplete their savings and exhaust \ngovernment programs. These tax incentives are a good first step forward \nto avoiding this problem.\n  I believe this bill should be seriously considered during the \nMedicaid debate. States all over the country are being impacted by \ndecreased revenues and are being forced to make tough choices. At the \nsame time, enrollment in Medicaid is increasing.\n  In fact, compared to other states, enrollment in Medicaid in Arkansas \nis growing at one of the fastest rates. Monthly Medicaid enrollment \ngrew by 9.6 percent from June 2002 to June 2003, while the national \naverage was 5.9 percent.\n  This legislation should also be a part of our debate on Social \nSecurity and retirement security. Long term care insurance should be a \npart of every family's retirement plan. Nursing home care is expensive, \nand not all state Medicaid programs pay for long term care within an \nindividual's home.\n  I urge my colleagues to become cosponsors of this important \nlegislation and work with Senator Grassley and me to pass it as soon as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 1246. A bill to require the Secretary of Education to revise \nregulations regarding student loan payment deferment with respect to \nborrowers who are in postgraduate medical or dental internship, \nresidency, or fellowship programs; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Jeffords, Kerry \nand Feingold to introduce the Medical Education Affordability Act, \nMEAA. The purpose of this bill is to make medical and dental education \nmore affordable.\n  Upon graduation from college, students who demonstrate economic \nhardship are eligible to extend their student loan deferment for up to \n3 additional years. Using the economic hardship deferment, a formula \nthat takes into account earnings and debt level, the majority of \nmedical and dental residents defer repayment of their student loans \nuntil the end of their residency period. Unfortunately, for those \nspecialties that require a residency of more than 3 years--OB/GYN, \npsychiatry, and general surgery to name a few--student loan repayment \nbegins before a resident's medical or dental education is completed. \nThis situation creates an enormous financial burden for residents who \nhave, in most cases, incurred significant debt. In 2004, the average \nindebtedness for graduating medical students was $115,000, for \ngraduating dental students it was $122,263. While lenders are currently \nrequired to offer forbearance to medical and dental students, this is \nan expensive option as interest continues to accrue and may be \ncapitalized more often.\n  The Medical Education Affordability Act would solve this problem by \nextending the economic hardship deferment to cover the entire length of \na medical or dental residency. By altering the definition we are \nremoving a significant financial obstacle facing students with \nresidency periods longer than 3 years. I want to stress again, \nresidents will still have to demonstrate economic hardship--MEAA only \nextends the deferment for borrowers that continue to meet the debt-to-\nincome requirements of the economic hardship deferment.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in support of \nmedical education by signing onto this bill. By working together, I \nbelieve that the Senate as a body can act to ensure that more \nindividuals are able to pursue a full range of medical specialties.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Education \n     Affordability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATION REVISION REQUIRED.\n\n       (a) Action Required.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education shall \n     revise the regulations of the Department of Education that \n     are promulgated to carry out the provisions relating to \n     student loan repayment deferment under the Federal Family \n     Education Loan Program under part B of title IV of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq.), the William \n     D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program under part D of title IV \n     of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.), and the Federal \n     Perkins Loan Program under part E of title IV of such Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 1087aa et seq.), which are promulgated under sections \n     682.210, 685.204, and 674.34 of title 34, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, to comply with the requirements of subsection \n     (b).\n       (b) Requirements.--The student loan repayment deferment \n     regulations shall be revised to provide, with respect to a \n     borrower who is in a postgraduate medical or dental \n     internship, residency, or fellowship program, that if the \n     borrower qualifies for student loan repayment deferment under \n     the economic hardship provision--\n       (1) the deferment shall be available for the length of the \n     internship, residency, or fellowship program if the program--\n       (A) must be successfully completed by the borrower before \n     the borrower may begin professional practice or service; or\n       (B) leads to a degree or certificate awarded by a health \n     professional school, hospital, or health care facility that \n     offers postgraduate training; and\n       (2) the borrower shall not be required to apply annually \n     for such student loan repayment deferment during the length \n     of the program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Levin, \n        Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1247. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \nestablish a scholarship program to encourage and support students who \nhave contributed substantial public services; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with Senators \nMikulski, Landrieu, Levin, Cantwell and Kerry, the Youth Service \nScholarship Act. This Act would authorize the Secretary of Education to \naward college scholarships of up to $5,000 a year to high school \nstudents and undergraduates who perform community service.\n  A recent study titled Community Service and Service Learning in U.S. \nPublic Schools reveals that 66 percent of public schools involve \nstudents in community service. This means that approximately 54,000 \npublic schools in America currently engage about 13.7 million students \nin community service each year. Other studies have shown that nearly 84 \npercent of high school students participate in volunteer activities \neither in or out of school and two-thirds of college students have \nrecently participated in volunteer activities.\n  The Youth Service Scholarship Act is designed to assist low-income \nstudents who dedicate a significant portion of their time to volunteer \nservice with money for college. This Act would authorize the Secretary \nof Education to award college scholarships of up to $5,000 to high \nschool students who perform over 300 hours of community service in both \ntheir junior and senior years. In order to be considered, high school \napplicants must maintain a 3.0 grade point average, submit character \nrecommendations, and write an essay\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\non the nature of their community service. Additional money will be \navailable if the student continues to participate in a significant \namount of community service once they are in college.\n  Voluntarism not only brings support and services to communities in \nneed, it provides significant benefits to the students who participate. \nResearch has shown that students who volunteer are 50 percent less \nlikely to use drugs and alcohol or engage in destructive behavior. \nAdditionally, students who volunteer are more likely to receive good \ngrades, be philanthropic, graduate, and be interested in going to \ncollege.\n  In the 21st Century, higher education is not a luxury, it is a \nnecessity. For many of our low-income youth, finding money to pay for \ncollege is an obstacle to enrollment. This scholarship program provides \naid to motivated and inspired youth.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Youth Service \nScholarship Act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1247\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Service Scholarship \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) young people under 18 years of age are now our Nation's \n     most impoverished age group, with 1 of every 5 living in \n     poverty, a higher proportion than in 1968, and the percentage \n     of minority children living in poverty is about twice as \n     high;\n       (2) more than 1 of 4 families is headed by a single parent \n     and the percentage of such families has risen steadily over \n     the past few decades, rising 13 percent since 1990;\n       (3) there is a need to engage youth as active participants \n     in decisionmaking that affects their lives, including in the \n     design, development, implementation, and evaluation of youth \n     development programs at the Federal, State, and community \n     levels;\n       (4) existing outcome driven youth development strategies, \n     pioneered by community-based organizations, hold real promise \n     for promoting positive behaviors and preventing youth \n     problems;\n       (5) formal evaluations of youth development programs have \n     documented significant reductions in drug and alcohol use, \n     school misbehavior, aggressive behavior, violence, truancy, \n     high-risk sexual behavior, and smoking;\n       (6) compared to youth in the United States generally, youth \n     participating in community-based organizations are more than \n     26 percent more likely to report having received recognition \n     for good grades than youth in the United States generally and \n     nearly 20 percent more likely to rate the likelihood of their \n     going to college as very high; and\n       (7) the availability and use of Federal resources can be an \n     effective incentive to leverage broader community support to \n     enable local programs, activities, and services to provide \n     the full array of developmental core resources, remove \n     barriers to access, promote program effectiveness, and \n     facilitate coordination and collaboration within the \n     community.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.\n\n       Subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a-11 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating section 407E as section 406E; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n                 ``CHAPTER 4--PUBLIC SERVICE INCENTIVES\n\n     ``SEC. 407A.

A bill to establish a servitude and emancipation archival \nresearch clearinghouse in the National Archives; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 140th \nanniversary on this upcoming Sunday of Major General Gordon Granger and \nhis Union soldiers' arrival in Galveston, TX. On that day in 1865, \nthese troops brought with them the news that the war had ended and that \nthe enslaved peoples were henceforth free. Since its origin in 1865, \nthe observance of June 19 as African American Emancipation Day, or \nJuneteenth, is the oldest known celebration of slavery's end.\n  It took two and a half years from the time that President Lincoln's \nEmancipation Proclamation went into effect for the news of freedom to \narrive in Texas. That it took 2 years for African Americans to learn \nthat the war was over, and that they were now free seems absurd in our \ninformation age. Yet, despite the transformation made in our society by \ncomputers, networks and the internet, there are still gaps in the \ninformation accessible to African Americans around this country. The \nbill that I introduce today attempts to address one of them.\n  Mr. President, it is a very human instinct for people to want to \nunderstand who they are from the lense of who are their ancestors and \nwhere they are from. The very commercially successful, and critically \nacclaimed television series ``Roots'' was a seminal event in this \nnation's interest in genealogy. Yet while people across the nation were \ninspired by Alex Haley's tale to understand their own family history, \nAfrican Americans trying to do the same confronted unique challenges. \nUnfortunately, African Americans who attempt to trace their genealogy \nencounter huge hurdles in reclaiming the usual documentary history that \nallows most Americans to piece together their heritage. For this \nreason, I am proposing the Servitude and Emancipation Archival Research \nClearing House, SEARCH, Act of 2005. This bill establishes a national \ndatabase within the National Archives and Records Administration, NARA, \nhousing various documents that would assist those in search of a \nhistory that, because of slavery, is almost impossible to find in the \nmost ordinary registers and census records.\n  Traditionally, someone researching their genealogy would try looking \nup wills and land deeds; however, enslaved African Americans were \nprohibited from owning property. In fact, African Americans, must \nfrequently rely on the records of slave owners--most of which are in \nprivate hands--in hope that they had kept records containing birth and \ndeath information. Even if records do exist, many African Americans in \nthe past did not have formal last names, thus compounding the \ndifficulty of tracing their lives. The omission of surnames also \nprecludes use of the most popular and major source of genealogical \nresearch, the United States Census. Furthermore, letters, diaries, and \nother first-person records used by most genealogical researchers are \nscarcely available for slaves, owing to the fact that they could not \nlegally learn to read or write.\n  We may think that after 1865, African Americans could begin using \ntraditional genealogical records like voter registrations and school \nrecords. However, African Americans did not immediately begin to \nparticipate in many of the privileges of citizenship, including voting \nand attending school. Discrimination meant that African Americans were \nbarred from sitting on juries or owning businesses. Segregation meant \nsegregated neighborhoods, schools, churches, clubs, and fraternal \norganizations, and thus segregated societies maintained segregated \nrecords. For example, some telephone directories in South Carolina did \nnot include African Americans in the regular alphabetical listing, but \nrather at the end of the book. An African American must maneuver these \ndistinctive nuances in order to conduct proper genealogical research. \nIn my own State of Louisiana, descendants of the 9th Cavalry Regiment \nand 25th Infantry Regiment, known as the Buffalo Soldiers, would have \nto know to look in the index of United States Colored Troops since \nthere is no mention of them in the index of State Military Regiments.\n  Abraham Lincoln said, ``A man who cares nothing about his past can \ncare little about his future.'' By providing $5 million for the \nNational Historical Publications and Records Commission to establish \nand maintain a national database, the SEARCH Act has the potential to \nsignificantly reduce the time and painstaking efforts of those African \nAmericans who truly care about their American past to contribute to the \nAmerican future. This bill also seeks to authorize $5 million for \nStates, colleges, and universities to preserve, catalogue, and index \nrecords locally.\n  In a democracy, records matter. The mission of NARA is to ensure that \nanyone can have access to the records that matter to them. The SEARCH \nAct of 2005 seeks to fulfill that mission by helping African Americans \nnavigate genealogical research sources and negotiate the unique \nchallenges that confront them in this process. No longer should any \nAmerican have to wait to learn information, which in itself can offer \nsuch freedom.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating the 140th \nanniversary of Juneteenth by passing this measure. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1248\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Bush stated on April 13, 2004 \n     that ``as a proud and independent people, Iraqis do not \n     support an indefinite occupation and neither does America'' \n     and that United States troops will remain in Iraq ``as long \n     as necessary and not one day more'';\n       Whereas a sound strategic plan for United States military \n     operations in Iraq would include information regarding the \n     numbers of Iraqi troops that must be effectively trained and \n     the amount of time that will be required to train them;\n       Whereas the President has declined to set out specific \n     goals for the United States military operations in Iraq or a \n     clear time frame for achieving such goals;\n       Whereas a clear plan and time frame for United States \n     military operations in Iraq would facilitate more responsible \n     budgeting for the costs of United States operations in Iraq; \n     and\n       Whereas confusion about the United States mission in Iraq \n     does not serve the United States vital interests in \n     establishing stability in Iraq or fighting the terrorist \n     networks that continue to threaten the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) supports the men and women of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States in Iraq and deeply appreciates their admirable \n     service; and\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\n       (B) recognizes that stability, democracy, and respect for \n     the rule of law in Iraq are in the United States national \n     interest; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the United States should remain committed to providing \n     long-term diplomatic and political support to the people of \n     Iraq to achieve stability and democracy;\n       (B) the United States should work diligently to accelerate \n     the sound and effective training of Iraqi security forces and \n     to increase international cooperation in this endeavor so \n     that the people of Iraq may assume responsibility for their \n     own security;\n       (C) the United States should continue to pursue a robust \n     and multi-faceted campaign to dismantle and defeat \n     international terrorist networks in Iraq and around the \n     world; and\n       (D) not later than 30 days after the date that the Senate \n     agrees to this resolution, the President should submit to \n     Congress a report that describes--\n       (i) the remaining mission of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States in Iraq;\n       (ii) current estimates of the time frame required for the \n     United States to achieve that mission, including information \n     regarding variables that could alter that time frame; and\n       (iii) a time frame for the subsequent withdrawal of United \n     States troops from Iraq.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I am submitting a resolution that \naddresses a gaping hole in the administration's rhetoric and strategy \nwith respect to Iraq. My resolution calls on the President to define \nthe mission of our military in Iraq, and to issue a plan and timeframe \nfor accomplishing that mission. It has been over 2 years since the \nPresident launched the war in Iraq, but we still don't have a defined \nmission or timeframe that would allow us to hold ourselves accountable \nfor giving the military the tools they need to succeed in achieving \nthose goals. My resolution also calls for a plan for the subsequent \nwithdrawal of U.S. troops, so that we can provide some clarity with \nregard to our intentions and restore confidence at home and abroad that \nthere is an end date in mind.\n  This resolution does not establish a timeframe for troop withdrawal--\nthat is for our military commanders to determine. Any such timeframe \nhas to be flexible--there are variables that will affect how quickly \nvarious missions can be accomplished. But it's hard to conceive of an \neffective strategic plan that isn't linked to some timetables.\n  The rationale for our military action in Iraq has changed over time. \nThe projections regarding the resources that would be required were \nwrong. And now we seem to be in the midst of some vague policy of \nmuddling through. When I speak to servicemen and women in Wisconsin and \nin Iraq, and when I speak to their families, their pride in their \nservice is evident and it is well-earned. But their frustration with \nthis open-ended commitment, with the stop-loss orders and the multiple \ndeployments, with the extensions and the uncertainties, is equally \nevident, and it is painful. We can do better by them, by insisting on \nclarity, by insisting on accountability, and by assuring them that we \nhave a plan with clear and achievable goals.\n  In fact, by leveling with the American people about our commitment in \nIraq, the administration can regain some of their confidence. After the \nshifting justifications for this war, after the premature declarations \nof ``mission accomplished,'' after the exciting and inspiring \nelections, we still don't have any kind of finish line for our military \nengagement in Iraq. The American people and our troops deserve a sound \nplan that is linked to real timeframes and real achievements.\n  A real timeframe will also help us achieve our security goals in \nIraq. The most common argument against clarifying how long we plan to \nkeep troops in Iraq goes something like this: If we reveal a timetable, \ninsurgents and terrorists will simply lie in wait, emerging in force to \nachieve their goals once we are gone.\n  But any responsible timetable for U.S. withdrawal would be based just \non the establishment of a competent Iraqi force. Americans won't leave \nuntil that force has the training it needs to succeed. An Iraqi force, \nwhich would not suffer from shortages of translators or struggle to \nbridge the cultural divide, is the right force to handle any resurgent \nthreat.\n  Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the administration's refusal to \nset a plan and timetable about just how long vast numbers of U.S. \ntroops will remain in Iraq is actually an advantage for insurgents and \nterrorists. This large U.S. military presence smack in the middle of \nthe Arab world is a major recruiting tool for international terrorist \nnetworks, and young men are coming to Iraq from around the world to get \non-the-job training in attacking Americans. These foreign forces are \nmotivated by our presence, and they feed off conspiracy theories and \nsuspicions regarding American intentions. When I was in Baghdad in \nFebruary, a very senior coalition officer confided to me that he \nbelieved a public U.S. timetable for withdrawing from Iraq would ``take \nthe wind out of the sails'' of the insurgents.\n  What's more, the indefinite presence of vast numbers of American \ntroops could also undercut the legitimacy of the Iraqi government in \nthe eyes of many--ironically, destabilizing Iraq despite our best \nintentions. Having a timetable for the transfer of sovereignty and \nhaving a timetable for Iraqi elections have resulted in real political \nand strategic advantages for the U.S. Having a timetable for the \nwithdrawal of troops should be no different.\n  Clear plans could also help lead to responsible budgeting. This \nadministration has bypassed the regular budget process, placing \nhundreds of billions of dollars on the country's tab, on the grounds \nthat requirements are simply ``unknowable'' and cannot be incorporated \ninto responsible budget planning. This is simply not credible, and \ncontinuing to mortgage our children's future with these irresponsible \npolicies is unacceptable. It is time to hold ourselves accountable for \nthe costs of this war, time to accept the tough choices that come with \nresponsible budgeting, and time to insist on sound planning and clarity \nabout all of this is going.\n  This resolution is not some kind of cut-and-run strategy, or a call \nto bring all of our troops home now, regardless of what remains to be \nachieved on the ground. It is clear to me that we still have military \nmissions on the ground--most notably, training the Iraqi forces to \nprovide for their own security. Moreover, a military response--as well \nas a diplomatic response, and a financial response--is vital in \ncombating terrorist networks in Iraq and elsewhere. It may well be that \nsome units--perhaps special forces--will be operating in Iraq in \ncoordination with the Iraqi military well into the future as part of \nthe counterterrorism strategy that we need to be pursuing around the \nworld, not just in Iraq.\n  But Mr. President, the military is only one part of solving the \npuzzle that we face in Iraq. For many years to come, we will have to \nwork diligently to combat a burgeoning culture of corruption in Iraq, \nor the rule of law doesn't stand a chance. We need to make \nreconstruction work and deliver real democracy dividends for the Iraqi \npeople, and this work will go on for some time. Intense American \ndiplomatic and political engagement and support are likely to continue \nlong after all or most of the troops are withdrawn.\n  Our troops on the ground are truly amazing in their resolve, their \nprofessionalism, and their sincere desire to help the people of Iraq. \nTheir courage and commitment was underscored for me during my trip to \nIraq earlier this year. I want to help these brave men and women \nsucceed, by insuring that they have an achievable mission, sound \nplanning, and a reasonable timeframe in which to finish their part of \nthe job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6495-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6495-S6496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 775.

Mr. President, I wish to take a couple of minutes to review \nfor my colleagues what has transpired over the last several days on the \npending matter of the nomination of John Bolton to be our ambassador to \nthe United Nations.\n  I know there has been a lot of talk about whether goalposts have been \nmoved in our efforts to resolve the outstanding matters concerning \ninformation which the Foreign Relations Committee seeks from the \nadministration regarding the Bolton nomination, information that will \nnot be shared with all Members of this body, but shared with the \nappropriate members of the Intelligence Committee and the chairman and \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  We have not been expanding the goalposts but, rather, shrinking them. \nI want to review what has happened since April 11, since the issue was \nfirst raised regarding the nomination of John Bolton.\n  There are two issues on which the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nseeks additional information. One has to do with 10 intercepts \ninvolving the names of 19 Americans that Mr. Bolton sought as the Under \nSecretary of State. We have tried since April 11, since the issue was \nraised on April 11, to have the appropriate members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee and the Intelligence Committee review those \nintercepts, much as Mr. Bolton did. The administration has refused to \nallow that to occur.\n  I then offered as a counterproposal, rather than the appropriate \nmembers looking at the intercepts, that at least the names of people we \nbelieve may be on those requests from Mr. Bolton be sent down to the \nadministration for them to review. If they are on the list, we would \nwant to pursue that a bit further to find out why Mr. Bolton sought \ninformation about them. If they are not, then that would end the \nmatter.\n  A second matter of equal importance is a request Senator Biden has \nmade, and that has to do with draft testimony before the Congress \nregarding Syria and the possibility of weapons of mass destruction \nbeing located in Syria.\n  Both requests are rather simple to comply with and should not take \nmuch time. But my colleagues on both sides ought to be aware that this \nis now a matter beyond the consideration of Mr. Bolton. Either the \nSenate has a right to receive pertinent and important information \nregarding this nomination or it does not.\n  Certainly my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know historically \nthat other Members have sought information from other administrations \nthey thought was critical to completing their task either on a matter \nof public policy or a nomination.\n  As I said earlier, we began on April 11. On April 14 of this year, \nquestions were submitted. Again on April 22. On April 29, Senator Biden \nwrote to the administration requesting information regarding Syria.\n  On May 4, Senator Lugar sent letters to Secretary Rice which implied \nthat she need not comply with all of the requests but certainly some of \nthem.\n  On May 18, Senator Biden sent a letter directly to Ambassador \nNegroponte requesting information regarding the intercepts; again on \nMay 26, on June 1, on June 2, on June 3, on June 8, on June 9, and as \nlate as today on June 14.\n  There has been a long effort to try and work out some compromise, \nincluding the request I made to Mr. Negroponte, to allow us to submit \nthe names. If John Negroponte reported back that there was no \ncorrelation between those names and the intercepts sought by Mr. \nBolton, then I was going to be satisfied with that answer.\n  It is ironic, in a way, that the administration is filibustering \ntheir own nominee.\n  I want to get to a vote on John Bolton. We can do it in 24 or 48 \nhours, in my view, by simply responding to the request we have made, in \nthe modified form we have made it, and responding to Senator Biden's \nrequest regarding the testimony on Syria. Both of those matters have \nbeen sought now for almost 2 months, and yet the administration \ncontinues to stonewall on those two requests.\n  I think it is important that the Senate be heard on these matters. I \nthink it is dangerous for us not to be. There is pertinent information \nthat could relate to the decisions by Senators to vote for or against \nthis nominee.\n  In short, we have reached out a hand of compromise to the \nadministration. And in response, the administration has given us the \nback of theirs. They have given us nothing--no counteroffer, just more \nstonewalling.\n  It is rather ironic that it is the administration that is \nfilibustering its own nominee.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, on May 26, just before the Memorial \nDay recess, the Senate, by a vote of 56 to 42, did not invoke cloture \non the motion to proceed to a vote on the nomination of John Bolton to \nthe position of United States Representative to the United Nations.\n  The reason that the Senate did not invoke cloture was that sufficient \nnumbers of our colleagues have supported the Foreign Relations \nCommittee's efforts to make sure that all relevant information has been \nmade available to the Senate related to this nomination before the \nSenate casts an up or down vote.\n  The administration has offered no rationale for refusing to provide \nthe NSA intercepts or the information about the consultant. With regard \nto the Syria documents, it has argued that they are not relevant to our \ninquiry. In other words, the administration is telling the Senate what \nit may investigate. It has also said that providing the information \nwill have a ``chilling effect'' on the deliberative process; yet the \ncommittee has already received numerous deliberative process materials.\n  The administration claims that they have already given the necessary \ninformation related to the intercepts request to the committee of \njurisdiction, namely the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  First, the Bolton nomination is within the jurisdiction of the \nForeign Relations Committee, not the Intelligence Committee.\n  Second, we know from Senators Roberts and Rockefeller that General \nHayden refused to provide them with the very names that Mr. Bolton and \nMr. Bolton's staff were allowed to see.\n  Moreover, in a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Rockefeller stated that Mr. Bolton \nmay have shared the NSA intercepts with others at State without prior \nauthorization from NSA.\n  So to be clear, Mr. Bolton was apparently free to share this unedited \ninformation with members of his staff, but the chairman and ranking \nmembers of the Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees have been \ndenied access to this same information.\n  I also want my colleagues to understand that the areas of inquiry \nthat the committee is pursuing were not dreamt up by us last night or \nlast week. The administration has been aware for some time what we were \nseeking and how strongly we felt about these materials being provided.\n  Let me lay out the chronology of our requests.\n  On April 11, during the first hearing on Mr. Bolton, that I first \nraised questions about the NSA intercepts.\n  On April 14, I submitted a question for the record inquiring about \nthis Issue.\n  On April 22, I sent a letter directly to the NSA requesting this \ninformation.\n  On April 29, Senator Biden sent a letter, which also requested the \ninformation related to Syria.\n  On May 4, Senator Lugar sent a letter to Secretary Rice which implied \nthat she should not feel obligated to respond to all of the Committee's \nrequests.\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\n  On May 18, Senator Biden sent a letter directly to Ambassador \nNegroponte, our new Director of National Intelligence, requesting these \nNSA intercepts.\n  On May 26, he sent a second letter to Negroponte, again making the \nsame request.\n  On June 1, I called Ambassador Negroponte to offer a proposal for \nresolving the intercept issue.\n  On June 2, I sent a letter to Ambassador Negroponte which laid out in \nwriting the June 1 verbal proposal.\n  On June 3, Ambassador Negroponte called me to say, ``no deal.''\n  On June 8, Senator Roberts approached me and suggested that pursuing \nmy idea of a giving a list of names to the administration might bear \nfruit. He also proposed a role for the Select Committee on Intelligence \nin the process. That seemed reasonable to me. After consultation with \nSenator Biden he did, too.\n  On June 9, Senator Biden and I sent a letter laying out our \nunderstanding on how names might be provided to the administration, and \nwhat the role for the chair and cochair might be in the process.\n  On June 14, Senator Roberts replied in writing to our letter saying \nhe could not support our proposal. I would add that our colleague \nSenator Rockefeller has said he believes our proposal is eminently \nreasonable.\n  Through all of this, no one from the White House has contacted me or \nmy colleague Senator Biden to offer any proposal for moving this \nprocess along.\n  In short, the administration has made no effort to meet Senator Biden \nand me halfway or even one-quarter of the way. The answer is either no \nor even worse, silence.\n  I ask my colleagues: If there is nothing in all of these documents, \nwhy have they not been provided? If there is nothing in them, then \nsurely, providing them would clear up some of our concerns rather \nquickly. And make it possible to move forward with an up or down vote \non the nomination.\n  And so if there is culpability for the delay in the Senate's \nconsideration of the Bolton nomination, that culpability rests with the \nBush administration. They have the ability to unlock this nomination by \ncooperating with this Senate as they did during the consideration of \nnominations during President Bush's first term in office.\n  I stand ready to listen to any proposal from the administration to \nresolve this matter. I know my colleague Senator Biden does as well. \nBut the institutional prerogatives of the Senate are at stake here, and \nI believe we have the responsibility of protecting those prerogatives \nfor this Congress and future Congresses. I am pleased and grateful that \nsufficient numbers of our colleagues appear to feel the same way.\n  I hope all Senators, regardless of whether they believe John Bolton \nwill be a great man at the United Nations or not, realize this is a \nmatter of constitutional equity. Either the Senate, as a coequal branch \nof Government, has the right to request and receive through appropriate \nMembers and appropriate committees pertinent information relating to a \ncritical nomination or not, and if we do not, then I think this body \nsuffers in its ability to perform its constitutional duties.\n  That is what we are requesting. It can be satisfied in a matter of \nhours, and then the Senate, as a body, can vote up or down on John \nBolton to send him to the U.N. or not send him to the U.N. But to \nstonewall this institution on information we have a right to receive I \nthink is wrong and I think it jeopardizes the relationship between the \nSenate and the White House.\n  My hope is the White House will respond to the modified requests we \nhave made so we can get about the business of voting on this nomination \nand moving to other matters before the Senate.\n  I thank my colleagues from Iowa and Illinois for being generous with \ntheir time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6590-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6590-S6595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is, indeed, an exciting time and \nmoment. We have an 8-billion-gallon national renewable fuel standard \nthat is going to be part of the Senate Energy bill. A previous bill I \nsponsored with Senator Lugar and 18 other Senators serves as much of \nthe basis for what we now have before us. This amendment takes us a \nbold step closer to improving the Nation's energy security, domestic \nand farm economy, and our environment.\n  To say we have a growing problem with energy in this country is an \nunderstatement. Today, about 97 percent of our transportation fuel \ncomes from oil, two-thirds of that from foreign sources. This excessive \ndependence on petroleum undermines our national security, as we all \nknow, and it reeks havoc on consumers who are now dealing with record-\nhigh gasoline prices. Our policy today costs us jobs. There are 27,000 \nlost U.S. jobs for every $1 billion in imported oil. Our present policy \ndamages our environment with fully one-third of the greenhouse gases \nnow coming from vehicle emissions alone.\n  And the truth is, the problem is not going away, it is only getting \nworse.\n  Right now we are importing 60 percent of our oil from foreign \ncountries. That percent is expected to increase, not decrease, to about \n70 percent by 2025.\n  According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, America spends \n$200,000 per minute on foreign oil, or $13 million an hour. And more \nthan $25 billion goes to the Persian Gulf imports alone. A study by the \nDepartment of Energy found that our dependency on oil from unsteady \nregimes outside our borders has cost the country an astonishing $7 \ntrillion over the last 30 years, measured in current dollars.\n  If these figures are not disturbing enough, here is one more. \nAccording to the National Defense Council Foundation, the economic \npenalties of America's oil dependence are between $297 billion to $304 \nbillion annually.\n  The Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, using this data, \ncalculated the hidden costs at the gas pump. Everyone thinks we are \npaying around--I heard my friend from New York say in New York the \nprice of gas is $2.25, in Iowa it is around $2.03, $2.05, and around \nhere it is about $2.10 a gallon. That is what we think we are paying. \nBut the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, using the data \nabout the hidden costs, has determined that the real cost of a gallon \nof gas at the pump is more than $7 a gallon. A typical tankful of gas \nreally would cost more than $140.\n  What are those hidden costs? Add up what we are spending in the \nmilitary alone in the Mideast and you come pretty close to the figure.\n  We have a choice. We can stand by, feed our addiction to foreign oil, \nor we can make a decisive shift now toward clean domestic renewable \nfuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. This will allow us to wean the \nU.S. economy from its dangerous level of dependence on foreign oil that \nis a clear and present danger to our economy and national security.\n  The renewable fuels standard will more than double the amount of \nethanol and biodiesel in our fuel supply by 2012. It will firmly commit \nour Nation to clean, secure, diversified sources of domestic energy, \nnot in some distant future but immediately in the years ahead.\n  Domestic ethanol production grew 21 percent in 2004 to more than 3.4 \nbillion gallons. I might just add, ethanol was introduced seamlessly in \nCalifornia and New York, where it helped to buffer rising crude oil \nprices.\n  I know my good friend from New York had to leave, but I have since \nfound out that right now there are two large production ethanol plants \nplanned for construction in the State of New York; two big ones, one \nthat is 100 million gallons a year, the other a bit smaller, being \nconstructed right now in New York and more to come online later on.\n  Why is that? Because the technology is developing at a rapid pace to \nproduce ethanol, not just from corn or sugar but from underutilized \nmaterials such as cornstalks, wood waste, cellulosic material, all \nkinds of biomass feedstocks.\n  So what we are doing makes sense. With an 8-billion-gallon renewable \nfuels standard, we establish a strong floor for the time frame under \nconsideration. The fact is, we will have no trouble whatsoever \nproducing enough ethanol to meet this standard. As I said, the industry \nalready has the capacity to produce nearly 4 billion gallons of ethanol \na year.\n  I will be frank. A lot of this does come from my State of Iowa. We \nlead\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\nthe Nation in biofuels production. I am proud of that. I am proud of \nthe fact that 11 of the 16 ethanol plants in my State are predominantly \nowned by farmers. We have biodiesel plants as well. Biofuels plants are \nbeing built in many other places, too, but also in my State.\n  These farmer-owned biofuels plants are adding value to our rural \neconomies. According to a recent study, each typical ethanol plant \ncreates 700 jobs, expands the local economic base by more than $140 \nmillion, and provides an average 13-percent annual return on investment \nover 10 years to a farmer investor.\n  Iowa's 16 ethanol plants and 3 biodiesel plants, with more on the \nway, serve as local engines of economic growth. Our ethanol plants are \nexpected to contribute $4 billion annually to the State's economy once \nall are in production, with more than 5,000 direct and indirect jobs. \nOnce all of the plants are online, the industry will utilize about 500 \nmillion bushels of Iowa corn each year.\n  That was just for Iowa. Nationally, this renewable fuels standard is \nexpected to create over 200,000 new jobs and add nearly $200 billion to \nour gross domestic product. Within 10 years, this standard will replace \nmore than 3 billion barrels of foreign oil, more to reduce import \ndependence over this time than the economically recoverable oil in the \nAlaska National Wildlife Refuge, before production even begins there.\n  I say again to my friend from New York, there is a choice. We can \ncontinue to spend our money--approximately $25 billion a year--in the \nPersian Gulf, or we can start spending it at home, not just in Iowa but \nin Georgia, New York, Illinois, and all over this country, where we are \ngoing to see these plants being built.\n  So we know that renewable fuels are good products. We know we can \nmeet the demand. We know that it will help us in a lot of ways.\n  The Consumer Federation of America came out with a study just a month \nago that found consumers could save as much as 8 cents per gallon if \nmore ethanol were blended into the Nation's fuel supply. Well, I bet my \nfriend's moms who are driving kids to school, as he mentioned, would \nlike to save 8 cents per gallon as they buy their gasoline.\n  A story in the New York Times over the weekend reported that \nconsumers in my home State of Iowa are saving up to 10 cents per gallon \nwith ethanol blended gasoline. I will bet consumers in other States \nwould like to have that same savings.\n  I have heard one other comment made about this renewable fuels issue \nsaying it is going to be bad for the environment. That is not true. \nFirst, it is renewable. It is made from homegrown renewable materials, \nnot pumped out of wells half a world away and shipped to us. When is \nthe last time one ever heard about an ethanol spill killing birds, \nmarine life, or polluting coastlines? The answer is never, and it never \nwill happen because ethanol is nontoxic and it is biodegradable.\n  Here is something else that my colleagues hear a lot about, that it \ntakes more energy to produce it then is gotten out of it. Again, \nnonsense. Ethanol is energy efficient. Every 100 Btus of energy used to \nproduce ethanol--that includes the planting, the harvesting, the \ncultivating, the processing--yields 135 Btus of ethanol. So 100 Btus \nin, 135 out. By comparison, the same 100 Btus of energy used in the \ntransportation, shipping, and refining of oil yields only 85 Btus in \ngasoline.\n  Someone might ask: Well, why is that? Very simply, sunlight is free. \nThe rain is free. These things grow. Sunlight and nature are being used \nas free assets to get ethanol. So just from an energy efficiency \nstandpoint, we ought to be moving ahead aggressively.\n  Lastly, my friend also said something about emissions. Well, the fact \nis ethanol reduces key emissions such as carbon monoxide, particulates \nthat cause smog. In a recent study by the Argonne National Lab, ethanol \nwas found to significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions, the main gas \ncontributing to global warming.\n\n  A lot of people in this body want to address the issue of climate \nchange. Yet some fail to see how biofuels are an essential component of \nany greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy. Keep in mind, when \nethanol is burned, is carbon dioxide being put out there? Yes, it is. \nSo you might say that adds to greenhouse gases, but keep in mind, that \nthe corn plant or that tree or whatever it is that is grown that one \ngets the ethanol out of, it is taking carbon dioxide out of the air. \nNot true of the oil that is pumped out of the ground. It puts carbon \ndioxide into the air but never takes it out. That is why renewable \nfuels are so important for our environment. Yes, it would put carbon \ndioxide in the air, but as it grows, using that sunlight and rain to \ngrow, it takes carbon dioxide out.\n  The renewable fuels standard is sound public policy. It is a key part \nof any plan to wean our Nation off of foreign oil. Contrary to what my \nfriend from New York said--I am sorry he had to leave--there is a \nbuilt-in flexibility through a system of tradable credits for oil \nrefiners who exceed their minimum requirement. It includes waiver \nlanguage from the requirements of the renewable fuels standard for a \nregion or a State if circumstances warrant it. It rewards production of \nemerging biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol that provide tremendous \nvalue to our country, our farmers, and the environment.\n  Again, these and other provisions are all in the renewable fuels \nstandard amendment that is being offered to the energy bill. That is \nwhy it is so important that we keep the standard in there, that we move \nahead, wean ourselves off of Persian Gulf oil, clean up the \nenvironment, and put the money in this country. Let us spend our money \ndeveloping energy in America rather than over in the Persian Gulf.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized for up to 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me thank my colleague from Iowa. He and I have \nsomething in common: We are interested in alcohol fuels, ethanol and \ndiesel. We understand these are homegrown. You don't have to wait for \nthe OPEC cartel to decide to send them to you. We grow the corn in the \nfield, and one out of every six bushels of corn that is grown in \nAmerica creates ethanol, alcohol fuel.\n  Earlier, my colleague and friend from New York was talking about, \nWhat could this possibly mean to farmers? He doesn't understand the \nmechanics of the market. More demand raises prices. Demand for corn to \nuse it to create ethanol and alcohol fuels will help farmers. As \nfarmers receive higher prices for their corn, there are lower payments \nin the Federal programs. The taxpayers are going to benefit as well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What the Senator from New York failed to note--and I was \nabout to interrupt him, but since I live with him, I interrupt him all \nthe time--I just live with him in Washington, incidentally; there is a \nfamily situation otherwise. What I was going to remind him was when \nthese trucks are coming in with ethanol into New York and getting \nstalled in traffic and burning up their fuel, if they have ethanol in \ntheir tanks, there is less pollution in his beautiful New York City. So \nwe have another added benefit here--not just more income for farmers \nand less in payments by taxpayers for farm programs but cleaner air and \nless dependence on foreign oil.\n  I hope Senator Harkin and I can take this on as a class project, to \ntry to work on Senator Schumer from New York. He is a very delightful \nman and does a great job for his State, but he needs some very \nfundamental education on corn and ethanol and what it means for \nAmerica.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I join with the Senator. We will do a little educating \nfor him.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is probably a task we should not undertake because \nit is momentous, but we will try anyway. This is the Energy bill. It is \na big bill, as you can tell. I sat down and did something kind of \nunique: I decided to read it, just to decide what we are voting on. I \ndon't say that entirely in a negative fashion because some of this is \nso technical, you need to have staff go through and figure out exactly \nwhat is happening in this bill.\n  The one thing that is most important about this bill is not the fact \nthat Senator Domenici of New Mexico has worked so hard on it with \nSenator Bingaman and done such a good job on a bipartisan basis to \nbring it to us. That is a positive thing, and I complimented Senator \nDomenici about it\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\nearlier. What is troubling about this bill is it is setting out to \nestablish:\n\n     the enhancement of the energy security of the United States.\n\n  Since it is setting out to establish America's energy policy, you \nwould think to yourself, How do most Americans come in contact with \nenergy each day? Certainly when you flip the lights on in the morning \nor in the evening, you come in contact with electricity, but equally \nso, when you get into that car or into that truck or on that bus, you \nare in contact with the energy policy of America.\n  If that is an important part of our life experience with energy, if \nover 60 percent of all the oil we bring into the United States is used \nto fuel vehicles, trucks and cars, you would just assume that a large \npart of this bill of almost 800 pages must be devoted to the whole \nquestion of the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks. Isn't that obvious? \nWouldn't that be one of the first things?\n  Sadly, you are going to have to search long and hard to find any \nreference in here to the fuel economy and fuel efficiency of cars and \ntrucks in America. The question I have asked over and over again is, \nHow can you have an honest energy policy for America and not talk about \nthat? How can you really have a policy that reduces our dependence on \nforeign oil if we do not talk about more fuel-efficient cars and \ntrucks--more conservation?\n  I don't think you can. The only provision in this bill that addresses \nthat, in the most indirect and oblique way, says that over the next 10 \nyears, we will reduce the demand for oil in America by 1 million \nbarrels a day. That is a good thing. I support that. It doesn't spell \nout how we will do it. Frankly, it doesn't reflect the ambition we \nshould have in putting together this bill because we can do better. We \ncan do a lot better.\n  Tomorrow, Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington is going to offer the \namendment from the Democratic side about energy policy. It is our lead \namendment. The reason it is our lead amendment is we believe it gets to \nthe heart of the question. Here is what we believe in our Democratic \nSenate caucus. We think we should add to this bill language which says: \nOver the next 20 years, we will reduce our dependence on foreign oil in \nAmerica by 40 percent.\n  Frankly, I think we can do better, but we establish a standard of 40 \npercent. Today, 58 percent of all of the oil that we burn each day in \nAmerica comes from overseas--58 percent. Unchecked, unchanged, it is \nestimated that in 20 years, it will be 68 percent. More than two out of \nevery three barrels of oil will be imported into the United States.\n  If the Democratic amendment is adopted--and I hope it is, on a \nbipartisan basis--if we reduce the foreign imports by 40 percent over \nthe next 20 years, the number will go from 58 percent to 56 percent. \nThat is still too high, but to do nothing means that our dependence on \nforeign oil will grow.\n  Depending on foreign oil means depending on the people who own it. I \ndo not want my future, the future of my children or grandchildren, in \nthe hands of the Saudi Royal Family. That is what their future will be \ntied to--in a world where there will be even more competition over OPEC \noil.\n\n  You cannot pick up a magazine or an article anywhere that does not \nrefer to the growth of China and its economy. They are just sucking \naway jobs from America, to paraphrase Ross Perot, and creating new \nopportunities for jobs in a country that is deficient in energy. So \nthey are looking all over the world to find where they can import gas \nand oil so they can fuel the growing Chinese economy.\n  What it means, of course, is China will be our competitor for that \noil in the years to come. If we do not take care to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, we will find ourselves in a predicament even \nworse than today, where the cost of oil will be increasing because of \nincreased demand for limited resources, and our dependence will be \nincreasing at the same time. What a recipe for economic disaster in \nAmerica.\n  I will tell you one thing that is troubling. Remember the only \nprovision in this bill related to fuel efficiency that I mentioned \nearlier that wants to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by a million \nbarrels a day? We just got an official statement from the Bush White \nHouse today--they oppose that provision. They want to take it out of \nthe bill. That is the only provision in the bill relative to fuel \nefficiency and fuel economy, and they want to have it taken out of the \nbill.\n  This is the same administration that does not concede the fact that \nthere is global warming, the same administration which last week had to \ndismiss a man who was doctoring environmental documents and statements \nto make it look as if there is no threat of global warming. This same \nadministration says they want to take out the only provision in the \nbill that would move us toward less dependence on foreign oil. What are \nthey thinking? This is the leadership in the White House?\n  The President can walk, literally hand in hand, with a Saudi prince \nat his ranch in Texas, but does America want to walk hand in hand with \na Saudi prince for the next 20 years? Not me--no. I want to see us move \ntoward energy independence. It is not likely we will reach it in its \nentirety in my lifetime, but don't we owe it to future generations to \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil?\n  Which moves me to a second topic, which is related. That dependence \non foreign oil draws us into a lot of predicaments around the world. \nAsk the 150,000 American soldiers in Iraq today. Ask whether we would \nbe as focused as we are on the Middle East and its stability if we were \nnot dependent on those oil tankers every single day leaving that \nArabian peninsula, the Arabian area, coming into the United States with \nthis oil we need so desperately. I do not think it is likely we would \nbe there with that much intensity of feeling. But we are there.\n  Because of our dependence on foreign oil, we have been drawn into a \nconflict, now more than 2 years in length, with no end in sight. I was \none of 23 Senators who voted against the Use of Force Resolution that \nauthorized President Bush to invade Iraq. That was not because I had \nany sympathy for Saddam Hussein--I never have had--but because I \nbelieved this administration had misled the American people about the \nreal threat in Iraq. It turns out afterward we were misled, there were \nno weapons of mass destruction, no nuclear weapons, no connection with \n9/11. It turns out the threats we were told existed did not exist. The \nAmerican people were misled.\n  Sadly, this administration took the best military in the world and \ninvaded Iraq and very quickly made short order of Saddam Hussein and \nhis troops but didn't know what to do next. They won the war. They \ncouldn't figure out how to win the peace. And we still pay the heaviest \npossible price every single day because of their lack of preparedness.\n  Think about it. Over the weekend, the number of American soldiers \nkilled in Iraq in combat now has reached about 1,700--1,700 of our sons \nand daughters have given their lives in Iraq, with no end in \nsight. Soldiers sent into battle by an administration which has \nreceived every penny they have asked for from Congress to supply our \ntroops. Soldiers sent into battle, killed, still today, in unarmored \nhumvees. Soldiers without body armor. Soldiers without the proper \nequipment.\n\n  I have been there. I have seen it. I have heard it. I have talked to \nthese soldiers. I know a few weeks ago in Iraq this was the case. That, \nto me, is a tragedy and a travesty.\n  What is also troubling is that this Congress is afraid to even ask \nthe hard questions of this administration. When was the last time we \nhad a serious hearing on Capitol Hill about the contract abuses of \nHalliburton in Iraq? We will have to search the Congressional Record \nlong and hard to find there has not been such a hearing. We do not get \ninto that issue. When was the last time we had a hearing on Capitol \nHill about the serious problems we are having in recruiting new \nsoldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen? That is a big problem. The best \nmilitary in the world needs the best men and women. Why is it they will \nnot join the ranks to fight in this war in Iraq and Afghanistan? That \nis worth a hearing, isn't it? We are still waiting for it.\n  There will be a hearing tomorrow--and I commend the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Senator Arlen Specter--to discuss some of \nthe basic issues about a very serious problem that we face.\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\n  Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion in recent days \nabout whether to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. This \ndebate misses the point. It is not a question of whether detainees are \nheld at Guantanamo Bay or some other location. The question is how we \nshould treat those who have been detained there. Whether we treat them \naccording to the law or not does not depend on their address. It \ndepends on our policy as a nation.\n  How should we treat them? This is not a new question. We are not \nwriting on a blank slate. We have entered into treaties over the years, \nsaying this is how we will treat wartime detainees. The United States \nhas ratified these treaties. They are the law of the land as much as \nany statute we passed. They have served our country well in past wars. \nWe have held ourselves to be a civilized country, willing to play by \nthe rules, even in time of war.\n  Unfortunately, without even consulting Congress, the Bush \nadministration unilaterally decided to set aside these treaties and \ncreate their own rules about the treatment of prisoners.\n  Frankly, this Congress has failed to hold the administration \naccountable for its failure to follow the law of the land when it comes \nto the torture and mistreatment of prisoners and detainees.\n  I am a member of the Judiciary Committee. For two years, I have asked \nfor hearings on this issue. I am glad Chairman Specter will hold a \nhearing on wartime detention policies tomorrow. I thank him for taking \nthis step. I wish other members of his party would be willing to hold \nthis administration accountable as well.\n  It is worth reflecting for a moment about how we have reached this \npoint. Many people who read history remember, as World War II began \nwith the attack on Pearl Harbor, a country in fear after being attacked \ndecided one way to protect America was to gather together Japanese \nAmericans and literally imprison them, put them in internment camps for \nfear they would be traitors and turn on the United States. We did that. \nThousands of lives were changed. Thousands of businesses destroyed. \nThousands of people, good American citizens, who happened to be of \nJapanese ancestry, were treated like common criminals.\n  It took almost 40 years for us to acknowledge that we were wrong, to \nadmit that these people should never have been imprisoned. It was a \nshameful period in American history and one that very few, if any, try \nto defend today.\n  I believe the torture techniques that have been used at Abu Ghraib \nand Guantanamo and other places fall into that same category. I am \nconfident, sadly confident, as I stand here, that decades from now \npeople will look back and say: What were they thinking? America, this \ngreat, kind leader of a nation, treated people who were detained and \nimprisoned, interrogated people in the crudest way? I am afraid this is \ngoing to be one of the bitter legacies of the invasion of Iraq.\n  We were attacked on September 11, 2001. We were clearly at war.\n  We have held prisoners in every armed conflict in which we have \nengaged. The law was clear, but some of the President's top advisers \nquestioned whether we should follow it or whether we should write new \nstandards.\n  Alberto Gonzales, then-White House chief counsel, recommended to the \nPresident the Geneva Convention should not apply to the war on \nterrorism.\n  Colin Powell, who was then Secretary of State, objected strenuously \nto Alberto Gonzales' conclusions. I give him credit. Colin Powell \nargued that we could effectively fight the war on terrorism and still \nfollow the law, still comply with the Geneva Conventions. In a memo to \nAlberto Gonzales, Secretary Powell pointed out the Geneva Conventions \nwould not limit our ability to question the detainees or hold them even \nindefinitely. He pointed out that under Geneva Conventions, members of \nal-Qaida and other terrorists would not be considered prisoners of war.\n  There is a lot of confusion about that so let me repeat it. The \nGeneva Conventions do not give POW status to terrorists.\n  In his memo to Gonzales, Secretary Powell went on to say setting \naside the Geneva Conventions ``will reverse over a century of U.S. \npolicy and practice . . . and undermine the protections of the law of \nwar for our own troops . . . It will undermine public support among \ncritical allies, making military cooperation more difficult to \nsustain.''\n\n  When you look at the negative publicity about Guantanamo, Secretary \nColin Powell was prophetic.\n  Unfortunately, the President rejected Secretary Powell's wise \ncounsel, and instead accepted Alberto Gonzales' recommendation, issuing \na memo setting aside the Geneva Conventions and concluding that we \nneeded ``new thinking in the law of war.''\n  After the President decided to ignore Geneva Conventions, the \nadministration unilaterally created a new detention policy. They claim \nthe right to seize anyone, including even American citizens, anywhere \nin the world, including in the United States, and hold them until the \nend of the war on terrorism, whenever that may be.\n  For example, they have even argued in court they have the right to \nindefinitely detain an elderly lady from Switzerland who writes checks \nto what she thinks is a charity that helps orphans but actually is a \nfront that finances terrorism.\n  They claim a person detained in the war on terrorism has no legal \nrights--no right to a lawyer, no right to see the evidence against \nthem, no right to challenge their detention. In fact, the Government \nhas claimed detainees have no right to challenge their detention, even \nif they claim they were being tortured or executed.\n  This violates the Geneva Conventions, which protect everyone captured \nduring wartime.\n  The official commentary on the convention states:\n\n       Nobody in enemy hands can fall outside the law.\n\n  That is clear as it can be. But it was clearly rejected by the Bush \nadministration when Alberto Gonzales as White House counsel recommended \notherwise.\n  U.S. military lawyers called this detention system ``a legal black \nhole.'' The Red Cross concluded, ``U.S. authorities have placed the \ninternees in Guantanamo beyond the law.''\n  Using their new detention policy, the administration has detained \nthousands of individuals in secret detention centers all around the \nworld, some of them unknown to Members of Congress. While it is the \nmost well-known, Guantanamo Bay is only one of them. Most have been \ncaptured in Afghanistan and Iraq, but some people who never raised arms \nagainst us have been taken prisoner far from the battlefield.\n  Who are the Guantanamo detainees? Back in 2002, Secretary Rumsfeld \ndescribed them as ``the hardest of the hard core.'' However, the \nadministration has since released many of them, and it has now become \nclear that Secretary Rumsfeld's assertion was not completely true.\n  Military sources, according to the media, indicate that many \ndetainees have no connection to al-Qaida or the Taliban and were sent \nto Guantanamo over the objections of intelligence personnel who \nrecommended their release. One military officer said:\n\n       We're basically condemning these guys to a long-term \n     imprisonment. If they weren't terrorists before, they \n     certainly could be now.\n\n  Last year, in two landmark decisions, the Supreme Court rejected the \nadministration's detention policy. The Court held that the detainees' \nclaims that they were detained for over two years without charge and \nwithout access to counsel ``unquestionably describe custody in \nviolation of the Constitution, or laws or treaties of the United \nStates.''\n  The Court also held that an American citizen held as an enemy \ncombatant must be told the basis for his detention and have a fair \nopportunity to challenge the Government's claims. Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor wrote for the majority:\n\n       A state of war is not a blank check for the President when \n     it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.\n\n  You would think that would be obvious, wouldn't you? But yet, this \nadministration, in this war, has viewed it much differently.\n  I had hoped the Supreme Court decision would change the \nadministration policy. Unfortunately, the administration has resisted \ncomplying with the Supreme Court's decision.\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\n  The administration acknowledges detainees can challenge their \ndetention in court, but it still claims that once they get to court, \nthey have no legal rights. In other words, the administration believes \na detainee can get to the courthouse door but cannot come inside.\n  A Federal court has already held the administration has failed to \ncomply with the Supreme Court's rulings. The court concluded that the \ndetainees do have legal rights, and the administration's policies \n``deprive the detainees of sufficient notice of the factual bases for \ntheir detention and deny them a fair opportunity to challenge their \nincarceration.''\n  The administration also established a new interrogation policy that \nallows cruel and inhuman interrogation techniques.\n  Remember what Secretary of State Colin Powell said? It is not a \nmatter of following the law because we said we would, it is a matter of \nhow our troops will be treated in the future. That is something often \noverlooked here. If we want standards of civilized conduct to be \napplied to Americans captured in a warlike situation, we have to extend \nthe same manner and type of treatment to those whom we detain, our \nprisoners.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld approved numerous abusive interrogation tactics \nagainst prisoners in Guantanamo. The Red Cross concluded that the use \nof those methods was ``a form of torture.''\n  The United States, which each year issues a human rights report, \nholding the world accountable for outrageous conduct, is engaged in the \nsame outrageous conduct when it comes to these prisoners.\n  Numerous FBI agents who observed interrogations at Guantanamo Bay \ncomplained to their supervisors. In one e-mail that has been made \npublic, an FBI agent complained that interrogators were using ``torture \ntechniques.''\n  That phrase did not come from a reporter or politician. It came from \nan FBI agent describing what Americans were doing to these prisoners.\n  With no input from Congress, the administration set aside our treaty \nobligations and secretly created new rules for detention and \ninterrogation. They claim the courts have no right to review these \nrules. But under our Constitution, it is Congress's job to make the \nlaws, and the court's job to judge whether they are constitutional.\n  This administration wants all the power: legislator, executive, and \njudge. Our founding father were warned us about the dangers of the \nExecutive Branch violating the separation of powers during wartime. \nJames Madison wrote:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and \n     judiciary, in the same hands may justly be pronounced the \n     very definition of tyranny.\n\n  Other Presidents have overreached during times of war, claiming \nlegislative powers, but the courts have reined them back in. During the \nKorean war, President Truman, faced with a steel strike, issued an \nExecutive order to seize and operate the Nation's steel mills. The \nSupreme Court found that the seizure was an unconstitutional \ninfringement on the Congress's lawmaking power. Justice Hugo Black, \nwriting for the majority, said:\n\n       The Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who \n     shall make the laws which the President is to execute . . . \n     The Founders of this Nation entrusted the lawmaking power to \n     the Congress alone in both good times and bad.\n\n  To win the war on terrorism, we must remain true to the principles \nupon which our country was founded. This Administration's detention and \ninterrogation policies are placing our troops at risk and making it \nharder to combat terrorism.\n  Former Congressman Pete Peterson of Florida, a man I call a good \nfriend and a man I served with in the House of Representatives, is a \nunique individual. He is one of the most cheerful people you would ever \nwant to meet. You would never know, when you meet him, he was an Air \nForce pilot taken prisoner of war in Vietnam and spent 6\\1/2\\ years in \na Vietnamese prison. Here is what he said about this issue in a letter \nthat he sent to me. Pete Peterson wrote:\n\n       From my 6\\1/2\\ years of captivity in Vietnam, I know what \n     life in a foreign prison is like. To a large degree, I credit \n     the Geneva Conventions for my survival. . . . This is one \n     reason the United States has led the world in upholding \n     treaties governing the status and care of enemy prisoners: \n     because these standards also protect us. . . . We need \n     absolute clarity that America will continue to set the gold \n     standard in the treatment of prisoners in wartime.\n\n  Abusive detention and interrogation policies make it much more \ndifficult to win the support of people around the world, particularly \nthose in the Muslim world. The war on terrorism is not a popularity \ncontest, but anti-American sentiment breeds sympathy for anti-American \nterrorist organizations and makes it far easier for them to recruit \nyoung terrorists.\n  Polls show that Muslims have positive attitudes toward the American \npeople and our values. However, overall, favorable ratings toward the \nUnited States and its Government are very low. This is driven largely \nby the negative attitudes toward the policies of this administration.\n  Muslims respect our values, but we must convince them that our \nactions reflect these values. That's why the \n9/11 Commission recommended:\n\n       We should offer an example of moral leadership in the \n     world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule \n     of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors.\n\n  What should we do? Imagine if the President had followed Colin \nPowell's advice and respected our treaty obligations. How would things \nhave been different?\n  We still would have the ability to hold detainees and to interrogate \nthem aggressively. Members of al-Qaida would not be prisoners of war. \nWe would be able to do everything we need to do to keep our country \nsafe. The difference is, we would not have damaged our reputation in \nthe international community in the process.\n  When you read some of the graphic descriptions of what has occurred \nhere--I almost hesitate to put them in the Record, and yet they have to \nbe added to this debate. Let me read to you what one FBI agent saw. And \nI quote from his report:\n\n       On a couple of occasions, I entered interview rooms to find \n     a detainee chained hand and foot in a fetal position to the \n     floor, with no chair, food or water. Most times they urinated \n     or defecated on themselves, and had been left there for 18-24 \n     hours or more. On one occasion, the air conditioning had been \n     turned down so far and the temperature was so cold in the \n     room, that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold. . . \n     . On another occasion, the [air conditioner] had been turned \n     off, making the temperature in the unventilated room well \n     over 100 degrees. The detainee was almost unconscious on the \n     floor, with a pile of hair next to him. He had apparently \n     been literally pulling his hair out throughout the night. On \n     another occasion, not only was the temperature unbearably \n     hot, but extremely loud rap music was being played in the \n     room, and had been since the day before, with the detainee \n     chained hand and foot in the fetal position on the tile \n     floor.\n\n  If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was an FBI agent \ndescribing what Americans had done to prisoners in their control, you \nwould most certainly believe this must have been done by Nazis, Soviets \nin their gulags, or some mad regime--Pol Pot or others--that had no \nconcern for human beings. Sadly, that is not the case. This was the \naction of Americans in the treatment of their prisoners.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is not too late. I hope we will learn from history. I \nhope we will change course. The President could declare the United \nStates will apply the Geneva Conventions to the war on terrorism. He \ncould declare, as he should, that the United States will not, under any \ncircumstances, subject any detainee to torture, or cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment. The administration could give all detainees a \nmeaningful opportunity to challenge their detention before a neutral \ndecisionmaker.\n  Such a change of course would dramatically improve our image and it \nwould make us safer. I hope this administration will choose that \ncourse. If they do not, Congress must step in.\n  The issue debated in the press today misses the point. The issue is \nnot about closing Guantanamo Bay. It is not a question of the address \nof these prisoners. It is a question of how we treat these prisoners. \nTo close down Guantanamo and ship these prisoners off to\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\nundisclosed locations in other countries, beyond the reach of \npublicity, beyond the reach of any surveillance, is to give up on the \nmost basic and fundamental commitment to justice and fairness, a \ncommitment we made when we signed the Geneva Convention and said the \nUnited States accepts it as the law of the land, a commitment which we \nhave made over and over again when it comes to the issue of torture. To \ncriticize the rest of the world for using torture and to turn a blind \neye to what we are doing in this war is wrong, and it is not American.\n\n  During the Civil War, President Lincoln, one of our greatest \nPresidents, suspended habeas corpus, which gives prisoners the right to \nchallenge their detention. The Supreme Court stood up to the President \nand said prisoners have the right to judicial review even during war.\n  Let me read what that Court said:\n\n       The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers \n     and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the \n     shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, \n     and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more \n     pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man \n     than that any of its provisions could be suspended during any \n     of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads \n     directly to anarchy or despotism.\n\n  Mr. President, those words still ring true today. The Constitution is \na law for this administration, equally in war and in peace. If the \nConstitution could withstand the Civil War, when our Nation was \nliterally divided against itself, surely it will withstand the war on \nterrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/14/senate-section/article/S6595-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
