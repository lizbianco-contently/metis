Mr. President, today is the last day of the fiscal year, \nand it will be necessary for us to consider the continuing resolution, \nwhich is at the desk. This continuing resolution is a short-term \nmeasure that will keep all functions of Government operating while we \ncontinue to work on the remaining appropriations measures.\n  I hope we can act expeditiously on the joint resolution, which is at \nthe desk. I understand there may be an amendment from the other side of \nthe aisle, and I ask Members to show restraint. We need to pass this \nresolution without amendment so it can get to the President for his \nsignature by midnight tonight. If an amendment is offered, I would \nexpect we would vote quickly on that amendment so we can then proceed \nto vote on the underlying continuing resolution. Members can expect a \nvote this morning as we complete our work on this funding measure.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:45 the Senate turn \nto the consideration of H.J. Res. 68, the continuing resolution, which \nis at the desk; provided further that one amendment be in order to be \noffered by Senator Harkin and relating to CSBG, and that the time until \n10:15 be equally divided in the usual form.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 10:15 the Senate vote in \nrelation to the Harkin amendment, and that following that vote, the \nresolution be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the joint resolution, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10773-8", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10773-S10780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2006\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S10774]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Kohl, \n     Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \n     Stabenow, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n     Akaka, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Carper, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1921.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To continue funding for the Community Services Block Grant at \n                    no less than last year's level)\n\n       On page   , at the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.    Community Services Block Grant.\n       Notwithstanding section 101 of this joint resolution, \n     amounts are provided for making payments under the \n     ``Community Services Block Grant Act'' at a rate not less \n     than the amounts made available for such Act in fiscal year \n     2005.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me try to explain as briefly as I can \nwhat the House did. The House sent over to us a continuing resolution \nthat says we will continue funding programs from last year at last \nyear's level, or the lower of what the House had passed earlier in \ntheir budget. For most programs, that doesn't mean much.\n  This is a continuing resolution until when? November, November 18?\n  Most education money goes out next year. So for 2 months it doesn't \nmean it is a big deal. Two or three months--maybe through December when \nwe will finally adjourn. However, there is one program that is deeply \naffected by what the House did. It is called the Community Services \nBlock Grant Program. This money goes out quarterly. It is used \nquarterly. It means tomorrow the community services block grant will be \ncut 50 percent--not next year, tomorrow. In real dollars, this isn't \nsome phony baloney stuff.\n  What is even worse--as I took the floor last night, I did not know \nthis--in 1990, an amendment was put on and agreed to on the Community \nServices Block Grant Program. It is a trigger formula. It is a little \nbit complicated, but I will try to explain it.\n  It says if the total funding for a fiscal year exceeds $345 million, \neach State shall receive not less than one-half of 1 percent of the \ntotal amount. It protects small States. OK? However, if the funding is \nless than $345 million, then no State shall receive less than one-\nfourth of 1 percent.\n  Here is what the House did. Last year, it was $336 million, and the \nHouse cut it back to $320.6 million. That is the level it was at in \n1986.\n  What does that mean for Alaska? Alaska is one of 13 States--small \nStates--that will be cut 75 percent, not 50 percent.\n  Thirteen States--Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, \nNevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont and \nWyoming--are not cut 50 percent. The total allocation for those States \nwould fall from $3,356,645 to less than $800,000.\n  I say to those of you who are from those 13 States, if you believe \nthe LIHEAP Program is important in your State, you ought to pay \nattention to this amendment. The LIHEAP Program in Alaska, Hawaii, \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Wyoming, for all intents \nand purposes, will cease next week--October, November, maybe December. \nSo small States are hurt the worst.\n  You might ask, What is this Community Services Block Grant Program? \nWhat are we talking about here? Who does it serve? It serves the \npoorest of the poor; 6.5 million Americans, 2 million children, private \nfood banks that rely on the space, refrigerators, and transportation \nsupported by the community services block grant and the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program will be affected. Housing, weatherization \nassistance, emergency shelter, rental assistance, the food stamp \nprograms, home-delivered meals, emergency food banks, senior day care, \nsenior centers, foster grandparents, Head Start Programs, parenting \neducation, domestic violence programs--all of these. That is who is \nserved--the poorest of the poor in our country. That is who is going to \nbe affected.\n  These are the programs that will be cut 50 percent, or 75 percent--\nnot next year. This isn't phony stuff. This isn't, Oh, someone will \ntake care of it.\n  Because of Hurricane Katrina, we have right now 171,000 people being \nserved by community action agencies that get their money from the \nCommunity Services Block Grant Program. Not only do we have poverty up \nin America, but we have all of these people who were evacuees who are \nbeing helped. The mayor of Baton Rouge was here this week and came to \nsee us about increasing the Community Services Block Grant Program to \nthe community action agencies because of all of the evacuees. When they \ntold him it was being cut by 50 percent, he couldn't believe it. He \nabsolutely couldn't believe this was actually happening. One might say, \nWell, we will come back and fix it later on. Maybe we will. When? \nNovember? December? I don't know when. Think about October and think \nabout November and early December or the end of December. People will \nbe evicted from their homes. People will have utilities cut off. The \nelderly will still need transportation to the doctor, and it won't be \nthere. It won't be there because this will be cut either 50 percent in \nmost States or in the smaller States by 75 percent.\n\n  I refer my colleagues to two letters, one from the Ozark Community \nAction Agency and one from the East Missouri Community Action Agency, \nwhich were printed in the Record of yesterday.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the National Governors \nAssociation be printed in the Record. It talks about CSBG, urging we \nkeep it at the appropriated levels.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                                     June 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,.\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor-HHS-Education, Senate \n         Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ralph Regula,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor-HHS-Education, House \n         Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Labor-HHS-Education, Senate \n         Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. David Obey,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Labor-HHS-Education, House \n         Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter, Senator Harkin, Chairman Regula and \n     Congressman Obey: As you begin negotiations on the fiscal \n     year (FY) 2006 Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education (Labor-HHS) appropriations legislation, we are \n     writing to share with you the Governors' views on funding for \n     key state programs. We appreciate that you will provide level \n     or increased funding for many critical programs and urge you \n     to continue to uphold the strong federal-state partnership \n     with respect to these services. As you continue your \n     deliberations, however, we ask for your attention to the \n     following programs.\n\n\n         The Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant\n\n       We urge you to continue level funding for the Preventive \n     Health and Health Services Block Grant at the FY 05 \n     appropriated level of $132 million. This is one of the few \n     grants that allow states to address their own unique health \n     challenges in exciting and innovative ways. States have \n     documented that investment of Block Grant dollars have \n     resulted in improved health outcomes and in many cases \n     significant cost savings.\n\n\n                       Bioterrorism Preparedness\n\n       Bioterrorism preparedness became a priority following \n     September 11, 2001 and the subsequent anthrax attacks that \n     killed several U.S. postal employees and others around the \n     country. Following these incidents, the federal government \n     provided funds to states for strengthening their public \n     health systems and developing surge capacity at state and \n     local public health facilities. The fiscal year 2006 budget \n     proposal has reduced funding in this area. In addition, funds \n     appropriated in fiscal year 2004 and 2005 have been \n     redirected by the Health and Human Services Department to \n     other departmental priorities. We urge you to continue level \n     funding for bioterrorism preparedness and to reject any \n     future efforts by HHS to redirect and/or reprogram already \n     appropriated federal funds for other priorities.\n\n\n                     Community Services Block Grant\n\n       Governors are concerned with the effects that the proposed \n     integration of the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) with \n     17 other federal programs into a new community development \n     initiative will have on the funding of CSBG. We are strongly \n     opposed to any cuts in the funding of CSBG, which supports a \n     broad range of federal, state, local, public and private \n     endeavors aimed at reducing the causes and effects of \n     poverty. We urge you to provide level funding for CSBG at the \n     FY 05 appropriated level of $641 million.\n\n\n                                  IDEA\n\n       Governors are committed to improving the academic \n     performance of students with disabilities. We appreciate the \n     increased federal\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\n     funding for special education that Congress and the \n     Administration have provided states and local schools the \n     last several years. The recently reauthorized Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provided a glide path \n     to achieve full funding of the federal share of IDEA, \n     including an authorization of $14.6 billion for fiscal year \n     2006. We urge Congress to provide the highest possible \n     funding level for IDEA to stay the course and fully fund the \n     federal share of special education expenses.\n\n\n                      NCLB and High School Reform\n\n       Across the nation, governors are leading efforts to reform \n     high schools and implement the No Child Left Behind Act \n     (NCLB). Governors recommend the highest possible funding \n     level--paired with continued flexibility--for Title I to \n     ensure that states and localities have adequate federal \n     resources to help successfully implement NCLB and raise \n     student achievement. We also recommend that funding be \n     maintained and increased for the critical programs that serve \n     teachers, high school students, and students transitioning to \n     postsecondary education, including the Carl D. Perkins \n     Vocational and Technical Education Act and the newly proposed \n     Teacher Incentive Fund. To this end, Congress should consider \n     increasing the federal investment in the Pell Grant program \n     to improve the purchasing power for all students, as long as \n     program solvency is maintained.\n       Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to \n     working closely with you on these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Jennifer Granholm,\n                       Chair, Health and Human Services Committee.\n\n                                       Gov. Kathleen Sebelius,\n\n                             Chair, Education, Early Childhood and\n                                              Workforce Committee.\n\n                                           Gov. Haley Barbour,\n\n                                      Vice Chair, Health and Human\n                                               Services Committee.\n\n                                            Gov. Tim Pawlenty,\n\n                            Vice Chair, Education, Early Childhood\n                                          and Workforce Committee.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I received this morning an article from the Salt Lake \nTribune: Utah poor will suffer from U.S. budget cut.\n\n       Utah's nine Community Action Programs stand to lose almost \n     half a million over the next three months under a temporary \n     budget approved by the U.S. Congress . . .\n       The 50 percent cut . . . that fund the programs nationally \n     is temporary; lawmakers could restore the money when they \n     approve the final budget, possibly in December or January. Or \n     they might not.\n       In Utah, the losses that take effect Saturday are already \n     forcing layoffs, a scaled-back food and pantry operating \n     hours and the suspension of meal deliveries to thousands of \n     families in crisis.\n       Cathy Hoskins, director of the state's largest Community \n     Action Program, located in Salt Lake city, said they stand to \n     lose $250,000, which translates to 6,000 orders of three-day \n     food supplies for 4,500 households.\n       She has laid off six workers and reduced by a fourth the \n     number of hours that advocates can devote to helping families \n     navigate Medicaid, welfare and other social service programs.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       ``It hurts,'' said Road Home director Matt Minkevich, whose \n     agency could lose $37,000. ``That's the equivalent of about \n     two front-line staff or 3,000 shelter nights.''\n\n  This is the time of the year temperatures are starting to drop. Food \npantries are running low, and people need help.\n  Katrina hit. We now see there are a lot of poor people in this \ncountry, a lot of people that are at the end of their rope.\n  One might say: What the heck. It is just 2 or 3 months. Put yourself \nin the position of a low-income family who has just been evicted. They \ncannot pay their rent. They are out. They need some help in finding a \nplace to live. Where do they go? They go to their community action \ncenters. They go to East Ozark or they go to East Missouri to get that \nhelp. Now they are told, We can't, we do not have the people, we do not \nhave the funds. Maybe they need some money to tide them over for a few \ndays to find some shelter. Sorry, the money is not there.\n  One may think this does not happen in America. Think about New \nOrleans. Think about the poor who were caught who did not have cars, \ndid not have transportation, did not have bank accounts, did not have \nany hope or any way of getting out. There are a lot of Americans out \nthere who do not live like we do, who do not have nice homes. We just \ngo in and turn up the thermostat whenever we want to or go down to the \nlocal Safeway and pull out our credit card and buy groceries or go down \nto the local doctor and our insurance picks up the tab.\n  We are talking about 6.5 million Americans served by these programs. \nWe are talking about the poorest of the poor.\n  Let me give some more examples of what community service block grants \ndo: Transportation for the elderly to medical appointments at community \nhealth centers, in-home chore services for the homebound elderly, \ncongregate meals, child care, domestic violence programs, energy \nassistance, weatherization, emergency shelter, rental assistance, \nhomeless assistance, eviction prevention, transitional housing, and I \nmentioned the all-important Low-Income Heating Energy Assistance \nProgram.\n  This is what this money goes for. We are being told now we have to go \nback to 1986 levels. By doing that, because of the formula in the law, \n13 States that I mentioned--Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, \nMontana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, \nVermont, and Wyoming--13 States will lose over 75 percent of their \nmoney--not next year, tomorrow.\n  It is not, well, hang on, continue your programs, continue doing \nthings, we will get the money to you starting in January when we \nfinally get our budget figured out here. I am sorry, people need food \nnow. They need shelter assistance now. They need to pay their heating \nbills now. They need transportation to the doctor now. They cannot wait \nuntil January to have someone pick up the tab. They do not have credit \ncards. They do not have bank accounts. They do not have someone who \nsays we will give you the money and you can pay us back later. They do \nnot have that opportunity.\n  Let me repeat for the sake of emphasis who we are affecting with \nthis. Who are these people? Community service block grants serve 22 \npercent of all people in poverty. So one out of every five individuals \nin America below the poverty level is served by CSBG. They do not serve \nmore because we do not fund more. But now we are going to cut it below \nthat, more than 15 million individuals, members of 6 million low-income \nfamilies. There were 2.7 million families with incomes at or below the \npoverty guidelines, 1.1 million with incomes below 50 percent of the \npoverty guidelines. Think of that, 1.1 million families affected by \nwhat the House of Representatives did if we do not correct it; 1.1 \nmillion families had incomes below 50 percent of the poverty \nguidelines. That is below $7,000 a year. It is 3.7 million children, \n1.8 million adults who have not completed high school, 1.1 million \npeople who are disabled served by community services block grants. That \nis who we are talking about. We are not talking about people like us \nwho have all this money. We are talking about the poorest of the poor.\n\n  I will repeat again that 13 States, because of a formula in the law, \nwill have a 75-percent cut tomorrow: Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, \nMaine, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, \nUtah, Vermont, and Wyoming. Tomorrow there will be a 75-percent cut in \nthe community block grants that go to Wyoming. But it will be more \nbecause there is a set-aside for tribes. I am sure the LIHEAP program \nis as important in Wyoming as in Iowa and it is getting cold in October \nand November.\n  What the House did is thoughtless, heartless. It is cruel and totally \nirresponsible. That does not mean we have to be thoughtless and \nheartless and irresponsible. We can adopt this amendment, get it back \nup to last year's level as a continuing resolution ought to do. We do \nnot add any money. We just keep it at last year's level. The House can \ncome back and correct this mistake today.\n  Well, you say that is a burden on the House; the Members have \nprobably caught their planes and gone home. I remember when the House \ncame back on Palm Sunday to pass a resolution on the Terri Schiavo \ncase. If they can do that, they can come back and correct this. They \ncan come back today and say we are not going to leave 6.5 million \nAmericans dependent on LIHEAP programs, people who will be evicted, we \nwill not leave them in the dust.\n  Think about what we are doing. Think about this. Think about next \nmonth. A low-income family, a mother with two or three kids who have \nbeen in an apartment, and they have not paid their rent because they \nran out of money. Maybe they had an illness. They had to pay out of \npocket. So they are evicted. Where do they go?\n  Don't tell me that doesn't happen. We saw what happens in New \nOrleans.\n\n[[Page S10776]]\n\nWe know now the poor are not out of sight and out of mind any longer. \nThey are here. What happens? How uncomfortable will it be for that \nfamily? What kind of discomfort will they suffer?\n  What about an elderly person whose utilities have been turned off?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ISAKSON). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for at least 3 more minutes to \nfinish.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will not object, but I would like to have some time on \nour side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't care. If I can just get 5 minutes, I will end.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has already had 20 minutes. The time was \nequally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was told last night, I say to my friend from Alaska, \nthat I had a half hour. I came in this morning and found out I only \nhave 15 minutes. I don't know who made that agreement. It was done \nwithout my knowledge.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection if the Senator has 4 more minutes, \nbut I would like the time until 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The time is at 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy----\n  Mr. THOMAS. There is an objection. As a Member, I object.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to yield to the Senator 4 minutes of our \ntime, if he wishes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will take 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Look, we may make the House uncomfortable, but I plead with my \ncolleagues, I plead with my colleagues, don't let this happen. Don't, \nin our haste to leave here and go home for the weekend, shrug our \nshoulders and say, well, someone will take care of it. Don't let our \nreticence or our reluctance to make the House come back and do what is \nright cause us to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to the poorest in our \ncountry.\n  I plead with my colleagues, let's do the right thing. Let's adopt \nthis amendment. The House can come back later today. They can fix it. \nThey can make it right. It may be a little bit uncomfortable for them \nto get on an airplane and come back here, but think about the \ndiscomfort of the poor in our country, think about that elderly person \nwho needs the LIHEAP program. Think about their uncomfortableness. They \nneed us. Let's not turn our backs on them at this point in time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Iowa knows, this \nSenator completely supports Community Service Block Grant Programs. We \nboth serve on the Committee on Appropriations and serve on the \nsubcommittee that deals with this issue.\n  I tell the Senate, on these community service block grants, for every \ndollar that the Federal Government puts up, more than $2 comes from \noutside sources. They are not matching funds. They put them up. They \nsupply them. This reduction in the House bill was done to sort of have \nleverage over our committee in conference.\n  The Senate bill which is carried by the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania already has the full amount of the request in it. All we \nhave to do is get that bill to conference, but it has not been possible \nthus far. But when this continuing resolution takes effect, there will \nbe allocated to the States the money they need.\n\n  Beyond that, FEMA has all sorts of money right now to assist the \npeople who are involved in the hurricane areas. There is no reason to \nthink anyone is going to be shut off in the disaster area from the \ncommunity block grant concept because FEMA will provide money to this \nagency if they are short of money in this period ahead of us because of \nthe delay in getting the Health and Human Services bill passed by the \nCongress and sent to the President.\n  But what happens if the Senator's amendment passes? We come to a halt \ntonight. We have already reprogrammed money to the Department of \nDefense from 2005 moneys in order to carry them over until they get the \nmoney from the Defense bill, when and if it is passed.\n  We know we are in a period of delay because of a lot of things, \nbecause of the two major disasters, because of the delay we have had in \nterms of being able to confirm the nomination of the Chief Justice. \nThere has been a lot of delay this year, and we are late. It is not \nsomething new. We have been late before and had continuing resolutions.\n  This matter the Senator has brought up will not lead to people being \ndenied assistance because the States can advance their money for this \nperiod of 6 weeks, and it will be repaid when we pass the bill. The \nSenate will hold the money for the Community Services Block Grants. We \nalways have. It is one of the things we have negotiated with the House \nalmost every year. The Senator knows this. We go to conference almost \nevery year, and the House has reduced this item. It is sort of a little \nleverage in terms of negotiation with the Senator from Iowa, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, both of whom have done an excellent job with \nCommunity Services Block Grants.\n  As I said, I support it. The chairman of the committee supports it. \nWe support the Community Services Block Grant Program. It will be fully \nfunded. It has been fully funded in the bill that is before the Senate. \nTo delay this bill now and delay funding for everyone else because \nthere is a little glitch here that it could--it could--be read to be \nsomething that is taking money, as a practical matter, it carries the \nsame language that was in the continuing resolution before when the \nminority was in the majority. This is exactly what happened before. It \nis the same thing.\n  And it is a continuing resolution that has to be passed. If it is not \nto the President by tonight, funding stops for everybody, not just a \nslight glitch in the Community Services Block Grant. I do not like to \nsee people out there who really depend upon the Federal Government for \nassistance being told somehow or other they are going to be denied \nmoney. The money that comes from the Federal Government is less than a \nthird of the money they get.\n  So we have a possibility of a slight delay in Federal money getting \nto them, but during that period, the non-Federal money, both from \nStates and private sources, will meet the need. Beyond that, FEMA has \nmoney. We all know we gave them a tremendous amount of money to deal \nwith those who are in the disaster areas.\n  So I say to my friend from Iowa, this is wrong. This is wrong. We \nwill resolve this difference with the House. We have never before \nabandoned Community Service Block Grants in the Senate. I do not care \nwhich party has been in charge over the Senate, we have supported this \nprogram. And we will. But to threaten these people, to make it sound as \nthough somehow or other they are going to put them out on the street \nand they are not going to get any assistance, that is wrong.\n  I tell the Senate, if we do not pass this bill without amendment, not \nonly will the House be back here, we will be back here for days \nwrangling over what to do because we cannot get the House back by \nmidnight. We go into that period of all the slush that comes after the \nfunding runs out. And it is not an easy sight.\n  We all remember the time it happened once before when the Government \ndid shut down because of a dispute between the House and the Senate. It \nwas resolved out at Andrews Air Force Base about 9 days later, as I \nrecall.\n  Now, at this time, after these two disasters, is no time to put a \nquestion on the availability of the funds for every agency. If the \nSenator's amendment is adopted, every agency is going to have to say: \nWhat do we do? We can't spend any money from the 2006 account. They \nwill not have this continuing resolution, a lot of them, to spend from \n2005 levels.\n  This is chaos. We do not deserve chaos in this country after the two \ndisasters we have just come through. I say to the Senate, it is \nabsolutely wrong to try to stop this continuing resolution this year. \nWe have troops in the field. As I said, those of us on the Defense \nAppropriations Committee have, this last week, approved about seven \ndifferent reprogrammings to make sure funds are available tomorrow \nmorning for those people who need them who are deployed overseas. So to \nstop these funds, to stop this bill, would stop everything tonight.\n\n[[Page S10777]]\n\n  Now, again--and the Senator has mentioned my State--my State is one \nof the States that needs funding of this kind. There is no question \nthat if there is a hiatus of having Federal funds, the State is going \nto have to step forward and put some of their money up first. But they \nknow we will restore this money. By the time the 2006 bill is signed, \nit will say that starting for October 1, they will get this money they \nshould have had.\n  I tell the Senator from Iowa, there is just----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will yield right now to the chairman of \nthe committee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When the Senator from Alaska comments that the States \ncan put up some money so there would be no shortfall in the interim \nuntil November 18, what assurances are there that that could happen, \nthat they have the funds and the disposition to do so?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Well, I say to the Senator, I know my State. My State is \nnot going to let those people suffer because there is a temporary \nhiatus in Federal funding. The checks will go out from the State. The \nState provides the checks. I cannot imagine that would happen.\n  Beyond that, FEMA is there. If this agency does not have the money to \nmeet the needs in the area of the two disasters, FEMA can step forward \nand give them money. And it is already doing that. That is my \ninformation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, would the Senator from Alaska permit me \nto ask the same question to the Senator from Iowa? If I may have the \nattention of the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator wants the floor, I will be glad to yield \nthe floor to him. But I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania is not going \nto support this amendment. If you do so, it means we will be in real \ntrouble as far as our committee is concerned.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, I have no present intention of supporting the \namendment. I would like to try to find a way to resolve the issue \nsubstantively. But it is not an infrequent occurrence that the House \nleaves town and leaves us with a gun at our head, where we have no \npractical alternative but to yield to the House, which is out of town, \nto run the Government.\n  But I am intrigued by what the Senator from Alaska has said. He is \nvery experienced and has been here a long time. He knows the ins and \nouts of Government perhaps better than anyone. And when the Senator \nsays the States will provide the shortfall in the interim, it is a \nbrief period of time, or FEMA could step in, I would be interested in \nthe comments--I have discussed this preliminarily with Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is to October 18. That is what we are talking about.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I hear it is November 18. It is 6 weeks.\n  Mr. STEVENS. November 18? I apologize. That happens to be on my \nbirthday.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, that ends the debate. Six weeks is a short time in \nthe fiscal year the way we function around here, but it could be a very \nlong time for people who need money to keep their bodies and souls \ntogether.\n  Let me direct a question to Senator Harkin.\n  The Senator from Alaska, having yielded the floor to me, how about \nSenator Stevens' idea of the States making up the shortfall, on the \nassurances from the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nPresident pro tempore and Senator Harkin and myself--the ranking member \nand chairman of the subcommittee--that we will provide the additional \nfunds when we go to conference so that any shortfall will be made up, \nthat we will exercise our very best efforts and think we can be \nsuccessful--we have some leverage, too, in conference--that the moneys \nwill be paid in the interim and the shortfall will be made up?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Sure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will you amend that question by saying we will provide \nin the bill that the States will be repaid for what they advance?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will amend my statement to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has yielded to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. However, the Senator from Pennsylvania may \nnot yield to the Senator from Iowa. The Senator from Iowa can ask for \nrecognition.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yielded the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We can work that out, Mr. President. I yield to the \nSenator from Iowa. I yield the floor so he can have the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will you ask the question again?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa seek recognition?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator please ask the question again? Is the \nquestion about the States making up the difference?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If everyone will suspend, the time is \ncontrolled by the Senator from Alaska. The Senator from Pennsylvania \ncould not yield to the Senator from Iowa. However, subject to \ncorrection by the Parliamentarian, the Senator from Alaska may yield to \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield time to the chairman of the \ncommittee. I was just occupying the position of the chairman until he \nsought recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides of \nthis issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 4 minutes. The minority has \nnone.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time \nallocated to the majority.\n  Do you know what this is, pure and simple? Shenanigans. Pure and \nsimple, shenanigans. Now, the reporter may not know how to spell that, \nand I am not sure I could get it right, but it is not a serious effort \nto increase funding for anybody for anything. No matter what my good \nfriend from Iowa has said about the intentions of this amendment, it is \nto force Senators to vote for a lower level of funding than he is \nproposing.\n  The problem is, the House is involved in this. We received this bill \nfrom the House. It is a continuing resolution to provide interim \nfunding until we complete action on the next fiscal year bills for \nthese programs.\n  You have heard the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, who is \nchairman of the subcommittee, who will help write that bill and manage \nthe bill on the floor of the Senate. He is not going to reduce the \nlevels of these programs, as the Senator from Iowa suggests will be \ndone.\n  We will negotiate, in due course, in the regular order with the \nHouse, for appropriate levels of funding for the next fiscal year when \nwe pass the next fiscal year bill. This is a temporary measure. It is \nnot going to deprive anybody of funds they would otherwise get under \nthe next year's bills.\n  The next fiscal year starts on October 1. Here we are at the end of \nthe last fiscal year. This is shenanigans, purely and simply. The \ncontinuing resolution is not a new or innovative procedure to provide \ninterim funding while the Congress completes actions on bills that may \nnot yet be finally worked out between the conferees, between the House \nand Senate. It is often done. I do not recall there being any serious \ndisadvantage to anyone under a continuing resolution. Any shortfalls \nthat might occur as a result of the adoption of this continuing \nresolution can be made up when the regular fiscal year 2006 bill is \nfinally agreed to by both Houses.\n  So I urge seriously the Senate to reject the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Iowa. It is not going to have the effect that he suggests because \nthe House is not going to agree to it. The House has already passed the \ncontinuing resolution and set the level of funding on a temporary \nbasis.\n  What is up to us now is: Are we going to provide continued funding \nfor those programs that are identified in the continuing resolution? It \nis not just the programs the Senator from Iowa talks about. There are a \nlot of programs affected by this continuing resolution: national \nsecurity issues, all kinds of other programs, nutrition programs for \nthe poor. So what he would do, in effect, is deny them the funds that \nwould be made available under the continuing resolution. That would be \na mess.\n  If we want a mess on our hands and people hurting and deprived of \nfunding\n\n[[Page S10778]]\n\nto which they are entitled under current law, at currently approved \nlevels of funding by both Houses of Congress, vote for the amendment. \nThat would create the real mess.\n  So I urge the Senate, Mr. President, to resist this amendment, vote \nit down. Then, let's adopt the continuing resolution and provide \nfunding that is needed by all the agencies and Departments identified \nin the continuing resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg) and the Senator from Louisiana \n(Mr. Vitter).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I joined my colleague, the Senator from \nIowa, in supporting the Community Services Block Grant, CSBG. The \ncontinuing resolution before the Senate contains the House-passed \nfunding level for CSBG, $320 million. This is a 50 percent cut from \nboth the fiscal year 2005 level of funding and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee supported level.\n  CSBG funds can be used in a variety of ways to help low-income \nfamilies make ends meet. I have heard from several agencies in \nWisconsin who rely on this funding to provide a range of services, from \njob training to housing, to low-income families and individuals in \ntheir communities. These agencies have told me, in no uncertain terms, \nthat a cut of this magnitude to CSBG would require them to cut actual \nprogramming aimed at reducing poverty for families and the elderly. \nThis means a cut to programs such as the Skills Enhancement Project in \nOutagamie County, which provides skills training to low-income workers \nso that they may compete for higher paying jobs. Similarly, the Home \nBuyers Assistance Program, which aims to increase homeownership among \nlow-income families, would have to narrow the number of families served \nif the CR was passed without additional funding for CSBG.\n  CSBG funding plays a similarly important role throughout my State. \nThe West Central Wisconsin Community Action Agency, West CAP, which \nprovides a range of supports for low-income families and individuals, \nrelies on this funding to provide ``hardship relief'' programs, \naffordable housing, food pantry services and job training. West CAP has \nmade it clear that this cut to CSBG couldn't come at a worse time, a \ntime when they are seeing increases in the use of food pantries, steep \nincreases in the pricing of basic needs, and dramatic increases in the \ncosts of gasoline and home heating fuels, which particularly impact on \nlow-income individuals.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of the Harkin amendment to restore \nfunding to CSBG. At a time when Katrina and Rita have focused our \nNation's attention on the needs of low-income families, it is \nunconscionable that Congress would turn its back, by cutting CSBG. With \nthis amendment we had a chance to set it right.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I voted in opposition to the Harkin \namendment to H.J. Res. 68. I opposed this amendment not because of its \nsubstance, because I am strongly on the record supporting the Community \nService Block Grant Program. I voted earlier this year for an amendment \nto the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution that would increase funding \nfor a number of community development programs by a total of $2.073 \nbillion. This funding increase was for important programs such as \ncommunity development block grants and community service block grants \nthat give a helping hand to those who need it most and help get them \nback on their feet.\n  No, I did not oppose the amendment because of its substance. I \nopposed it because of its timing. We are here on the last day of the \nfiscal year, and the bill before us would provide stopgap funding for a \nmajority of the Federal Government until we finish the appropriations \nprocess here in Congress. We cannot hold up this bill today to provide \nstopgap funding for the Federal Government. The House of \nRepresentatives passed this bill last night and has adjourned. If the \nPresident does not sign this bill before midnight tonight the Federal \nGovernment will shut down.\n  We cannot allow important programs and agencies of the Federal \nGovernment to go without funding--especially in this great time of \nneed. Numerous Government agencies are working around the clock in \nemergency recovery efforts to assist those impacted by Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita on the gulf coast.\n  The issue that the Senator from Iowa brought up is extremely \nimportant, and I am certain that the Senate will quickly restore \nfunding to the level that allows the CSBG Program and other community \ndevelopment programs to operate effectively.\n  Last night the Democratic whip in the House of Representatives said \nit would be ``unacceptable'' to allow the Government to shutdown. I \nagree. Failing to pass this stopgap funding bill today without \namendments would do just that. It would shutter the windows of many \nvital Federal Programs--including those programs deeply involved in \nhurricane recovery efforts, funding for our troops, and other essential \nprograms. This is unacceptable indeed.\n  I know how important the CSBG and CDBG Programs are to my home State \nof South Dakota. I often discuss with my constituents how these \nprograms impact the lives of many South Dakotans. I also realize how \nthis current funding situation would impact our State. That is why I am \ndetermined to work with my colleagues at the appropriate time to \nrestore funding. But we cannot shut down the rest of the Federal \nGovernment today at this critical hour.\n  Finally, I fear this is the kind of vote that the other side makes \nthe Senate take up just for attempted political gain and for crass \npolitical motives. I fought a hard campaign last year, and I know first \nhand how votes can be twisted during an election year--when tension is \nhigh and there is little time for substantive explanations. I am making \nthis statement today to set the record straight. Those on the other \nside may someday try to use this vote for their political advantage, \nbut I resolved to make the responsible vote and keep our Government \nfrom facing a shutdown and resolving the funding issue on CSBG at the \ncorrect time.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I opposed the Harkin amendment No. \n1921, on the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Program.\n\n[[Page S10779]]\n\n  Most of us know the important role that the Community Service Block \nGrant Program plays in addressing the needs of folks on limited incomes \nin Montana and across this country. The programs it encompasses go a \nlong way toward softening some of the conditions and addressing the \ncauses of poverty. The range of services include everything from low-\nincome energy assistance, nutrition and housing programs, Head Start \neducation, and other vital services offered by community action \nagencies.\n  I strongly support the CSBG Program--I always have--and I will \ncontinue to support full funding of CSBG again in the fiscal year 2006 \nSenate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations \nbill. The Senate version of the bill funds CSBG at almost $637 million, \nwhile the House of Representatives funded the program only at $320 \nmillion. Earlier this year, I signed a letter to my colleagues on the \nSenate's Appropriations Subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education, outlining my support for \nfunding CSBG at $650 million fiscal year 2006. All the Senate needs to \ndo now is its work in passing the fiscal year 2006 Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill and getting it to conference where this important \nprogram and the countless others' funding levels may be reconciled with \nthe House bill.\n  I have no doubt the CSBG Program will be funded sufficiently this \nyear, contrary to the benchmark the House of Representatives has set. \nGiven that this situation will be resolved with the completion of the \nappropriation process, along with the fact that I do not believe we \nshould hold up this continuing resolution and other important \nappropriation bills, such as the Defense bill which provides funding \nfor our men and women in harm's way, or shut down the Government \nbecause of this amendment--for something I feel confident will be \nfunded anyway. Voting for this amendment would have shut down the \nGovernment, thereby completely eliminating any of the funding \nmechanisms in place to continue helping those most in need. I was not \nwilling to jeopardize their well-being.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In the past five years, five million more citizens have \nfallen into poverty. Thirty-seven million Americans live below the \npoverty line. Three million more working Americans live in hunger or on \nthe verge of hunger today than in the year 2000.\n  The long-term unemployment rate is at historic levels--1.4 million \nAmericans are unemployed. Wages are stagnant throughout the United \nStates, yet gas prices, housing costs, and heating oil costs are \nsoaring. Families stay awake at night worrying how to make ends meet.\n  Many parents wonder how they will feed their children and pay their \nbills. It is shameful that in the richest and most powerful Nation on \nEarth, nearly 20 percent of all children go to bed hungry at night \nbecause their parents, even working full time, still can't make ends \nmeet.\n  So how does the Republican leadership in Congress respond? By cutting \none of the key programs intended to help these families and children \nthrough times of difficulty.\n  These cuts are even more incomprehensible when we see the needs of \nour fellow citizens who have lost everything in Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. The needs of the poor in America had already been ignored by the \nBush administration. But those devastating storms have shone a bright \nnew light on the unacceptable poverty that continues to plague our \ncommunities today. We all watched the heartbreaking scenes of countless \nlow-income residents with no cars, struggling to escape the path of the \nhurricane, and then struggling again to escape the flood waters. These \nwere real people in real poverty left largely on their own, fending for \nthemselves.\n  American people expect their leaders to stand for fairness, freedom \nand opportunity. Those values are the cornerstone of the American \ndream. We believe that if you live right and work hard, you should be \nable to care for your family, afford rent in a safe neighborhood, and \nto send your children to college.\n  We also believe that when life deals you a setback, you can count on \nyour neighbors to pitch in. If you lose your job or become seriously \nill, we all want to help out. If you lose your home, your belongings, \nand your security from a natural disaster, it is some comfort to know \nat least that you haven't been deserted and that help is on the way. \nYou deserve a chance to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start \nover again--to reclaim the American dream for yourself and your family. \nThat's the American way, the American spirit.\n  The State agencies and the community action agencies funded by the \ncommunity service block grant program know that spirit well. They fight \npoverty and encourage self-sufficiency in low-income communities every \nday. Their services include literacy, child health care, afterschool \nactivities, low-income housing development, food stamps, and emergency \nshelter assistance--all building blocks for a better future for \nfamilies facing misfortune.\n  Unfortunately, the administration and the House of Representatives \nhave closed their eyes to the needs of the poor and to the important \nwork of these community service agencies across the nation. This bill \ntakes the unconscionable step of cutting funds for the community \nservice block grant program in half--just at the time that these \nservices are needed most.\n  At a time when poverty is increasing, and in the wake of the \ndevastation of the hurricane, the House has decided to limit funds to \nthe very agencies that came forward to help people least able to help \nthemselves.\n  As Hurricane Katrina hit, Assistant Secretary for Children and \nFamilies Wade Horn acknowledged the unique role of the community-based \nagencies in disaster relief and called them to action in a memorandum \nof September. He said that community action grantees ``particularly \nthose in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, Florida, \nGeorgia and Tennessee [should] open [their] doors to those displaced \nfamilies who have sought refuge in [their] community and seek new ways \nto support individuals, families and children impacted by this \ndisaster.''\n  These local agencies responded to that call by providing support and \nother help to those in need.\n  I recently heard of a community action agency in Georgia. A woman \nlost her home and her employment to Hurricane Katrina. She and her \nhusband had evacuated New Orleans without their medication and little \nmore than the clothes on their backs. The woman came to the Union \nCounty Community Resource Center. She and her husband were provided \nwith food, vouchers for clothing at local thrift stores, and were \nreferred to the local free clinic to obtain the prescriptions they \nneeded to replace those that were lost. They were helped to find jobs \nthrough churches, organizations, and businesses. In fact, the woman was \nplaced in a position within the same week.\n  In Arkansas, community service block grant funds helped a single \nmother and her four children move from a shelter into federally \nassisted permanent housing. Funding paid for the security deposit, a \ndeposit with the electric company, and a new washer and dryer because \nthere were no facilities in the building.\n  These actions are repeated every day thousands of times over to help \npeople get back on their feet. According to the National Association of \nState Community Service Programs, community action agencies have \nassisted over 171,000 evacuees. Much of their time was volunteered. But \nthe services and facilities they are using will draw from the funds \nallocated by the government. The services for new residents, even \ntemporary ones, will change the community priorities already set for \ndwindling block grant resources. How can the administration encourage \nthese agencies to do more while simultaneously cutting their funds?\n  Over the past 3 years, community service block grant funds have been \neroding, and a lack of funds has impaired the ability of these agencies \nto reach out to the poor. If the community service block grant is cut \nin half, their services will be compromised even more, and the agencies \nwill face a crisis of their own that will strain their reserves. \nPrograms that depend on grant resources for support such as fuel \nassistance, the earned-income tax credit, Medicare outreach, and food \npantries will be seriously hurt, and in some cases will be eliminated.\n\n[[Page S10780]]\n\n  With rising home energy costs, a 50-percent cut in funding will \njeopardize the LIHEAP program. October and November are especially busy \nmonths for the community action agencies that administer it. The \nprogram year begins October 1, and many agencies sign up the vast \nmajority of LIHEAP participants right away. Most States get almost 90 \npercent of their annual allotment in the first quarter.\n  In 3 months, the loss to Massachusetts will be $2 million. Half of \nthe State's 4,000-person staff will face layoffs. Yet our State serves \nmore than 400,000 persons, including many from the Gulf States.\n  According to Action Inc., a community action agency in Gloucester, \nMA, a temporary 50-percent cut in funds will result in the elimination \nof its housing and family legal services. Three hundred fifty very low-\nincome local families who face housing problems will be at risk of \nhomelessness.\n  The family law program will also be eliminated. Yet it helps 75 very \nlow-income residents a year by providing legal assistance on issues \nsuch as divorce, custody, visitation and child support. Four hundred \ntwenty-five families will not have the legal assistance that helps \nprevent evictions and solve critical family issues.\n  Action Inc. is only one example of the numerous agencies in \nMassachusetts and across the Nation facing lay offs and program cuts or \neven elimination because of the harsh cuts in continuing resolution.\n  It is wrong for the administration and the House of Representatives \nto shred America's safety net even further when so many Americans are \nalready falling through it. We know how to mend it. All we lack is the \nwill and the leadership to do it.\n  The community services block grant agencies have been fighting to \nalleviate poverty with great skill. It is time the Government stopped \nforcing them to do so against such heavy odds. The challenge is too \ncritical for Americans to ignore any longer. We can no longer remain \nindifferent to the least of those among us.\n  Personal responsibility, community responsibility, government \nresponsibility--they go hand in hand. When one of them breaks down, as \nit has now, we have to fix it. I am saddened by Congress's harsh \ntreatment of those most in need. We should fully fund the community \nservice block grant, not cut it in half.\n  It may be inconvenient for House Members to take a plane ride back to \nWashington to fix the problem they created, but it does not compare to \nthe hardships millions of poor people face today and every day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as of yesterday afternoon, nearly a \nquarter of this country's refinery capacity is offline.\n  Already feeling the impact of high prices at the gas pump prior to \nthe two hurricanes, Americans are bracing for additional price \nincreases as refinery operations remain shutdown in the gulf coast. \nAmericans are also bracing for record high energy costs this winter.\n  While the administration has ordered the release of petroleum from \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve, without refinery capacity, putting \ncrude oil on the market does little to nothing to alleviate immediate \nsupply constraints and high prices at pump.\n  What hurricanes Katrina and Rita taught is that we must be ready for \na rainy day. That is why it is critical to our national and economic \ninterests to build a gasoline reserve to keep the country moving \nforward in case of an emergency.\n\n[[Page S10781]]\n\n  Witnessed by the ill-preparedness of the response in the wake of \nHurricane Katrina, we must prepare now for the potential impact of \nfuture catastrophes.\n  Most importantly, as fuel supplies remain tight, we must prepare to \nalleviate the impact that another natural disaster, refinery fire, or \npipeline explosion has on the Nation fuel supply and as a result our \nnational economy.\n  Yesterday I introduced the Strategic Gasoline and Fuel Reserve Act of \n2005.\n  The reserve would require the Department of Energy to hold and manage \n40 million barrels of unleaded gasoline and 7.5 million barrels of jet \nfuel to be used in times of supply shortages--shortages that adversely \nimpact the U.S. economy.\n  The Secretary is tasked with identifying at most five strategically \nsignificant regional locations for the fuel reserve. For instance, one \ncould be located in the Northeast, one in the Midwest and one in the \nCalifornia.\n  Finally, the Secretary of Energy must establish procedures to release \nfuel from the reserve to those typically engaged in the sale of \ndistribution of gasoline or jet fuel.\n  Hurricane Katrina forced about 1 million barrels of refined product \noffline. The reserve would provide 40 days' worth of gasoline supply \nbased on the amount shutdown from Katrina--or almost 2 weeks worth of \ngasoline supply to fill the void of offline capacity caused by both \nHurricane Rita and Katrina together.\n  Furthermore, the reserve would include 7.5 million barrels of jet \nfuel--enough to keep the fleet in operation for 40 days if faced with a \ndisaster of the magnitude of Katrina.\n  We have witnessed three airlines enter into bankruptcy--partly \nbecause of increasing fuel costs. U.S. airlines pay an additional $190 \nmillion in annual fuel costs for every penny increase in the price of a \ngallon of gas.\n  It is important to keep a viable stock of jet fuel available to \nensure the seamless operation of one of America's important \ntransportation fleets.\n  But, in total, consumers are the ones hardest hit by rising fuel \ncosts.\n  A fuel reserve like the one in this legislation could provide a price \nbuffer when pipelines or refinery outages occur, helping to mitigate \nprice spikes that bite consumers in the pocketbook.\n  Consumer Federation of America has urged Congress to create a \nnational fuel reserve. They recognize that American households who own \nand drive cars will consume 100 billion gallons of gasoline this year--\ncosting them over $200 billion at the pump. This represents a cost of \nnearly $2,000 for each household with a car, and an increase of nearly \n$600 a year in the past 4 years alone.\n  A study commissioned by the State of California concluded that a \nregional reserve, which is what would be created under this bill, could \nsave consumers $1 billion every time supplies were affected. With a \nnationwide reserve, that number is even higher.\n  As Democrats continue to push for a national policy of energy \nindependence, a gasoline and jet fuel reserve is an important component \nof that debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record material in \nsupport of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Support for the Strategic Gasoline and Fuel Reserve Act of 2005--\n                           September 29, 2005\n\n\n                     Consumer Federation of America\n\n       Mark Cooper, Director of Research, Consumer Federation of \n     America (CFA), said about the Strategic Gasoline and Fuel \n     Reserve Act of 2005, ``Four years ago, at the first signs of \n     trouble in the gasoline market, we called for a regional \n     product reserve that would be used to not only ensure supply, \n     but to dampen the wild roller coaster ride that has been \n     afflicting the driving public. This legislation is a step in \n     the right direction and hopefully marks the start of a broad \n     re-orientation of energy policy toward policies that protect \n     consumers from pricing abuse.''\n\n\n                            United Airlines\n\n       Mark Anderson, Vice President, Government Affairs, United \n     Airlines, said, ``Senator Durbin understands that escalating \n     fuel prices, driven in part by shortages in supply, have a \n     negative impact on travel and economic stability for \n     individuals and businesses throughout Illinois and the \n     nation. This proposal, which will ensure that emergency \n     supplies of refined products like gasoline and jet fuel are \n     located at strategic locations across the country, will \n     provide economic stability when it is most needed. We applaud \n     Senator Durbin's efforts to address this issue of critical \n     importance.''\n\n\n                           American Airlines\n\n       According to Will Ris, Senior Vice President for Government \n     Affairs for American Airlines, ``the proposal of Senator \n     Durbin to establish a reserve of refined oil products is a \n     farsighted idea that should be implemented quickly. The \n     hidden story of the current crisis is that the cost of \n     refining crude oil has increased at a much more rapid rate \n     than the price of crude itself. By creating a reserve of \n     refined products, the fluxuation in the markets due to \n     temporary refining shortages can be reduced substantially. We \n     particularly applaud Senator Durbin's proposal to build \n     reserves of jet fuel as well as gasoline. This shows a strong \n     understanding of the importance of commercial aviation to the \n     economy.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10781-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10781-S10783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1903.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that certain local educational agencies shall be \n eligible to receive a fiscal year 2005 payment under section 8002 or \n      8003 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n       On page 220, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 8116. APPLICATIONS FOR IMPACT AID PAYMENT.\n\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 8005(d) \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 7705(d)(2) and (3)), the Secretary of Education shall \n     treat as timely filed, and shall process for payment, an \n     application under section 8002 or section 8003 of such Act \n     (20 U.S.C. 7702, 7703) for fiscal year 2005 from a local \n     educational agency--\n       (1) that, for each of the fiscal years 2000 through 2004, \n     submitted an application by the date specified by the \n     Secretary of Education under section 8005(c) of such Act for \n     the fiscal year;\n       (2) for which a reduction of more than $1,000,000 was made \n     under section 8005(d)(2) of such Act by the Secretary of \n     Education as a result of the agency's failure to file a \n     timely application under section 8002 or 8003 of such Act for \n     fiscal year 2005; and\n       (3) that submits an application for fiscal year 2005 during \n     the period beginning on February 2, 2004, and ending on the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, amendment No. 1903, which I am working on \nwith my colleagues to resolve, will provide impact aid funding to the \nchildren of the service personnel in Fort Carson, CO. It will restore \n$1.2 million in needed educational impact aid funding to the El Paso \nCounty School District No. 8. The money for this amendment has already \nbeen appropriated within the Department of Education budget.\n  The El Paso School District educates the children of thousands of \nservice men and women serving our Nation on the Fort Carson military \nbase. Many of the loved ones of these students and staff of the El Paso \nCounty School District have been deployed to Iraq as part of Operation \nIraqi Freedom. In fact, over 11,000 soldiers from Fort Carson are \ncurrently deployed in Iraq. That is one-half of Fort Carson's total \nforce.\n  Due to a technical error, the Department of Education has denied the \nschool district access to a $1.2 million set-aside for that school \ndistrict's program. The result is that school district may have to fire \nas many as 12 teachers and teachers' aides. This amendment simply \npermits the school to access the money already set aside for it.\n  I recognize this is not the traditional vehicle for this fix, but, \nfrankly, given the stakes for the school district and the fact that the \neducation of the children of the men and women from Fort Carson who are \nin Iraq is at stake, I believe we owe it to the families there to fix \nthis problem, and to do it now.\n  I note, too, that I have discussed this issue with the HELP \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page S10782]]\n\nChairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy have graciously consented to \nthe inclusion of this amendment on this bill. I have also been in close \ncontact with the Armed Services Committee and with Senators--from \nArizona and New Mexico--who face similar challenges. They all support \nthis measure.\n  I will work closely with the managers of this bill to dispose of this \namendment in the most efficient way.\n  And while I am here, Mr. President, I want to discuss four other \namendments I have offered or will shortly offer to this bill. The \namendments build on a good bill produced by Senators Stevens and \nInouye.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1887\n\n  The first amendment--amendment No. 1887--would simply change the name \nof the so-called ``death gratuity'' to the less insulting and more \nappropriate name, the ``fallen hero compensation.'' The Senate has \nconsidered--and adopted--a version of this amendment before. \nRegrettably, it was dropped out in the conference on the fiscal year \n2005 Iraq and Afghanistan emergency supplemental. I hope it stays in \nthis time.\n  It fixes something in current law that I consider unfair. We \ncurrently call the assistance that taxpayers make available to military \nsurvivors a death gratuity. The term gratuity means gift, and I do not \nbelieve that any of the widows, widowers, or children left behind think \nof that money as a gift. I refuse the term death gratuity. Senate \nAmendment 1887 will change the term to fallen hero compensation, a term \nthat more appropriately describes the sacrifice of these men for their \ncountry.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1888\n\n  Senate amendment No. 1888, offered by Senators Reed, Lieberman and \nmyself, mirrors an amendment Senators Chambliss, Lieberman, Reed and I \noffered to the Defense authorization bill. I think we have agreement to \nget a modified version of this amendment added to the Defense \nauthorization. Pending a clearer picture of the fate of that bill, I \nintend to protect my right to offer that amendment here.\n  This amendment will allow the Office of Special Events within the \nDepartment of Defense to provide more support to Paralympic \ncompetitions in the United States. This is a matter of basic fairness. \nThe Pentagon currently supports Olympic and other international games. \nThis amendment just makes it easier for the Pentagon to support such \ncompetitions. With so many of our men and women coming back from Iraq \ndisabled, it is important we provide these Olympic opportunities.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1900\n\n  Senate Amendment No. 1900 requires standards and accountability for \nAfghan security forces trained by the United States.\n  It passed by unanimous consent as part of the fiscal year 2005 Iraq \nand Afghanistan emergency supplemental, but was dropped in the \nconference committee--not understandably--because it was deemed \nunnecessary. I could not disagree more with the assessment of my \nesteemed colleagues in the conference committee.\n  Press accounts in recent weeks indicate that our training efforts in \nAfghanistan have been even less successful than our efforts in Iraq. \nEarlier this month LTG David Petraus, the top American trainer in Iraq, \nspent 5 days in Afghanistan to prepare a confidential assessment for \nthe Pentagon. While I have not seen the results of the assessment, I \ncan say without question that the decision to send General Petraus to \nAfghanistan was not an indication that the Pentagon believes things are \nprogressing well there.\n  And a series of recent press stories--from Stars and Stripes to the \nNew York Times--indicate that our soldiers deployed to Afghanistan are \nalso concerned about the status of training there.\n  A sergeant with the 391st Engineer Battalion was quoted by Stars and \nStripes as saying, in plain and simple language, ``The Afghan National \nArmy just isn't where it needs to be yet.''\n  According to the New York Times, by September, the Afghan army had \ngrown to about 26,000 troops and the Afghan police force to more than \n50,000. In contrast, the Iraqi army and special police forces have \n87,300 troops, and the Iraqi police force has about 104,300 officers.\n\n  The same article reports that until earlier this month, many Afghan \npolice recruits were training with wooden rifles. That is not a \nmisstatement. The force we expect to root out the world's worst opium \nproduction and trafficking efforts has been training--until earlier \nthis month--with wooden rifles.\n  Our commanding officer there, General Eikenberry, said this: ``When \nyou're trying to put the pieces back together again, you need a lot of \ntime and a lot of patience.'' He is, of course, right. Ensuring that \npatience--particularly as we consider yet another $50 billion \nsupplemental for Iraq and Afghanistan--requires more information. We \nsimply need more information about whether and how we are meeting our \nshared goal of an Afghan security force trained to a uniform standard.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that there are sufficient \nreporting requirements in place on our efforts in Afghanistan.\n  It is true that the Afghan Freedom and Support Act requires an update \non our training effort there. But nowhere in that act or anywhere in \nexisting reporting requirements is there a demand for clear reporting \non the standards to which these forces are being trained, or any demand \nfor clear accountability that the forces trained have met the standards \nwe are demanding they meet.\n  This amendment will ensure that we have the same reporting \nrequirements for Afghanistan as we already have for Iraq. It will \nprovide the accountability our taxpayers deserve and the success that \nour national security demands.\n  My last amendment, which I will introduce later today, is the result \nof a letter I received from one of my constituents. He is an Army \nspecialist and is currently deployed to Iraq. He wrote to me because \none of his friends was killed by an IED while sitting in the exposed \ngunner's seat of a Humvee. His letter reads as follows:\n\n       Two days ago a good friend of mine was killed in action \n     when an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonated next to \n     his Humvee. He was sitting in the gunner seat and pulling \n     rear security. I have seen automated guns that can go on the \n     top of these same Humvees. These guns are controlled from \n     inside the vehicle. Why are these guns not on every Humvee? I \n     do not have the time or the resources over here to check, but \n     if you were to look into it I believe you would be shocked at \n     the percentage of KIA's that were sitting in the gunner's \n     seat of Humvees since OIF 1 in 2003. All I do know is that \n     the four people that were inside the vehicle were physically \n     unharmed. If the answer is money, then I would really like to \n     know how much my friend's life was worth.\n\n  Since receiving that letter I have been in close contact with the \nPentagon about the technology this young specialist is referring to. \nThe Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station, known as CROWS, can move \nour soldiers out of the exposed gunner's seat and inside the protective \nshell of an up-armored Humvee. Behind me is a picture of how the CROWS \nsystem works. The CROWS system sits on top of the Humvee, with the \ngunner operating the weapons system from inside. My friend's friend who \nwas killed could have been safe because he would have been inside the \nprotective armor of the vehicle.\n  In a CROWS-equipped vehicle, the gunner controls a powerful weapons \nplatform through a computer screen. The system can be mounted on a \nvariety of platforms, and it gives a soldier the capability to acquire \nand engage targets while protected inside the vehicle--out of range of \nenemy fire or IED attacks.\n  Right now we have a few of these systems deployed in Iraq, and I am \ntold that our soldiers ``hot seat'' them, which means that when one of \nthese Humvees comes back from a patrol or an escort mission, another \ngroup of soldiers takes the vehicle out again as soon as they can gas \nit up.\n  According to an article I read in the American Legion magazine, CROWS \ngives our soldiers a powerful color daylight camera, a Generation 2 \nforward-looking infrared camera, and a laser range finder. According to \nanother article, the CROWS system has 98 percent accuracy and can \nengage the enemy beyond 2,000 meters with one-shot, one-kill accuracy \nand no collateral damage.\n  My amendment would add funding for the CROWS system in Title IX of \nthis bill so that the Pentagon can meet its target for production and \ndeployment of this important weapons system this year. As of June 27, \nthere were\n\n[[Page S10783]]\n\n24 CROWS systems in Iraq. If the Pentagon meets its funding targets in \nthis year's supplementals, we will be able to field 245 systems into \nIraq this year. To meet this target, this important system needs \nanother $28 million in the Senate bill--and another $103 million on the \nnext supplemental in early spring.\n  My amendment would add that additional funding so that we can meet \nthis important target.\n  These are five very important amendments to the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues--with \nSenator Stevens and Senator Inouye and all my colleagues in the \nSenate--to move forward and ensure that we enact these amendments for \nthe benefit of our men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No 1903\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on amendment No. 1903 to H.R. 2863, \nsubmitted by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, on behalf of the \nchairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens, and the ranking member, we are \nready to accept it.\n  I urge its approval.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am gratified that it was possible for the \nSenate to consent to the adoption of amendment No. 1903, offered by \nSenator Salazar of Colorado. I am grateful to Senator Salazar for \nintroducing this amendment, which will ensure that students attending a \nnumber of schools receiving assistance through the Impact Aid program--\nincluding the Window Rock Unified School District located on the Navajo \nNation in Arizona--are not punished for administrative errors made by \ndistrict personnel. I am also grateful to the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee for consenting to the \ninclusion of this amendment in this bill.\n  The Window Rock district is known is a 100 percent impacted district. \nThat is, because the land it encompasses is federally owned, it cannot \nrely on a local property tax base to fund school operations as most \ndistricts in our country can. It is important to note that the \nadministrative error that triggered this penalty--the loss of $1.2 \nmillion--was a one-time occurrence, and that Senator Enzi, the chairman \nof the committee with jurisdiction over this matter plans to address \nthat ongoing administrative problem that has occurred here the next \ntime Impact Aid is reauthorized. Moreover, as Senator Salazar rightly \nemphasized, the money here is not new money but previously appropriated \nfunds that had been withheld.\n  There is no question that district must take pains to ensure that \nrules and procedures are adhered to but in this case I agree with \nSenator Salazar that the penalty here was disproportionate and that, in \nany case, punishing reservation schoolchildren is not a particularly \nwell-targeted penalty. This amendment will rectify that, and I am \npleased that it will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1903) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii, a great \nfriend and truly an inspiration and hero for all of us in this Nation, \nfor his great contribution, not only during World War II but also his \ncontinuing contribution in the Senate--likewise, to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Stevens, for an equally remarkable contribution to \nour country during World War II, and their understanding of the \nimportance of doing everything we can to defend our country.\n\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, we had a hearing of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee where we had testify the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Myers; we had General Casey, who is in charge \nof the battles that are taking place over there in Iraq at this time; \nwe had General Abizaid, and we had Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  About that time, we learned that, at the behest of the ACLU, a \nFederal judge in New York by the name of Alvin Hellerstein has ordered \nthe Government to release more pictures of the Abu Ghraib abuse. This \nis despite the fact that General Myers said if you do this, it will \ncost American lives. Apparently, Hellerstein missed the Newsweek Koran \ndebacle, where 15 people were killed immediately after a bogus report \nby that publication, Newsweek, inciting impulsive violence that is done \non a case-by-case basis.\n  I think sooner or later we are going to have to do something about \nit, try to at least do all we can to make the American people aware of \nthe bias we have in the media.\n  I have had occasion, since I am on the Armed Services Committee, to \nprobably be over in Iraq more than anyone else. On one trip, the \nPresiding Officer was with me. All of us who have been over there will \nremember that every time we arrive the first thing the troops say to us \nis: Why is it the American people don't understand what we are doing? \nDon't they realize our country is under the greatest threat it has ever \nhad throughout its history? And don't they understand the resolve we \nhave and the fact that we know we are risking our lives? And I say to \nthem: They do know it, in spite of the fact that the media is wrong.\n  There is a lieutenant colonel by the name of Tim Ryan. He was in the \n1st Calvary in Iraq. He actually led a group into Fallujah. I am going \nto read one quote he made. He finally could not take it any longer. He \nsaid:\n\n       The inaccurate picture they paint [talking about the media] \n     has distorted the world view of the daily realities in Iraq. \n     The result is a further erosion of international support for \n     the United States' efforts there, and a strengthening of the \n     insurgents' resolve and recruiting efforts while weakening \n     our own. Through their incomplete, uninformed and unbalanced \n     reporting, many members of the media covering the war in Iraq \n     are aiding and abetting the enemy.\n\n  They are aiding and abetting the enemy. And to have this thing \nrevived on the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse--by the way, I have to say \nthis: Long before the public was even made aware of it, the military \nhad gone in, taken the necessary precautions, and had prosecuted those \nwho were guilty. That was done long before this came out in public.\n  Now, as far as the war is concerned, I think it is very important for \npeople to know we are being very victorious in the areas. It is a tough \nasymmetrical type of threat, an enemy we have never had before.\n  But I would suggest that on one of the trips when I went there, we \nspent\n\n[[Page S10784]]\n\nthe entire time in the Sunni Triangle. The Sunnis are supposed to be \nthe ones who do not like us. I can recall a general in Fallujah who at \none time had been the brigade commander for Saddam Hussein. He hated \nAmericans. Then, when he became the brigade commander for the Iraqi \nsecurity forces, he started embedded training with our Marines. He \nbecame so affectionately involved with our marines that he looked me in \nthe eyes and said: When they rotated me out, I cried. He loves \nAmericans now. He loves the freedoms we are bringing to that country. \nHe is joining in that fight.\n  Do you ever hear about this in the media? No, you do not hear about \nit.\n  At the same time, I was in Tikrit. Tikrit is the home of Saddam \nHussein. At that time, I think most of us remember, the training \nheadquarters in Tikrit for the Iraqi security forces was blown up, and \nthere were 40 either killed or seriously injured. Those were all \nIraqis. For every Iraqi who was killed or injured, their family \nreplaced that Iraqi trainee with another member of their family. Do you \nhear about that in the media? No, you do not hear about that in the \nmedia.\n  I can remember being in a Black Hawk helicopter, going some 50 feet \noff the ground, all throughout the Sunni Triangle, over almost every \nsquare foot, and seeing the kids down there. Something people do not \nrealize is how close our troops have become to these people. A lot of \ntimes, when you send candy and cookies to your troops, you think they \nare eating them and all that. Do you know what they are doing? They are \nrepackaging them, putting them in small packages, and when they go over \nan area in helicopters, they throw the packages down to the kids below. \nThose kids in the Sunni Triangle are waving American flags and jumping \nup and down and cheering. But you do not see that from the media.\n  I have to say, I do appreciate the fact that Bill O'Reilly, last \nnight, did draw the public's attention to this judge who is wanting to \nrelease more pictures of prisoner abuse. But I am critical of Bill \nO'Reilly because he said no one in Congress wants to do anything about \nit. No one wants to touch it. I want to remind him--and in doing so, I \nam not going to talk about what I did--but back in February of 2004, I \ndid complain about the fact that we were doing a great disservice to \nour troops by giving the Iraqis, giving the terrorists, giving the \nMiddle East, giving the American people the wrong picture of what is \ngoing on there.\n  I said I was not outraged. Let's keep in mind, in Abu Ghraib these \nprisoners were terrorists, these people killed Americans. And here we \nwere worrying about: Are we treating them properly?\n  I remember Zell Miller defended me. Nobody else would do that at that \ntime. I will read to you what he said, Zell Miller. You know all about \nZell Miller from the State of Georgia. He said:\n\n       Mr. President, here we go again, rushing to give aid and \n     comfort to our enemies--pushing, pulling, shoving, and \n     leaping over one another to assign blame and point the finger \n     at ``America the terrible,'' lining up in long lines at the \n     microphones to offer apologies to those poor, pitiful Iraqi \n     prisoners.\n\n  Of course, I do not condone all the things that went on in that \nprison, but I for one refuse to join in this national act of contrition \nover it. Those who are wringing their hands and shouting so loudly for \nheads to roll over this seem to have conveniently overlooked the fact \nthat someone's head has rolled, that of another innocent American \nbrutally murdered by terrorists.\n\n       Why is it there is more indignation over a photo of a \n     prisoner with underwear on his head than over the video of a \n     young American with no head at all? Why is it some in this \n     country still do not get it, that we are at war, a war \n     against terrorists who are plotting to kill us every day, \n     terrorists who will murder Americans at any time, any place, \n     any chance they get?\n       Yet here we are, America on its knees in front of our \n     enemy, begging for their forgiveness over the mistreatment of \n     prisoners, showing our enemy and the world once again how \n     easily America can get sidetracked, how easily America can \n     turn against itself.\n       Yes, a handful of soldiers went too far with their \n     interrogation. Clearly some of them were not properly trained \n     to handle such duty, but the way to deal with this is with \n     swift and sure punishment and immediate and better training.\n       There also needs to be more careful screening of who it is \n     we put in these kinds of sensitive situations--and no one \n     wants to hear this, and I am reluctant to say it, but there \n     should also be some serious questioning of having male and \n     female soldiers serving side by side in these kinds of \n     military missions. Instead, I worry that the . . . ``hand \n     wringers of America,'' will add to their membership and \n     continue to bash our country ad nauseam and, in doing so, \n     hand over more innocent Americans to the enemy on a silver \n     platter.\n       So I stand with Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma who stated that \n     he is more outraged by the outrage than by the treatment of \n     those prisoners.\n\n  I appreciated the fact that he came to my aid and made that statement \nback on May 13, 2004. The truth is out there. The media is not giving \nan accurate picture.\n  I will hold this up. This shows the number of editorials from the New \nYork Times and the Washington Post: The number of editorials that \ncovered the some 400,000 people tortured to death, put in mass graves \nin Iraq, a total of three editorials were written. The number of \neditorials since March of 2001 about the beheading of hostages by \nterrorists in Iraq and elsewhere, including Nicholas Berg and Daniel \nPearl, was eight. Yet the number of editorials since March of 2004 \nabout U.S. detainee policies, including Abu Ghraib, was 90. If that \nisn't bias.\n  We need to do something to stop this. This needs to be appealed to \nthe Supreme Court. I am going to be advising the Secretary of Defense \nof my feelings. Hopefully we can save some American lives by not \nreliving the pictures and this issue that has already cost many \nAmerican lives. If we actually show these pictures and revive it again, \nit will be aiding and abetting the enemy, and American lives will be \nlost.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10784-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10784-S10791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1716\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are an estimated 1.5 million \nindividuals who survived Hurricane Katrina who are now scattered across \nthe Nation. The stories of what they have already experienced are \nharrowing. They are suffering deprivation beyond what many of us could \nimagine, and their needs, especially for health care services, are \ngreater than most of us hope to ever know.\n  Today I come to the floor to share with you a few stories of those \nsurvivors and the problems they are facing in getting the health care \nservices they need. Many are uninsured and without means to pay for \nfood and shelter, let alone prescription drugs or a doctor's visit.\n  As I said when I spoke on the Senate floor on Wednesday night, one in \nthree survivors who have applied for Medicaid in Louisiana have been \nturned away. Why? Because they do not meet Medicaid's traditional \neligibility criteria.\n  These people need help. The Grassley-Baucus bill would deliver it to \nthem without delay, without uncertainty.\n  As we consider moving forward on this legislation, I remind my \ncolleagues of the faces of those we are trying to help. The survivors \nof Hurricane Katrina are people such as Eugene Johnson, age 57, a \nretired plumber and a diabetic who lost his home to Katrina. He, his \nwife, and four of his five children have moved from shelter to shelter. \nHe needs eye medicine that he left behind in New Orleans, but he cannot \nafford the $119 cost of the prescription. Without his medicine, he will \ngo blind.\n  An aid group, the Children's Health Fund, provided him with the \nmedicine and responded with these words:\n\n       We're a stopgap. Nothing more.\n  Maude Jordan, who slept on top of her refrigerator for 3 days before \nbeing rescued in New Orleans, penniless and diabetic, was taken to a \nrelief center in Baton Rouge. Her application was rejected by Medicaid. \nHowever, she was unable to establish eligibility because she could not \nestablish categorical eligibility; that is, she was rejected because--\nthis is what Medicaid said--she\n\n[[Page S10785]]\n\nwas ``unable to establish eligibility because cannot establish \ncategorical eligibility.'' Give me a break. She needs help now. That is \nwhat our bill does.\n  Dwayne Russ, 44, who had lived independently in a specially outfitted \napartment in New Orleans and maneuvered in an electric wheelchair, lost \nhis wheelchair when he was evacuated to Georgia and was placed in a \nnursing home. The local director of advocacy at a specialty hospital \nand rehabilitation center helped him out but stated:\n\n       Dwayne is just one person but he demonstrates there's lots \n     of people out there in his same predicament who are not \n     getting the help they need.\n\n  Tom Leynes, age 49, was a carpenter with an apartment just off the \nbeach, a happy family man. After Katrina, he found the bodies of his \ntwo little girls holding hands. Now he is struggling with depression, \nliving in a tent, taking medication, and trying to deal with the pain. \nHe needs help.\n  Theresa Bieller, 39, Gulfport, MS, was following a 15-pill regimen \nfor a heart problem and other conditions before the storm. Most of her \nprescriptions were already low or empty. To make matters worse, she had \nno electricity to operate a nebulizer for her 2-year-old asthmatic \ndaughter, Chloe. After a few days without medicine, her chest pain and \nweakness mounting, Bieller checked into a hospital. She came out the \nnext day with a mere 3 days' supply, not 15. She has no insurance and \nlittle cash to buy the expensive drugs. She needs help.\n  ``Precious'' is the name given by nursing home staff to an elderly \nwoman evacuated from New Orleans to Tennessee who cannot remember her \nname. Precious can talk, but she is unable to tell staff who she is or \nwhat her health care problems are. She spent 4 days in a hospital \nbefore becoming a resident at Bordeaux Long-Term Care. Who and how her \ncare will be paid for is unknown.\n  These survivors and hundreds of thousands like them are waiting for \nCongress to act to make sure they can get the health care services they \nneed. They cannot afford to wait another moment for this assistance, \nand neither can we. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nmotion which I will now offer by unanimous consent on the Grassley-\nBaucus Emergency Health Care Relief Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 214, S. 1716; that the Grassley-Baucus \nsubstitute bill which is at the desk be considered and agreed to; that \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; and that all of this occur with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, if I might momentarily reserve the right \nto object, Mr. Baucus, the Senator from Montana, has given a powerful \ndescription of people who are in great need of help. There is no \nquestion about that. Many of the States that are affected and other \nStates have taken steps to provide help in many areas, to set up \nuncompensated care funds to provide assistance to evacuees. I think the \nSenator from Montana would argue that it is not enough, he would like \nto do more, and his intention is obviously to bring this bill to the \nfloor to deal with some of these concerns. I have spoken before on this \nand will not speak at great length now. I do not believe this bill is \nthe right way and the best way to address those concerns. It has a cost \nof $9 billion. It does include provisions for assistance to States \nregardless of whether they have evacuees located in them, regardless \nwhether they were hit by the hurricanes.\n  I and other Members have been working with Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus and their staffs to try to come to some agreement, but \nthat has not happened. The question is not whether we should or want to \nprovide assistance, but we want to make sure we do it in a way that \nensures that resources get where they are most needed and in a way that \ntakes advantage of the $45 billion or so that has already been \nappropriated but has not been committed yet.\n  So I do object to the unanimous consent request. I know Senator \nLincoln from Arkansas and Senator Landrieu from Louisiana wish to speak \non this issue, and I will be more than happy to let each of them do so \nbefore returning to the floor, if I am able to do so today, and offer a \nfew remarks.\n  I do object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to support my colleague from \nMontana and his counterpart from Iowa, Chairman Grassley, who have \nstepped up to the plate, along with the Senator from Arkansas on the \nFinance Committee and other Members, to put forward a bill that is \nabsolutely crucial for the hundreds of thousands, in fact millions, of \npeople who have been impacted directly by these two storms and the \nsubsequent failing of a levee system in a major metropolitan area of \nthis Nation.\n  This is an unprecedented natural disaster. We have said it so much \nthat maybe it is a cliche and people are not quite understanding the \nmagnitude of this, but these hurricanes and the subsequent levee breaks \nhave truly displaced 1.5 million people who are without homes, without \nbusinesses, without their churches, without their synagogues, without \ntheir extended families around them, without their pharmacists, without \ntheir doctors, and they need help now.\n  I wish we had organized, funded, and resourced FEMA in such a way \nthat this could be taken care of, and actually the next time this \nhappens I hope we will have done just that. But for today, for the \npeople of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and now Texas, who were also \nhit with this last storm Rita just 6 days ago, we have not had time to \nreform and reorganize FEMA. So if we wait for FEMA to do this, these \npeople will not get the help they so desperately need.\n  We need some additional resources. That has been documented on radio, \ntelevision, in print newspapers from conservative to liberal to right \nup the middle that FEMA is not functioning as well as it once did. This \nis not about blaming anybody, this is about recognizing that fact and \nmoving on. So Senators Baucus and Grassley, the good leaders that they \nare, in a bipartisan fashion, without trying to blame anyone, have \nsaid: OK, let us step in the gap. We have people who need help. We have \nthe money to help them. Let us help them. They have put a bill together \nthat will do that.\n  We are now 31 days since Katrina made landfall, the most powerful \nstorm and subsequent levee break in the history of the country, and 6 \ndays since Rita. Maybe people can wait another week or two, maybe \nthree, maybe the people who just got hit 6 days ago can hold on \nliterally to their life, their health, their children, their parents, \nwith no health insurance, nowhere to get medical coverage, maybe they \ncan, but maybe they cannot. Why should we again make them victims of \nour inability to act?\n  This is not a Democratic bill. This is not a Republican bill. This is \na bill put together by Republicans and Democrats, tightly and carefully \ndrawn. Maybe some other additional compromises can be made; I do not \nknow, but what I do know is we have to pass this bill very shortly or \nwe are going to end up spiraling downward instead of upward in this \nregion.\n  The needs are great. It is not just health care and not just \nunemployment benefits, but when there are big cities and small towns \nfrom the Texas coast to the Louisiana coast to the Mississippi coast \nthat are obliterated, they are not functioning, there is not a building \nstanding--in some communities such as Waveland or in parts of Biloxi or \nCameron Parish, which is a large but sparsely populated parish in my \nState, 10,000 people, there is not a structure standing as far as the \neye can see, except the courthouse that was built in the early 1930s.\n  In New Orleans, still a large part in the West of the city is like a \nghost town. The mayor is doing a good job getting people back to the \ncity. Our city council is working hard. Our sheriffs, our policemen, \nour firemen--all of them are working very hard trying to get people \nback to the city. The health care system that existed just 32 days ago \nin New Orleans does not exist anymore. The one that existed in Waveland \nis completely gone. The one that was in Cameron is gone.\n\n[[Page S10786]]\n\n  So I wish FEMA had showed up the next day and said: Here are your \nhealth care cards, here is what you do, here is help. But that did not \nhappen. I am not here to fuss with FEMA; I am here to fix the problem. \nWe do not have a lot of time.\n  Let me say something else to my colleagues. Congress normally does \nnot work quickly. It is not what we are created to do. I understand \nthat. I have been in the Senate now 6 years. We are created to sort of \ngo slowly. It is because the Founders did not want us in passion to \nmove too quickly. I understand that. But we were also supposed to take \nthe responsibility to create agencies that could act quickly, \nefficiently, and effectively. In large measure, we have failed to do \nthat. It was not the Republicans' fault or the Democrats' fault or this \nadministration or the previous administration. I am not interested in \nthat. I am just saying the reality is the people--2 million and more \nbecause other people have been impacted--need help. We have to provide \nit.\n  There are some problems over in the House of Representatives, and \npeople know about those problems. I can understand that. But the \nSenate, Republicans and Democrats, has put together not just this bill, \nwe have put together four or five bills on education, health care, \nsmall business tax relief, community development block grants, getting \npeople immediate help to relieve their mortgage payments. If we do not \ndo this in the next few days, the economy of the gulf coast will begin \na downward spiral, and I do not know what else it will take with it.\n  Everybody keeps saying this is a local problem, this is about New \nOrleans or Plaquemine or Saint Bernard or just Waveland. It is not. It \nis a regional crisis. It is a very important region for our country. It \nis the heart of the oil and gas industry. It is the largest river \nsystem in the Nation. It is the largest fisheries and maritime complex \nin the country. This is not time to cower.\n  The Presiding Officer is from the South, a different part of the \nSouth, but as a Governor he most certainly understands the dynamics of \nthe Washington-Virginia region, and if it was impacted in such a way, \nit could have national ramifications. The Chair most certainly \nunderstands that. That is what is happening in our region.\n  Slidell, a population of 25,000--direct hit, the eye. Most of these \npeople work at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi or they work in \nNew Orleans East, which is completely gone--most of the residents are--\nat NASA at the Michoud plant. A lot of people in Slidell are poor, \nmiddle income and wealthy. The neighborhoods have all been hurt and \naffected. Some are doctors, some are small businesses.\n  Lake Charles, 71,000--not a direct hit but took a big hit in the \nhurricane, and the small cities around there, Sulphur and White Lake. I \nhave mentioned Waveland and Pass Christian, MS, Beaumont, TX, Bay Saint \nLouis, MS, just to name a few. These are the people, the working folks \nwho support the maritime and the energy industry.\n\n  It is a complex and comprehensive plan that is necessary for \nrebuilding, and we are working on the pieces of how to do that. There \nare many different ideas that are floating around. Something will come \ntogether, whether it is done for each individual State or whether we \nend up coming together as a gulf coast region and doing something. I am \nconfident, with the good ideas I have heard expressed here, some \ncompromise will come together.\n  But we can't wait for this huge structure of rebuilding before we \ntake care of some of the urgent and immediate needs: water, \nelectricity, food, health care--the basic needs, the basic fundamentals \nof those governments, so small businesses can actually have a permit to \nstay in business, so businesses who want to locate actually have \nsomewhere to send their letter: ``Dear Mr. Mayor, I would like to \nlocate in your town.''\n  If there is no city hall, there are no people on the payroll, there \nis no executive assistant to the mayor, where do they send the letter \nto open a business?\n  I know I might be exaggerating a little bit, but I do it to make the \npoint that, yes, we need tax cuts, yes, we need incentives for small \nbusiness, but no small businesses can operate on an island by \nthemselves. They actually have to plug into electricity and hook up to \nwater. They have to be able to file their permits with city hall.\n  We have cities right now deciding whether they need to lay off all of \ntheir employees, half of their employees--maybe we will lay off 10 \npercent every week until somebody in Washington hears us.\n  I don't know why we have trouble hearing in Washington. I am not \ncertain; maybe we talk too much. I most certainly myself could be \nblamed for that. I do a lot of talking. People say, Mary, you talk a \nlot, and I have to admit I probably talk too much and maybe I need to \nlisten a little bit more. But I am starting to think a lot of people in \nWashington are not listening because the people in my State are crying \ndesperately for help. I can hear people from Mississippi and Texas and \nAlabama crying for help. I know we do not normally act quickly, but we \nhave to figure out a way to do it.\n  I am not talking about taking the Treasury and dumping money down \nthere. I am talking about passing the bill of Senators Baucus and \nGrassley that was worked out by Democrats and Republicans. Maybe we can \ntighten it even more. Maybe there is a compromise even further to be \nhad. But there are a lot of Republicans supporting this bill. We need \nthe House and we need this administration to support this bill and get \nit passed before we leave next week.\n  I am going to conclude because Senator Lincoln, who is truly an \nexpert on this subject, wants to speak about this particular bill. But \nwhen we come back next week, I, as the Senator from Louisiana, want my \ncolleagues to understand it is going to be very difficult for any of \nus--and for me particularly--to go home next weekend for a break when \nnobody in Louisiana, very few people in Texas, Mississippi, or Alabama \nhave had any break and will not for a while. The only thing they are \ngoing to get as a break is broken homes and broken hearts, displaced \nfamilies. We cannot go home without helping them to more quickly get \nback home.\n  We are grateful for the hospitality of Arkansas and New York. I went \nto New York to personally thank New York Mayor Bloomberg and the police \nand firemen for everything they did to help us. I have had people from \nall over the world in my office, thanking them for coming to our aid--\ninternationally as well as nationally--but we cannot go home next week \nwithout helping the people from the gulf coast get home. We have to fix \nthe education crisis. I am going to list a few things we have to do \nbefore we leave:\n  We have to fix the education crisis. Lamar Alexander, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, has been working very hard all week on a compromise. I \nwould like to see his bill passed.\n  We have to pass the Grassley-Baucus, or Baucus-Grassley Medicaid \nproposal for health care for people.\n  We are going to have to pass some kind of mortgage relief. We have \nhundreds of thousands of people for whom--some of them--their home was \ntheir largest asset. If we do not give them some relief, they are going \nto lose the largest asset, the only real asset they have. Some people \nhave more than that, but most people have their wealth in their home. \nThey are getting ready to lose it all because of the conflicts between \nthe insurance companies and whether it was wind or whether it was \nflood. We are not asking for forgiveness, but a break for 6 months. We \nhave to give them that.\n  My staff told me today, a few minutes before I came down here--and I \nam sorry I do not have the document--that the report just came out that \nthere has been the highest number of people in the history of the \ncountry who have defaulted on credit card payments. Does anybody wonder \nwhy? Is anyone confused about why this month, this report would show \nthe highest number of people in the history of the country to default \non credit card payments? It is because the people who are lucky enough \nto have credit cards and who still have not yet hit their limit are \nusing their credit cards and their cash cards to literally stay alive. \nThey have no health insurance, no hospital, no job, and virtually no \naction from Congress. They have a credit card and they will hit their \nlimit.\n  So if we do not get some response quickly, in a bipartisan manner--I \nsee Harry Reid on the floor, our leader,\n\n[[Page S10787]]\n\nwho knows this well. For the last 2 weeks he has been working to keep \nDemocrats and Republicans working together to get this done--we are \ngoing to be in a serious situation. There are some things we have to \nget done next week.\n  In conclusion, I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for \nbringing their bill up again to the floor. We are going to have to get \nsome things done before we can go home next Friday. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in that regard next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, words to express my consternation are \ndifficult to come by right now.\n  First, to express my appreciation to Senator Baucus for his tireless \nefforts. Montana is a State without a lot of people. It is a State that \ngrows hardy stock. I have been there. Every time I have been there, it \nhas been with Senator Baucus. It is a beautiful State--big sky country. \nSenator Baucus does not have many people in his State that this \nlegislation he is attempting to put forward would help. He is doing it \nfor the precious people in the world, not just the one he talked about \nwith the name Precious, but precious people who have no place else to \ngo than to someone like Senator Baucus, who is a leader from the State \nof Montana, who finds himself in a situation of responsibility in which \nhe must reach out.\n  He first is a Senator from the State of Montana. But most important, \nhis title is a U.S. Senator. He is concerned about the people of \nLouisiana, about the people who may not be named Precious, but they are \nprecious. People in the State of Arkansas, because of close proximity \nto the areas where the hurricane struck, took in as many as 65,000 \npeople. They are not all there now--most of them are there--but \nwherever they have gone, they have left in the State of Arkansas a lot \nof unpaid bills. That is not because they are trying to get away from \nresponsibilities they have. It is because this Government has programs \nthat are supposed to protect people such as Precious. The State of \nArkansas deserves more from us than they have gotten.\n  This legislation Senator Baucus is propounding has the support of the \nvast majority of the Senate--I hope on a bipartisan basis.\n  While I am talking about bipartisanship, I have also to throw a \nbouquet to the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley. He has \ntaken a lot of grief for working with Senator Baucus to come up with \nthis legislation. Why did Chuck Grassley do that? Because he is a \nUnited States Senator and has responsibilities outside the State of \nIowa. This legislation is a model for bipartisan compromise.\n  Senator Lincoln was misled, I say with all due respect to some of my \ncolleagues, because she filed a similar amendment to the Commerce, \nJustice appropriations bill. Why did she withdraw this? She withdrew \nthe amendment in exchange for the promise that the Finance Committee \nwould reach a bipartisan agreement, which they did, and it would be \nbrought to the floor and we would vote on it. We have had no vote on \nit. Senators Baucus and Grassley fulfilled their promise. Her \nlegislation wasn't exactly like this, but it was so close it is not \nworth discussing the difference at this time. A handful of Senators \nhave blocked consideration of this bill on the floor, twice already \nthat I know of, and I think maybe three times.\n  The administration has the audacity to argue that this is not \nnecessary. They want to do it with a bunch of waivers. Anyone who \nunderstands Government knows that is absolutely ridiculous. Their \napproach creates more bureaucracy while failing to provide funding \nguarantees for the States that badly need this. More important, their \napproach not only leaves but has left tens of thousands of Katrina's \nvictims without care. We need to provide swift access to health care \nfor Katrina's victims with guarantees of full Federal funding for the \nStates who are generous and step forward at a time of need.\n  This is the time to allow us to pass this legislation. We are here \nnow on a Defense appropriations bill. That is what we are going to be \ndoing now. Couldn't we set aside 20 minutes, 10 minutes of debate on \neach side, and vote on this? We have a handful, maybe a half dozen \nSenators, holding up this legislation. Couldn't we spare the American \npeople 20 minutes of debate time on the Senate floor to deal with \npeople who are in dire need of help? As Senator Baucus explained, these \nare people who cannot even speak. We want to help them.\n  Continued failure to do so ignores the support of the bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate. It also ignores the wishes of this country's \nbipartisan Governors. The Governor from the State of Arkansas is a \nRepublican. The Governor from the State of Louisiana is a Democrat. \nThey want help. Mayors, county commissioners, patients, hospitals, \nnurses, doctors--my good friend, the majority leader of the Senate, is \na physician, a prominent, eminent transplant surgeon. I know how he \ncares about people who are sick. But we need the majority leader to \npush aside the loud voices of this very small minority over here and \nstop this. He needs to stop this and let us move forward with this \nlegislation.\n  He has decided not to run for reelection. He is going to be here a \nyear plus a few months. Is this a legacy that he wants to leave? \nKatrina? People, after 5 weeks, with no health care? Is it going to be \n7 weeks? 5 months? Maybe ignore them, maybe that is what they want, \nignore them.\n  These few Senators are standing complaining about maybe it costs too \nmuch. Maybe the first place the majority leader should look, with his \nfriends who are holding this up--let's look at the budget that is out \nhere, of which Protestant leaders of this country, on the night it was \npassed, said it would be an immoral document.\n\n  I am very grateful to the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, and \nmy friend of many years, Senator Baucus, for doing what they are doing, \nand the advocacy of Senator Lincoln from Arkansas. I so appreciate \ntheir not letting this issue die in the eyes of the American people. We \nmust continue doing this. It is the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ncolleagues in what we hope to be an opportunity to bring about an \nawareness of the dire need, not only of the evacuees, of those \nindividuals in the affected States who have received such incredible, \ndevastating natural disasters, but also the other Americans who are \ninvolved in this circumstance, the other Americans who have opened \ntheir hearts and their homes, their hospitals and clinics, their \npharmacies and their community centers, their church basements--these \ncommunities who have recognized what it means to be an American. They \nhave recognized what it means to be fellow Americans. They have \nrecognized what it means to be a good neighbor--I was, I guess--tongue \nin cheek--perhaps I was criticized being a little overpassionate on \nthis issue, so I will resume my good, soft-spoken, and commonsense \napproach to what I think to be a very real problem--to have deeper \nroots, in terms of what are the values we as Americans do profess and \nfor which we are willing to put our money where our mouth is when we \nspeak of these values to really talk about not the immediate impact but \nalso the long-term impact of the decisions that we make or we fail to \nmake in a timely way.\n\n  I will come at it from a different perspective. Maybe keeping my \ncompassion down a little bit will be helpful, but it is hard when we \nlook out and see the kind of compassion in the faces of the incredible \nconstituents that we serve, that we represent, that we have the \nprivilege of coming to this floor to represent each and every day.\n  We also look out at the private sector, for which we also can be \nproud, our Nation's health care providers and States that have been \nthere, at a time when vulnerable Americans need them the most.\n  The moment that Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast--now about a \nmonth ago--they jumped into action. They didn't have to be asked. They \ndidn't have to be told what their job was. Medical, professional, and \ncommunity leaders knew what their job was. Their job was to reach out \nto their neighbors, to their fellow Americans, and to their fellow \nhuman beings, who were in unbelievably devastating circumstances.\n  Cities and States all around the country opened their doors to \nwelcome Katrina survivors from throughout the\n\n[[Page S10788]]\n\ngulf coast region. Hospitals evacuated those who needed immediate \nattention. Doctors, nurses, and other health care providers have come \ntogether to provide health care to thousands of victims of this \nhorrific natural disaster in the gulf coast. And they did all of it \nwith no questions asked. They didn't ask: Who is going pay for this? \nWho is going to reimburse us? Who is going to take care of us? When the \nhigh numbers of Medicaid patients jump way beyond a survivable number, \nwho is going to make us whole?\n  They did not ask those questions because they believed in this \ncountry. They believed in who we are in this body as Americans, who \nknow our responsibility as neighbors. I happen to be somewhat of a \nneighbor of the President in the chair today. When my family is here \nand we are in session, northern Virginia provides an incredible \nneighborhood for us, just like our neighborhood in Little Rock.\n  We reach out to our fellow neighbors out there, as we do our \nneighbors in Arkansas.\n  It is what we are about in this country. It is being there for our \nfellow man. That is what these providers have done. Now it is our time.\n  We have an opportunity in this body to demonstrate that we understand \nwhat that means, we understand what it means to be a good American, to \nbe a good neighbor and to provide to our fellow man who is in the \nneediest time in his life the kind of care and love and support that he \nneeds--he or she--at that time without asking questions.\n  We could pass the Emergency Health Care Relief Act that Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley have worked so hard, in a bipartisan way, \nto bring about. I offered an amendment a month ago. I could see from my \nproviders, those doctors and nurses, those pharmacists who worked 24-7, \nwho spent their entire Labor Day weekend taking care of their neighbors \nfrom Mississippi and Louisiana, who didn't ask questions, I could see \nthat there was going to be a tremendous need down the road to provide \nthem piece of mind--that not only they were doing the right thing in \nhelping those neighbors but also that they could continue to do the \ngood job in providing services to the constituency, the community, and \nthe neighbors they have known all of their lives.\n  Many of our communities in east Arkansas, particularly in the Delta \nregion, are already disproportionately poverty counties. Hospitals and \nclinics, community health centers before Katrina were already \ndisproportionately Medicaid and Medicare facilities. They were already \nheavily dependent.\n  Tomorrow, they are going to take a cut. To save money in this \ncountry, to look at where we are going to save money, we are going to \nreduce the Federal share of their Medicaid reimbursement as of October \n1. Out of the 29 States that are going to see a cut in their Medicaid \nreimbursement, the most affected 7 States in the country by this \nnatural disaster will see a cut tomorrow in their reimbursement for the \nneediest, those who depend on the health care safety net of this \ncountry because we are so trapped, so paralyzed in the redtape that we \nwant to create in this body.\n  We do have an opportunity, though, to not only provide for Katrina \nsurvivors and victims of such an incredible natural disaster, but to \nalso prove to the private industry of this Nation that we can react \nwithout the unbelievable web of redtape that leaves them hanging, that \nleaves them holding the bag for the cost of something that we should be \nheld accountable for--not just held accountable because we are the \nGovernment but held accountable because we are the institution that \nwraps its arms around the American people when they are most in need. \nWe can do so in an efficient and effective way.\n  To my colleagues on the other side who are so desperately worried \nabout the cost of what we are doing, who are so afraid of helping one \ntoo many needy people, I say to you: Look at what we have become.\n  We have worked hard to keep the costs down. We have made it temporary \nso it wouldn't explode or overexpand--yes--an already very expansive \nprogram.\n  These people are not going home tomorrow.\n  I saw a piece in my hometown of Helena about a couple that left in \nhaste out of New Orleans. They went to Jackson and could find no help. \nThey went to Memphis and were sent to Tunica, MS. In Tunica, at the Red \nCross facility, they were told there was already overcapacity, and they \nwere simply sent away. They went to the next bridge that crossed the \ngreat Mississippi River and into my hometown, remembering someone they \nhad grown up with in their childhood from Chicago, and called him \nhoping that he would be there. He was. He was a pastor of a church. He \nhad opened his church doors and his home. He and his wife opened their \nhome and welcomed them in, as well as other families that were already \nliving there. They reached out to one of the most poverty-stricken \ncounties already in the country--reached out to a small health care \nfoundation that this community had managed to put together over the \nlast several years to try to reinvigorate their health care \ninfrastructure because they know how important it is as a component of \nrebuilding the vitality of their community and creating jobs for those \nwho want to get into a more independent situation.\n  But who locates businesses, or factories, or jobs in an area where \nyou don't have the necessary health care to begin with?\n  So you have a small nonprofit health care foundation paying for this \ncouple's health care because the providers have no earthly idea whether \ntheir Federal Government is going to be there for them.\n  We are bigger than that. We are not talking about an open-ended \npayment.\n  We are talking about a temporary ability to give peace of mind to the \npeople who, since day one when this disaster struck, have not asked \nquestions, have put their full faith and hope in this Federal \nGovernment--that for once it will disregard the redtape, look wisely at \nsomething that we already have in place, and look wisely at past \nexperience such as 9/11, when we were able to temporarily offer a \nhealth care safety net to survivors, and expect that we could come up \nwith the wisdom and the courage in this body to provide them the peace \nof mind that what they have done for their fellow man was the right \nthing to do.\n  We are talking about ensuring full Federal funding within the area \nwhere medical care has been provided for victims of the hurricane.\n  Medicaid is our health care safety net in this country. I think this \ncrisis itself has shown us how important this safety net is to our \nNation.\n  We have to make sure it does not unravel in the face of this national \nemergency.\n  Do we have concerns about Medicaid? Do we feel as though there are \nplaces where we could be more efficient and effective in that program? \nYou bet there are places we can be more efficient and effective.\n  Chairman Grassley has suggested some in terms of the cost of \nprescription drugs through Medicaid that can be negotiated in a better, \nmore efficient way, to provide more cost-effective drugs in that \nprogram and hopefully lead the way to seeing us provide more cost-\neffective pharmaceuticals for all other programs, as we do with the \nVeterans' Administration. We can do that when we work together.\n  To scrap a program designed as a safety net for people who are in the \nmost devastating circumstances is not the way to do that.\n  The administration promised they wanted to make whole financially the \nStates that were providing health coverage to evacuees. They say there \nis no need for the Grassley-Baucus initiative to provide full Federal \nfunding for Medicaid because they want to use waiver policy. What they \ndid not say is there is no Federal funding, no Federal dollars in \nproviding that waiver policy. There are no dollars that they will put \nbehind that.\n  They have asked Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, the affected \nStates, to sign memorandums of understanding to agree to be on the hook \nfinancially for a portion of the Medicaid costs of the survivors. How \nhumiliating to go to a State that has been devastated and say: We are \ngoing to put you on the hook right here and now for the costs of what \nyour neighbors want to provide. And we, as a nation, supposedly the \nwealthiest nation in the world, should be able to care for our American \ncitizens.\n\n[[Page S10789]]\n\n  We know those States are in no position financially to incur that \nkind of cost. Those three Governors testified before the Committee on \nFinance earlier this week. One of the Governors mentioned she did not \neven have the resources through her State legislature to overcome the \nincrease in costs they were going to see because of the loss of Federal \ndollars they are going to experience tomorrow when their Federal \nmatching portion of Medicaid is cut. That was before Katrina ever hit. \nBefore this devastation hit, they could not find the resources in their \nState--with a disproportionate share of low income, dependent on that \nsafety net--to be able to cover that. That was before the disaster.\n  Those Governors were highly concerned. They expressed it in their \ntestimony and in their questions and comments about making sure the \nFederal Government would be there for them to make them whole, to \nextend help to their States--Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--when \nthey were unable to deal with that under their current budgets.\n  For Arkansas, what does it mean? Does it mean we are left holding the \nbag due to budgetary issues, due to the fact that there are a few \npeople in the Senate that are more worried about the temporary spending \nto help the neediest of this devastation than they were about the $62 \nbillion we vetted for FEMA? Nobody objected to that. I have no \nobjections for taking the money from that. FEMA will probably come back \nand ask for more money anyway.\n  If it were your mother or your sister or brother or niece or nephew, \nuncle or parents or grandparents who had been displaced, who found \nthemselves in a strange community with a chronic illness--whether it \nwas heart disease, diabetes, perhaps cancer patients in need of \ntreatment, perhaps it was a child who needed health care--can you \nimagine the fear of thinking you would not be able to access it? Or to \nfind the provider that was providing it for you was scared to death \nthat it was going to push them over the edge; that if they helped \nenough of the people without any assurance or piece of mind, eventually \ntheir doors would be closed and they would no longer be able to provide \nthat kind of care.\n  As I toured the evacuee camps, there was an unbelievable feeling of \ngratitude among those displaced at a time when they had to have been \ndevastated. A woman was about to get married who had lost her wedding \ndress in New Orleans. But the people in our community in Arkansas \nprovided a wedding dress and a wedding for people who had been \ndisplaced who did not know where their other family members were, who \nwere separated, yet who were still so grateful for the food, the \nwarmth, the hospitality, the love and the arms that enveloped them in \nthe evacuee camps where they found themselves. Some of them have \ndispersed and gone to stay with cousins, aunts or uncles, sisters or \nbrothers in other States. That is one of the reasons we want the \nexpansion.\n  We do not want it just for the State of Arkansas. We know we have \nalready sent many evacuees to Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North \nCarolina, Iowa, Utah. They too are going to need health care because \nthey do not know when they will be able to go back, and they do not \nknow what they will be going back to. They do not know what happened to \ntheir jobs, the health care they may have had which is provided for in \nthis bill to keep private insurance still in the go-along to make sure \nwe make it whole as well, that we put as few people as possible into \nthat Federal safety net.\n  We have an opportunity. I hope as a nation we can realize spending \nmore and more time to try to bring up convoluted waivers--and our State \nMedicaid directors know that most of what is in the waivers is an empty \npromise. Last night in Arkansas, we got a waiver from HHS, but it \ncertainly has contributed only to more redtape in addition to what has \nalready been created. It provides more questions than answers. There is \nno money attached to it so it really is an empty promise that they will \ndo something about that.\n\n  The survivors, the health care providers in the States, have received \nno relief, no legitimate help. They are out there doing this without \nany assurance of from where it will come.\n  We do not know in the waivers what services will be cut. How do we \nexpect providers to know what they can provide and what they can't? \nMost of them were given the assurances from their State: Don't worry, \nwe are part of a great Nation.\n  When you treated those people over the weekend on Labor Day, we are \ngoing to ask them to go back in their minds 4 months and fill out the \nkind of paperwork to ensure they can get reimbursed for a tetanus shot \nor for a procedure, whatever it might have been. They, in good faith, \nhave filled out what the State has asked them to fill out to make sure \nthey are accountable for the services they have provided. Yet through \nthe waiver processes, there is yet one more piece of redtape, one more \nform to be filled out, one more web of Washington bureaucracy they will \nhave to deal with, without any guarantee that there is money behind it, \nthat there are resources to actually pay for that.\n  As we look at the waivers that have been offered, they create \nuncertainty about reimbursement. The administration has suggested \ncreating a new uncompensated care pool to reimburse health care \nproviders. When we asked where was the money going to come from, that \nis what they told us--a new uncompensated care pool. Why wouldn't we \nuse something that already exists, that already has fraud and abuse \nstipulations and cautions? Why wouldn't we use a system that we can \ncontinually improve on? But we will create a new uncompensated care \npool. We will not know where the money will come from.\n  I question my colleagues who are looking at fiscal responsibility. A \nnew uncompensated care pool does not have any parameters to it, it does \nnot have any protections from fraud and abuse.\n  Health care providers receive no guarantee about which services and \nhow much care will actually be reimbursed through this uncompensated \ncare pool. I go back to the story I used in committee the other day \nabout the woman who survived on top of her refrigerator. She was \nreported in The Economist. She survived on her refrigerator for 3 days \nand was able to finally get out. She made it as far as Baton Rouge. She \nwas a diabetic and quite in need of care. She went to seek out health \ncare and was told she was categorically incorrect and could not get \ncare.\n  That is the kind of redtape we will perpetuate if we do not look at \nthe reasonable proposal that Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus have \ncome together to produce.\n  Does it go as far as I would like it to go? It does not. I have been \nout there and have seen what the people are up against--both the \nproviders and the evacuees. I see what their families are going \nthrough--not just the lack of care, the lack of essentials or the \ncommunities that are trying to provide for them, but the dignity they \nwant to maintain while finding themselves without a home, without any \npossessions, dislocated from their family, their neighbors, the people \nwho care for them and love them, finding themselves in strange places \nwith people who are trying desperately to give them that sense of \ndignity and care.\n  In my soft-spoken and commonsense way, I appeal to my colleagues. We \ncan be fiscally responsible. We can look for ways we can provide care \nand peace of mind to those who need the health care and to those who, \nwithout reservation, are providing it to some of the neediest, most \ndestitute of Americans at this time in our country. I ask my \ncolleagues: Please, do not put this off for yet another week. Don't \nsend us home to our States to tell our providers, to tell the Americans \nthat have evacuated the gulf coast, that they are not important enough \nfor Congress to deal with this issue in a more timely fashion.\n  I compliment my friend from Montana for his and Senator Grassley's \nattempt to work through this issue and to bring about something that is \nnot only practical and common sense-oriented, that is limited in its \ntimeframe, but that is also compassionate toward our fellow Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know the people in the State of Arkansas \nalready know how much their Senator fights for them. I state my \nperspective: The Senator from Arkansas is one of the best. She is a \nbeliever. She fights\n\n[[Page S10790]]\n\nfor her people and all are grateful for that.\n  I make a couple of points. One, this legislation to help the health \ncare needs of evacuees and victims of Katrina is desperately needed. It \nwill pass. It is a question of when that willful band of three or four \nSenators will finally recognize that so we can get on with it and help \npeople who really need some people. That is what this comes down to.\n  I hear a couple of complaints about this legislation. Let me briefly \nexplain what this is all about. Basically, this is an effort to help \npeople. It is a modest effort. It is legislation designed by the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, a Republican, and myself, \nthe ranking Democrat. We have worked with all the members of the \ncommittee. We have worked with staffs of the committees.\n  We have worked with Senators from States directly affected, asking \ntheir views. This has been scrubbed. This has been examined. This has \nbeen worked over many days in many ways. It is balanced. It is not \nnearly as extreme as some of the suggestions of some Senators. I might \nsay, a couple of the Senators backed off and did not offer their \nlegislation on the promise that we in the Finance Committee would come \nup with a bill, a balanced bill--Senator Grassley and myself--and bring \nthat bill to the floor.\n  Well, here we are. It is a couple weeks later. We in the Finance \nCommittee did our part. It is up to the Senate now to do its part and \ntake up this bill and pass it, recognizing that this is only temporary. \nThis is only temporary relief, only temporary assistance for the health \ncare needs of the people in Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, the States \naffected. This is not permanent. By ``temporary,'' I mean about 5 \nmonths. My gosh, by the time we get this enacted, virtually a month \nwill have already passed. We are talking about legislation which is 5 \nmonths in duration.\n  Some are concerned: Well, gee, this is an additional entitlement. It \nis more money. It is an entitlement.\n  Well, I think it is important to remind ourselves that in our country \nwe have a program called Medicaid. What is Medicaid? Medicaid is our \nsafety net. It is kind of the last resort for people to get health care \nif they cannot afford it otherwise, or do not have it otherwise--they \ncannot get it at their place of employment, or if they are not wealthy, \nthey cannot buy health insurance.\n  So we have something called Medicaid. It is health care for low-\nincome people, people who do not have much money whatsoever. It is kind \nof a safety net to catch people who otherwise would fall between the \ncracks. It is directly designed for people such as those who are \naffected by Katrina.\n  So many people in Louisiana and other States do not have health \ninsurance. They do not have it. They do not have it for several \nreasons: One, they could not afford it; or they work for small \nbusinesses, which we know have a harder time providing health \ninsurance; or their business has laid them off, so they do not have \nhealth insurance because they do not have the income. For whatever \nreason, they do not have health insurance and they need health care \nnow--especially diabetics, especially people who need dialysis, \nespecially seniors, or maybe not seniors, who have very definite, \nimmediate, extraordinary health needs.\n  One out of three Medicaid applications in the States affected--at \nleast in Louisiana--has been turned down because they did not meet the \ncriteria. The criteria, as we know today, are pretty low. Or I might \nsay it differently. It is difficult to get on Medicaid if you have \nsignificant income or just some income, if you have some assets. If you \nhave some income and some assets, you do not get health care.\n  So we are saying, let's raise the eligibility criteria a little bit \nto the same measures we provided for victims of 9/11. It is the same \nprovision. The income levels are increased only very modestly, very \nslightly, and the categories that are covered are virtually the same.\n  I ask my colleagues, if the survivors of 9/11 could get this kind of \nMedicaid health care insurance, why in the world can't people who are \naffected by Katrina get the same coverage? It is the same. The people \nof New York City got help right away. It was passed very quickly. Why \ncan't the people of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama get \nthe same coverage? It does not make any sense to me.\n  Now, the catchall objection I heard earlier today was: Well, gee, \nthis isn't quite right. It is not the best. Well, there is never going \nto be ``the best.'' We all know it is often important to not let \nperfection be the enemy of the good. Is it going to be perfect? No. Is \nit very, very good? Yes. Can we adjust it and change it if we need to \nmake some changes? Certainly. But let's begin.\n  This is an emergency. It is a bit reminiscent--I do not want to be \ntoo melodramatic about this, but we have had crises in our Nation's \npast, whether it was Pearl Harbor, Sputnik, or whatever it might have \nbeen, and this Congress reacted very quickly to those crises. This, \ntoo, is a crisis for these people in that part of the country. We need \nto act quickly. It is a crisis for them. If we do not act, many people \nwill not get the health care they need; or, looking at it differently, \nthey are going to be burdened with an additional concern, whether they \nare going to get their health care, whether they are covered under \nMedicaid, whether it is going to be there. That will be added to all \nthe other problems they have: Where are they going to live? Where are \nsome of their lost loved ones? What is next for them? Are they going to \nbe able to make their car payment or house payment? The problems the \npeople in Louisiana and these other States are coming up with are \nincredible. Why can't we, then, in a small way, help with health care?\n  Now, I have heard the objection: Well, gee, Senator, your legislation \ndoes not allow a reduction in FMAP payments to 29 States. After all, 29 \nStates is a lot of States. There are only about three or four or five \nor six or seven States that are most affected.\n  Let me explain this. Currently, there is a scheduled reduction in \nFederal payments to States. It is called FMAP. It is irrespective of \nKatrina. It is in the law. It is because certain States, a few years \nago, had higher incomes. Because of averaging and data lags, the \ninformation is quite dated. But the point is, this legislation says, \nOK, for those 29 States that are going to have their Federal payments \nto cover Medicaid drop automatically, we are saying they will not \ndrop--temporarily. We are not increasing the Federal payment to States. \nWe are not increasing it at all. We are saying it will not drop for 29 \nStates for which it otherwise is scheduled to drop. And this is only \ntemporary. I think it is for a year's term.\n  Well, why is that so important? Why is it important not to let \nFederal payments drop to those States? It is pretty simple. These are \nStates which have a lot of additional costs. A lot of evacuees are \ngoing to these States. Many are going to these States, which puts an \nadditional burden on these States. Now, it is not just Medicaid \nburdens; these States are going to have to pay additional Medicaid \ncosts or other social services costs, other education costs, to pay for \nthe people who are now coming to their States and who need help.\n  Let me give you a little bit of a flavor of what that means in terms \nof dollars and cents. Let's take the State of Arizona. They are \nscheduled to have about a half a percent reduction. That is a drop of \n$30 million in payments to the State of Arizona for Medicaid, and \nthat State is now going to pick up at least 2,000 more people. That \ndoes not make a lot of sense.\n\n  Let's take the State of Nevada: It is about a 1.14-percent drop in \nFederal payments under Medicaid. That is about $14 million less Nevada \nis going to otherwise receive. They have to pick up about 1,500 \nadditional people.\n  Let's take the State of Oklahoma. It is almost a 2.25-percent \nreduction. That is about a $66 million reduction. There are about 4,000 \npeople, at least who we know of, who are going to be living \ntemporarily, at least, in Oklahoma, and they will have to pick up those \nother costs.\n  We are not asking for an increase. We are just saying: No reduction \nin Federal payments to States affected.\n  I might add that 25 of the 29 States on this list are States where \nthe President has declared a public health emergency because of \nKatrina. Twenty-five of the 29 States are States where the\n\n[[Page S10791]]\n\nPresident has declared a public health emergency, indicating there are \nadditional pressures on those States and additional pressures on the \npeople in those States. We are trying to provide some temporary help.\n  Now, you hear sometimes: Well, the administration is suggesting a \nwaiver. Senators mentioned the problems with the waiver. I will very \nbriefly list them. One is that the waiver does not cover a lot of \npeople who are going to need care. A major category is childless \nadults. If you are a single man or single woman, you do not get any \nassistance here. That does not make any sense. It does make sense to \ngive assistance to women and children, but it does not make sense not \nto give any assistance to a single man or a single woman. That is an \neffect of the waiver that the administration is talking about.\n  Why create all these additional misconceptions? Let's say, as the \nlegislation does: OK, we are going to utilize this Medicaid safety net, \nand I don't care whether you are single, you are a parent, you are old, \nor what; if you do not have the income, you are covered. We are going \nto help you out for 5 months. What is wrong with that? Doesn't that \nmake sense? To me, it makes a lot more sense.\n  It is important to add, too, this legislation is strongly supported \nby the Governors in the States affected. It is bipartisan, supported by \nRepublican Governors, Democratic Governors. Governor Riley of Alabama \nwants the legislation. Governor Barbour of Mississippi wants this \nlegislation. Governor Blanco of Louisiana wants this legislation. It is \nsupported by Republicans and Democrats.\n  A lot of Senators around here say: Well, gee, the local people know \nwhat the needs are. The local people know best. We in Congress are too \ntop-down. We issue these ultimatums, we pass this legislation, but it \nis the local people who know.\n  It is important to note, the local people want this. It is the local \npeople who are asking us for this. The Senators from Louisiana--from \nboth sides of the aisle--want this. Senator Lott and Senator Cochran \nwant this. It is the same with the Senators from Alabama, who are both \nRepublicans. They want this legislation. It is the same with the \nSenators from Louisiana. One is a Republican and one is a Democrat. \nThey want this. I mentioned the Governors want it. The House \ndelegations want it. Again, I remind my colleagues, it is temporary. It \nis only for 5 months, this Medicaid help.\n  Now let's get into the question of uncompensated care to hospitals. \nThis legislation--again, scrubbed, worked over--provides for $800 \nmillion of uncompensated care to providers in the States affected, to \nbe administered by HHS, and grants for uncompensated care for those \nhospitals; whereas, the administration says: Well, we will give \nuncompensated care in waivers. But we are not saying how much. We are \nnot saying how. It is only a promise. I am saying, it is deeds. It is \nnot words. It is deeds.\n  I might also add the waiver process the administration talks about as \nan alternative has huge, big problems, to be honest about it. What are \nthey? Well, the basic problem is this. The administration says: OK, we \nwill make you States whole under Medicaid; that is, you have the \ncharges, then you bill us, and we will pay you. There is a real \nquestion whether they have the authority under the law to do that. It \nis a huge issue. In fact, coming to work today, I heard a George \nWashington professor talk about this. She says under the law they \ncannot do that.\n  Do you know what I think is going to happen? Some are going to duck \nunder this waiver ``idea'' saying: OK, it will make you whole, States. \nThen there will be a big debate whether legally the administration can \ndo that. Then, well, it kind of fades away and--guess what--these \nStates are not going to get it. These hospitals are not going to get \nthat extra uncompensated care, either.\n  All I am saying is, this is a quick, certain way. It is Medicaid. We \nall know Medicaid. We know it works. The provider networks are set up. \nThe process is set up. The people are there. So let's raise the income \nlevels a little bit--just a little bit--temporarily, for 5 months. \nLet's get on with it, rather than this very uncertain administrative \nidea of waivers and what they are, what they can and cannot do.\n  We have already established under the law one thing they cannot do. \nThey cannot give Medicaid assistance by picking and choosing in that \npicking and choosing, there is discrimination against who gets help and \nwho does not.\n  Katrina survivors need to know, are they going to get any help or \nnot? They do not need the additional worry of whether they are going to \nbe discriminated against.\n  Finally, I would like to say, this question before us, to a large \ndegree, tests us as a Nation, as a people, as a Senate, as a Congress. \nWho are we? What do we stand for? Are we going to stand here and bicker \nover minute details while people need help? Are we going to be kind of \nFEMA-like and be hesitant and not respond immediately? What signal does \nthat send? What signal does that send to the people affected? What \nsignal does that send to the rest of the country? What signal does that \nsend to the world?\n  Here we are, the Congress is bickering over whether to provide health \ncare benefits to the people who need them, people who are down and out \nbecause of a natural disaster.\n\n  We are supposed to be America, a big heart, model for the world. \nSure, we have to make sure there is no waste. That is one of the \nreasons we should go through Medicaid. There are already antifraud \nprovisions and protections set up under Medicaid today. That is already \nin existence. It is pretty simple. It doesn't take rocket science to \nfigure this one out. Let's help these people. Let's do it now. We will \ntake up other disaster assistance matters in subsequent weeks and days \nand have an opportunity then to make adjustments that may or may not \nseem necessary. But at the very least, let's pass this legislation now.\n  We are going to pass it. Obviously, if you are going to do something, \nyou might as well do it earlier rather than later and get on with it so \nwe can get on with other things. We are going to pass this. I hope \nSenators who are opposed to this, for reasons I can't fully understand, \nwill finally sit down and say: OK, sometimes discretion is the better \npart of valor. Let's pass it and get on with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me speak briefly to a related subject \ndealing with relief for those adversely affected by hurricanes in the \ngulf region, the other side of the coin. We have a lot of programs we \nare going to have to fund for the relief of the people who suffered. A \nlot of us have felt we ought to be careful about how we spend that \nmoney and even make sure as much as possible we cut spending in other \nareas to pay for it. There are those who say the way to ensure we have \nenough money for these programs is to raise taxes. What I want to \naddress is the fact that raising taxes, especially at this point, taxes \nthat ironically would impact the very people who have suffered, would \nbe absolutely the wrong thing for those people, for their communities, \nfor the families of our country, for the economy, and for job creation.\n  Raising taxes is not something you do when you want to help people, \nespecially since we know the bulk of the growth that is going to occur \nin that region is going to come from the private sector. You don't make \nthe private sector more healthy by extracting more money from it.\n  Specifically, we are talking about a process in the Senate whereby we \nput real life into the budget we passed earlier this year through two \nbills we call the reconciliation bills, essentially reconciling income \nto our outgo. One of those bills deals with some of the tax policy we \nfirst effected in the year 2001 and then in the year 2003. Remember, \nthe economy wasn't doing so well back then. When President Bush was \nelected in 2001, he said: We need to reduce taxes in some areas and \nthereby help the economy get back on its feet.\n  In 2003, we brought that tax relief forward to that date and the \neconomy took off. Marginal rates were reduced for all taxpayers. There \nwere two taxes especially that helped with investment and job creation. \nWe reduced substantially the tax on dividends issued by\n\n[[Page S10792]]\n\nbusinesses, by corporations. We also reduced the taxes on capital \ngains. Capital gains are paid on virtually anything you sell and make a \nprofit on.\n  As a result of reducing those tax rates, did we have less money come \ninto the Treasury? No. The reduction of the tax rates ironically caused \nall kinds of economic activity to occur because people weren't going to \npay as much taxes on it, with the result that the taxes came rolling \ninto the Federal Treasury. That is the situation we see today: Record-\nbreaking revenues coming in from the payment of taxes because we \nreduced the tax rate.\n  Were we to allow those tax rates to go back up again, we can fully \nexpect the exact opposite effect: less economic activity to tax; \ntherefore, less taxes collected. It doesn't make any difference if you \nraise the tax rate; if there is nothing to tax, then you are not going \nto bring more revenue into the Treasury. Both because it would hurt the \npeople you are trying to help in the gulf and around the country, and \nbecause it would bring in less revenue to the Treasury, a tax increase \nat this time is exactly the wrong response.\n  There is an interesting phenomenon--I know the Presiding Officer is \naware of it because he takes a significant role in studying the economy \nand its effects--economists who look at this say we will be able to \nrebuild from the effects of the two hurricanes. Our economy is big and \nstrong, and there won't be any lingering damage. There will be a blip \nin this third quarter. But by the fourth quarter, our economy will be \nstrong again.\n  What they are worried about is the signals coming out of Washington \nthat maybe in this reconciliation bill, we won't continue to support \nthe lower capital gains and dividends tax rates, that we will in effect \nallow those tax rates to increase by not doing anything. Those tax \nrates are scheduled to increase in the year 2008, if we don't stop it. \nWe are going to have a tax increase then, if we don't say we are going \nto continue the 15-percent rate. We have the chance to do that this \nyear. I will explain why it is important to do it this year.\n  What we are asking for is the ability to continue the tax rate as it \nis on capital gains and dividends 2 more years, from 2008 to 2010. That \nis important for a reason I will discuss in a moment. Some people say: \nAt a time that we have to pay for hurricane damage and reconstruction \nand rebuilding, we ought to raise taxes, not keep the same rate we \nhave.\n  The point is, the tax rate we have today extends on through the year \n2008. We don't gain anything by raising that tax rate to so-called pay \nfor the hurricane rebuilding. That doesn't happen until the beginning \nof the year 2009. We are not able to gain revenue by allowing that tax \nrate to go back up again, since it is not going to go back up again, if \nat all, until the year 2009. There is nothing to be gained by not \nacting and everything to be gained by sending a signal to the markets \nthat we are serious about keeping these rates at the level they are.\n  Why is this important? It is important because when people decide \nwhether to invest, they foresee what the length of their investment \nwill be, what they have to pay for it now, what they are going to make \non it, and what kind of taxes they will have to pay. That is how they \ndecide whether to invest. They capitalize their investment based upon \nthe expectation of profit which is a condition of both what they will \nsell for and what the tax rate will be. We know what the tax rate will \nbe through the year 2008. The question they ask is, what about the year \n2009 and 2010?\n\n  Most of the investments made today are investments that are going to \nplay out over the next 3, 4, or 5 years. It doesn't do a lot of good to \nlook at the tax rates tomorrow or the next day. We do want to look at \nthe tax rates in the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. That is when the \nprofits will be realized, the taxes will be paid. It is hugely \nimportant what the tax rate is going to be in the year 2009 and 2010. \nThat is why we have to act this year to extend the current law to make \nsure those rates stay right where they are, that we don't have a rate \nincrease.\n  There are some interesting statistics which I know the Chair is aware \nof, but I want to remind my colleagues with respect to the state of the \neconomy today and the impact of the hurricane damage on it. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates the two hurricanes will have only \nminimal effect on economic growth. They project that GDP growth in the \nsecond half of 2005 could be one-half percent slower than was \npreviously predicted, but that by the fourth quarter and beyond, \neconomic growth will return to its normal levels. We do know the \neconomy was firing on all cylinders before the hurricane. In August, \nthe month of the hurricane, CBO forecast the economy would ``continue \nto expand at a healthy pace during the second half of 2005'', and CBO \nprojected GDP growth would grow by 3.7 percent in 2005, by 3.4 percent \nin 2006. As I said, the economy is doing great, firing on all \ncylinders.\n  In August, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.9 percent, one of the \nlowest percentages ever. In May 2003, when the tax cuts were enacted, \nthe unemployment rate was 6.1 percent. So it went from 6.1 down to 4.9. \nMost economists believe the tax cuts had a lot to do with that.\n  I might contrast to our European friends. Through the first half of \n2005, the growth rate in the Euro area was 1.1 percent. The \nunemployment rate there stands at 8.6 percent. So we are doing very \nwell in this country. Our economy is moving right along. It is not \ngoing to be adversely affected by the hurricane rebuilding. What we \ndon't want to do is anything to slow that economic growth down, stop \nthis engine of production. Tax increases would do exactly that.\n  Since the year 2003, when the tax cuts were enacted into law, we have \nseen a sharp increase in revenues coming into the Treasury. While \nprivate economists expected that, it didn't show up in official \nGovernment estimates. In August, the CBO acknowledged that the revenues \nfor 2005 will be $85 billion more than they were projected in March of \nthis year. That is how wrong the Government was. It could even be more \nthan that. So from March to now, we know we are going to have at least \n$85 billion more in Federal revenues than were projected.\n  Here is the great statistic: CBO now projects the Treasury will \ncollect $262 billion more in revenues in 2005 than in 2004, an \nunprecedented increase--$262 billion more. This is at lower tax rates. \nHow can that be? When you have lower tax rates, it encourages people to \ninvest more because they are not going to have to pay as much taxes. \nThat investment produces economic growth which, in turn, is taxed, and \nthat is why we are getting all the increased revenues to the Treasury.\n  Interestingly, corporate income tax payments are up 42 percent this \nyear. They were able to expand their operations because they have been \nable to attract additional investment. They are being attracted in part \nby the lower rates on dividends and capital gains.\n  What would happen if we allowed those rates to increase? The \nnonwithheld income tax receipts are up 28 percent. What are these? \nThese are the tax payments that don't come from employer withholding. \nIn other words, they come from things such as capital gains and \ndividend income. Clearly, the 2003 reductions in the cap gains and \ndividends are having an impact there. We have to use the reconciliation \nbill this year to maintain the lower rates for capital gains and \ndividends and keep our economy growing.\n  In summary, there is a strong economy that we don't want to hurt by \nraising taxes. Beyond being concerned about the tax dollars coming into \nthe Treasury, we know the primary reason to keep the rates on dividends \nand capital gains relatively low is to give individuals and businesses \nthe opportunity to invest, give businesses the capital they need to \nexpand and create jobs. It expands the economic pie. It improves the \nstandard of living for everyone. All Americans will benefit from \nkeeping the 2003 tax rate on dividends and capital gains in place \nthrough the year 2010. I urge my colleagues not to respond to the siren \nsong of raising money to rebuild from the hurricanes by raising taxes. \nIt won't work. It will slow the economy down and that will hurt not \nonly general revenues to the Treasury, but American families and \nindividuals as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. On September 3, 2005, America lost one of its greatest \npublic servants when, following a year-long battle with cancer, William \nHubbs Rehnquist passed away at the age of 80. At the time of his death, \nhe had been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court for 33 distinguished \nyears, having served as Chief Justice since 1986 and previously as an \nassociate justice, appointed in 1972.\n  Much of William Rehnquist's professional career was dedicated to \npublic service. He served his country honorably in the U.S. Army Air \nCorps during World War II from 1943-1946. After his military service, \nhe earned an undergraduate, a masters' and a law degree from Stanford \nUniversity. Even further demonstrating his intellectual acumen, \nRehnquist also graduated with a master's degree from Harvard University \nand was first in his class at Stanford University Law School. After law \nschool, he became a Supreme Court clerk for Associate Justice Robert \nJackson before leaving for private practice in Arizona. In 1969, \nJustice Rehnquist joined the Nixon administration as an Assistant \nAttorney General where he served until 1971. That year, President Nixon \nnominated William H. Rehnquist to be on the Supreme Court; the \nfollowing year, he was confirmed to be an associate justice by the U.S. \nSenate.\n  It was on the Supreme Court that William Rehnquist built his \nreputation as one of the great legal minds of our time. His tenure on \nthe high court of the land, both as an associate justice and as the \nChief Justice, was an extraordinary achievement. I was particularly \nimpressed with his leadership as the head of the entire Federal \njudiciary, as well as his affable personal demeanor on the bench and \noff, both of which were important traits in his role as Chief.\n  I respect immensely the way in which Chief Justice Rehnquist served \non the Court with honor and restraint. As a justice, he fairly and \nproperly interpreted the words of the Constitution without usurping the \nrights of the American people and those of the States to make laws as \nthey deem appropriate rather than allowing un-\nelected judges who are appointed for life to substitute their personal \npolitical views for the popular will of the people.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist clearly understood that judges ought to apply \nthe law and Constitution, not invent the law or amend the Constitution \nby judicial decree. And I believe that he perfectly embodied what I \nconsider to be the proper role of a justice and that America should be \ngrateful for his long and distinguished public service on the bench.\n  Our Nation was so fortunate to have a man of William Rehnquist's \nintelligence and legal experience in public service for so many years. \nAs a Supreme Court Justice, he was a decent, dedicated, steady, and \nprincipled jurist whose legal brilliance and knowledge will be \ndifficult to replace. Chief Justice Rehnquist deserves America's \ngratitude for his over three decades of dedicated service on the \nSupreme Court and a life devoted to the service of this great Nation \nand its citizens.\n  My condolences go out to his family, in particular his three \nchildren, James, Janet, and Nancy, during this difficult time.\n  May he rest in peace.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I as deeply saddened to learn of the \npassing of Chief Justice William Rehnquist. He will most certainly be \nremembered as one of this Nation's greatest Chief Justices.\n  During his 33 years of distinguished service on the High Court, Chief \nJustice Rehnquist served with tremendous wisdom, skill, and intellect. \nHis legacy will be defined by his calm and steady leadership, his \nstaunch defense of the constitution, and his support of an independent \njudiciary.\n  Born into a modest home in the Midwest, Rehnquist enlisted in the \nArmy at age 19 during World War II. He went on to have a very \nimpressive academic career, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in \npolitical science from Stanford University. In 1950, Rehnquist received \na master's degree in government from Harvard University. He later \nreturned to Stanford Law School, where he graduated first in his class \nand served as the editor of the law review.\n  After law school, Rehnquist served as a law clerk to Associate \nSupreme Court Justice Robert Jackson. He then settled in Phoenix, AZ, \nwith his wife Nancy, where he spent 20 years in successful private \npractice. In 1968, Rehnquist returned to Washington, DC, to serve as \nPresident Nixon's Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal \nCounsel. In 1972, William Rehnquist became the 100th Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  I expect we will hear much discussion in the coming years about the \nlegacy of Chief Justice Rehnquist. But I am confident that a \nsignificant part of his legacy, his strong leadership of the Court, \nwill be unquestionable. President Bush said at Rehnquist's memorial \nservice, ``He built consensus through openness and collegiality.'' \nLikewise, praise from so many of his colleagues and friends serve as a \ntrue testament to William Rehnquist's ability to treat people \ngraciously and fairly, both from the bench and in his personal life.\n  The praise for his professional life is certainly plentiful, but we \nknow that most important to William Rehnquist was his family. He was \ngreatly loved as a husband, father, grandfather, and uncle. His \ndaughters Nancy and Janet joked that dating your father was completely \nunderrated, after they had the pleasure of accompanying their father \naround Washington and on foreign trips after the death of their mother. \nHe was a family man, first and foremost.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist deserves our praise and our tremendous \ngratitude for his dedicated service to this country. Our Nation mourns \nthe passing of this great man. The significant contributions he made, \npersonally and professionally, will certainly be remembered always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10793-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10793-S10794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEDICARE DO NOT CALL ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I have joined Senator Corzine to \nintroduce the Medicare Do Not Call Act. I am pleased to cosponsor this \nimportant legislation which will protect Medicare beneficiaries from \nbeing subjected to telemarketing campaigns related to the new Medicare \nPart D prescription drug program.\n  The Part D program will begin in January 2006, and as many of my \ncolleagues are already aware, this program will turn the administration \nof the benefit over to health insurance companies. Between now and \nJanuary 1, 2006, Medicare beneficiaries will receive a great deal of \ninformation from the Federal Government, insurance companies, and local \norganizations regarding how to sign up for the program. Many \nbeneficiaries have already received information about the low-income \ncoverage options.\n  Just last week the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nannounced which health plans have been approved to offer the benefit. \nIn South Dakota, there will be 18 companies offering the stand-alone \nprescription drug plan or PDP. Three companies will offer the Medicare \nAdvantage plan, which is an HMO or Health Maintenance Organization type \nplan.\n  Starting in October, all of these companies will be allowed to start \nmarketing their plans. While I do think it is important for seniors to \nhave access to information about the various options, I do not think it \nis OK for these companies to be promoting their products through \naggressive telemarketing campaigns. There are plenty of other, less \ninvasive ways for these companies to get information about their Part D \nproduct to Medicare beneficiaries and I encourage those efforts, \nwhether they be mailings, holding information sessions or releasing \nnewspaper and television ads.\n  The Medicare Do Not Call Act would prohibit health plans from \ntelemarketing their new Medicare prescription drug plans to \nbeneficiaries. The bill permits representatives of insurance companies \noffering the Medicare prescription drug benefit to speak\n\n[[Page S10794]]\n\nwith and return calls to beneficiaries who initiate contact and permits \nplans to call beneficiaries that are already enrolled in their plans. \nThe prohibition only applies to solicitation calls. Those companies \nthat violate the law are subjected to criminal penalties for \ntelemarketing fraud related to the program.\n  I think that this provision is very important, so seniors do not feel \ntheir privacy is being violated by constant phone calls from numerous \ninsurance companies calling their homes. It is important that seniors \ndo not feel pressured to choose one plan or another because of \npersistent telemarketers.\n  Starting November 15, 2005, all seniors will be able to start \nselecting which insurance company they would like to administer their \ndrug benefit. It is my hope that between now and then the information \nsent to beneficiaries is accessible and easily understood. I do have \ngreat concern that many seniors are going to feel extremely \noverwhelmed, confused and frankly very frustrated about the information \nthey receive about the multitude of coverage options. I think that the \nMedicare Do Not Call Act is one step we can take to simplify the \nprocess and help seniors.\n  While I did not support final passage of the legislation that created \nthis program because of several concerns I have about how it will \nimpact South Dakotans, I still think it is important for seniors to \nexamine this program closely and decide for themselves whether the new \nMedicare Part D drug benefit will be worthwhile to them. I will \ncontinue to work hard to ensure that the people of my State have \nsufficient information before they are expected to make a decision. I \nwill also continue to support legislation and other initiatives to make \nimprovements to the program and the administration of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10794-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LIVESTOCK MANDATORY REPORTING ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I was forced to place a hold on \nH.R. 3408 that will reauthorize for 5 years the Livestock Mandatory \nReporting Act of 1999, LMPR.\n  I introduced S. 1617 with Senator Harkin that will extend the act by \none year. S. 1617 passed this body by unanimous consent during the \nfirst week of September. Now here we are at the last minute trying to \npass the House version before an important GAG report is released.\n  Last year, Senator Harkin and I requested a GAO investigation into \nthe accuracy of reported prices by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \nWe are so close to having this report released that Congress should \nextend the LMPR by 1 year.\n  My bill could be easily taken up by the House and prevent LMPR from \nexpiring. This would allow the report to come out and give Congress \ntime to evaluate the recommendations.\n  There have been several concerns regarding the administration of the \nprogram ranging from late filed reports by packers and inadequate \noversight at USDA to ensure compliance and enforcement of the law.\n  I have heard from enough livestock producers to know that there can \nbe improvement to this important law.\n  I am trying to protect the interests of producers and have stated \nbefore that only those entities that fear transparency should be \nfighting for a 5-year extension with no consideration for GAO's pending \nconclusions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10794-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND GUNS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week the Violence Policy \nCenter released its annual study of homicide data titled ``When Men \nMurder Women.'' This year's study analyzed homicide data from 2003, the \nmost recent available, that involved one female victim and one male \noffender.\n  The VPC found that in 2003, the majority of women who were murdered \nwere killed with a firearm. In the overwhelming majority of these \ncases, 77 percent in fact, the male offender used a handgun. The VPC \nreport also revealed that more than ten times as many females were \nmurdered by a man they knew than were killed by a stranger. Of these, \n62 percent were in an intimate relationship or married to their killer. \nAccording to the report, ``Most often, females were killed by males in \nthe course of an argument.'' These statistics illustrate the tragic \nrole firearms play in domestic violence disputes that escalate into \nmurder.\n  As my colleagues know, since 1968 it has been illegal for convicted \nfelons, illegal aliens, individuals involuntarily committed to a mental \nhealth facility, individuals who have renounced their citizenship, drug \naddicts, those dishonorably discharged from the military, and fugitives \nto possess or purchase a firearm. In 1996, we extended the law to the \nprohibition on firearms to individuals who were under a domestic \nviolence restraining order and those who had previously been convicted \nof a domestic violence misdemeanor.\n  Unfortunately, these efforts continue to be undermined by Congress' \nfailure to close the ``gun show loophole.'' Under current law, when an \nindividual buys a firearm from a licensed dealer, there are Federal \nrequirements for a background check to insure that the purchaser is not \nprohibited by law from purchasing or possessing a firearm. However, \nthis is not the case for all gun purchases. For example, when an \nindividual wants to buy a firearm from another private citizen who is \nnot a licensed gun dealer, there is no requirement that the seller \nensure the purchaser is not in a prohibited category. This creates a \nloophole in the law, providing prohibited purchasers, including those \nwho have previously been convicted of domestic violence crimes, with \npotential easy access to dangerous firearms. Such firearms could later \nbe used to murder a wife or girlfriend in a moment of rage or jealousy.\n  The VPC demonstrates that the Congress should do more to help protect \nwomen from gun violence. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nfunding for domestic violence prevention programs as well as \nlegislation to close the gun show loophole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10794-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10794-S10795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE NEED FOR STRONG LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to work \nwith me and all those who support the belief that only through strong \nleadership will government be able to respond to the needs of its \ncitizens. This week, I participated in the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs hearing on dealing with the aftermath of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. I want to share a statement made by the \nHonorable Dan Coody, Mayor of Fayetteville, AR, who said:\n\n       I've always believed that any program or process will \n     succeed or fail based on the leadership in that program. And \n     I think that from the very top to the very bottom--speaking \n     at the micro level--there needs to be a system put in place \n     where we hire the most qualified, most knowledgeable people \n     for the job--that want to do the job--and put them in a \n     position where they can lead.\n\n  Mayor Coody's remarks underscored my expectations that Federal \nagencies must be led by experienced and qualified senior leaders in \norder to ensure that agencies meet their mission. The same evening as \nour Committee hearing, I was privileged to present the 2005 Service to \nAmerica Medal Federal Employee of the Year award to Orlando Figueroa, \nthe Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs, Science Mission \nDirectorate, at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Mr. \nFigueroa led the Mars Exploration Rover Project to success under \ntechnical challenges and time constraints. He and his team at the Mars \nExploration Rover Project created a mobile science lab was used to \nconduct remote exploration on the surface of another plant, which \nallowed the exploration of regions beyond the original landing site. \nThis fantastic accomplishment has produced a wealth of scientific \ndiscoveries revealing Mars as a potential habitat, and I told Mr. \nFigueroa that to me, these discoveries spark the imagination, fuel the \nhuman spirit, and inspire us to pursue even greater things. Mr. \nFigueroa exemplifies leadership.\n  The Federal Government is fortunate to have a cadre of career \nexecutives selected for their leadership, who are members of the Senior \nExecutive Service, SES. To become a member of the SES, a candidate must \npossess the following five executive qualifications: leading change; \nleading people; being results driven; having business acumen; and \nbuilding coalitions or having communication skills.\n\n[[Page S10795]]\n\n  SES candidates demonstrate these qualifications through experience in \nkey executive skills such as leading others to rapidly adjust \norganizational behavior and work methods; supervising and managing a \ndiverse workforce; developing strategic human capital management plans; \nestablishing performance standards and plans; managing the budgetary \nprocess; overseeing the allocation of financial resources; and \ndeveloping and maintaining positive working relationships with internal \ngroups and external groups such as Congress, the Office of Management \nand Budget, and the White House.\n  These qualifications and experiences help ensure that the Federal \nGovernment's senior executives have the ability to establish a clear \nvision for the organization and to drive others to succeed. Political \nappointees are not required to meet these qualifications, however, but \nit would be difficult for any agency head to succeed without them.\n  A recent Princeton University review, authored by Mr. David Lewis, \nunderscored the need for political appointees to have such skills. He \nused the Program Assessment Rating Tool, PART, to analyze the \nrelationship between political appointees and Federal manager \nperformance. As my colleagues know, PART was designed by the \nAdministration to measure program performance at Federal agencies. A \nPART review helps identify a program's strengths and weaknesses to \ninform funding and management decisions aimed at making the program \nmore effective.\n  Mr. Lewis found that programs run by politically appointed managers \nreceive systematically lower grades than those run by career managers \nand that the varied backgrounds of political appointees do not always \ntranslate into them being successful managers. Mr. Lewis' research \nshows the need for greater management experience and subject matter \nexpertise for political appointees.\n  Comptroller General David Walker said in a September 21, 2005, \ninterview with Federal Times that ``for certain positions, given the \nnature of the position, there should be statutory qualification \nrequirements for any nominee.'' I agree. Looking at the shortfalls in \nleadership at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the high \nnumber of political appointees at FEMA for the size of the agency, it \nis obvious that the political appointee-laden management structure may \nhave created numerous problems, especially in the area of recruiting \nand retaining top emergency services personnel and the inability to \nstay focused on the agency's core mission of disaster preparedness and \nrelief.\n  There must be trust and integrity in Government and most of all in \nour leaders. The crises we face at home and abroad demonstrates the \nneed for highly qualified individuals to lead our Government. There \nmust be the right people, at the right place, at the right time, with \nthe right skills. This is especially true at Federal agencies who need \nsenior leaders, with management skills and subject matter expertise. \nMore importantly, there should be an institutional loyalty and cultural \nsensitivity in working for the American people as a Federal employee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10795-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On December 10, 1999, a 34-year-old man walked into the Fort Myers, \nFL, home of a 91-year-old disabled woman and sexually assaulted her. \nAccording to police, the man knew the victims family and attacked her \nbecause of her disabled state.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10795-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10795-S10796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE FOR LIEUTENANT GENERAL JOHN ROSA, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 32 \nyears of outstanding military service LTG John Rosa has given our \nNation.\n  General Rosa started his career in the U.S. Air Force in 1973 after \nreceiving his commission from the Citadel in Charleston, SC. As a \ncombat pilot, General Rosa accumulated more than 3,600 flying hours in \nthe A-7, the A-10, F-16, F-117A Stealth fighter, and numerous other \naircraft. In 1985, General Rosa received his masters degree from Golden \nGate University. In the years that followed, General Rosa served as \noperations group commander and three times as wing commander.\n  Yet, as I think General Rosa might readily admit, his most difficult \nassignment began when he became the Superintendent of the U.S. Air \nForce Academy. Under ordinary circumstances, overseeing the academic \nprogress and military training of more than 4,000 cadets can be a \nchallenging experience. Unfortunately for General Rosa, he came to the \nAir Force Academy under anything but ordinary circumstances.\n  Two years ago the Academy underwent a very difficult period in which \nmany current and former cadets came forward with allegations of sexual \nassault. This scandal was tumultuous and resulted in four senior \nleaders of the Academy being dismissed from their duties.\n  General Rosa was asked to step into a situation that seemed to be \nspinning out of control. His senior leadership team was just as new as \nhe was, and the Air Force leadership and Congress were relentless in \ntheir demands for results.\n  Despite these circumstances, General Rosa did not hesitate to take \naction. He invited outside investigative organizations to come to the \nAcademy and review the institution's policies and procedures for \naddressing sexual assaults. He opened up the Academy and its cadets to \nthe media, to Congress, and to the school's board of visitors. Most \nimportantly, General Rosa admitted that the Academy had a very serious \nproblem and that sweeping it under the rug was not an acceptable \nresponse.\n  Less than a year later, General Rosa was again in the spotlight when \nthe Academy found in its cadet surveys that inappropriate religious \nexpression had become a problem. Instead of ignoring the surveys, \nGeneral Rosa did the opposite. He released them to the public and \nlaunched a comprehensive review on how the Academy approached religious \nexpression. He tackled the problem, investigated it thoroughly, and \nbegan instituting the changes that were necessary.\n  In his 2\\1/2\\ years of service, General Rosa made the Academy look in \nthe mirror and see the strengths and weaknesses of the institution for \nwhat they are. The Academy is a proud institution, and it is difficult \nto think that something as terrible as sexual assault and religious \nintolerance might occur there. Yet General Rosa was never comfortable \nwith the status quo or with a closed-door approach. He pushed and \npulled to get better results, and his methods were open and \ntransparent.\n  General Rosa forced the Academy, its cadets, its faculty, and even \nits alumni to face a reality that some did not want to acknowledge. He \nforced the institution to make changes that were necessary, justified, \nand in the best interest of the Air Force. Through this process, the \nAcademy raised its standards and slowly became the model institution \nthat we all have come to expect and American taxpayers require.\n  Under General Rosa's leadership, the Air Force Academy is now a \nsource of guidance for other military academies and universities. \nIndeed, the Department of Defense is now turning to the Academy for \ndirection on how to formulate the Department's sexual assault and \nreligious expression policies.\n  Although the Academy is not perfect and problems still exist, I \nstrongly believe the U.S. Air Force Academy has, under General Rosa's \nleadership, become a much better place. I commend General Rosa for \ntaking on this unbelievably difficult mission and for his outstanding \nservice to our Nation. And\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\nI also commend his family for standing by him as he worked tirelessly \nto repair and strengthen the reputation of one of America's premier \ntraining institutions.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to honor the service of one of \nAmerica's finest military officers. I wish General Rosa and his family \nthe best as he begins his new career as President of the the Citadel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10796-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO IOWA STATE SENATOR MINNETTE DODERER\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, former Iowa State Senator Minnette \nDoderer, who passed away last month, was one of the true giants of Iowa \npolitics. Born into very humble circumstances in Holland, IA in 1923, \nshe served 12 terms in the Iowa House and two terms in the Iowa Senate, \nwhere she was the first woman to serve as President pro tempore.\n  Martin Luther King once said that ``Life's most urgent and persistent \nquestion is: What are you doing for others?'' During a long, feisty, \nand distinguished career in Iowa politics, Senator Doderer answered \nthat question in spectacular fashion. She was a mentor and role model \nfor women all across our State, a passionate champion of the Equal \nRights Amendment, and an indomitable advocate for the poor, the \nneglected, and the voiceless in our State.\n  Some people run for public office to be somebody. Senator Doderer ran \nin order to get things done. She saw injustice, discrimination, and \nsexism, and she fought it with tremendous skill and courage. Above all, \nshe made a practical difference, especially for women. She championed \nand passed legislation on equal rights, rape law reform, child care, \nand juvenile justice laws that made a concrete, tangible difference in \nthe lives of Iowans.\n  Minnette Doderer was passionate about her family and her friends. She \nwas a tough, tenacious fighter for what she believed in. She cared \ndeeply about justice and fairness for ordinary people. Most of all, she \nwas a good, decent, humane person--the kind of person that makes Iowa \nsuch a special place.\n  I valued Minnette's friendship and counsel. Though I regret she is no \nlonger with us, I celebrate the living legacy she left behind: a \nbetter, fairer, more just and equal Iowa, especially for our daughters. \nMay she rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10796-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3402.

A bill to repeal the increase in micropurchase authority for \nproperty and services for support of Hurricane Katrina relief and \nrescue operations; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Wyden and I are introducing \nlegislation today to change a provision in law that was attendant to \nthe emergency supplemental passed recently dealing with hurricane \nKatrina. That provision in law increased the amount of money that would \nbe available to be spent on a Government credit card from $2,500 to \n$250,000. That is right--$250,000 for purchases on a Government credit \ncard.\n  Here is what a Government credit card looks like. There are about \n390,000--somewhere in that neighborhood--390,000 Government credit \ncards in the country. I have three GAO reports that describe \nsubstantial abuse and misuse of these Government credit cards.\n  The proposal that passed this Congress attendant to the hurricane \nemergency relief says that on these credit cards, the limit will go \nfrom $2,500 to $250,000. Let me describe for a moment what the GAO \nfound in various investigations.\n  What has been charged to a Government credit card? Hiring \nprostitutes, gambling, breast-enlargement surgery--yes, it was for a \ngirlfriend of somebody who had a Government credit card--cigars, \nmounting a deer head, jewelry, wine, and the list goes on.\n  Now the limit goes to $250,000. We aim to take it back to $2,500. It \nwill still have the emergency capabilities that existed since 9/11 \nwhich will allow a $15,000 limit under emergencies.\n  We had a hearing at which a professor from GW Law School who is an \nexpert in this area of Government procurement testified. Here is what \nhe said about the $250,000 credit card limit:\n\n       The potential for abuse is staggering.\n\n  Everybody knows that: ``The potential for abuse is staggering.'' If \nyou don't believe it, take a look at the GAO reports with respect to \nthe abuse when the limit was $2,500. Now it is $250,000 for a credit \ncard purchase? Who is going to stand up for the interest of the \ntaxpayers?\n  This fellow, Mr. Safavian, was the top contracting officer for \npurchases of\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\nthe Federal Government. He just said several weeks ago about the \n$250,000:\n\n       This guidance--\n\n  That he and OMB would provide--\n\n       This guidance helps make sure that adequate management \n     controls are in place to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are \n     spent efficiently and responsibly in support of disaster \n     victims.\n\n  Meaning the new $250,000 on credit cards will be spent efficiently \nand responsibly. That is from David Safavian, Director of the Office of \nProcurement and Policy. The problem is, Mr. Safavian was arrested by \nthe FBI on September 19 and charged with lying to an ethics officer and \nso on. He is the guy who gave us the assurance that taking the credit \ncard from $2,500 to $250,000 will be just fine because there are all \nthese limits in place and it will be spent wisely and efficiently. Yes, \nand the Moon is made of green cheese.\n  Who is going to believe this, especially when we have the GAO reports \nthat show past abuses with even the $2,500 limit, which includes the \nhiring of prostitutes on Government credit cards? It includes breast-\nenlargement surgery on Government credit cards. When on Earth will \npeople wake up and start thinking?\n  So Senator Wyden and myself are today introducing legislation to say, \nHow about let's sober up and think through this the right way on behalf \nof the American taxpayers.\n  We want to help hurricane victims, no question about that. But I do \nnot want people walking around with credit cards that have a $250,000 \nlimit that say U.S. Government on them, in a way that the GAO says puts \nus at risk and in a way that Government procurement experts tell us is \nvery dangerous for the American taxpayer.\n  I am pleased to do this with my colleague, Senator Wyden. For the \npast several years, Senator Wyden and I have taken a look at a whole \nrange of wasteful issues. I might just say that Senator Wyden and I, a \nwhile back, found deep in the bowels of the Pentagon there was a plan \nto create what was called a futures market for terrorism. I think they \nwere preparing to spend another $8 million on it. And, yes, they were \ngoing to actually have a futures market for terrorism so that people \ncould make wagers buying futures contracts on things such as how many \nAmerican soldiers will be killed in the next year, will the King of \nJordan be assassinated within the next year. One could actually wager \nand make money by betting on those kinds of things.\n  Senator Wyden and I blew that wide open. The next day, both Secretary \nRumsfeld and the President said they did not know it was going on. They \nshut it down and it is all over. In my judgment, that was unbelievably \nstupid as a public policy, whoever allowed that to happen. It is now \nshut down.\n  A lot of bad things happen in circumstances where no one is watching. \nIn this case, with credit cards that have a $250,000 limit, there is \nsomething fundamentally wrong with that. I do not know who put that in \nthe emergency supplemental. It should not have been there. But it was \nthere. We aim to repeal it on behalf of the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield to my friend from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague yielding to me and particularly \nhighlighting the need for some real accountability and protection for \nthe taxpayers at this time. We are seeing expenses for the Government--\nthe war in Iraq, the various disasters that have hit--exploding to the \npoint where people are saying, well, let us hold off on giving senior \ncitizens some help with their prescription drugs.\n  I think what the Senator is saying is, before one takes those kinds \nof steps, put the brakes on the opportunity for ripping off taxpayers.\n  I want to ask the Senator a question that really stunned me. There \nare now about 392,000 Federal employees who have these credit cards \nacross the country. We have been trying to figure out how many folks \nhave them on the gulf coast and how many of the folks have this \n$250,000 authority. The two of us feel very strongly that there are a \nlot of dedicated people down there who are working very hard and nobody \nis suggesting otherwise, but what possible argument would there be for \nnot having something along the lines of some guardrails to try to make \nsure that people did not abuse these credit cards?\n  That strikes me as a pretty modest step, just have some guardrails \nrather than saying, look, go out and take $250,000 worth of authority \nand we will see what happens.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in answer to the Senator's request, he is \nasking that of perhaps 390,000 credit cards that exist in the \npossession of Federal workers, do we know how many have this $250,000 \nlimit? We do not have the foggiest idea.\n  The Senator indicated we want to help people who are dealing with the \nhurricane. Our interest is not in pulling the rug out from under people \nwho are working and trying to respond to the devastation of these \nhurricanes, but I am not interested in paving the way for additional \nwaste, fraud, and abuse with the misuse of Federal credit cards.\n  Yes, there are thousands of dedicated public servants who will use \nthese responsibly, but increasing the limit from $2,500 to $250,000, in \nmy judgment, is fundamentally irresponsible, and we aim to take it back \nwith this amendment and aim to offer this amendment to the next \nsupplemental that deals with this hurricane.\n  I will yield the floor so my colleague from Oregon can have the \nfloor, and I would like to propound a question at some point later when \nhe finishes his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it seems to me that the bottom line is we \nwant Federal workers in the hurricane zone to have all the tools they \nneed to get the job done. But a month after the hurricane hit, we do \nnot need $250,000 worth of authority on a credit card. One needs \npermission to spend that kind of money. The fact is, under the current \nrules one can have it when they need it, just not on a credit card \nwhere they do not even have to ask. This is a commonsense step.\n  Senator Dorgan indicated if somebody needs to spend more than $15,000 \na shot, there are already streamlined, simplified acquisition \nprocedures in place to let them do that. Those procedures at least have \nsome oversight. The two of us supported the Katrina bills that came \nthrough the Congress. We support the rule that was already in place \nthat increases the spending power of these cards by a reasonable amount \nin an emergency from $2,500 to $15,000. What the two of us feel \nstrongly about and what we do not support is how can one support \nexcessive spending without any safeguards at all?\n  We heard from a Dr. Yukins at George Washington that there is \nextraordinary potential for abuse here. Dr. Yukins said it was \nstaggering.\n  In looking at Government waste at a variety of agencies, Senator \nDorgan and I have come to the conclusion that when one is talking about \nthe Department of Homeland Security, when one is talking about the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, and when one is talking about the \nDepartment of Defense, what one needs is more accountability and more \noversight rather than less.\n  In Homeland Security, we have seen massive outlays for ineffective \nprograms to hire the TSA screeners. At FEMA, it is hard to know where \nto start there, but folks may have heard on public radio yesterday that \na Government Accountability Office audit more than a year ago said that \nonly one in several dozen FEMA employees could prove that they had done \nthe proper paperwork for procurement authority.\n\n  When it comes to Iraq, all one needs to do there is talk about Iraqi \ncontracts. Senator Dorgan and I have tried to put in place some \noversight and some accountability there, and we will continue on that \nas well. So this is not the only avenue for abuse of taxpayer dollars. \nIf one wants to come to the floor and talk about no-bid contracts and \nthe like, there is plenty to dig into in terms of more oversight and \nmore accountability for our taxpayers. This is a commonsense step that \nthe Senate can take.\n  I have listened to Senator Collins on this issue, as well as Senator \nGrassley. A number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \nexpressed concern about this in effect blank check to use credit cards, \nand use them on some pretty high ticket items.\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\n  I am going to yield the floor back to Senator Dorgan, but given the \nfact that there is a catalog of abuses--this happened outside the \nhurricane zone before anybody knew about Katrina--let us now deal with \nan emergency, let us recognize that there are different spending needs \ngiven that emergency, but let us also make sure that there are some \nsafeguards in place to make sure the taxpayers' interests at a critical \ntime when costs in Government are exploding, let us make sure there are \nsome safeguards in place to protect the public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I conclude by pointing out that, yes, \nothers have described their concern about the $250,000, and some have \ntalked about a $50,000 limit and other approaches. Senator Wyden and I \nsay that we ought to go back to the old limit, $2,500 per credit card \nper transaction. That is why we introduced this legislation and hope \nthat our colleagues will agree.\n  Again, this is what the credit card looks like. There are nearly \n400,000 that are possessed by Federal workers. We do not allege that \nthese are not dedicated public servants. We do allege that at least in \nsome instances, according to three GAO reports, there have been massive \nabuses. These are just a few.\n  I put up another chart about them: Liquor, gambling, mounting a deer \nhead, cigars, ski clothes and diamond rings, not to mention hiring \nprostitutes and breast enlargements--all put on Government credit \ncards.\n  Does that make a person look and pay attention? Of course. Should \nthat be happening? Of course not.\n  The $250,000 limit on the credit card, this is what Professor Yukins \nsaid, who is an expert in these areas:\n\n       [T]he Administration has announced various protective \n     measures. . . . It appears, however, that those additional \n     protections will not address the core problem with the new \n     procurement exceptions: Under the new law, agencies will be \n     able to spend billions of relief dollars without any of the \n     competition, transparency or other legal rules that normally \n     protect our procurement system.\n\n  I ask my colleagues how this got into the supplemental bill, taking \nit from a $2,500 to a $250,000 limit on a Federal Government credit \ncard. How did that happen? When one looks at that they say: Wait a \nsecond, we are going to increase the limit on a credit card from $2,500 \nto $250,000? What on Earth are you thinking about?\n  Well, it came from the White House. The White House made the specific \nrequest, believing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina people were going \nto need emergency capabilities to do these kinds of purchases. So the \nWhite House said they wanted an increase to $250,000. The person they \nsent down to brief staff in the Senate of how this would work and why \nit is necessary was Mr. David Safavian. He was the head of all \nprocurement policy at the Office of Management and Budget in the White \nHouse.\n  What did he tell us publicly and what did he tell the American \npeople? ``This guidance''--guidance about procurement with the $250,000 \nlimit on a credit card:\n\n       This guidance helps make sure that adequate management \n     controls are in place to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are \n     spent efficiently and responsibly in support of disaster \n     victims.\n\n  That was said 2 weeks before Mr. Safavian's arrest by the FBI for \nlying. This is the person who came to brief the Senate staff about why \nthe $250,000 limit on credit cards was necessary.\n  It not only is not necessary, it is terribly unwise. In my judgment, \nunless changed, from this we will see a dramatic amount of waste, \nfraud, and abuse. There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. I \nguarantee this proposal to increase credit card limits for Federal \nemployees to $250,000 is the wrong way.\n  Senator Wyden and I are going to do everything we can to see if we \ncannot in more sober moments persuade everyone here that we ought to go \nback to the previous limits and that we ought to enforce them the right \nway. The GAO's reports say that even with the $2,500 limits, there are \nserious problems with the use of these Federal credit cards.\n  That is our proposal. I want to thank my colleague from Oregon with \nwhom I have worked on a number of occasions on many areas of Federal \nwaste. Yes, this is a big old government, a big bureaucracy. There are \nwonderful people who work in it, and it does wonderful things. There \nare also areas of waste that make me furious. Senator Wyden and I have \nworked on that in a number of areas, in a number of ways, and I hope we \ncan continue to do that. This is a preventive way to try to restore \nthat $2,500 as a limit on Federal credit cards.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Talent, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 1807. A bill to provide assistance for small businesses damaged by \nHurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate a bill, the Small Business Hurricane Relief and \nReconstruction Act of 2005, which provides a comprehensive package for \nimmediate emergency resources to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina \nrebuild their lives and their businesses.\n  As we are well aware, the entire gulf coast of the United States has \nbeen ravaged by the disaster of Hurricane Katrina. No natural disaster \nin this country in recent memory has carried with it the devastation \nand horror we have witnessed in the recent weeks. Many lives have been \nlost and damages are projected in the hundreds of billions of dollars. \nThe President and Congress have already provided over $61 billion in \nemergency funds.\n  While we work to reestablish communities and provide some stability \nto the affected areas, we must consider the enormous economic impact \nthis catastrophe has had on the region and on our entire Nation. This \nimpact is particularly pronounced for the vital small business sector. \nWith over 800,000 firms damaged in the hurricane-affected region, \nemployment in the Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama area may be \nreduced by over a million jobs! Moreover, our economy which has \nrecently recovered from recession, thanks largely to our small \nbusinesses which have created three-quarters of all new jobs, could be \ndampened by as much as a full percentage point.\n  As chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I \nam committed to do everything in my power to provide immediate and \nnecessary support to rebuild this region and to help sustain our \neconomy. I want to ensure that every American affected by this \nhurricane has the resources to begin rebuilding their lives, their \nbusinesses, and their dreams.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senator Kerry, Senator Vitter, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Talent, Senator Kennedy, Senator Cornyn, and \nSenator Bayh, for cosponsoring this bill. This bill includes all of the \nprovisions that were in prior hurricane relief legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Vitter and Senator Talent but also includes \nseveral additional provisions and improvements to preexisting \nprovisions.\n  The provisions of this bill were contained in an amendment that I \nproposed, amendment No. 1717, to the Commerce, Justice, and Science \nAppropriations Act of 2005, H.R. 2862. I would like to thank my \ncolleagues, Senator Kerry, Senator Vitter, Senator Landrieu, and \nSenator Talent, for cosponsoring that amendment. The amendment was \napproved in the Senate by a rollcall vote of 96 to 0 on September 15, \n2006, and subsequently passed the Senate in the Commerce, Justice, and \nScience Appropriations Act on that same day.\n  Senator Vitter, Senator Talent, and I also introduced the provisions \nof S.A. 1717 as a stand-alone bill, S. 1724, on September 19, 2005. We \ntook this step in order to begin the process of enacting these \nprovisions into law more quickly than might occur through the Commerce, \nJustice, and Science Appropriations Act, which must still complete its \nSenate-House conference.\n  Today we are introducing an expanded package of provisions \nto increase the assistance provided to victims of the hurricane, who \nrequire immediate assistance. Because the Federal Disaster Loan program \nadministered by the Small Business Administration issues disaster loans \nto businesses, homeowners, and renters, this\n\n[[Page S10800]]\n\nlegislation would have a significant impact on many facets of the \nefforts to rebuild the areas damaged by Hurricane Katrina.\n\n  Because of the importance of this rebuilding challenge, I chaired a \nhearing in the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship on \nSeptember 22, 2005 to address the impact that Hurricane Katrina and \nHurricane Rita have had on small businesses. At that hearing, the \nCommittee heard testimony from the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration, Hector Barreto, who explained the unprecedented scope \nof the SBA's response to these disasters. In addition, the director of \nthe SBA's Disaster Assistance Program, Herb Mitchell, testified about \nthe SBA's actions thus far, and its plans for the continuing recovery.\n  The committee also heard testimony from seven representatives of \nsmall businesses, and of small business development centers, in the \ngulf coast region. These witnesses, who traveled from Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama for the hearing, described to the committee \nthe devastation that has occurred to their businesses and communities \nand various steps they believe would assist in the rebuilding process.\n  Many of their recommendations were contained in the legislation I had \nintroduced last week, S. 1724, and the legislation I am introducing \ntoday includes other provisions stemming from the committee's hearing \nand their testimony.\n  The Small Business Administration is and must be at the forefront of \nthis massive relief effort, playing a significant role in assisting \nimpacted communities. This bill will strengthen the SBA's resources and \nwill enable them to pave the pathway to recovery. I have faith that \nAmerican small businesses will persevere through these difficult times \nand help lead the region's recovery. It is essential that we work \ntogether here in Congress, and put forth the best possible proposal to \nstimulate our economy and foster job growth.\n  I have spoken with SBA's Administrator Barreto concerning the various \nways to respond to this disaster and assist with the recovery. He \ninformed me that FEMA has referred over 500,000 cases for loan \nassistance to the SBA, and that the SBA is receiving up to 20,000 calls \nper day. This is a tremendous volume and a vital challenge that the SBA \nmust satisfy. To date, the SBA has sent out almost 500,000 applications \nfor loans to individuals and businesses, and has received 810 loan \napplications as of Monday morning, which demonstrates that much \nassistance is yet to be provided by the SBA. Therefore, it is critical \nthat we act now.\n  I have included many provisions in my bill that would assist \nhurricane victims applying for SBA disaster loans. My legislation \nincreases the maximum size of an SBA disaster loan from $1.5 million \nper loan to $10 million per loan and makes it possible for non-profit \ninstitutions damaged by Hurricane Katrina to be eligible for disaster \nloans.\n  I firmly believe this legislation is the best possible package to aid \nfamilies, businesses, and communities through these challenging times. \nSmall businesses must have a fighting chance to survive the economic \ndisaster caused by Hurricane Katrina.\n  For instance, the bill increases the share of small businesses in \nFederal prime contracts and subcontracts for rebuilding the damaged \nareas through meaningful goals, set-asides, subcontracting plans, \noutreach programs, and HUBZone preferences.\n  The legislation also allows recipients of disaster loans to increase \nthe size of their loan if the additional amounts would be spent on \nmitigation efforts, such as sea walls, storm shutters, or better \ndrainage system to prepare for future disasters. This provision was \nsuggested by the administration in its proposal to rebuild the gulf \ncoast region.\n  The bill also allows the Small Business Administration to offer \neconomic injury disaster loans to small businesses throughout the \ncountry if the businesses suffered direct adverse economic impacts from \nthe two hurricanes. The SBA offered these loans nationwide after the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  In addition, the bill protects future borrowers in the SBA's business \nloan programs from having to pay higher fees to compensate the Federal \nGovernment for any defaults that may occur because the businesses of \nsome current borrower who had loans before the hurricane were destroyed \nin the hurricanes. SBA business loan programs utilize fees to pay for \nall or part of the programs' costs, and those businesses that default \nbecause of the hurricanes would not be included in the calculation of \nfuture program costs in the SBA's business loan programs.\n  The bill addresses concerns about fraud and lack of competition by \nabolishing the excessive increase in the ``micro-purchase'' threshold \nto $250,000. This increase, slipped into the second hurricane \nSupplemental Appropriations Act in September 2005, allowed Federal \nofficials to ignore small businesses in awarding contracts up to \n$250,000. Micro-purchases are generally strictly limited to $2,500 and \nto $15,000 in case of nuclear attack or military contingency. These \npurchases allow for convenient credit card transactions by the Federal \nGovernment, but are vulnerable to fraud and favoritism.\n\n  I have also provided the SBA with the authority to grant victims of \nHurricane Katrina up to 12 months to begin repaying their SBA disaster \nloans which would assist both small and large businesses, homeowners, \nand renters. This l2-month period could be extended to 24 months at the \ndiscretion of the SBA Administrator if he determines that Katrina \nvictims would need additional time to begin repaying their loans. This \nwould allow also homeowners and businesses additional time to get their \nlives and businesses restored before being required to begin repaying \nloans.\n  This legislation also proposes lowering fees for the 7(a) program to \nmake borrowing more affordable for small businesses both within and \noutside the disaster areas, many of which have been impacted by the \ndisaster and are struggling to cover higher costs in health care and \nenergy and rising interest rates.\n  Recognizing the increased demand this disaster will place on all \nsmall business lending programs, the amendment proposes increasing the \n7(a) lending program from a program level of $17 billion to $27 \nbillion, and the 504 lending program from a program level of $7.5 \nbillion to $12.5 billion. Both the 504 and 7(a) lending programs are \nfunded entirely through fees, so the increases require no \nappropriation.\n  Moreover, this bill increases the program level for SBA disaster \nloans--physical and economic injury--by approximately $800 million, \nrequiring an appropriation of approximately $86 million. The committee \nis concerned there will not be enough funding for disaster loans \navailable to meet the scope of this disaster, given that the economic \ninjury disaster loans alone for the September 11 attacks amounted to \nabout $1 billion, and the physical damage for Katrina is considered \nmuch more extensive.\n  The bill also includes a provision requiring the SBA to treat these \nspecial provisions as separate from the regular programs, to avoid \nincreasing future subsidy rates, and therefore, the costs for borrowers \nwho rely on those programs. This same protection was provided for \nemergency 7(a) loans after the September 11 attacks, and for the \nspecial disaster loans made after those attacks.\n  Additionally, many small businesses in the disaster areas will \nrequire relief from making payments and interest on 504 loans they had \nbefore Katrina hit. Therefore, this amendment includes a provision that \nauthorizes the SBA to cover the payments and interest on existing loans \nuntil the small business can resume payments.\n  Similar to the Supplementary Terrorist Activity Relief, STAR, loans \nenacted by Congress after September 11, this bill allows the SBA to \nprovide similar loans with lower fees for small businesses located \noutside the disaster zones but are nonetheless indirectly impacted by \nHurricane Katrina. The lowers fees also provides the lenders with an \nincentive to lend to these businesses.\n  Importantly, the bill includes protections to mitigate recent reports \nof past misdirection of loans to nondisaster victims. The protections \ninclude requiring lenders to inform borrowers that they are receiving \nKatrina relief loans, requiring lenders to document to\n\n[[Page S10801]]\n\nthe SBA how the borrower was adversely affected by Hurricane Katrina, \nand for the SBA's inspector general to collect the explanations and \nreport to the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nand House Committee on Small Business every 6 months, verifying loans \nare being used for the intended purposes. Finally, the bill would \nrequire the Government Accountability Office to review the \nimplementation of the program, after its completion, and report its \nfindings to Congress. These added protections will ensure that only \napplicants who really need these loans to recover from the horrific \neffects of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita will receive the loans.\n  Furthermore, the legislation authorizes $450 million to the affected \nState governments of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and \nFlorida to provide emergency bridge loans or grants to small businesses \nin the disaster areas that have been adversely impacted by Hurricane \nKatrina and require immediate access to capital until they can secure \nother loans or financial assistance. The goal is to disburse the funds \nquickly, and this measure is based on a successful program that helped \nvictims of the hurricanes in Florida in past years.\n  With the cost of Katrina relief and rebuilding estimated at over $100 \nbillion, small businesses, particularly those located in the disaster \narea and that employ individuals in the affected areas, should receive \ntheir fair share of Federal contracting and subcontracting dollars. My \nbill also attempts to provide critical assistance to small businesses \nthat have been operating in the areas devastated by the Hurricane \nKatrina by expanding access to Federal contract and subcontracts.\n  Government projects provide solid business opportunities and prompt, \nsteady pay for small businessmen and businesswomen. In addition, \nGovernment procurement would open doors for many local small \nbusinesses to participate in the long-term reconstruction work in the \ngulf coast areas. Prior to the disaster, small construction companies \nin Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana brought home nearly $500 million \nin Federal contracts a year. Total small business contracts in the gulf \ncoast region exceeded $3 billion a year. While many small businesses \nwould benefit from other forms of disaster assistance, many of them are \nready to get back to work and into business as soon as possible.\n\n  To that end, my bill designates the Hurricane Katrina disaster area \nas a HUBZone. A HUBZone designation would enable small businesses \nlocating in the disaster area and employing people in that area to \nreceive contracting preferences and price evaluation preferences to \noffset greater costs of doing business. The HUBZone program was created \nto direct federal contracting dollars to economically distressed areas. \nExtending the HUBZone designation to the gulf coast would bring needed \nbusinesses development tools to affected areas.\n  In addition Mr. President, my bill would increase the maximum size of \nSBA surety bonds for small businesses from $2 million to $5 million, \nand authorizes the SBA to increase the size of these bonds further to \n$10 million. Small contractors vying for work need an increase in bonds \nto handle greater projects for Hurricane Katrina relief. Local small \nbusinesses in the gulf coast can use higher bonds to compensate for the \ndamage to their assets from the hurricane.\n  My bill would also direct the SBA, its resources partners, and the \nFederal offices of small and disadvantaged business utilization to \ncreate a contracting outreach program for small businesses located or \nwilling to locate in the Katrina disaster area. Finally, my bill would \nestablish small business contracting and subcontracting goals for all \nKatrina-related contracts and subcontracts to promote greater jobs \ncreation and development, while providing reasonable flexibility to \nFederal agencies in meeting that goal in light of difficult \ncircumstances on the ground.\n  Finally I would also like to comment on the funding levels provided \nfor the SBA in this bill. I have authorized the appropriation of $24.25 \nmillion for grants to increase business counseling in the damaged areas \nfor several SBA entrepreneurial development programs including: Small \nBusiness Development Center, SBDCs; SCORE; Womens Business Centers, \nWBCs; Veteran's Business Centers, and Microloan Technical Assistance.\n  Our Nation's 25 million small businesses prove time and again to \nbreathe new life into our economy, by growing at twice the rate of all \nfirms. And when a disaster strikes, the spirit, determination and will \nof America's small businesses help to create the firm economic \nfoundation, propelling our Nation's economic growth. Therefore, we in \nturn must create an atmosphere favorable for small businesses and \nprovide this emergency package to the SBA. We must allow our Nation's \nsmall businesses to do what they do best--create jobs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Too much is \nat stake for small businesses, and the economy as a whole, to allow \nthis critical legislation to languish. Congress must find essential \nagreement and fulfill its obligation to America's small businesses. \nClearly, if we strive for anything less, we fail to support the \nbackbone of our economy, our hope for new innovation, and the \nentrepreneurs reach for the American dream.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Snowe, the chair \nof our committee, and our colleagues, Senators Landrieu and Vitter, to \nintroduce a bill to help small businesses that have been damaged, \nphysically and economically, by one or both of the hurricanes that have \ndestroyed the gulf region over the past four or five weeks.\n  Our colleagues should feel very comfortable voting for this bill. The \nneed is undeniable, based not only on what we see on television every \nday and read in the papers but also based on the testimony of small \nbusinesses and governors at hearings held in the Senate, in our \ncommittee last week, and this week before the Finance Committee. \nFurther, 96 Senators voted for very similar legislation 2 weeks ago.\n  This bill is very similar to the amendment (S.A. 1695) that Senator \nLandrieu and I offered to the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill for \nthe Departments of Commerce, Justice, and Science, and that passed the \nSenate by a vote of 96 to 0 on September 15 as part of the compromise \namendment (S.A. 1717) that I put forth with Senators Snowe, Landrieu, \nand Vitter. We offered those amendments to the appropriations bill \nbecause relief for small businesses had not been provided for in the \ntwo emergency supplementals. Two bills, worth some $63 billion, and \nnothing designated for small businesses.\n  It is through the Small Business Administration that disaster loan \nassistance is available, not just for businesses but for homeowners and \nrenters, and it is through the Small Business Administration that the \nFederal Government provides the full complement of assistance to the \nsmall businesses in our Nation. The SBA is indispensable to the \nrecovery of the gulf region after Hurricane Katrina. If the \nadministration is not going to provide small business relief in the \nemergency spending bills it sends to Congress, this is absolutely \nappropriate.\n  We have got to get into law, and to fund, relief for small businesses \nbefore Senators go home for a week break in October. These folks have \nwaited too long. We have got to get people back to work.\n  Since Hurricane Katrina hit, the gulf has had the extreme misfortune \nof being hit by Hurricane Rita. And this bill reflects the damage \ncaused by going a bit further to take care of those small businesses, \ntoo. It also incorporates provisions requested by the administration. \nFor example, at the request of the administration, the bill authorizes \nthe Small Business Administration to make economic injury disaster \nloans nationwide to any small business directly and adversely impacted \nby Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita. The bill limits eligibility of \neconomic injury disaster loans to those small businesses suffering \neconomic losses because of the spikes in gasoline and natural gas and \nheating oil related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. That is consistent \nwith all other provisions in this bill. We also increased the amount of \nfunding for grants to the States from $400 million to $450 million, to \nreflect the increased damage and delays in recovery caused by Hurricane \nRita. We also repeal some contracting provisions enacted as part of\n\n[[Page S10802]]\n\nthe second supplemental that were anti-small business and would have \nresulted in millions of contracting dollars lost for small businesses \nthat should be getting Federal contracts to rebuild the area. The small \nbusinesses don't just need loans; they need work to get revenue flowing \nagain and to hire again, creating local jobs.\n  Mr. President, I extend great thanks to my colleagues, Senators \nSnowe, Landrieu, and Vitter for their work on this bill. I think we \nhave demonstrated to a weary public that we can work together, and I \nhope that our colleagues in the Senate and in the House and the \nPresident will join us and vote to make this law and to fund it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1808. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the qualified medicare beneficiary (QMB) and specified low-\nincome medicare beneficiary (SLMB) programs within the medicaid \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Medicare \nBeneficiary Assistance Improvement Act.'' This legislation would \nimprove what are referred to as the Medicare Savings Programs, which \nincludes the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary, QMB, and Specified Low-\nincome Medicare Beneficiary, SLMB, and Qualifying Individual-1 (QI-1) \nprograms that provide cost-sharing assistance for low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries through the Medicaid program. It would also make \npermanent the QI-1 program, which expires today due to inaction by the \nHouse of Representatives to extend the program.\n  The QI-1 program was established as part of the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997 and was authorized for 5 years. In 2002 and 2003, extensions of \nthe program were included in various continuing resolutions. The \nprogram was further extended through passage of Public Law 108-448 in \n2004, through today's expiration date.\n  There is no reason that the Congress must participate in this annual \nlast minute scramble to try and extend the program for a few months or \na year. It is a disservice to the States, who must watch the Congress \nclosely to constantly prepare to send out disenrollment notices and \nlayoff staff, even though they are relatively certain the program will \nbe extended. But, more importantly, it is a disservice to those that \nneed this important assistance, as many of those enrolled worry this \nbenefit will be taken away and many of those never enrolled never are \ntold of the benefit since States and advocates are spending their time \ntrying to get the program extended rather than conducting outreach.\n  While I remain very hopeful that the Congress will pass an extension \nof the QI-1 program for an additional period in the coming week, I am \nintroducing the ``Medicare Beneficiary Assistance Improvement Act'' \ntoday in the hope that Congress will end this process of temporary \nextensions and permanently authorize the program, as provided for in \nthis legislation.\n  To reiterate, low-income senior citizens and disabled Americans \nnationwide should not be subjected to the constant risk of losing \ncrucial health care benefits. Furthermore, the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services, CMS, the Social Security Administration, SSA, and \nthe States should be spared the administrative burdens and cost \nassociated with reauthorizing the program each year--sometimes more \nthan once in a year.\n  Furthermore, the bill proposes several improvements to the Medicare \nSavings Programs and application processes that will make these low-\nincome benefits both more efficient to administer and more accessible \nto the individuals who need them. It would also seek to simplify the \nprocess and make the Medicare Savings Programs more understandable to \nlow-income senior citizens and people with disabilities, as well as \nState and Federal Government officials.\n  In New Mexico, over 1,500 low-income Medicare beneficiaries receive \nthe QI-1 benefit, which saves them almost $1,000 in Medicare Part B \npremium out-of-pocket costs annually. Unfortunately, according to \nestimates made by the Medicare Rights Center using Census Bureau data, \nover 11,000 are likely to be eligible. Many are completely unaware of \nthe assistance this program offers.\n  The same is true among those of us that created the three different \nMedicare Savings Programs. In fact, I am almost absolutely certain that \nfew of my Senate colleagues could accurately explain how any of these \nprograms work and that is precisely the problem with them. They are \nintended serve our Nation's most vulnerable, low-income citizens with \ntheir Medicare cost-sharing burdens, but do so in a very complicated \nmanner that few can understand. It is no wonder that many of our \nNation's elderly and people with disabilities that qualify for this \nassistance do not participate.\n  For example, the QI-1 program is Federal grant payment to States for \nthe purpose of paying the Medicare Part B premium, which is $78.20 per \nmonth in 2005 and will increase to $88.50 per month or over $1000 per \nyear in 2006, for individuals with income between 120 and 135 percent \nof the Federal Poverty Level. Through this Federal grant, States must \npay the full amount of the Medicare Part B premium for qualifying \nindividuals but may cap or otherwise limit enrollment if the State \nprojects that further enrollment will result in exhaustion of their \nState allotment.\n  Six States had enrollment this year that would exceed their allotment \nso were forced to cap funding. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices, CMS, responded to this problem with a rule on August 26, \n2005, that reallocated unspent funding from some States to those that \nhad exhausted their funds in order to eliminate the enrollment caps in \nthe States of Oregon, Arizona, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and \nConnecticut.\n  Three days later Hurricane Katrina hit three of the six States and \nnow their entire health care systems are in chaos, and Congress has \nfailed to act to address their need. While that has gained a great deal \nof much needed attention and deserves even greater attention from the \nmedia and public, the House of Representatives yesterday failed to \nextend the QI-1 program and went out of session for the week even \nthough it expires today. Senators Grassley and Baucus were working with \nthe House of Representatives on a last minute extension through the \nintroduction of S. 1718, but it failed to move in the waning hours of \nthe fiscal year and the House of Representatives took no action \nwhatsoever.\n  Even though CMS has apparently notified the Congress that it can \ncontinue to run the program for a few days, the failure of the Congress \nto take action in a timely manner to ensure that disenrollment notices \nare not sent out by the States to an estimated 185,000 low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries nationwide is absolutely unacceptable and also \nis deserving of attention and media scrutiny.\n  Furthermore, while the QI-1 program has always played an important \nrole in helping low-income Medicare afford health care coverage, the \nQI-1 program would, in the future, play an important role in helping \nlow-income Medicare beneficiaries access prescription drug coverage \nthrough Medicare's new drug benefit. Enrollment in the QI-1 program is \nsupposed to automatically qualify a person for the Medicare Part D drug \nbenefit's low-income subsidy beginning on January 1,2006.\n\n  To briefly describe the most critical aspects of the legislation, \nSection 2 of the bill simply provides for one unified name for the \nFederal programs that offer cost sharing and benefit assistance for \nlow-income Medicare beneficiaries. Rather than separately referring to \nthe QMB, SLMB, and QI-1 programs, the bill provides one common name for \nall of these programs, the ``Medicare Savings Programs.''\n  Low enrollment in these assistance programs is in large part due to \nthe lack of knowledge and understanding of the programs or benefits \noffered. This simple change has been pilot tested with Medicare \nbeneficiary groups and found to elicit a positive response and interest \nfrom Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Section 3 of the legislation would make permanent the QI-1 category \nby incorporating these individuals into the SLMB category at the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program enhanced matching rate. In addition \nto simplifying and making permanent the program, States would see a \nfinancial benefit from this change.\n\n[[Page S10803]]\n\n  Section 4 eliminates some of the critical barriers to enrollment. As \nI noted earlier, just 1,500 of the estimated 11,000 low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries in New Mexico eligible for the QI-1 benefit are enrolled. \nThis section provides for several important enrollment simplification \nprocedures, such as allowing self-certification of income and \ncontinuous eligibility, and expanded outreach efforts.\n  Section 5 eliminates the limit on assets, which is set at $4,000 for \nan individual and $6,000 for a couple and disqualifies millions of \nMedicare beneficiaries with very low incomes from qualifying for \nassistance. Some States have waived or disallowed the counting of some \nassets for the purposes of eligibility determination and have seen much \nhigher enrollment rates.\n  I urge the Congress to pass a temporary extension of the QI-1 program \nearly next week, but then to immediately begin work to permanently \nauthorize the QI-1 program and to simplify and streamline all the \nMedicare Savings Programs. Our Nation's low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries and the States deserve nothing less.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a summary and text of this \nlegislation in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Fact Sheet\n\n          ``Medicare Beneficiary Assistance Improvement Act''\n\n       Sponsor: Senator Bingaman\n       Purpose: To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \n     improve the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) and \n     Specified Low-income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) programs \n     within the Medicaid program, and in doing so to make \n     permanent the Qualifying Individual-1 (QI-1) program.\n       Background: The QI-1 program is a federal grant payment to \n     states for the purposes of paying the Medicare Part B \n     premium, which is $78.20 per month in 2005 and will increase \n     to $88.50 per month (over $1000 per year) in 2006, for \n     individuals with income between 120 and 135 percent of the \n     Federal Poverty Level. Federal assistance for QI-1s was \n     created in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 for a five-year \n     period and has been extended on a year-to-year basis since \n     December 2002. The program is currently slated to expire on \n     September 30, 2005.\n       Now is a critical time to make QI-1 a permanent program. \n     Approximately 185,000 low-income Medicare beneficiaries \n     nationwide currently rely on the QI-1 program for payment of \n     their Part B premium and will be hard pressed to afford \n     Medicare coverage without this assistance. The QI-1 program \n     also plays an important role in helping low-income Medicare \n     beneficiaries access prescription drug assistance through \n     Medicare's new drug benefit. Enrollment in the QI-1 program \n     automatically qualifies a person for the Part D drug \n     benefit's low-income subsidy beginning on January 1, 2006.\n       The legislation would ensure that low-income older and \n     disabled Americans nationwide are no longer at risk of losing \n     crucial health care benefits. Furthermore, states, the \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Social \n     Security Administration (SSA) would be spared the \n     administrative burden and cost associated with reauthorizing \n     the program each year--sometimes more than once in a year.\n       Furthermore, the bill proposes several improvements to the \n     QMB and SLMB programs and application processes that will \n     make these low-income benefits both more efficient to \n     administer and more accessible to the individuals who need \n     them.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n     Section 1. Short Title.\n       This section gives the bill's title: the ``Medicare \n     Beneficiary Assistance Improvement Act.''\n     Section 2. Renaming the Program to Eliminate Confusion.\n       This section provides for one unified name for the federal \n     programs that offer cost sharing and benefit assistance for \n     low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Currently, \n     beneficiaries may be in ``dual eligible'' programs, \n     ``Qualified Medicare Beneficiary'' programs (QMB), \n     ``Specified Low-income Medicare Beneficiary'' programs \n     (SLMB), or Qualifying Individual-1 (QI-1) programs. This \n     bill provides one common name for all of these programs, \n     the ``Medicare Savings Programs.''\n       One of the problems contributing to low enrollment in the \n     assistance programs is lack of understanding of the programs \n     or benefits offered, in part due to confusing nomenclature. \n     The new name has been pilot tested with Medicare \n     beneficiaries groups and found to elicit a positive response \n     and interest from Medicare beneficiaries.\n     Section 3. Expanding Protections by Increasing SLMB \n         Eligibility Income Level to 135 Percent of Poverty.\n       This section would make permanent the QI-1 category, which \n     provides assistance with the cost of the Medicare Part B \n     premium for beneficiaries with incomes between 120 percent \n     and 135 percent of poverty, by incorporating these \n     individuals into the SLMB category. In addition, the \n     legislation provides enhanced matching payments (at the \n     state's CHIP rate) for the SLMB population (100-135% FPL).\n     Section 4. Eliminating Barriers to Enrollment.\n       In the states that use 209(b) or SSI criteria for \n     eligibility for the QMB program, Medicare beneficiaries are \n     not automatically made eligible for assistance, even though \n     they qualify. In other states that do not use these criteria, \n     Medicare beneficiaries are automatically eligible if they \n     meet the income thresholds to qualify for SSI payments. \n     Subsection (a) requires that states that use these \n     alternative definitions for eligibility make Medicare \n     beneficiaries automatically eligible for assistance as well.\n       Subsection (b) allows individuals to certify their income \n     without having to provide additional documentation. Many \n     eligible Medicare beneficiaries decline to participate in \n     assistance programs because they have difficulty producing \n     the necessary documents and generally are reluctant to \n     provide such information.\n       Subsection (c) provides for continuous eligibility in the \n     assistance programs. Just as Medicare beneficiaries apply \n     once for Medicare, they can apply once for assistance \n     programs as well, without the need for yearly \n     recertification.\n       Subsection (d) requires states to allow applications for \n     assistance programs on a simplified application form by \n     telephone or mail without the need for a face-to-face \n     interview. Many eligible individuals choose not to apply for \n     government programs because of the stigma associated with a \n     Social Services office. Research shows that individuals are \n     more likely to apply for a benefit when they are not required \n     to have an in-person interview at one of these offices.\n       Subsection (e) expands the role of Social Security in the \n     Medicare Savings Program application process by requiring \n     local Social Security offices to provide oral and written \n     information about Medicare Savings Program benefits and offer \n     Medicare beneficiaries the ability to apply for assistance at \n     these offices, as is the application protocol for the drug \n     benefit's low-income subsidy program.\n       Subsection (f) allows states to outstation eligibility \n     workers at local Social Security field offices.\n     Section 5. Elimination of Asset Test.\n       This section eliminates the strict limit on assets that \n     disqualifies millions of Medicare Beneficiaries with very low \n     incomes from qualifying for assistance. States with high or \n     no asset tests have maximized their QI-1 funding allotments, \n     while states with standard assets tests have seen extremely \n     low QI-1 enrollment.\n     Section 6. Improving Assistance With Out-of-Pocket Costs.\n       Subsection (a) prohibits estate recovery against QMBs for \n     the cost-sharing or benefits provided through this program. \n     Many individuals do not apply for assistance because they \n     fear a surviving spouse will lose what little income they \n     have by having to repay the state for benefits received upon \n     death.\n       Subsection (b) gives QMBs three months of retroactive \n     eligibility, allowing the state to pay for Medicare cost-\n     sharing and premiums for the previous three months. Other \n     categories of individuals who receive assistance through \n     Medicaid (SLMBs, QI-1s, and dual eligibles) are eligible for \n     assistance beginning three months prior to the date which \n     they are enrolled. Because of the low incomes of these \n     beneficiaries, coupled with the fact that lower-income \n     individuals have higher health care costs, such retroactive \n     assistance is particularly important.\n     Section 7. Improving Program Information and Coordination \n         With State, Local, and Other Partners.\n       This section authorizes a data match demonstration project \n     between Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue \n     Service, and SSA to match information to identify individuals \n     who are potentially eligible for assistance programs but not \n     enrolled. This section also authorizes $100 million in grants \n     to states to use the information identified through the \n     demonstration project to improve enrollment in the Medicare \n     Savings Programs and the low-income subsidy, as well as \n     grants to other entities like the Indian Health Service and \n     Veterans' Affairs to do coordinated outreach with these \n     programs.\n     Section 8. Notices to Certain New Medicare Beneficiaries.\n       This section requires SSA, upon sending out initial \n     notification of Medicare eligibility, to include information \n     and an application for the Medicare Savings Programs to \n     individuals the Commissioner identifies as likely to be \n     eligible for benefits under those programs. The section also \n     requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     include in the annual Medicare & You handbook information on \n     the availability of the Medicare Savings Programs and a toll \n     free number for beneficiaries to call to obtain additional \n     information.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1808\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 262\n\n       Whereas William J. Bennett served as chairman of the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities from 1981 to 1985.\n       Whereas William J.

Con. Res. 56\n\n       Whereas mutual cultural understanding and appreciation \n     helps to advance the overall bilateral relationship between \n     the United States and China;\n       Whereas Chinese cultural achievements have enriched the \n     world for over 5,000 years;\n       Whereas Chinese artists both in China and in the United \n     States have excelled in music, dance, fashion, theater, film, \n     and the visual arts;\n       Whereas the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts \n     is hosting a month-long celebration of Chinese cultural \n     contributions at the Festival of China in October 2005;\n       Whereas the event, with more than 50 performances and \n     exhibitions and over 800 artists, will be the largest \n     festival in the history of the Kennedy Center;\n       Whereas the Kennedy Center characterizes the Festival of \n     China as the ``the largest celebration of Chinese performing \n     arts in American history'';\n       Whereas events like the Festival of China, along with \n     efforts to promote educational and scientific cooperation \n     between the United States and China, further mutual \n     understanding between our two societies;\n       Whereas publicly- and privately-funded exchange programs \n     and other forms of Sino-American contacts foster positive \n     relations; and\n       Whereas cultural events like the Festival of China help \n     strengthen diplomatic, commercial, and political cooperation \n     between the United States and China: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the diverse array of cultural contributions made by \n     Chinese artists based in China, the United States, and around \n     the world benefit the entire international community;\n       (2) the Kennedy Center, along with the Chinese Ministry of \n     Culture, should be commended for promoting Chinese \n     achievement in the arts at the Festival of China;\n       (3) the significant undertaking and efforts necessary to \n     organize the Festival of China provides a unique opportunity \n     for bilateral cooperation;\n       (4) building upon the Festival of China, additional efforts \n     that promote cultural understanding between the United States \n     and China should be encouraged;\n       (5) the United States and China should work to promote \n     cultural, as well as scientific and educational, cooperation \n     between the two countries;\n       (6) the United States and China should continue to promote \n     exchange programs, such as the Festival of China, as a vital \n     tool for advancing mutual understanding and cooperation \n     between the people of the United States and the people of \n     China; and\n       (7) the hundreds of performers and individuals who have \n     contributed their time and effort to make this landmark \n     celebration of Chinese culture and the arts a success are to \n     be congratulated.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity \nto introduce a resolution to honor the contributions of Chinese art and \nculture and recognize the landmark Festival of China taking place this \nOctober at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in \nWashington, DC.\n  I commend the joint efforts of the Kennedy Center and the Chinese \nMinistry of Culture in organizing this celebration and congratulate the \nhundreds of individuals who have contributed to its success.\n  With over 800 artists and 50 scheduled events, the Festival of China \nwill truly be one of the largest celebrations of Chinese performance \narts in American history.\n  Starting with Beijing Cultural Week, the Festival will feature \nChinese dance, theater, and opera, and musical performances, along with \nfilm and art exhibitions.\n  I am also privileged to be joined today in offering this resolution \nby two of my colleagues, Senators Stevens and Murkowski, both of whom \nplay significant roles in fostering our relationship with China.\n  Senator Stevens, as the Senate Pro Tempore, chairs the U.S.-China \nInterparliamentary Group, which facilitates annual exchanges between \nMembers of the Senate and their counterparts in the Chinese National \nPeople's Congress.\n  A hero in both the United States and China, his long history with the \nChinese people and their culture goes back\n\n[[Page S10806]]\n\nto World War II, when as a pilot he flew missions in support of the \nFlying Tigers over the ``Hump'' between Burma and China. Because of his \ndedicated service to the people of China, he was later decorated with \nthe Yuan Hai Medal by the Chinese government.\n  Since he first arrived in the Senate 36 years ago, Senator Stevens \nhas worked tirelessly to improve the bilateral relationship between the \nUnited States and China, and promote exchanges and cooperation between \nthe two sides.\n  While Senator Murkowski's tenure in the Senate may be shorter than \nthat of her senior colleague from Alaska, she nevertheless is already \nplaying a key part in shaping our relationship with China.\n  As the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East \nAsian and Pacific Affairs, she has the unique responsibility of \noverseeing our relationship with China and its many neighbors in the \nregion.\n  My own relationship with China first started in 1979 when I had the \nchance to visit as the Mayor of San Francisco.\n  In 1980, I joined my counterpart, Mayor Wang Daohan, in signing an \nagreement to establish the first Sister City relationship of its kind \nbetween San Francisco and Shanghai.\n  Since that time, I have traveled regularly to China and had the \nopportunity to get to know many of its leaders.\n  I can tell you that, in my view, no nation on Earth has changed more \npositively in the past three decades than China.\n  That is why I consider it truly an honor to join with my colleagues \nin introducing this resolution to recognize the Festival of China.\n  I hope that during the month of October 2005 more Americans will have \nthe chance to understand China and its unique contributions to art and \nculture during the past 5,000 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10806-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1921.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3863, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3863) to provide the Secretary of Education \n     with waiver authority for the reallocation rules in the \n     Campus-Based Aid programs, and to extend the deadline by \n     which funds have to be reallocated to institutions of higher \n     education due to a natural disaster.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to \npass H.R. 3863, which would provide the Secretary of Education with the \nauthority to reallocate campus-based aid program funds to institutions \nof higher education that have been affected by Hurricane Katrina or \nHurricane Rita, or that have enrolled affected students. The bill also \nextends the deadline by which funds have to be reallocated, as they are \ncurrently scheduled to expire on September 30.\n  In addition, this bill automatically waives institutional matching \nrequirements for the Federal work-study, supplemental educational \nopportunity grant and Perkins loan funds for affected institutions that \nparticipate in these programs in the 2005-2006 academic year. As a \nresult, affected institutions that have scarce resources will be able \nprovide immediate assistance to their eligible students to enable them \nto meet their higher education expenses this year.\n  I am pleased that we are able to take this step to assist \ninstitutions and students that have been affected by the gulf \nhurricanes by redirecting program funds that would otherwise lapse. We \ncontinue to explore other ways in which to meet the immediate needs of \naffected institutions of higher education and their students.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3863) was read a third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/30/senate-section/article/S10809-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AUTHORITY TO SIGN DULY ENROLLED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate began consideration \nof the DOD appropriations bill, the Defense appropriations bill. Today \nwe had hoped to lock in an amendment filing deadline for Monday \nafternoon, but the other side has objected to that proposal. I know the \nmajority leader and the chairman of the committee are disappointed we \nare unable to lock in a deadline. Next week is a very compressed work \nweek due to the observance of Rosh Hashanah. It is very important we \nmake progress on the Defense appropriations bill, given that short \nschedule. We also hoped to clear a number of nominations, including an \nAssistant Secretary for Homeland Security, several Assistant \nSecretaries at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the \nAssistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing. These are very important \npositions that we expected to confirm today. But, again, there has been \nan objection on the other side.\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\n  As the leader has previously announced, there will be no votes Monday \nor Tuesday in observance of the Jewish holiday, but we will be in \nsession and Senators are encouraged to offer their amendments during \nthat time.
