I know he has a statement following that.\n  Today we return to begin the process of finishing our work for the \n109th Congress. This afternoon we will begin consideration of the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. Senator \nHutchison will be here around 3 o'clock today to begin consideration of \nthat bill with opening statements. Although we do not have any rollcall \nvotes today, I hope the chairman and ranking member will work together \nto reach an agreement for completion of that bill during tomorrow's \nsession.\n  Over the course of the next several days, we have orientation events \nfor Senators-elect for the 110th Congress. We will be welcoming them a \nlittle bit later tonight at a dinner that formally kicks off that \norientation meeting. We will also have our leadership elections this \nweek and policy luncheons as well. Those will be on Tuesday and \nWednesday. The Democratic elections will occur Tuesday morning, \nfollowed by their Democratic policy luncheon, and on this side of the \naisle we will proceed with our elections on Wednesday morning, with our \npolicy luncheon to follow that afternoon. Given this schedule, our \nfirst vote will likely occur sometime Tuesday--late Tuesday afternoon. \nWe do hope to finish the military construction bill on Tuesday \nafternoon.\n  This week we will also consider a short-term continuing resolution. \nThe current CR expires on Friday, and we need to pass a further \nresolution as soon as we possibly can. I have talked to the Democratic \nleader about this and we hope we will act on this quickly.\n  This week we will also work toward agreements and passage of the \nVietnam normal trade relations legislation and the U.S.-India nuclear \nagreement, as well as other appropriations measures that can be \nconsidered. We will keep Members apprised as we schedule these and \nother matters as we move through the week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader and I have had a number \nof conversations and we think this should be a productive week. There \nwill naturally be a number of interruptions, but we have our minds on \ncompleting the appropriations bill and finishing the very important \nnuclear agreement with the largest democracy in the world: India. We \nwant to do it now for\n\n[[Page S10846]]\n\na number of reasons, not the least of which is the President is leaving \nin the next few days for Vietnam and we want to see if that can be \ncompleted with a minimum amount of debate and amendments.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to comment on the \nrecent elections and then a very brief look ahead. First, let me remind \nmy colleagues in every year that we have waged war, our troops have \nfought to uphold certain ideals: the ideals of democracy, of liberty, \nand of freedom. They are those very same principles upon which this \nNation was founded in 1776 and they are the principles we strive to \nlive by today in 2006. We saw that play out in last week's election, a \nnatural manifestation of those ideals. We saw democracy at work, an \nopportunity for the American people to speak, to influence Government. \nSo while I, of course, was disappointed in the outcome, we are not \ndiscouraged, and people come back today not discouraged because, as I \nhave said, this election was democracy at work.\n  Change can be tough. Change opens the door, however, to new \nopportunity, and with that new opportunity comes new hopes. The \nAmerican people have spoken and now is the time for us to move forward \ntogether. That is a very powerful message from the American people: \nMove forward and move forward together.\n  For a number of my colleagues--and I think of this as I mention the \norientation program that begins for our new colleagues for the next \nCongress--moving forward means concentrating in part on paving the way \nfor their successors. For them, it is a time of transition. The next \nfew weeks, the last of the 109th Congress, will be my final weeks \nserving as a Senator, but as most everyone knows, I self-limited my \ntime as a Senator 12 years ago, so I have known every day--every day \nfor the last 12 years--that I would be departing this body next month, \nand it did help me to keep focused. It kept me grounded in the fact \nthat those of us serving here only occupy our positions of service and \nthat we don't own those positions. As Senate majority leader, my job is \nto focus on finishing the business of the 109th Congress, and that is \nwhere I will be concentrating my efforts.\n  As I look back on this Congress, the Republican majority has \naccomplished many things of which I am very proud. We submitted the tax \ncuts for every American which have helped to create 6 million jobs in \nthe last 3 years. We have waged a bold war on terror, which has \nprevented every potential terror attack on our soil right here in this \ncountry over the past 5 years. We have given seniors prescription drug \ncoverage through Medicare for the first time, affordable prescription \ndrug coverage. We confirmed outstanding judicial nominees, including \ntwo Supreme Court justices. We passed a forward-looking energy bill. We \nstrengthened our commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS here at home and \naround the world. We have eliminated frivolous class action lawsuits. \nAnd we did all of this in one of the most challenging partisan \npolitical environments ever.\n  But as we move forward--and that really does officially begin today--\nwe begin with finishing the business of the 109th Congress, and we must \nwork together to overcome that partisanship we have seen in the past, \nthat crippling partisanship that has plagued us in the recent past. \nAmerica wants results and America wants solutions, and it is with that \nfocus we enter the waning days of the 109th Congress. We must return to \nan era of working together in a civil, bipartisan fashion. It is my \nhope both parties, Republicans and Democrats, will work toward \ngoverning together to produce those solutions, to produce those \ntangible results for the American people. That begins here, and it \nbegins now.\n  This week the Senate agenda will focus, as we mentioned earlier, on \ncompleting the remaining appropriations bills, and in the days and in \nthe weeks ahead, we will consider the nomination of Bob Gates as \nSecretary of Defense and, as we just stated, the Vietnam trade \nlegislation and the U.S.-India civilian nuclear technology bill. Each \nof us has many ideas to contribute to the discourse and I know we will \ncontinue to do that. We must build on our successes, the successes that \nmake America the best place--the best place--to raise a family, the \nbest place to start a business, and the best place to get and keep a \njob. Now is the time for us to get back to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10846-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the elections are over. It is time for us to \nmove forward. It is time to move forward and, in working together, \nbegin the process of moving our great country forward.\n  Last week the American people spoke for change. In the months ahead, \nSenate Democrats will fight for change. We are going to focus on three \npriorities, including bipartisanship. We have to work together. We \ncan't accomplish anything as Democrats standing alone. As has been \nshown, the Republicans couldn't accomplish anything standing alone. We \nneed to work together to pass legislation on a bipartisan basis and \nsend it to the White House. We must have open government--a new word: \n``transparency''--and we have to have results. Bipartisanship is great. \nBut if people don't see what we are doing and there are no results, it \nis not as it should be.\n  We have a lot of challenges: health care, energy, the economy, \nincluding these deficits we have; Iraq. We need to restore checks and \nbalances. Last Wednesday or Thursday I met a lot of press people in the \naudience and I said to each of them: I will bet most of you here have \nnever watched a congressional conference in session, a conference \ncommittee meeting. It is true. We haven't had one. That is what we used \nto do here. We used to have them for a couple of hundred years, and for \na couple of decades I was involved in them. But during the last at \nleast 6 years, we haven't had any--a conference where we have a House \nbill and a Senate bill and we have an open meeting, and Republicans \nmake suggestions on how the bill could be made better, and Democrats \nmake suggestions, and there is a vote taken publicly. We haven't done \nthat, and that is not good. We need to do that. That is what I am \ntalking about, open government, these checks and balances our Founding \nFathers set forth in that document we call the Constitution, three \nseparate, equal branches of government.\n  I commend the distinguished majority leader. We worked together here \nin the Senate to come up with the most significant lobbying and ethics \nreform in a quarter of a century--since Watergate, actually. We passed \nthat. We passed it on a bipartisan basis. We included not only lobby \nand ethics reform; we had, as a result of a number of Senators led by \nDianne Feinstein, a provision in there dealing with earmarks, to make \nearmarks more transparent. The bill we passed out of here slowed the \nrevolving door between government employees and lobbyists and \neliminated gifts paid for by lobbyists and substantially expanded \ndisclosure by lobbyists. It limited privately funded travel in many \ninstances, and required more disclosure. It stopped dead-of-the-night \nlegislating regarding open meetings. We did this. We should all feel \ngood about what we accomplished in this regard. But, sadly, it went to \nthe House and that was the end of it. So I would hope before the \ndistinguished majority leader ends his career as a Senator, which has \nbeen a markedly significant career, that we can do that. It should be \nthe law of the land, and hopefully it will be in the next couple \nmonths.\n  Finally, this Senate and we Democrats will do our very best to focus \nour energies on the challenges facing our country and take concrete \nsteps to protect our country and help working families get ahead. For \ntoo long families have struggled with high health care costs while the \nbig drug companies haven't struggled. I am glad they have not had to \nstruggle, but I think we need to have a more even playing field--\nespecially with insurance companies. For too long, ranchers in Nevada\n\n[[Page S10847]]\n\nand farmers all across this country have struggled to fill their tanks \nwith gas and to have enough money in their bank accounts to do that \nwhich they need to do. But they have seen these big oil companies get \nthe tax breaks that I personally do not think they deserve. I don't \nthink the American people believe they deserve them either.\n\n  For too long, all Americans have worried about the direction of the \nwar in Iraq only to see Congress refuse to have a real debate on the \nissues. On a personal basis, I have encouraged the President to listen \nto what the Baker-Hamilton working group has to say, and I know he will \ndo that. I think it is important that he is willing to meet with those \npeople. They are a tremendous group of very patriotic Americans with \nsignificant experience. On the Democratic side, as an example, you have \nthe former Secretary of Defense and former Presidential Chief of Staff. \nThey are good people, Democrats and Republicans, who are going to be \ntalking to the President. If we are going to have a new direction in \nIraq, the President must listen to new ideas. This is a step in the \nright direction.\n  That is why last week I asked the President to convene a bipartisan \ncongressional leadership group and invite other people, too, if he \nwants, of course. It is his meeting. But if he wants, to have Secretary \nBaker, Congressman Hamilton, members of the military. I think if we \nspent a couple of days doing this--however long the President sees \nfit--I think it would be helpful to have if he heard what we had to \nsay. If we are going to have a new direction in Iraq, the President \nmust listen to new ideas. That is why I felt comfortable in suggesting \nthis to the President.\n  We Democrats have some very concrete ideas as to what we think should \nhappen. First of all, again on a bipartisan basis, with 79 votes on the \nDefense Authorization bill for the previous year, Democrats and \nRepublicans joined together to put a provision in that bill that said \nthe year 2006 will be a year of significant transition in Iraq. The \nyear 2006 is coming to an end. We need to implement that law.\n  We, as Democrats, also offered an amendment that received 40 votes \ncalled the Reed-Levin or Levin-Reed amendment, however you want to look \nat it, to begin a change of course, to set a framework to change \ncourse. For example, in that legislation, we called for responsibly \nredeploying our troops to transform the mission to training, \ncounterterror, logistics, force protection. Does this mean pulling all \nthe troops out now? Of course it doesn't. But it does say we must start \nredeploying troops as soon as possible.\n  Second, the sectarian differences must be reconciled. They are \nplaguing the country. We have had in the last 2 days, just that we know \nof, almost 200 Iraqis killed, 3 American soldiers, 4 British soldiers. \nWe must push for changes to the Iraqi Constitution and power and \nresource sharing.\n  I believe it is time for our President to call for a regional \nconference that he participants in. I spoke to the King of Jordan \ntoday. He thought it was a good idea to have the President call for a \nmeeting of the leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan--even Syria. It \nis a regional problem. Let's talk about this regionally. It is more \ntheir problem than our problem. They have more to lose or win than we \ndo. So I think a regional conference would be very important to \nregionalize our strategy.\n  We must revitalize the failed construction efforts. It was stunning \nto see in the weekend news how much less oil is being produced there in \nIraq than before the war. It was stunning to see how little potable \nwater is being produced there than before the war. And to see that the \nelectricity in Baghdad--as an example, prior to the war it was 16 hours \na day, and now it is down to less than 4 hours a day. We have to \nrevitalize our failed reconstruction efforts.\n  Finally, we have to rebuild our military. We do not have a single \nundeployed Army unit that is battle ready. Everything is in need of \nrepair or replacement--replenishment. The Pentagon has told us it will \ncost $75 billion to bring the military up to what it was before the \nwar. We want to work and see if we can accomplish that. Those are our \nsuggestions.\n  From Iraq to the economy, there is much to do in the next few weeks \nand then at the beginning of the new year and a new Congress--so much \nto do. We must take advantage of the next few weeks and get as much \ndone as we can.\n  There are 55 Republicans, there are 45 Democrats, we understand \nthat--for the next 60 days. After that, it is going to be a very slim \nmajority that we have, but it is one that we believe will open the door \nfor bipartisanship. I hope, for the good of the American people, we can \ncontinue to look forward--not dwell on the past but look forward.\n  I hope very much we can get our so-called tax extenders done. The \nreason these are important to do is they are critical tax relief for \nAmerican families and businesses that will expire if we don't do \nsomething--a deduction for college tuition, deduction for State and \nlocal sales taxes. The manager of the bill on military construction is \nKay Bailey Hutchison from Texas. This has been her issue because the \nlarge State of Texas is losing those families' tax deductions, \ndeductions for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by teachers and for \nbusinesses, the research and development tax credit, the work \nopportunity tax credits and Welfare-to-Work tax credits. These things \nare extremely important. Unless we act to extend this relief in the \nnext few weeks, families will be facing a tax increase next year. That \nis not acceptable and we need to act.\n  It is a new day in the Senate. Let's work together and move America \nforward. I offer my hand to my friends on the other side of the aisle. \nI have reached out to my friend, Senator Frist. We are going to do \neverything we can to have the country know we are doing good things in \nthe next few weeks. And I reached out to my friend, Mitch McConnell, \nwho I understand will be the next Republican leader, to work together \non the issues of the next Congress as we have on many issues in the \npast.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10847-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10847-S10848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BIPARTISANSHIP\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank both the majority leader and \nminority leader for their comments this afternoon and for setting forth \nthe tone of moving forward in a spirit of bipartisanship on behalf of \nour country. I want to quickly make four points.\n  It is going to be very important for us in the weeks ahead, and in \nthe new Congress, that we do find the seeds of bipartisanship which we \nhave found in the past in many of the efforts that have gone on in this \nbody. For me, during my first 2 years as a Senator, one of the things I \nwill always remember as one of the best times of the Senate is when we \ncame together with the Gang of 14, with 7 Republicans and 7 Democrats, \nto make sure that this Senate was able to get beyond the very difficult \nissue that it faced. I hope we find more and more of those \nopportunities as we move forward on the great issues of our time, \nincluding Iraq, energy, health care, and the rest of the issues with \nwhich we must deal as a country.\n  I will say this as well. In the days ahead, we will hear many things \nabout some of our colleagues, some of whom are newcomers to our \ninstitution, the U.S. Senate, and some of them who are leaving. For me, \nit is a sad day that Senator Chafee and Senator DeWine, who were \nmembers of the Gang of 14, will not be around to be a part of that \nfuture bipartisan coalition that we are going to have to have in the \nSenate. But I hope, on the side of both the Democrats and the \nRepublicans, that there is a great number of Members of the Senate on \nboth sides of the aisle who will come together to address those \nsignificant issues that face us as a country.\n  As I spent my time in Colorado for most of the last month and \ntraveled around the State, most of the people in my State were making \none statement to us as a Congress and that was to get about the \npeople's business. They want us to do the work that they so fervently \nwant to be accomplished for this country. I believe in my State--which \nI believe is reflective of what is happening around the country--they \nwant\n\n[[Page S10848]]\n\nus to set a new direction and to be successful in our undertaking in \nIraq. I join the minority leader, Senator Reid, in his comments about \nhow we ought to move forward in trying to create a bipartisan approach \nto achieving success in Iraq.\n  As I traveled around my State, and as I traveled around the country \nas well, I think the issue of energy independence has become an issue \non which people very much want us to get beyond the rhetoric they have \nheard for the last 30 years. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was one of \nthe few bipartisan efforts that ultimately succeeded in this Congress. \nI hope, as we move ahead on the issue of energy, we will find ways of \nembracing conservation, embracing renewable energy, embracing the new \ntechnologies of today so we can in fact get our hands on energy \nindependence, which is so critical. It is critical for our Nation from \nthe point of view of the national security of the United States of \nAmerica and the world. It is critical for our Nation in terms of our \neconomic security, and it is critical for our Nation in terms of the \nenvironmental security which is also at stake on the issue of energy. \nFinally, it is critical to our country as to how we provide new \nopportunities for rural America as we grow our way to energy \nindependence in this country.\n  Finally, I would like to make a comment on an issue which I believe \ncontinues to break the backs of the American people and bankrupt \nAmerican businesses today and that is the issue of health care and the \ncosts of health care, which have risen astronomically. We have left \nalmost 50 million people of our country without health insurance, \n77,000 in my State of Colorado alone.\n  I hope this institution, the Senate, working with the House of \nRepresentatives, can deliver real results for the people of the United \nStates of America in the weeks and years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, it is my pleasure today to bring the \nfiscal year 2007 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and related \nagencies bill to the Senate for consideration. The bill provides $16.26 \nbillion for military construction, $77.9 billion for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, and $143.5 million for the related agencies.\n  The bill provides the much needed resources for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to care for our brave veterans returning from \nAfghanistan and Iraq, as well as those who have served with honor in \nour past wars. We fully support our veterans and appreciate the \nsacrifices they made for our country, by increasing the VA's funding by \n$6.45 billion from last year's enacted level to the President's request \nof $77.9 billion.\n  This year, we are proposing to bring medical services and medical \nadministration under one account. This merger of the two accounts will \ngive the VA the flexibility to manage and budget all medical services \noperations, including hospital staff personnel, from one account for \nbetter management, organization, and efficiency. The funding for the \nnew combined medical services account is $28.7 billion, which is $3.1 \nbillion above last year's level and equal to the President's request. \nThe funding recommendation also includes the full request of $3.6 \nbillion for medical facilities; $412 million for medical and prosthetic \nresearch, which is equal to last year's level and $13 million above the \nPresident's request; $429 million for major construction; and $85 \nmillion for grants for construction of State extended-care facilities.\n  This bill bridges a significant funding gap in fiscal year 2007 for \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs. The administration's budget request \nincluded legislative proposals for the VA's health care system that \nwould have instituted new enrollment fees and increased the copayments \nfor prescription drugs, both of which would have been paid by veterans. \nRevenue estimate for those proposals was $795 million. The \nadministration assumed this revenue in the VA's budget request. The \nsubcommittee has denied these proposals and has provided the $795 \nmillion difference for VA health care.\n  The bill also contains additional resources in the areas of advanced \nprosthetics, recognizing that veterans returning from Operations Iraqi \nFreedom and Enduring Freedom are experiencing the loss of limbs due to \ncombat injury.\n  The bill provides much needed funds for military construction. With \nthe impending return of troops as a result of the current overseas \nrebasing effort, which our subcommittee recommended and strongly \nsupports, BRAC, Army modularity, and the global war on terror, our \nservice men and women are in a time of great transformation, and the \nfunds will be provided for these accounts. It is important that they \nreceive these facilities to enable the transformation. We are also \ncontinuing to press our NATO allies to share the burden of construction \ncosts for NATO facilities and have been successful.\n\n  The bill provides necessary funds for the rebasing effort as well as \ncontinues the emphasis on family housing initiatives within the \nDepartment of Defense. It also provides $1.1 billion for Guard and \nReserve components which is $215 million above the requested level. The \nbill includes funding totaling $5.2 billion to implement the BRAC 2005 \ndecisions. This is an increase of $3.7 billion over last year. We do \nrecommend a minor cut of 7 percent to this account because we found \nflexibility in supplies and equipment will not be needed next year \nbecause of the slow pace of BRAC implementation. I would emphasize, \nhowever, that no BRAC construction projects are affected.\n  Putting our bill together was certainly a bipartisan effort. Let me \nsay now we are giving notice to Members on both sides of the aisle that \nwe plan to come forward tomorrow about 2:15 with all of the amendments \nwe have had requested so far, and anything a Member might want to put \nin this bill needs to be in our hands by close of business today, 5 \no'clock. We wish to finish up the bill, deal with the amendments at \n2:15 on Tuesday, and have our vote then lined up for later in the \nafternoon on Tuesday, in the 5 o'clock to 5:30 range. So we are giving \nnotice, and we hope if there are any amendments we have not already \nbeen given, anyone with that kind of request will come forward.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein, the ranking member, for her partnership. \nWe have worked so well together throughout our time on this \nsubcommittee. We actually have been chairman and ranking member, both \nof us. I have been chairman and she has been ranking member, and we \nhave been the other way, and I think we will be the other way come \nJanuary. I know it will make no difference. I know we will meet the \nneeds of military construction. We will meet the needs of our veterans. \nWe will do it the right way, and we will do it in agreement, because we \nhave the same goals--that we honor our veterans with the services they \ndeserve and that we provide for our military housing and military \nconstruction and cleanup for BRAC in the most responsible way. I \ncouldn't ask for a better working relationship than I have with my \nranking member and her staff. I look forward to the years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as I was standing here looking out \nat a woman presiding and a woman chairman, a woman ranking member. I \nthought, there has been progress.\n  I am very pleased to join my chairman in recommending the 2007 \nMilitary Construction-Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill to the Senate. I thank my friend Chairman Hutchison \nfor her hard work on this bill, and I especially thank the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran, and the ranking member, \nSenator Byrd, for their support and help in bringing this bill to the \nfloor.\n  This past weekend the Nation observed Veterans Day, the day we set \naside to honor America's veterans with ceremonies across this great \nland.\n\n[[Page S10855]]\n\nToday the Senate takes up a bill that backs up the speeches and \nceremonies with the funding necessary to provide the services our \nveterans were promised and that they both need and deserve. The bill \nbefore us today is a critically important funding measure for our \nNation's veterans and for the Active and Reserve Forces in the \nmilitary. It is a good bill.\n  The bill provides a total of $94.3 billion in its three titles. The \nbulk of the funding, $77.9 billion, is for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. Of that amount, $41.4 billion is mandatory spending for \nveterans benefit programs, such as veterans compensation and pensions, \nand $36.5 billion is discretionary spending, primarily for the medical \nprogram. This means that medical service programs are funded at the \nlevel necessary to meet the needs of our veterans. Both the chairman \nand I believe this is so.\n  The funding in this bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs is \nequal to the President's budget request and almost $6.5 billion--that \nis an increase of 9 percent--over the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. \nThis increase is necessary due to the Iraq and Afghanistan situation.\n  For veterans health, the bill provides $32.67 billion. That is an \nincrease of 11.3 percent above the 2006 level. It includes $3.2 billion \nfor mental health, a $340 million increase over last year's enacted \nlevel. And it includes $4.3 billion, a $228 million increase over last \nyear's enacted level, for geriatrics and extended care to assist the \nNation's aging veterans population.\n  For military construction, which 2 years ago was all that we did \ntogether--now we also have the veterans budget for the second year--the \nbill includes $16.3 billion in funding. That is for a wide range of \nmission-critical facilities--barracks, daycare centers, family housing \nprojects, both within the United States and overseas. Also included in \nthat funding is $5.24 billion to implement the most recent base \nrealignment and closure round, not so fondly known as BRAC around here.\n  Last but not least, the bill includes $143 million for a group of \nsmall but essential agencies, including the American Battle Monuments \nCommission and the Armed Forces Retirement Home. This title of the bill \nalso funds Arlington National Cemetery, a sacred site familiar to all \nAmericans which in many ways is the centerpiece of our homage to those \nwho serve the Nation and our military in war and in peace.\n  In a year in which the Appropriations Committee has been faced with \nsevere budget constraints, we are fortunate to be able to bring to the \nSenate a bill that fully funds the President's request for veterans and \nmeets the pressing infrastructure requirements of the military. We were \nable to accomplish this without imposing any new fees or copayments on \nveterans. Most importantly, perhaps, is we do not appear to be facing \nthe same kind of shortfall in funding for VA health care that the \nSenate was confronted with last year.\n\n  Providing affordable, accessible, first-rate health care to our \nNation's veterans is a priority for this Senate and for both the \nchairman and myself. At a time when our Nation is at war and over \n155,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are seeking VA health care \nservices, many with grievous physical and mental wounds, veterans \nhealth care must be placed at the top of the list. Money is tight, to \nbe sure. But like America's military forces currently fighting in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, the veterans who have fought in those and past wars \ndeserve the fullest measure of our support and gratitude.\n  Likewise, the Nation's military forces need and deserve quality \nfacilities in which to live and work. With the new round of BRAC and \nthe ongoing global realignment of United States forces in Europe, \nKorea, and elsewhere overseas, the Defense Department's base structure \nis undergoing change. Tens of thousands of military personnel are \nreturning to the United States from bases that are being closed \noverseas, placing great demand on domestic installations that will \nabsorb them and their families.\n  At the same time, the Army is in the midst of reinventing its \nmilitary structure, transforming from cumbersome divisions and brigades \ninto more mobile and agile modular units. This modularity carries with \nit a new set of infrastructure requirements, and new emphasis regarding \nnew facilities is being placed on the Nation's special operations \nforces, including the fielding of a new Marine Corps special operations \ncommand. All of this restructuring, of course, is going on while \nupwards of 170,000 United States military personnel remain fully \nengaged in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In all, there are many challenges facing the military construction \nbudget. Yet when the $5.2 billion for a new BRAC round is taken out of \nthe equation, the amount of military construction funding requested by \nthe President remained nearly level with last year's funding. \nNevertheless, with the budget constraints we face this year, we were \nable to provide sufficient military construction dollars to fund the \nhundreds of military construction priorities both at home and abroad \nthat have all been authorized in the Defense authorization bill.\n  This is a carefully balanced, bipartisan bill that is designed to \nmeet the health and welfare needs of America's veterans and the \ninfrastructure requirements of America's military forces with very \ntight budget limitations.\n  I again commend Chairman Hutchison for her work in developing this \npackage. With the passage of this bill, we will have done our work in \nthe Senate. I firmly believe we can work quickly to complete a \nconference with the House and send a good bill to the President, if the \nleadership gives us the opportunity. There has been some speculation \nthat no appropriations bills will emerge from this lameduck session and \nthat we instead will be operating under a continuing resolution for \nmonths to come. I hope that speculation is wrong. It would be a serious \ndisservice to our Nation's veterans and our active-duty military to \nrelegate the programs funded under MilCon-VA to a continuing resolution \nin the new year. It will be at a $6.5 billion loss to these programs to \ndo that. I know Chairman Hutchison, Chairman Cochran, and Senator Byrd \nshare my desire to send a conference report on this bill to the \nPresident and see it signed into law before the end of the year. I very \nmuch hope we can do so.\n  A great deal of work on both sides of the aisle has gone into \nproducing this bill. I thank my colleagues for their support, and I \nthank my staff--Christina Evans on my immediate left, BG Wright on my \nfar left, and Chad Schulken who is back in the staff dock--and also \nSenator Hutchison's staff--Dennis Balkham, Sean Knowles, and Rose \nFabia--for the long hours and great effort they have put into this \nbill.\n  The bill is a direct result of a remarkable working relationship \nbetween Senator Hutchison and myself and between her staff and my \nstaff. I thank the chairman again for this warmth and most particularly \nfor her leadership. I am very pleased to recommend passage of this bill \nto the full Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I agree with Senator Feinstein's \nstatement completely that we should pass this bill. I think it would be \nirresponsible, honestly, for us not to fund the priorities and the \nincreases that are in this bill for our veterans and our military \nconstruction projects. So I will make every effort to ensure that we do \nhave this bill go to conference, and I think we will be very close with \nthe House on the conference items.\n  I do believe we can get this bill to the President. Frankly, I think \nthere are other appropriations bills that would be in the same \nsituation. We have new projects in many of the pieces of legislation. I \ncannot think of an appropriations bill that is not bipartisan. So it is \nmy hope that we can keep the priorities and spending that we have \nworked very hard all of this year to produce in all of the \nappropriations bills, rather than rely on a continuing resolution that \ndoes not take into account the bipartisan efforts that have been made \nto fund the priorities of today. That is especially true in our bill \nbecause it is ongoing, defense-related items, but I think there are \nother bills that have the same kinds of priorities and necessities as \nwell. So we will work together in our bipartisan way and try to make \nsure that happens.\n  I will just say once again that if any of our colleagues have \namendments,\n\n[[Page S10856]]\n\nnow is the time to notify us, by the close of business today, 5 \no'clock. It is our hope to dispose of amendments starting at 2:15 \ntomorrow. I am told that votes could occur any time after 2:15, and the \noffices will be appropriately notified.\n  Let me end by saying that I, too, want to give so much credit to \nSenator Feinstein's staff and my staff who have a great working \nrelationship. They work the long hours and they do so much behind the \nscenes that makes everything come together--the amounts that we have in \nthe budget resolution and the allocations on the Appropriations \nCommittee and all of the different factors that go into an \nappropriations bill. They do a great job. I thank Senator Feinstein's \nthree staff members, and my three staff members, who were named by \nSenator Feinstein earlier.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the pending Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007, H.R. 5385, \nas reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations provides $89.861 \nbillion in budget authority and $84.956 billion in outlays in fiscal \nyear 2007 for the Military Construction and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs programs. Of these totals, $36.961 billion in budget authority \nand $36.814 billion outlays are for mandatory programs in fiscal year \n2007.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in fiscal year \n2007 of $52.900 billion. This amount is $111 million above the \nPresident's request, at the 302(b) allocations adopted by the Senate, \n$8.8 billion above fiscal year 2006 enacted levels, and $41.8 billion \nbelow the House-passed bill.\n  As my colleagues know, the large difference with the House funding \nlevel is due to the difference in allocations. This is primarily due to \nthe Defense Health Program in the Senate's Defense allocation but in \nthe House's Military Quality of Life and Veteran's Affairs allocation.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       H.R. 5385, 2007 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS\n       APPROPRIATIONS, SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal Year 2007, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     Purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority.............       52,900       36,961       89,861\n    Outlays......................       48,142       36,814       84,956\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.............       52,900       36,961       89,861\n    Outlays......................            *            *            *\n2006 Enacted:\n    Budget authority.............       44,143       38,188       82,331\n    Outlays......................       41,803       38,093       79,896\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............       52,789       36,388       89,177\n    Outlays......................       46,782       36,284       83,066\nHouse-passed bill: \\1\\\n    Budget authority.............       94,705       36,388      131,093\n    Outlays......................       89,448       36,284      125,732\nSenate-reported bill compared to:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget authority.........            0            0            0\n        Outlays..................           na           na           na\n    2006 Enacted:\n        Budget authority.........        8,757       -1,227        7,530\n        Outlays..................        6,339       -1,279        5,060\n    President's request:\n        Budget authority.........          111          573          684\n        Outlays..................        1,360          530        1,890\n    House-passed bill: \\1\\\n        Budget authority.........      -41,805          573      -41,232\n        Outlays..................      -41,306          530      -40,776\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* There is no outlay allocation in the Senate for 2007 appropriations\n  bills.\n\\1\\ House and Senate bills having different jurisdictions.\n \nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5128\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to call up my amendment for \nfunding for VA oversight. I am talking about properly funding the VA \nInspector General's Office. I do have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], for himself and Mr. \n     Obama, proposes an amendment numbered 5128.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide, with an offset, an additional $2,500,000 for the \n  Department of Veterans Affairs for the Office of Inspector General)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Additional Amount for Office of Inspector \n     General of Department of Veterans Affairs.--The amount \n     appropriated by this title under the heading ``Office of \n     Inspector General'' is hereby increased by $2,500,000.\n       (b) Offset.--The amount appropriated by this title under \n     the heading ``Construction, Major Projects'' is hereby \n     reduced by $2,500,000.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want to say at the outset that I am \ncognizant of the constraints placed upon the Appropriations Committee \nand I am very pleased that funding has been included to obviate the \nneed for the administration's proposals to charge veterans more for \ntheir care.\n  That said, I don't believe it is in anyone's interest--least of all \nveterans--to cut funding for the VA watchdog, the inspector general.\n  The President's budget and this VA-MilCon bill both call for a \nreduction in 27 IG staff members.\n  Our amendment seeks to restore this cut and ensure the IG can do his \njob by adding $2.5 million in resources. The money for this amendment \nwould be drawn from the construction account and would amount to only a \nhalf of a percent of the entire account.\n  If this bill is enacted as is, the OIG oversight function would \nsuffer. There would be an increased risk of criminal activity, waste, \nand abuse across VA programs and operations. It would result in fewer \nmonetary benefits in a time of fiscal restraint, fewer reports with \nrecommendations for improved economy and efficiencies, and fewer \narrests, indictments, and convictions of individuals who prey on \nAmerica's veterans or seek to defraud VA. The loss of staff would \nmarkedly diminish the IG's ability to address complex issues such as \nthe recent loss of VA data and other information technology issues.\n  Furthermore, it would reverse the recent trend of the OIG expanding \nits truly independent oversight of VA's health care programs and \noperations and reduce OIG field presence where veterans receive care at \nVA facilities across the Nation.\n  During the recent VA data theft incident, had it not been for the \ndiligence of investigators from the VA IG's office, it is likely it \nwould have taken even longer for the Secretary, Congress and affected \nveterans to have learned of the loss.\n  Now is not the time to cut the IG's funding and staff. Clearly, it is \nmore important than ever that VA has the effective internal oversight \nthat only a robust and fully funded Inspector General's Office can \nprovide.\n  The authors of the VA independent budget realize this and have \nwritten a letter to the House and Senate leadership in support of the \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Independent Budget,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 13, 2006.\n     Speaker of the House Hastert,\n     House Minority Leader Pelosi,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Senate Majority Leader Frist,\n     Senate Minority Leader Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear ___: We write on behalf of AMVETS, Disabled American \n     Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America, joint authors of the \n     Independent Budget, on a matter of concern dealing with the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Inspector \n     General (OIG).\n       Like most Federal agencies, VA currently is subject to a \n     Continuing Resolution until Congress passes VA's \n     appropriations act, which may not occur until very late this \n     calendar year, or perhaps even later. Because the proposed \n     fiscal year 2007 appropriation\n\n[[Page S10857]]\n\n     for VA's OIG is expected to result in a significant \n     shortfall, we understand VA is preparing to take steps to \n     develop a plan to reduce spending in that office. We also \n     understand that the principal strategy will be a reduction in \n     the number of OIG employees through attrition of the existing \n     work force.\n       The VA OIG budget is formulated based on 458 full-time \n     employee equivalents (FTEE). However, that office is \n     currently staffed at 473 FTEE. The longer that office remains \n     above 458 FTEE, the more they will be required to reduce \n     staffing in order to achieve the lower FTEE limitation. Given \n     this situation, we have been advised that a number of steps \n     are being taken or are planned, including not filling vacant \n     positions except on a case-by-case examination of need versus \n     alternatives.\n       While we sometimes disagree with findings in a particular \n     OIG review or investigation, the OIG constitutes a major \n     segment of VA's management system to assure accountability, \n     and within VA serves as an independent voice on patient \n     safety, health care quality, financial stewardship, systems \n     and facilities management and data integrity. Reducing the \n     OIG's ability to carry out such vital functions, even on a \n     marginal basis as has been proposed, ultimately could put \n     veterans in jeopardy. We understand Senator Daniel Akaka has \n     proposed an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Veterans \n     Affairs-Military Quality of Life appropriations bill that \n     would replenish these funds to the OIG. We strongly support \n     Senator Akaka's proposal and urge the House and Senate \n     Leadership to include funds associated with Senator Akaka's \n     amendment in the final conference report on VA's \n     appropriation for the new fiscal year. We believe this small \n     investment will pay very large dividends for veterans who \n     need and use VA services.\n       We appreciate your attention to this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     David G. Greineder,\n       Acting National Legislative Director, AMVETS;\n     Carl Blake,\n       Acting National Legislative Director, Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America;\n     Joseph C. Violante,\n       National Legislative Director, Disabled American Veterans;\n     Dennis Cullinan,\n       National Legislative Director, Veterans of Foreign Wars of \n     the United States.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. This is a small amount of money relative to the overall \nspending in this bill. Indeed, such a modest amount is essential to \nensuring the billions included in this bill are spent wisely.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n\n                      lance corporal eric benholtz\n\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a brave young man \nfrom my home State of Ohio, Marine LCpl Eric Bernholtz. Lance Corporal \nBernholtz was killed on August 3, 2005, when an improvised explosive \ndevice detonated under his military vehicle during combat operations \nsouth of Haditha, Iraq. He is survived by his parents, James and \nCatherine, his brother Adam and sister-in-law Sarah, and his long-time \ngirlfriend Erica Scott.\n  Growing up in Grove City, OH, Eric enjoyed playing sports and video \ngames with his friends. Eric loved children; his father said that even \nwhen he was in high school, little kids would knock on the door and \nsay, ``Can Eric come out and play?'' He enjoyed reading and rock \nclimbing and talked about becoming a firefighter and remodeling houses. \nShortly after the attacks of September 11, Eric decided that he wanted \nto serve his country. He decided to do so by enlisting in the Marines \nin 2003.\n  Former neighbor Andy Unger described the 23-year-old Marine Reservist \nas a carefree kid who found his focus in the military. Jim, Eric's \nfather, agreed that his son had found what he was looking for in the \nmilitary, even though he knew it meant fighting in Iraq. These are \nJim's words describing a conversation he had with his Eric: ``When Eric \ntold me he had joined the Marines I said, `You know you will have to go \nover there.' And he told me, `Somebody has to do this Dad.' He wanted \nto be one of those people.''\n  Grove City High School guidance counselor John Hampson knew Eric well \nand said that he was simply the kind of person who always made others \nfeel good. ``He would always greet you,'' John recalls. ``He was always \nmaking a point to go out of his way to say hello. He knew how to have \nfun, but to have fun in an appropriate manner.'' He remembers Eric as a \njokester who liked to make everyone laugh and that he talked of being a \nfirefighter when he ended his tour of duty.\n  The night before Eric's funeral, his friends shared humorous stories \nabout their friend the prankster. They recalled how they would sneak \ninto church to play basketball, drink chocolate milkshakes, and talk \nall night. In the words of his childhood friend, Brent Carman, ``There \nwas never a moment without a joke or a smile.'' They laughed about \nEric's trademark footwear, which he called ``shandals.'' This \nparticular style involved Eric cutting off the toes and heels off his \nold gym shoes, and hence turning them into something resembling \nsandals. Dave Montgomery, a friend, reflected that Eric was simply the \ntype of person who loved life.\n  At Eric's funeral, the Reverend Rob Paugh laughingly recalled his \nnavigational skills. ``Eric thought he had a sense of direction'' he \nsaid. He then shared a story about how Eric once managed to find a \nwedding in Louisiana by simply driving south--without knowing either \nthe name of the town or the church. The minister was amazed to see him \nthere in a suit--but no socks.\n  Eric was a man of tremendous dedication--dedication to his family and \nfriends and dedication to his faith. A devoted member of the Grove City \nChurch of the Nazarene, Eric spent much of his time and energy there. \nHe acted in church dramas and coached church youth sports teams.\n  Those close to Eric said he was known for being full of life and \npersonality, having a soft-spoken heart and a love of God. These same \nfriends stood watch over Eric from the time the Marines brought his \nbody to the funeral home until the morning of his burial.\n  And on July 19, few weeks before his death, this is what he told his \nmother over the phone: ``I'm not afraid and you know, Mom, if something \nhappens to me, I'm okay with Jesus. I'm fine. You're going to see me \nagain.''\n  Other friends have also reflected upon how important his faith was to \nEric. Jerrod ``Butter'' Watson of Newark, OH, said:\n\n       Eric was a solider for our country but more importantly, \n     for God. He is guarding the gates of heaven now. We mourn the \n     loss of such an honorable young man but rejoice that he is in \n     a far better place and we will see him soon. May God bless \n     the family and friends left behind. I am honored to have \n     known such an amazing man of faith and courage. He will never \n     be forgotten.\n\n  A fellow marine commented upon his friendship with Eric Bernholtz, \nalso making special note of his strong faith in the Lord:\n\n       [Eric] was a solid Marine, with endless potential. I know \n     he's in a better place now. He would never shy away from his \n     faith and would try to convince others to believe. I remember \n     that being one of his greatest qualities. I was always \n     envious of his faith in the Lord. He will be greatly missed, \n     and the Marine Corps is just a little bit weaker without him. \n     To his parents, I couldn't have met a better man. I grieve \n     with you, but couldn't begin to understand your pain. Be \n     proud of Eric, he was a great person. To Eric, so long \n     friend, I look forward to the day we meet again.\n\n  This strength in the Lord also gives Eric's parents the necessary \nwillpower to make it through the loss of their beloved son. Jim \nBernholtz said that when he and his wife learned of their Eric's death, \nthe Lord gave them both peace right away. They miss him every day but \nthey know exactly where Eric is. In an interview, Jim said that in \ntwenty-some-odd years he would be shaking hands with his son agaln.\n  Eric Bernholtz was a brave young man who always wanted to do the \nright thing. His father said, ``Eric told me when he was on the phone \nwith me last, 'Dad, I'm not scared. I'm ready to come home, but I now \nhave to finish what I came here to do.' ''\n  His parents Jim and Cathy remember Eric as a ``constant joy.'' Even \nwhen he\n\n[[Page S10858]]\n\ncame home late, missing his curfew by minutes, as upset as they would \ntry to be with him he would have them all laughing together within \nminutes.\n  At his brother's funeral, Adam Bernholtz, who is deaf, gave the \neulogy in sign language. Eric was his best friend growing up and was \nhis bridge to the hearing world. Eric grew up with sign language as \nmuch as the spoken word and fit into the deaf world as easily as the \nhearing. As Adam finished, he signed: ``I love you. I can't wait to run \nand hug you when I see you again.''\n  Eric Bernholtz will be greatly missed by all those who had the \nprivilege of knowing and loving him. I am so honored to have been given \nthe privilege of sharing his bravery with all of you today. Fran and I \ncontinue to pray for this courageous young man and his family.\n\n\n                   lance corporal christopher j. dyer\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I would also like to speak about a \nfellow Ohioan who gave his life during Operation Iraqi Freedom--Marine \nLCpl Christopher J. Dyer, from Evendale, OH. On August 3, 2005, Lance \nCorporal Dyer died near Haditha, Iraq, when a roadside bomb exploded \nunder his vehicle.\n  Chris was only 19 years old when he gave his life in service to this \nNation. But 19 years was more than enough time for him to inspire all \nwho knew him. There are very few--young or old--who live with the same \ndetermination and joy that Chris did. Jason Rosser, one of his \nclassmates and friends, remembers that Chris ``lived every day to the \nfullest--if I was given 100 years more, I still couldn't catch up to \nhim.''\n  Winston Churchill once said something that was very simple, but which \nperfectly illustrates the life of Chris Dyer--``Never, never, never \ngive up.'' Chris never gave up. No matter how difficult the challenge, \nhe wasn't satisfied unless he excelled at it. In fact, Chris \nconsistently sought out challenges that tested him both mentally and \nphysically. Giving up simply wasn't an option in his world. He was the \nkind of person who sets goals--and then achieves them.\n  Chris graduated with honors from Princeton High School in 2004. He \nhad excelled in his classes, taking 5 years of German and 3 of physics. \n``If there was a tougher course to take,'' his father, John, recalls, \n``he wanted to take it. He was such a fine young man.''\n  Chris was well-rounded. He played viola in the orchestra and dove for \nthe swim team. His teammates remember his drive to excel in all sports, \neven though he wasn't always the athlete who had the most natural \nability. His father, John, remembers that Chris played football for the \nfirst time in eighth grade--and was team captain by the end of the \nseason. And during one high school swim meet, Chris attempted a dive \nthat fell somewhat short of what a dive should be--he belly flopped \ninto the water with a loud smacking noise. But 5 minutes later, Chris \nwas bravely climbing the ladder once again--still red from the slapping \nof the water.\n  Princeton High School Principal Ray Spicher said:\n\n       Chris was a young man who had tremendous drive and \n     tremendous potential. He was really intense about a lot of \n     aspects of life but also fun-loving. He knew how to have a \n     good time. Chris was the kind of guy we would all hope our \n     kids would grow up to be like.\n  Chris was also involved in his community, and took the time to write \nto the second- and third-graders in a Sunday school class, thanking \nthem for the letters they had sent him in Iraq--correspondence he had \nenjoyed sharing with his fellow marines.\n  I have talked about Chris the honors student and Chris the athlete. \nIt is time for me to talk about Chris, the marine.\n  Chris joined the Marines out of a strong sense of duty, and because \nhe felt it was an honor to serve. Growing up, Chris had kept his sights \non his goal of one day serving his country. In high school, the \nadvanced studies coordinator at Princeton High, Tim Dugan, was also an \nex-Marine. He and Chris grew close, and had many discussions about \nChris's own interest in joining the Corps.\n  Chris also viewed the Marines as the ultimate challenge. His father, \nJohn, recalls that his son joined the Marines for two reasons. One was \nto serve his country, and the other was to prove himself as one of the \nbest. For Chris, the Marines were just another way of testing himself.\n  Chris also understood what it truly meant to be a marine. John \nremembers walking with his son just after he graduated from boot camp. \nThese were Chris's words:\n\n       Dad, I know you're going to be worried. I don't want you to \n     worry. I'm going to come home. I couldn't be any happier with \n     what I am in life right now. Dad, I know this is hard for \n     you, but if it comes to it and I have to give my life for one \n     of my fellow Marines, I'll do it without thinking.\n\n  John says that the Marines gave Chris the focus that helped him \nfulfill his enormous potential. ``I think, for him not to reach his \ndreams,'' John said, ``would have killed him just as much as that bomb \nin Iraq.'' Upon arriving in Iraq, Chris was offered a job training \nIraqis. Although this meant an immediate promotion and a job off the \nfront lines, Chris--who was the only PFC in his company to carry a \nsquad automatic weapon, or SAW--refused. He explained his decision in a \nlong letter to his father, writing:\n\n       I was offered that job training Iraqis. But, Dad, I'm a SAW \n     gunner, and you know what that firepower means to my squad, \n     so I turned it down. So, no promotion, no safe haven, no \n     worries.\n\n  I think Chris's letter says a lot about the type of marine he was--\nand about the type of marines he served with.\n  Chris was a member of Lima Company, which lost thirteen other men--\neight of them from Ohio--on the day Chris died. It was a tragedy felt \nnot only by Ohio but by the entire Nation. The bond among these men was \nsomething not seen everyday. Chris' father, John, remembers that his \nson described them as closer than brothers. In video footage of the \nunit in Iraq, the musical Chris is seen strumming his guitar and \nsinging Puff the Magic Dragon, while his Marine brothers laugh around \nhim.\n  I attended Chris' funeral at Arlington Cemetery and was honored to \nmeet his family and friends, who have been truly inspired by his \nstrength of character and dedication to his country. Chris' little \nsister Sarah has also enlisted in the Marines, and is currently \nattending the Ohio State University on a Navy ROTC scholarship. She \nobtained her parents' permission to graduate from high school a year \nearly, and was the second youngest recruit in her graduating class at \nParris Island. ``My brother did influence my decision in that he wanted \nto serve his country,'' she said. ``He realized we have so many \nfreedoms. We have a debt to society.''\n  Sarah wrote the following poem in honor of her brother:\n\n     Dear Dear Brother\n     You have gone home,\n     To your Father, your Savior,\n     Your Kingdom is come.\n     Dear Dear Brother,\n     You fought bravely as a knight,\n     You are a Devil Dog with the fiercest bite.\n     Dear Dear Brother\n     We miss you so,\n     Your father, mother, sisters.\n     All your friends and Joe.\n     Dear Dear Brother\n     We will see you again,\n     After triumphs, and troubles, and all of our pain.\n     Dear dear brother,\n     Stay Tough on high.\n     We will remember you.\n     SEMPER FI\n\n  A bright future awaited Chris Dyer. He had been accepted into the \nhonors program at the Ohio State University and was planning to study \nfinance so that he could become a partner in an investment firm. In the \nlast email he sent to his father, he asked that his coming home party \ninclude salmon, burgers, steaks, and brats. He wanted to purchase a \n1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee, complete with power V-6 and a Moon roof.\n  Chris also wrote that he wouldn't be working during the few months he \nwas home before beginning classes--he was going to take that time to \nget his pilot's license, something that had been his dream for years. \nIn a mural painted in his memory, a plane flies across a midnight blue \nbackground towards a single star representing Chris' spirit.\n  Chris Dyer was a man who was always reaching for the next goal, the \nnext accomplishment. With his life he selflessly defended the values \nthat we all cherish--freedom, liberty, and democracy. His mother, \nKathy, spoke as Chris during a memorial service in his honor. ``Today I \nam not a fallen hero,'' she said. ``I am a risen one.''\n  There is no one for whom that statement could be truer than Chris \nDyer.\n\n[[Page S10859]]\n\nHe always wanted to be the absolute best in whatever he did, be it a \nnew sport, an honors student, a caring brother, or a marine. His \nparents John can take comfort in knowing that their son was successful \nin all of the above.\n  My wife Fran and I wish to express our deepest thanks to Christopher \nDyer for giving his life for our freedom. We will keep his family--his \nparents John Dyer and Kathy Dyer, and his sisters Laura and Sarah--in \nour thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                    Lance Corporal Daniel Mc Vicker\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I come to the Senate floor to pay \ntribute to a remarkable young man and a fellow Ohioan--Marine LCpl \nDaniel M. McVicker from Alliance, OH. Lance Corporal McVicker was \nkilled in the city of Al Qaim, Iraq on October 6, 2005, while driving \nan armored vehicle that was hit by a roadside bomb. He was 20 years \nold.\n  Daniel is survived by his father and stepmother, Mark and Irma \nMcVicker, and his mother and stepfather, Carey and Bill Meissner. He \nwas also the loving brother of Mollie McVicker and Eddie Ricci. Daniel \nis also survived by his grandparents Chet and Nancy Wiley; his \ngrandfather Morgan McVicker; and his great-grandmother Dorothy Bingham.\n  Danny--as he was known to family and friends--lived his life to the \nfullest. His mother, Carey, remembers him as ``a wonderful son and a \nguy who always liked to have fun.'' He had many interests, and was \ndeeply involved in school extracurricular activities. As a freshman at \nWest Branch High School in Beloit OH, he wrestled and played football \nuntil he injured his ankle. But this didn't stop Danny, who quickly \nturned to a new love--music.\n  He joined the school's concert choir and became a favorite \nparticipant in West Branch's annual spring musicals, playing roles in \n``Guys and Dolls,'' ``The Wizard of Oz,'' and ``Grease.'' During his \njunior and senior year, he joined the school's highly competitive \nensemble choir, Young and Alive, and also traveled to perform at \nDisneyland. And during his senior year, Danny earned the honor of being \nelected by his peers as ``Assistant Warrior Chief,'' one of three \nmascots for the school.\n  Danny was something we could all aspire to--a young man who simply \nhad the confidence to be himself. This is what his father, Mark \nMcVicker, had to say about him:\n\n       He had his own drum and people loved him for it. If you met \n     him, you loved him. He was very strong, very friendly, very \n     popular.\n\n  Dr. Scott Weingart, the superintendent of West Branch High School, \nexpressed a similar sentiment. He said:\n\n       Our students remember Dan McVicker as a student who was \n     nice to everyone, who had friends in many, many different \n     circles.\n\n  And Mr. John Zamarelli, Danny's music teacher, described Danny as \n``the rarest of teenagers--one so secure that he never worried about \nwhat anybody thought of him.''\n  Danny was indeed an individual with many interests. But his strongest \npassion was the desire to serve our Nation. Danny and his friends were \nonly high school juniors when the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \noccurred. And yet they were deeply moved by the events of that day. \nInspired to serve his country, Danny joined the Marines Corp shortly \nafter he graduated in 2003. Nine of his classmates joined along with \nhim, all motivated by the same desire. Together, these young men gave \nnew meaning to the mascot of West Branch--the Warriors.\n  Dr. Weingart was not surprised when he learned that Danny had decided \nto enlist. ``He was just that kind of young man,'' he said.\n  Once Danny made the decision to enlist in the Marines, he was \nsurrounded by love and support. Eleven family members accompanied him \nto his enlistment ceremony in Cleveland. They were all very proud.\n  In Iraq, Danny served in the Combat Logistics Battalion Security \nCompany, providing security for convoys as part of the II Marine \nExpeditionary Force. His fellow marines thought very highly of him. Joe \nVickery of Mantua, Ohio, remembers that he saw Danny ``transform into a \ngreat marine.'' In Joe's words, Danny ``never gave up.''\n  Indeed, Danny was a great marine who ``knew what he had to do.'' \nWhile stationed at the Marine Corps Air Station in Cherry Point, NC, he \nvolunteered to go to Iraq on several occasions. In the words of his \nfather, Mark:\n\n       He truly felt like he wasn't contributing unless he was \n     over there.\n\n  This was just typical of Danny. He was always willing to help out--be \nit his country, community, or fellow man. He was a proud member of the \nFirst Brethren Church of North Georgetown, someone deeply rooted in his \nchurch and community. After joining the Marines, he corresponded on a \nregular basis with his pastor, Rev. Mitchell Funkhouser. Reverend \nFunkhouser particularly recalls one letter, the last that Danny sent. \nReferring to his duty to protect the other troops, Danny had written:\n\n       They called us the Guardians. It's a humbling title.\n\n  I would like to share a story that his father Mark relates about \nDanny, who had wanted to get a tattoo since he was 18, but waited until \nhe joined the Marines to do so. Danny had waited until after his 18th \nbirthday to enlist because he wanted to sign up on his own--he didn't \nwant his dad to do it for him. Well, Danny talked over the tattoo \ndecision with his father Mark and his stepmother Irma. A Bible verse \nwas what he wanted, he said, thinking that because it was religious \nthey would agree to it quicker. As his father, Mark, says:\n\n       So one Sunday the three of us sat down in the living room \n     and researched the Bible. He said I want something that \n     describes strength and it must be in the Book of Daniel.\n\n  Mark and Irma--but mostly Danny--agreed after a couple hours of Bible \nstudy that Daniel 10:6 was going to be his first tattoo once he was a \nMarine. Danny unveiled the new tattoo that Thanksgiving. It was on his \nleft shoulder and read:\n\n       His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the \n     appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and \n     his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and \n     the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.\n\n  Danny was proud of the chosen verse, and Mark himself even agreed \nthat it was a nice-looking tattoo. And 10/6--the number of the Bible \nverse that Danny chose--also became the month and day that he died a \nhero serving his Nation, a symbol of strength and dedication.\n  Danny McVicker was dearly loved and respected by all who knew him. \nOver 400 friends, neighbors, and strangers came to his funeral to pay \ntheir respects. At the funeral, Danny's old roommate, Marine Corporal \nBen Fiddler, said that ``having Daniel as a friend was a blessing.''\n  Danny's schoolmates at West Branch felt the same way. After his \ndeath, they honored him with a makeshift memorial in front of the \nschool. The school has also formalized a tribute by naming a senior \naward in his honor, and a moment of silence was observed in his honor \nbefore a West End versus Alliance High School football game, a game \nwhich Danny's Warriors won with a thrilling, last minute field goal.\n  Indeed, his family, friends, and neighbors will never forget Danny \nMcVicker. He lived life to the fullest, and was model of what we all \nhope our children will become. His heart was big, and he had a \ntremendous sense of dedication to his family, community, and country. \nHis parents should be applauded for having raised such a wonderful son \nand patriot.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep the family of Daniel \nMcVicker in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a new public opinion poll shows that \nAmericans are particularly concerned about the restriction that keeps \nMedicare from bargaining to hold down the costs of the medicine older \npeople purchase.\n  In fact, a new poll yesterday indicated 93 percent of the American \npeople want this restriction lifted--and for obvious reasons. The fact \nof the matter is, millions of older people simply cannot pay their \nskyrocketing prescription drug bills and they want to know why the \nGovernment isn't doing more to contain these costs.\n  Fortunately, we have been able to make a little bit of headway on \nthis issue in the Senate. Senator Snowe and I, in particular, earlier \nthis year, got the support of 54 Senators, a majority of the Senate, to \nlift this restriction and take stronger action to hold down the cost of \nmedicine.\n  Medicare is sort of like the guy going to Costco buying toilet paper \none roll at a time. The Government is not acting like a smart shopper. \nThe Government is not taking practical steps like everyone in \nTennessee, Oregon, Iowa, or anywhere else, to use bargaining power to \nhold down the cost of this essential for older people, prescription \ndrugs.\n  We have made a bit of headway. I have been particularly pleased the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, made it clear this would \nbe a top priority for the Senate to take up when we begin our work \nearly next year.\n  Given that and in hopes that the Senate can come together on a \nbipartisan basis--and I believe the approach Senator Snowe and I have \nbeen taking for the past 3 years can now get over 60 votes in the \nSenate--I take a few minutes tonight to outline a bit as to how it \nwould work if this restriction was lifted and Medicare could genuinely \nact to hold down the cost of medicine.\n  So let's start with the example of a new drug coming out on the \nmarket for cancer, and it is an expensive drug. Let's say this drug \nthat many seniors will need will cost $100,000. At present, each of the \nplans that offers the prescription drug benefit has to negotiate for \nthe few people in each of those plans who might need the new drug.\n  If the legislation Senator Snowe and I have been advocating became \nlaw, the Secretary could negotiate on behalf of all the people in the \nMedicare private plans who need the drug. That way, there would be new \nleverage for older people in the private marketplace to hold down the \ncost of medicine. If you had a small number of people in a private \nplan, say, in Tennessee, and a small number of people in a private plan \nin Oregon, and a small number of people in a private plan in Iowa, the \nSecretary could negotiate on behalf of all of those people in \nMedicare's private plans. That could mean real savings to folks in \nTennessee and folks in Oregon and folks elsewhere who right now do not \nhave a lot of leverage in the private marketplace.\n  Now, think about the implications of this proposal. Nobody is talking \nabout price controls. Nobody is talking about a one-size-fits-all run-\nfrom-Washington, DC, approach that would freeze innovation.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Tennessee has been particularly \ninterested, as I have, in taking approaches that promote innovation in \nthe science and biomedical fields. What I have just described, which is \nsomething that could be done under the approach Senator Snowe and I \nhave been advocating, will not freeze research, will not freeze \ninnovation, but will make darn sure the senior citizens of this country \nand the taxpayers of this country have a new opportunity to hold down \nthe cost of medicine and also protect the wallets of our taxpayers.\n  Let me give another example of how this approach can contain the \ncosts of medicine. Let's say we have an older person in Portland, OR, \nor Miami or New York. They are in a metropolitan area, and in the \nmetropolitan area they may have a choice of major plans because a lot \nof folks are vying to get a part of the ``big city'' market with a lot \nof older people. So let's say one of the seniors is in an HMO, a health \nmaintenance organization, or they are in something called a PPO, a \npreferred provider organization, or maybe they are in a drug-only \nprivate plan. All of those private entities may be looking for ways to \nhold down the costs, but if one of those private plans does not get the \nsame deal the other big private buyers get, then one of those plans can \nask Medicare to step in at that point. In effect, one of those private \nplans that is not getting a fair shake in the marketplace can say to \nMedicare: Hey, look, we are not getting a very good deal when it comes \nto negotiating for our seniors. At that point, Medicare could step in \nand say: We are going to assist in that kind of bargaining process.\n  I happen to think just the fact Medicare is in a position to have \nthat leverage--if the private marketplace is not willing to bargain \nseriously, is not willing to negotiate seriously--just the fact there \nwould be that kind of leverage for Medicare can help to be a force to \ncontain the cost of medicine for older people.\n  So here again I have cited an example of how you can hold down the \ncost of medicine without price controls, without national formularies \nand approaches that could constrain innovation, just by using plain old \ncommon sense and bargaining power, the way every business does in North \nCarolina, Tennessee, and across the country.\n  Now, finally, it seems to me we ought to be thinking about the fact \nthat with many older people, they will have a private retirement \npackage as well. So a lot of those seniors are concerned about their \noverall health care bill, knowing they are going to get some help from \nMedicare and some help from a private health package as well. But if \nyou hold down the costs of the Medicare plan, then you are going to \nhave more money in the pockets of older people as they try to cope with \ntheir extra out-of-pocket costs.\n  So when the Medicare plans save seniors money on medicine, that is \nsimply less cost the retiree plan has to make up. Seniors are going to \nbe looking at their overall bill, and they want to know that every step \npossible is being taken to hold down their Medicare expenses, as \nSenator Snowe and I have been advocating for the last 3 years, because \nif that is done, there is simply less cost for the retiree plan to make \nup.\n  Containing the costs on the Medicare side has the potential to help \nkeep costs down for employers insuring their retirees. So if you do \nthat, you are also going to provide some relief to the taxpayers of \nthis country because included in the original Medicare bill are a lot \nof subsidies designed to help employers keep insuring their retirees so \na lot of older people do not just get pushed back entirely into \nMedicare when their employers ought to be helping them. By containing \ndrug costs through Medicare and containing some of the costs for those \nemployers, then the need for taxpayer dollars to shore up those \nemployer plans goes down.\n  What is the bottom line? We are going to be able to help seniors not \nthrough a Government cost-containment approach but by empowering those \nwho are supposed to advocate for them in the private marketplace. That \nis what 54 Members of the U.S. Senate have voted for. It is a \ncomprehensive, market-based, cost-containment approach. It will help \nolder people in the marketplace if they are part of a small plan. And \nthe Secretary is in a position to negotiate on behalf of all of those \nin those small plans, say, for an expensive cancer drug. It could help \nthe older person in a big city where some plans are getting a good deal \nbut one senior is not. At that point, the senior wants somebody to make \nsure there is some extra clout in the marketplace.\n  Finally, I think what Senator Snowe and I have been advocating over \nthese last 3 years will help employers and taxpayers as well. If you \nhold down the costs on the Medicare side, that is going to mean the \nemployers--the employers--of this country are not going to have to come \nup with as much\n\n[[Page S10861]]\n\nmoney on their side to protect their retirees. Containing costs on the \nMedicare side clearly has the potential to keep costs down for \nemployers insuring their retirees.\n  So now, as the Senate begins to schedule for early next year and \nSenators look at the variety of issues that are coming up, I hope they \nwill look in particular at this concept which has won the support of 93 \npercent of the American people. I think most Americans just scratch \ntheir heads and say: How in the world could the Government say the only \npeople in the United States--the only people in the United States--who \nwill not bargain to hold down the costs of medicine are those running \nMedicare?\n  If you are in North Carolina and you are in the technology sector or \nyou are in Oregon in the natural resources sector, the first thing you \ntry to do is use your bargaining power and get the most for your \ndollar. You act as a smart shopper. And people have been flabbergasted \nthat Medicare is the only ``person'' out there shopping without using \nevery bit of clout that would be available to older people in the \nmarketplace.\n  That is why this evening I wanted to take a few minutes to outline \nspecifically how the changes Senator Snowe and I have been advocating \nfor the last few years would work. They are common sense. They use the \nmarketplace to protect the wallets of senior citizens and our \ntaxpayers. I am particularly pleased Senator Reid has indicated this \nwould be a high priority. Fifty-four Members of the U.S. Senate have \nalready voted for it. I hope next year--as people begin to understand, \nwith the examples I have given tonight and others, how this would \nwork--my hope is early next year a significant step will be taken \nfinally to hold down the costs of the medicines that are essential for \nthis country's older population.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr).

Mr. President, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was \nestablished on January 19, 1975, to regulate the Nation's civilian \nnuclear power industry. Since then, 25 men and three women have served \nas members of that commission. Members are appointed by the President \nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate for 5-year terms. On \nNovember 3, Commissioner Ed McGaffigan, Jr. became the longest serving \nmember of the NRC. Of the 28 men and women who have served as \ncommissioners since 1975, only 6 have been reappointed to a second \nterm. Only one, Ed McGaffigan, has been reappointed to a third term. \nFirst appointed by President Clinton in 1996, Ed was reappointed to a \nsecond term in 2000, and reappointed by President Bush to a third term \nin 2005.\n  The Senate rarely confirms NRC nominations before the date set by law \nfor the term to begin, so none of the six commissioners who have served \n2-year terms have served a full 10 years. Until this month, the longest \nserving NRC commissioner was Kenneth Rogers, who served a week short of \n9 years and 11 months. On November 3 of this year, Ed McGaffigan broke \nthat record.\n  Length of time in office, of course, is not an end in itself. How \nlong a commissioner serves is not as important as how well he or she \nserves the public interest while on the commission. By this measure, \ntoo, Ed McGaffigan stands out.\n  Congress created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission not to promote \nnuclear power but to regulate nuclear power. The commission's job, in \nthe words of the Atomic Energy Act, is to ``promote the common defense \nand security and to protect the health and safety of the public.'' Ed \nhas taken those words to heart.\n  Throughout his time on the commission, Ed has worked to improve the \nefficiency and the effectiveness of the NRC's regulatory programs. He \nhas been instrumental in improving the reactor oversight process, \nfocusing it more directly on risks and on activities important to plant \nsafety and, at the same time, making it more transparent and open to \nthe public. Following 9/11, he helped revamp the NRC's security and \nemergency preparedness programs to strengthen the Nation's nuclear \nfacilities against the possibility of a terrorist attack. He has helped \nlay the groundwork for licensing the next generation of nuclear \npowerplants, new uranium enrichment plants, and the nuclear waste \ndepository. He has also taken an active role in managing the generation \nchange confronting the NRC by helping to hire and train a new \ngeneration of nuclear regulators to replace the current generation \nwhich is now retiring. He is a firm but fair regulator and an effective \nnuclear safety watchdog.\n  I take special interest in Ed's achievements on the commission \nbecause Ed was one of the first people I hired when I came to the \nSenate in 1983. He was a legislative assistant. Later he was my \nlegislative director and, finally, my senior policy adviser. He was my \nright hand on defense and technology policy, on personnel and \nacquisition reform, on nuclear nonproliferation and export control \npolicy, all of that until he joined the NRC in 1996.\n  Ed had already established himself as a brilliant physicist and a \ndedicated public servant before I hired him. He had earned degrees in \nphysics from both Harvard and Cal Tech and in public policy from \nHarvard's Kennedy School of Government. He had served in the Foreign \nService. He had been a science attache at our embassy in Moscow. He \nheld simultaneous senior posts on both the staff of the National \nSecurity Council and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. He \nwas, in short, an established expert on science and technology and \nenergy and defense issues when he joined my staff. As a newly elected \nSenator, I was indeed fortunate to have his counsel at the start of my \nwork here in the Senate. He is an invaluable ally, a tenacious \nadversary, and a fine human being. I am honored to have his friendship.\n  It comes as no surprise to me that Ed has served the commission as \nlong or as ably as he has. He has devoted his career to public service. \nHe has served us well with his scientific skill, his expert knowledge, \nand his sound judgment.\n  At his third confirmation hearing before the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works last year, Ed spoke movingly of his Irish immigrant \nfather. He had encouraged Ed to ``dream big dreams'' and taught him, by \nacting on those dreams, to make them possible. In a lifetime of public \nservice, Ed has dreamed big dreams and the Nation is better for it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is a great privilege for \nthis Senator from Florida to continue public service as a result of the \nwill expressed in last Tuesday's election by the people of my State of \nFlorida. It is a great privilege for a lifetime of public service. It \nis especially a great privilege serving in this body at this time in \nour Nation's history, with the challenges that are facing us.\n  I believe there are many messages that have come from the American \npeople in this election that we have just experienced. Clearly, the \nissue of Iraq and the policy of the United States Government toward \nIraq is one. That was discussed during the election all over this \ncountry, and it was particularly discussed as two of the main items of \ninterest in the two televised debates that we had in the Senate \nelection in Florida.\n  The other message coming out of this election, in addition to Iraq, \nis that the American people are tired of the partisan bickering. They \nhave seen excessive partisanship operative in Washington. When they see \nthat excessive partisanship overlaid with ideological\n\n[[Page S10862]]\n\nrigidity, the result is gridlock. That is what we have had, in large \npart. People would like for their public servants to perform by \nreaching out to each other across the aisle and bringing people \ntogether in order to build that consensus in order to govern. That has \nnot been the main theme in the American Government in the last several \nyears.\n  I hope that both the House of Representatives and the Senate are \ngetting that message loudly and clearly from the American people. I can \ntell you, Mr. President, I know what Floridians are thinking. It is my \nbusiness to know that. Interestingly, also, Florida is a microcosm of \nthe Nation. People are tired of this bickering. Folks do not want a \nRepublican or a Democratic solution; they want the right solution. If \nyou do what is right, you can get a lot done. That is what the American \npeople want.\n  Certainly, a thorny problem, such as how to bring about stability in \nIraq, is going to require a bipartisan solution. It is going to take a \ngreat deal of cooperation between the legislative branch, the Congress, \nand the executive branch, the President. The statements that we have \nheard by the new majority leaders of both the House and the Senate, as \nwell as the statements made by the President, are certainly statements \nin the right direction. Now we will see if those statements can, in \nfact, become a reality in deeds and accomplishments.\n  This Senator is dedicated to reaching out and building that consensus \nacross the aisle, when you look at the enormous challenges that are \nfacing this country in addition to Iraq--the whole war on terror, the \ndefense of the homeland, the protection of our seaports; the stability \nof the U.S. budget, the attempt to bring the budget back into balance, \nan approach of pay-as-you-go; attending to the needs of our senior \ncitizens, particularly senior citizens who have been lifted out of so \nmuch poverty as a result of these programs, such as Medicare and Social \nSecurity, and the protection of those programs and the proper financing \nof those programs; the need of the United States to address the needs \nof assisting State and local governments on education; the preparation \nfor the big one that is surely to come in terms of natural disasters \nbecause, surely, we are going to have it--and the two Senators in the \nChamber, both, are coastal Senators. A category 4 or 5 hit directly \nfrom the water on a highly dense urbanized area, and that will cause \neconomic havoc that will be even over and above what we have seen, and \nthe potential of insurance losses in excess of what we experienced in \nthe 2005 and 2004 hurricanes that hit a lot of our Southeastern States.\n  When the economic loss and insurance loss hits $50 billion, there is \nno one State, no one insurance company that can withstand that kind of \nloss. That is another challenge facing us. Then there is the \nstraightening up of FEMA and its ability to respond, and respond \nquickly, which I have great hopes under Administrator of FEMA Paulison \nthat we are much better prepared than we were in the 2004 and 2005 \nhurricane cycles.\n  As we go down the list of the challenges that are facing this \ncountry--and there are many that I have not named--these cannot be \nsolved as a Democratic or as a Republican solution; they have to be \nsolved with the right solution; otherwise, you will never get \nconsensus, particularly in the Senate. So this is my profound hope, and \nI want to express it to the Senate on this first day after the Tuesday \nelection of November 7.\n  The message has been clear: Stop the partisan bickering.

ROBERT LIPSON\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, simultaneous with my remarks tonight at \nKennesaw University Convocation Center in Cobb County, GA, there is a \nmemorial service where thousands of my fellow citizens are paying \ntribute to the life, the times, and the contributions of Dr. Robert \nLipson. On Saturday night, Dr. Lipson, leaving Kennestone Hospital, was \nkilled in a tragic automobile accident with a motorcycle just two or \nthree blocks from the health care facility to which he had dedicated \nthe majority of his life.\n  Dr. Lipson was just not any ordinary doctor; he was an extraordinary \nhuman being. Dr. Lipson was president and CEO of WellStar Health \nSystems, the owner and operator of five hospitals in metropolitan \nAtlanta, in Cobb, Douglas, and Paulding Counties, the employer of \nhundreds of doctors and thousands of caregivers, and one of the true \nleaders in modern health care today in our State.\n  Dr. Lipson, in his time at Kennestone Hospital, did a $68 million \ncapital improvement with an 84-bed residential tower. He brought an \nopen-heart surgical unit to Kennestone Hospital, and at the time of his \ntragic loss, Dr. Lipson's emergency room at Kennestone Hospital was the \nsecond largest emergency room in the State of Georgia and one of the \nlargest in the United States, serving victims of tragic trauma \nthroughout the metropolitan area.\n  But it wasn't only his leadership as the head of WellStar Health \nSystems. For 25 years prior to his appointment, he had a practice in \ninternal medicine in our community. He was a leader in his synagogue, \nEtz Chaim, and brought to that leadership tremendous involvement in our \ncommunity. He was a gifted photographer. In fact, only 8 weeks ago--8 \nweeks before his death--his photography was displayed at Kennesaw \nUniversity for all to see because of his great insight, his great \ntalent, his credibility, and the way he had captured not only our \ncommunity but all the special places in the world he visited.\n  So tonight on the floor of the Senate, on behalf of myself and \nthousands and thousands of citizens in my State, I extend to his wife, \nhis mother, his son, and his daughter our sympathy in this tragic loss \nbut also our pride and joy in the great contributions of Dr. Robert \nLipson to the betterment of the health of countless thousands of \ncitizens and the betterment and the health of our community.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10862-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10862-S10865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Corporal Lance M. Thompson\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Upland, \nIN. Cpl Lance M. Thompson, 21 years old, died on November 15th. Lance \nwas killed by an improvised explosive devise while conducting combat \noperations in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq. With his entire life \nbefore him, Lance risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A 2001 graduate of Eastbrook High School, Lance followed in his \nbrother Phillip's footsteps by joining the Marines. His father, \nGregory, told the Kokomo Tribune that his son had been a committed \nmember of the Armed Forces and believed in what the Marines were doing \nin Iraq. Reflecting on Lance's life, his half-brother, Matt, told the \nMarion Chronicle-Tribune that his ``motto'' had been ``gung-ho.'' This \nselfless dedication carried Lance through his first tour of duty in \nIraq and led him back again for a second tour, which began in September \nof this year.\n  Lance was the 38th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the Weapons \nCompany, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine, 1st Marine Division, Camp \nPendleton, CA. This brave young soldier leaves behind his wife Dawn, \nhis father Gregory, his mother Melanie, his brother, Phillip; and his \nhalf-brothers, Matt and Alexander.\n\n[[Page S10863]]\n\n  Today, I join Lance's family, his friends, and the entire Upland \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nLance, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  Lance was known for his dedication to family and his love of country. \nAccording to friends and loved ones, he also enjoyed spending time \noutdoors, being with children and animals, and was always making jokes. \nToday and always, Lance will be remembered by family members, friends, \nand fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice \nhe made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Lance's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Lance's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Lance M. Thompson in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate \npain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nLance's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Lance.\n\n\n                       Lance Corporal James Brown\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Owensville. James \nBrown, 20 years old, died on November 2 after being struck by a sniper \nbullet while on patrol in Al Anbar Province west of Baghdad. James \nrisked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Inspired by the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, James joined the \nMarines after graduating from Gibson Southern High School in 2005 and \nwas deployed to Iraq in June. He planned to marry his high school \nsweetheart, Jamie Coleman, when he returned home in a few months. \nFamily friend Kenny Dewig said James had been a leader in the Marines \njust as he had been a leader with his Titans high school football team, \n``He was just in charge of the whole squad on patrols. He was just a \nreally good boy.''\n  Jonathan was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd \nMarine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, NC. This \nbrave soldier leaves behind father James Ling of Evansville, mother \nJoanne Van Antwerp of Owensville, sister Carma Dart, and brother Dillen \nFriend.\n  Today, I join James's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of James, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  James was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. He was looking forward to his wedding and starting a life with \nJamie. Today and always, James will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring James's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.

Brock \nBabb, 40 years old, died on October 15 after a roadside bombing in Al \nAnbar Province, Iraq. Brock risked everything to fight for the values \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Brock enlisted in the Marines after graduating from Reitz High School \nin 1984. He served in the first gulf war and then returned home to \nbecome a sheet metal worker and raise his family. In 2004, Brock \ndecided to reenlist, feeling that he had unfinished business in Iraq. \nBrock was remembered by his mother Susie as a dedicated and caring \nAmerican happy to carry out his duty, when she said that he wanted to \nhelp young marines survive.\n  Brock was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to Marine Forces Reserve's 3rd Battalion, 24th \nMarines, 4th Marine Division. This brave soldier leaves behind wife \nBarbara Babb; parents Susie and Terry Babb; and children Tanner, Zoie, \nand Levi Babb.\n  Today, I join Brock's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Brock, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Brock was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. He had only been in Iraq for 2 weeks at the time of the attack \nand was looking forward to helping his fellow marines. Brock's \ndedication and sense of duty made him a model marine and a true leader \nfor the others serving with him. Today and always, Brock will be \nremembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Brock's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.

Kraig \nFoyteck, 26 years old, died on October 30 after being hit by small arms \nfire during a raid on a house near Baghdad. Kraig risked everything to \nfight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land \nhalfway around the world.\n  Kraig enlisted in the military at 23 in search of adventure. He had a \npassion for gymnastics and enjoyed parachuting. Kraig's mother spoke of \nhis deep sense of patriotism and commitment to his country, telling a \nlocal news outlet that the night before he left for his tour she sensed \nsecond thoughts, but her son wanted to honor his commitement. In August \n2005, Kraig was sent to Mosul in northern Iraq, where his mother said \nhe patrolled with his Stryker unit and handed out candy and toys to \nIraqi children. Kraig was supposed to have finished his tour in August, \nbut the day before leaving Iraq, he was told he would be sent to \nBaghdad for a few months. He was due to return in January. He had hoped \nto reenroll in college after being discharged from the Army and planned \nto study medicine.\n  Kraig was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to A Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry \nRegiment, 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, Fort Wainwright, AK. This \nbrave soldier leaves behind his mother, Connie Foyteck of LaPorte; \nfather Rik Gutzke of Oregon; a brother, Christopher; and grandparents \nVirginia and Jack Foyteck.\n  Today, I join Kraig's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Kraig, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Kraig was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. The Army awarded him a Purple Heart in December after he broke \nfour bones in his back, but Kraig insisted that he return to his unit. \nToday and always, Kraig will be remembered by family members, friends, \nand fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice \nhe made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Kraig's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.

Frigo\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Kokomo, IN. \nNathan J. Frigo, 23 years old, died on October 17 in Baqubah, Iraq. \nNathan risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close \nto our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Nathan enlisted in the Army after graduating from Northwestern High \nSchool in 2001. He is remembered as an active student and athletic \nleader, having lettered in both track and cross country. Nathan chose \nthe position of infantryman and volunteered to serve a 4-year tour of \nduty. Nathan's father spoke of his deep sense of patriotism and \ncommitment to his country, saying, ``He knew the risks, but he wanted \nto go where he was needed. He wanted to help, and he wanted to make a \ndifference with his life.''\n  Nathan was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st \nBattalion, 68th Armor Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, CO. \nThis brave soldier leaves behind parents Maureen and Fred Frigo and \nsisters Sarah and Beth.\n  Today, I join Nathan's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Nathan, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of grief.\n  Nathan was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry, having aspired since he was a child to become a member of the \nmilitary. The Army announced that he has been elevated to specialist \nand awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Today and always, Nathan \nwill be remembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a \ntrue American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to justly honor the Frigo family's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's condolences to the mother of two \nfallen soldiers: ``I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the \nanguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of \nthe loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours, to have \nlaid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom.'' These words of \ncomfort withstand the tests of time and circumstance, and remind us all \nthat the impact of Nathan's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of them.\n  It is my sad duty--and great honor--to enter the name of Nathan Frigo \nin the official Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to his \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and \npeace. When I think about the terrible pain that comes with the loss of \nour heroes, I hope that families like Nathan's can find comfort in the \nwords of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in \nvictory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Nathan.\n\n\n                   Sergeant 1st Class Scott E. Nisely\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to SFC Scott \nE. Nisely, who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving his country. \nSergeant Nisely, of Marshalltown, IA, was assigned to C Company, 1st \nBattalion, 133rd Infantry Regiment, 34th Infantry Division, Army \nNational Guard, based out of Iowa Falls, IA. He was mobilized for \nOperation Iraqi Freedom with the unit in September 2005 and arrived in \nIraq in early May 2006. He died at the age of 48, on September 30, \n2006, in Al Asad, Iraq, when his military vehicle encountered small \narms fire.\n  Staff Sergeant Nisely will be posthumously awarded the Bronze Star \nfor the second time, the Purple Heart, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the \nArmy Good Conduct Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with \nMobilization device for the second time, and the Combat Infantryman \nBadge.\n  My thoughts and prayers have been with Scott's wife Geri and his \nchildren, Justin and Sarah, as well as all those other family and \nfriends who are grieving his loss. Scott's family said, ``Scott was a \ndedicated and loving husband and father. He was actively involved in \nhis children's lives. He was a loyal, compassionate, and caring friend \nthat everyone liked. He loved and was committed to God, and was very \ninvolved with his church and community.''\n  Learning about the sacrifice of Scott Nisely, I am reminded of the \nwords of\n\n[[Page S10865]]\n\nJohn 15:13: ``Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his \nlife for his friends.''\n  His family also said of Scott that he ``loved his country and was a \nvolunteer career service-member that was proud and honored to serve his \ncountry.'' Our Nation will be forever grateful for Scott Nisely's loyal \nservice and sacrifice. His loss is tragic, but he will be remembered as \nan American hero.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof U.S. Army National Guard SFC Scott Nisely of Nebraska. Sergeant \nNisely died during a firefight with insurgents near Asad, Iraq, on \nSeptember 30. He was 48 years old.\n  Sergeant Nisely was born in Syracuse, NE. After high school, he \nattended Doane College in Crete, NE, where he competed in track and \ncross country. He would later settle in Marshalltown, IA, with his wife \nGeri. In addition to his service in the Armed Forces, Sergeant Nisely \nalso worked for the U.S. Postal Service in Iowa for 12 years.\n  While at Doane, Sergeant Nisely enlisted with the Marine Corps \nReserve and served 22 years with the Marines on active duty and as a \nreservist. He was a veteran of Operation Desert Storm. In July, 2002, \nSergeant Nisely accepted a demotion in rank to fill a vacancy in the \nIowa Army National Guard and served in that capacity until his death.\n  Sergeant Nisely will be remembered for his strong faith and his \ndesire to serve his country. In honor of Sergeant Nisely, Doane College \nwill rename an annual track and field event the Scott Nisely Memorial \nTrack Classic.\n  In addition to his wife, Sergeant Nisely is survived by his son \nJustin and his daughter Sarah.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SFC \nScott Nisely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10865-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A MALL MEMORIAL FOR DR. KING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this morning, our Nation took an important \nstep toward honoring one of our most preeminent leaders. The National \nMall in Washington, DC, is graced with memorials to America's greatest \npresidents. Today we broke ground on a memorial to honor the Reverend \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although never elected to national office, \nDr. King courageously led the Nation through a crucial chapter of \nAmerican history and became the voice of the entire civil rights \nmovement.\n  In his famous ``I Have A Dream'' speech on the National Mall, Dr. \nKing noted that ``[w]hen the architects of our republic wrote the \nmagnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of \nIndependence, they were signing a promissory note to which every \nAmerican was to fall heir.''\n  This past summer we reaffirmed and reauthorized one of the most \nimportant methods of enforcing this promise and upholding the \nConstitution--the Voting Rights Act. Over the course of dozens of \nJudiciary Committee hearings and markups, we recalled the great \nhistoric struggle for civil rights led by American heroes of vision and \nstrength, including Martin Luther King, Jr., and his widow, Coretta \nScott King.\n  The pervasive discriminatory tactics that led to the original Voting \nRights Act were deeply rooted. As a Nation, this effort to ensure equal \nprotection dates back more than 135 years to the ratification of the \n15th amendment in 1870, the last of the post-Civil War Reconstruction \namendments. It took the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for \npeople of all races in many parts of our country to effectively begin \nexercising the rights granted 95 years earlier by the 15th amendment. \nDespite the additional gains we have made in enabling racial minorities \nto participate fully in the political life of our country, the work of \nthe Voting Rights Act is not yet complete, and the dream of Dr. King \nhas not yet been fully realized. But his dream lives on, as vital and \nas inspirational as the day it was delivered.\n  Just last week, we had an historic national election. Men and women \nof every color and creed came to polling places around the country to \nhave their voices heard. Nonetheless, some citizens experienced \nproblems casting their votes. The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold \na long-overdue oversight hearing this week to examine shortcomings in \nthe enforcement of our civil rights laws and the guarantees of \npolitical equality enshrined in the 14th and 15th amendments. In doing \nso, we continue to honor the promissory note written to all Americans.\n  I look forward to bringing my children and grandchildren to the \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Memorial when it is completed in 2008. I trust \nit will be a moving tribute befitting one of our Nation's greatest \nleaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10865-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10865-S10866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL HERITAGE AREAS ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate final passage of \nthe National Heritage Areas of 2006. I am grateful that Congress \nfinally has recognized the Upper Housatonic Valley in Connecticut and \nMassachusetts for its special contribution to the American experience. \nThis new law designates the Upper Housatonic Valley as a National \nHeritage Area and authorizes $10 million to preserve its historic and \ncultural assets.\n  Today's victory has been a long time in coming. In 2000, I sponsored \nlegislation directing the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study \nof the feasibility of establishing the Upper Housatonic Valley as a \nNational Heritage Area. After the Interior Department completed that \nreport, Senator Dodd and I in 2003 introduced the first bill to create \nthe Upper Housatonic National Heritage Area. Last Congress, a bill that \nwould have created that area and a dozen others passed the Senate but \ndied in the House. In this Congress, we reintroduced the Senate bill, \nand Representative Nancy Johnson reintroduced its House companion. \nFinally, after 6 years of hard work, I can stand announce that \nlegislation to create the Upper Housatonic National Heritage Area has \npassed the Senate and the House. The act now goes to the President, who \nis expected to sign it into law without delay.\n  The Upper Housatonic Valley's history is this Nation's history in \nmicrocosm--spanning Native American civilization, European settlement, \nthe industrial revolution, and the present day. In contrast to many \nother areas of the country, the Upper Housatonic Valley's early \nhistorical and natural landscape remains largely intact. What is more, \nthe area presents excellent opportunities for outdoor recreation, on \nwaterways and greenways or trails, and a wide range of other activities \nfor visitors or residents. For example, the section of the river below \nFalls Village, Connecticut is one of the Northeast's most prized fly-\nfishing centers.\n  This unique 950-square-mile region encompasses 29 towns in the \nHousatonic River watershed, extending 60 miles from Lanesboro, MA, to \nKent, CT. The valley brims with more than 100 historically important \nsites--some dating back to pre-Revolutionary times--including five \nNational Historic Landmarks and four National Natural Landmarks.\n  The Iron Heritage Trail celebrates the valley's distinctive role in \niron production. During the Revolutionary War, cannons and rifles were \nforged for Gen. George Washington's Army from abundant local iron ore, \nand iron used in the USS Constitution also came from this area. More \nthan 40 iron blast furnaces in the region fueled the Industrial \nRevolution.\n  Within Upper Housatonic Valley, the African-American Heritage Trail \ncelebrates the region's significant contributions to our Nation's \nAfrican-American history, including the abolitionist and civil rights \nmovements. For example, the valley was home to Elizabeth ``Mumbet'' \nFreeman, a pioneer in the fight against slavery, W.E.B. Du Bois, a \nfather of the modern civil rights movement, NAACP leader Mary White \nOvington, and Frank Grant of the Negro Baseball League.\n  The valley has produced writers, painters, sculptors, photographers, \nand musicians, among them Herman Melville, Edith Wharton, Norman \nRockwell, Daniel Chester French, James VanDerZee, and James Weldon \nJohnson. These artists have left the Nation a rich cultural \ninheritance. Today, the region remains a vibrant center for ongoing \nliterary, artistic, musical, and architectural achievements.\n  Coordinated efforts to preserve the natural and cultural resources of \nthis region are already well underway. The designation of the Upper \nHousatonic\n\n[[Page S10866]]\n\nValley National Heritage Area supports and enhances these local efforts \nto interpret, preserve, and showcase the diverse historic, cultural, \nand natural resources of the valley.\n  In closing, I would like to congratulate the many dedicated advocates \nin Connecticut, whose dogged efforts led to today's achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10866-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LONG ISLAND SOUND STEWARDSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate final passage of \nthe Long Island Sound Stewardship Act. I am proud to have coauthored \nand introduced this bill in the Senate in April 2004. This body passed \nthe bill that October, but then the bill died in the House. So we \nreintroduced it in the Senate last January, and Representative Rob \nSimmons reintroduced its House companion. The House passed its bill on \nWednesday, and we in the Senate have just followed suit. Now the bill \nwill go to the President, who is expected to sign it into law without \ndelay. Today's final passage will ensure expanded protection and \nrestoration of a national treasure.\n  A healthy Long Island Sound is crucial to our region's economy, \nquality of life, and heritage. I am deeply gratified that Congress has \nacted to support a new way for communities and citizens to work \ntogether to preserve this ecologically important estuary for years to \ncome. The Long Island Sound Stewardship Act, or LISSA, will help \nprotect the sound by providing financial incentives for land owners \nwithin the sound area to preserve the environmental quality of and \npublic access to this endangered habitat.\n  Long Island Sound is a unique estuary with profound economic, \necological and cultural importance for the United States. This critical \nresource contributes approximately $6 billion annually to the economy \nof the region, and it is especially important to the tens of millions \nof people who live within 50 miles of its shores.\n  We have come a long way in restoring the Sound and its rich \nbiodiversity. Take, for example, the osprey--a bird that has come to \nsymbolize the Sound. In 1940, there were approximately 1,000 osprey \nnests along the Sound shoreline. But by 1974, pollution reduced the \nnumber of osprey nests to just nine. Because of proactive conservation \nmeasures, the osprey has rebounded. That is real progress.\n  Despite our efforts, however, the sound remains in a diminished \ncondition. It suffers from hypoxia, habitat loss, and contamination by \ntoxic substances, pathogens, and solid waste, all of which negatively \naffect the health of all the organisms, including humans, who live in \nor near the sound.\n  I have been working to defend the sound since I arrived in the \nSenate. In 1989, I sponsored legislation that established a Long Island \nSound office within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EPA's \nLong Island Sound Office went on to identify the sound region as \nvulnerable to degradation and, with my support, established the Long \nIsland Sound Study to develop a plan for protecting the sound. In 2000, \nI kicked off a ``Listen to the Sound'' campaign, which focused on \nestablishing a comprehensive network of open space and natural areas \nalong the sound's rim, as well as creating more opportunities for \npublic access and habitat restoration. More than 1,500 Connecticut and \nNew York residents attended those meetings. In 2002, the EPA released \nthe results of its Long Island Sound study, which concluded that \ncoordinated action to save the sound was necessary.\n  Building on several of the EPA study's recommendations and on \nfeedback from my Listen to the Sound meetings, I introduced LISSA in \nApril 2004 with Senators Dodd, Schumer, and Clinton as cosponsors.\n  LISSA establishes a broad-based Long Island Sound Stewardship \nAdvisory Committee comprised of all sound stakeholders, including \nFederal, State, local governments, tribal interests, nongovernmental \norganizations, academic interests, private interests including land, \nagriculture, and business interests, and recreational and commercial \nfishing interests. The advisory committee is charged with evaluating \nthe parcels of land within the sound region and recommending crucial \nparcels for designation by the Environmental Protection Agency as \nStewardship Sites eligible for special preservation funds. LISSA \nauthorizes $25 million per year for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 to \nthe EPA Administrator to carry out this act.\n  By enacting this legislation, we aim to preserve the natural beauty \nand ecological wonder of this majestic waterway between New York and \nConnecticut. LISSA will ensure that our children and grandchildren can \nenjoy the sound's beauty, ecology, and recreational opportunities.\n  In closing, I wish to acknowledge the many Long Island Sound \nadvocates in Connecticut and New York who have worked so hard to \nachieve today's great success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10866-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALTHIA HARRIS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a longtime \nmember of my staff, Ms. Althia Harris, who has served over 30 years in \nthe Senate. Ms. Harris has reached an incredible benchmark in her \ncareer, and I stand today to reflect on her service.\n  Ms. Harris began working in the Senate on April 30, 1975, for \ndistinguished Senator Philip A. Hart of Missouri. Just a few days \nbefore the end of his term, Senator Hart lost his battle with cancer on \nDecember 26, 1976. Ms. Harris then served Senator Adlai E. Stevenson \nIII of Illinois for 5 years. Upon Senator Stevenson's retirement, she \njoined the office of his successor, Senator Alan J. Dixon. I was then \nlucky enough to inherit a most loyal and experienced Senate employee \nwhen Ms. Harris joined my staff in 1984.\n  Upon joining my team, Althia initially helped with my transition from \nthe West Virginia Governor's office to Capitol Hill. An immeasurable \nand invaluable aide, I am sure without Althia's able assistance the job \nwould have taken much longer to accomplish. I know it would have been \nmore difficult without a seasoned Senate staffer knowledgeable in how \nto really make things work in the Senate.\n  On September 12, 1986, Althia began working part time in my office so \nshe could take on new challenges in the private sector and other areas \nof government. She first worked for the Advertising Council and then \nfor the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA. At NASA, \nshe continues to work as a contractor for the Office of Education. As \nan active member of her community, she has never abandoned her work \nhere in the Senate.\n  With continual service in my office for over 20 years, Althia is \nsomeone who has helped keep my office operation running with important \nday-to-day tasks. She is a lover of urban gardening, a collector of \nAfrican art, and a domestic and international traveler.\n  As Senators, we are each here to represent our respective States and \nto work on the needs of our constituents. But the work we do is \ndirectly dependent on those who support us--our staff who are always \nthere, always pushing behind the scenes. Each and every devoted member \nof my staff helps me accomplish the job I am here to do, and Althia has \nmade a real contribution to my work for over 20 years.\n  I am honored to recognize Althia's devotion and service and to extend \nmy deepest appreciation for her ongoing contributions. Althia is a true \ngem--the kind of person you are lucky to find and retain for what time \nthey can give. It has been a wonderful 20 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10866-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10866-S10868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in honor of the seventh annual \nInternational Education Week, November 13 to 17, 2006, I would like to \ntalk about the importance that international education and exchange \nprograms play in establishing closer relations between the United \nStates and the world.\n  The U.S. Government has a proud tradition of supporting international \neducation and exchange programs, and we must continue that tradition. \nWhy? First of all, international education is necessary for our \nchildren to remain competitive in the increasingly global economy. \nSecond, exchange programs also attract future leaders from abroad, \nexposing them to the opportunities and freedoms afforded by our \ndemocratic system. Third, international education and exchange programs \nexpand horizons and change the\n\n[[Page S10867]]\n\nlives of the participants for the better. Finally, international \neducation builds bridges between communities and improves understanding \nof cultures different from our own--something that has perhaps never \nbeen as important as it is today.\n  International Education Week will be observed in all 50 States and in \nover 100 countries. I encourage my colleagues to take a moment during \nInternational Education Week to acknowledge the work the citizens of \ntheir States are doing to ensure the successful future of the United \nStates through the promotion of international education.\n  In Wisconsin, schools such as Fox Valley Technical College in \nAppleton, Northcentral Technical College in Wausau, and the University \nof Wisconsin system, to name a few, will hold events recognizing the \nimportance of international education in higher education. Community \norganizations will be recognizing the week as well; the International \nInstitute of Wisconsin will be hosting a Community Summit on Citizen \nDiplomacy to discuss the important role citizen diplomacy--including \ninternational education--plays in today's world. I am proud that these \nand many other Wisconsin institutions and organizations are working to \nrecognize the important role of international education and exchanges.\n  I am a strong supporter of international education and exchange \nprogramming. On April 12, 2005, I introduced S. Res. 104, the ``People-\nto-People Engagement in World Affairs'' resolution. My resolution \nrecognized the importance of international programs and exchanges and \ncalled on Americans to strive to become more engaged in international \naffairs and more aware of peoples and developments outside the United \nStates--including studying abroad. I have also cosponsored resolutions \nmaking 2005 the Year of Foreign Language Study and 2006 as the Year of \nStudy Abroad.\n  I would like to take a moment to lay out in more detail the reasons \ninternational education is so important.\n  First and foremost, we need to be preparing our children to compete \nin a global economy. Because the United States is increasingly \nconnected to foreign economies, international education and exchanges \nare critical for the United States workforce to remain competitive--\nespecially to fulfill the increased need for foreign language \nproficiency. We cannot compete globally if we are unable to promote and \nsell our goods and services, and we will hinder ourselves if we do not \nprovide opportunities for American students to learn foreign languages \nor about other cultures and societies.\n  In 2006, a University of Wisconsin--Platteville alum, triple majoring \nin criminal justice, Spanish, and biology, participated on a study-\nabroad program in Merida, Venezuela. During her studies in Merida, she \nwas able to hone her Spanish language skills and take a specialized \ncourse in law. She now works in Wisconsin as a correctional officer and \nis called upon regularly to assist with translation services. This \nstudent--like many others who study abroad--honed her foreign language \nproficiency through her international education experience and is \ndirectly applying the skills she obtained overseas in her employment. \nShe is a greater asset to her employer because she can provide \ntranslation services. International education and exchange programs are \ncrucial components for the United States and must continue to be \nsupported in order to maintain a healthy economy.\n  International education advances the global economic interests of the \nUnited States and has been shown to give students an advantage over \ntheir peers in the United States who have not been exposed to \ninternational experiences. Most students realize this fact. The \nDepartment of State has noted that 88 percent of American college \nstudents believe international education will give them a competitive \nadvantage in the workplace.\n  While international education and exchange programs improve America's \ncompetitiveness globally, they also attract current and future leaders \nfrom other countries to the United States. According to the Department \nof State, more than 565,000 international students from over 200 \ncountries study in the United States each year--some of whom will \nreturn home to become leaders of their countries. The more they know \nabout the United States and the more connections they have with \nAmerican citizens, the better.\n  Emmanuel Sanon of Haiti was a recent participant in the Northcentral \nTechnical College's CASS, Cooperative Association of States for \nScholarships, program. CASS is a USAID funded scholarship program for \nstudents from countries in the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico \nto study at a 2-year college in the United States with hopes of gaining \ntechnical and leadership skills in order to return home to become \nagents for change in their countries.\n  Bonnie Bissonette, director of international education at \nNorthcentral Technical College, wrote me about Emmanuel's experience \nand said:\n\n       Emmanuel studied Electromechanical Technology and \n     Leadership at Northcentral Technical College in Wausau from \n     2003-2005 and returned home to Haiti with high hopes for his \n     future. Since returning home, he has had 5 contractual jobs \n     with the U.N. in Haiti and is looking to start a tech school \n     for the youth of his community. He has already started to \n     provide some computer and English language training. \n     Wisconsin has taken a lead role in educating the economically \n     disadvantaged youth of our close neighbors to the south so \n     that they can improve the standard of living and slow the \n     tide of economic emmigration. Fox Valley Technical College \n     and NTC are two of only 13 community colleges in the United \n     States that host this highly successful program.\n\n  Emmanuel's experience is only one of several success stories I could \nshare about the useful skills exchange students gain while studying in \nthe United States which are later used to improve the lives of others \nin their home countries.\n  Which brings me to my next point--international education and \nexchange programs expand horizons and change lives by exposing the \nparticipants and programmers to new ways of thinking and living. Those \nwho study abroad are forced to live outside of their comfort zones and \nas a result they learn a vast amount about themselves and other \ncultures. They often return home as different people with greater \nawareness and appreciation for others.\n  A University of Wisconsin--Whitewater professor wrote to me recently \nand said:\n\n       For about ten years now, I have been the coordinator of a \n     student exchange between UW--Whitewater and Arnhem Business \n     School in the Netherlands. My students change dramatically \n     during their experience. They even `look' different when they \n     return. At first they are tentative and worried, and by the \n     time they leave, they are truly citizens of the world . . . \n     Working as a coordinator is one of the most rewarding things \n     I do as a professor.\n\n  This example drives home the fact that in Wisconsin, and also across \nthe United States, students who choose to engage in international \neducation and exchange opportunities are truly changed forever.\n  The deeper understanding of other cultures is a two-way street and is \nvital to enhancing the image of the United States abroad and our \nnational security. Citizen-to-citizen exchanges improve perceptions of \nthe United States: a 2006 study published by the Pew Research Center \nfound that ``publics around the world continue to have a more positive \nopinion of the American people than they do of the United States. In \nseven of the 14 foreign countries surveyed, at least half of \nrespondents have a favorable impression of Americans; in contrast, four \ncountries give the U.S. positive marks.''\n  Through their international experiences, exchange participants are \nable to demonstrate American values, listen to different viewpoints, \nand speak about the similarities they share with populations around the \nworld. Increasing international understanding of America will improve \nthe image of the United States--and an improved perception of the \nUnited States will serve to also improve our national security.\n  International education and exchange programs also have great \npotential to create beneficial relationships between communities on \nopposite sides of the world. These relationships can lead to increased \nopportunities for commerce and development for everyone.\n  Let me give you an example. For the first time this year, the \nUniversity of Wisconsin--Green Bay was awarded a Department of State \ngrant to take college students to Jordan to study for 2 weeks. The \nprogram, called Journey to Jordan, gave students the opportunity\n\n[[Page S10868]]\n\nto spend 6 weeks in Jordan learning Arabic, living with host families, \nvolunteering at civil service organizations, and learning firsthand \nabout Jordanian culture. These students returned with exposure to \nanother language and a greater understanding of another culture.\n  Just as important, however, is that the program itself built a bridge \nbetween Jordan and the United States. Earlier this month, the vice \npresident of the University of Jordan, along with members of the North \nAmerican Jordanian Association, NAJA, and the American MidEast \nLeadership Network, traveled to the University of Wisconsin--Green Bay, \nat their own expense, to discuss future partnership opportunities.\n  These individuals chose to travel to the United States because they \nwant to maintain a relationship with the University of Wisconsin--Green \nBay. This is a wonderful connection between universities and countries \nthat I hope will continue to grow.\n  I commend those who work every day to promote international education \nand exchange programs, but we need to work even harder to engage more \nAmericans in international education and exchange programs. To start, \nwe should be following the lead of those who have begun this process. \nThe University of Wisconsin--Oshkosh has a global education certificate \nprogram that educates teachers on how to introduce global perspectives \nin the classroom. Wisconsin's own State superintendent, Elizabeth \nBurmaster, has worked to encourage K-12 schools to introduce students \nto global perspectives in the classroom at an earlier age.\n  But we can do more. I was a strong supporter of the creation of the \nCommission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program, an \nindependent commission created in 2004 for the purpose of recommending \na program to greatly expand the opportunity for students at \ninstitutions of higher education in the United States to study abroad, \nwith special emphasis on studying in developing countries. One of my \ncolleagues--Senator Durbin--has taken the first step in working to \nimplement the commission's published recommendations by introducing the \nAbraham Lincoln Study Abroad Act, S. 3744.\n  The purpose of S. 3744 is to encourage at least 1 million \nundergraduate students in the United States to participate in study \nabroad programs academic credit within 10 years, including students in \ntechnical and scientific fields of study. The program also seeks to \nensure that an increasing portion of study abroad takes place in \nnontraditional destinations, with substantial increases in developing \ncountries.\n  The bill would specifically authorize the Secretary of State to \nestablish an Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Program to facilitate \nundergraduate study abroad for academic credit through the creation of \nundergraduate fellowships and grants to institutions of higher \neducation to reform academic programs and institutional policies that \ninhibit participation by students in study abroad.\n  Senator Durbin's bill--along with other international education and \nexchange legislative initiatives is an important step to one day having \nall American students engaged in some type of international education \nor exchange program, and we need to continue to take the necessary \nsteps to provide our children every opportunity to learn about new \ncultures and to speak a second, or even third, language.\n  As we recognize and celebrate International Education Week, I call on \nall Americans to take a few minutes to learn something new this week \nabout another culture, and I encourage all Americans to recognize and \nsupport international education and exchange throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10868-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               HONORING CLARENCE J. ``MAC'' McCORMICK III\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life of a \ndistinguished businessman, community leader, and friend, Mac McCormick, \nwho passed away on October 26. Mac's dedication to the State of Indiana \nkept him involved in public service throughout his life, and I know \nthat he will be greatly missed.\n  Mac was a good and decent man who dedicated his life to serving \nothers. From his work in economic development to his involvement with \nVincennes University, his career was filled with acts of conscientious \nservice on behalf of friends, family members, and Hoosiers across \nIndiana.\n  Mac comes from a long line of distinguished Hoosier public servants, \nincluding his father, Jim McCormick, and his grandfather, Clarence \nMcCormick. I have had the privilege of knowing the McCormick family for \nmany years and have seen firsthand the difference his efforts have made \nin our State. The contributions Mac made through his leadership and \nphilanthropy touched countless lives, and his dedication and good humor \nmade him a role model for a generation of Hoosiers.\n  In 1981, Mac started Best Way Express, Inc., with four trucks. \nThrough his skillful oversight it grew to the 400-truck operation it is \ntoday. Over the past quarter century, Mac has used that same tireless \ndedication and business savvy to serve the people of Indiana. As a \nboard member of the Indiana Economic Development Corporation and the \nIndiana Chamber of Commerce, he helped ensure a bright future for the \nworking men and women of our State, and his service to Vincennes \nUniversity as a member of the board of trustees and vice president of \nthe nonprofit Jamac Corp. exemplified his spirit of philanthropy.\n  Mac is survived by father Clarence J. ``Jim'' McCormick; stepmother \nMarilyn McCormick; brothers Mike and Pat McCormick; sister Jane \nWissell; sons Will, Ry and Eli McCormick; and partner Andre Neal.\n  A lifelong Hoosier, Mac served in leadership roles in numerous \ntrucking trade associations, including Truck PAC, Truckload Carriers \nAssociation, and Indiana Motor Truck Association, and in July he was \nchosen as the Indiana Chamber of Commerce's 2006 Business Leader of the \nYear. He was set to assume the chairmanship of the American Trucking \nAssociation next week, where he previously had served as vice chairman. \nIt is a rare man who can make such an impact on so many people over the \ncourse of one life. Hoosiers will miss Mac as a friend, a community \nleader, and a committed advocate for our state.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Clarence J. ``Mac'' McCormick \nIII in the Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to the State of \nIndiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10868-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10868-S10869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE 2006 CALIFORNIA NOBEL LAUREATES\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to extend my most sincere congratulations to all of the \n2006 Nobel laureates. These individuals have shown themselves to \npossess some of the world's most creative and accomplished minds, and \neach has made a remarkable contribution to humanity. I am extremely \nproud to say that California is home to three of these individuals. \nTheir names are Roger D. Kornberg, recipient of the Nobel Prize in \nchemistry; Andrew Z. Fire, recipient of a share of the Nobel Prize in \nmedicine; and George F. Smoot, recipient of a share of the Nobel Prize \nin physics.\n  Dr. Roger D. Kornberg was born into the shadow of a giant in the \nscientific community. Dr. Kornberg's father, Dr. Arthur Kornberg, won a \nshare of a Nobel Prize in 1959 for his trailblazing work on DNA \ninformation transfer. Dr. Roger Kornberg's decision to follow in his \nfather's footsteps reflects a man of clear vision and unshakable will, \nand it is extraordinarily inspiring to see an individual meet the high \nstandard that was set before him.\n  Dr. Kornberg graduated from Harvard University in 1967 and went on to \nget his doctorate from Stanford in 1972. For the last 26 years, Dr. \nKornberg has been a professor of structural biology at Stanford, \nconducting cutting-edge research while guiding his students in their \nexploration of nature's mysteries. Over that time he tirelessly probed \nthe questions surrounding how information is stored in genes and \ntransferred to other parts of a cell. This process is called \ntranscription, and it holds a key to understanding of how cells \noperate.\n  As a result of Dr. Kornberg's efforts, we can now visually \ndemonstrate how\n\n[[Page S10869]]\n\ninformation encoded in a cell's DNA blueprint is read and duplicated \ninto what is called messenger RNA. This constitutes a significant leap \nforward in our knowledge of cellular mechanics and has brought us \ncloser to identifying and rectifying the disturbances in the \ntranscription of genetic information that is the cause of common \nkillers like heart disease and cancer. Dr. Kornberg's work has already \ninfluenced the development of drugs and therapies for various \nconditions and is opening new avenues for future research.\n  The story of Dr. Andrew Z. Fire is equally impressive and \ninspirational. Although extremely modest in demeanor, Dr. Fire has \ndemonstrated world-class intellectual ability and unquenchable drive \nsince childhood. Having graduated high school at the age of 15, Dr. \nFire attended the University of California, Berkeley, after being \nturned down by his other choice: Stanford. Now, at age 47, Dr. Fire has \nachieved the highest pinnacle of success in his field, opened up \npreviously inaccessible areas of research with vast potential for the \nfuture of medicine, and gotten into Stanford, where he is the third \nNobel laureate of the institution's proud medical school.\n  Dr. Fire, like Dr. Kornberg, was recognized for his years of \nexploration into RNA and its role in transcription of genetic \ninformation. More than 15 years ago, Dr. Fire became interested in \nunderstanding the genes involved in the earliest steps of cellular \ndevelopment. In an attempt to plot cellular development from the \nbeginning, Dr. Fire designed an experiment that produced the exact \nopposite of the anticipated result: After injecting a worm with a piece \nDNA to increase the expression of a particular gene, Dr. Fire \ninadvertently succeeded in suppressing the gene completely. This result \nwould eventually lead to the discovery of a fundamental mechanism for \ncontrolling the flow of genetic information--that of RNAi, or RNA \ninference, which quashes the activity of specific genes. This discovery \nwas termed the ``Breakthrough of the Year'' in 2002 by Science Magazine \nand has earned Dr. Fire and his colleague, Dr. Craig Mello, the 2006 \nNobel Prize for medicine.\n  The potential benefits of the discovery of RNA inference are \nlimitless. By using RNAi to silence one gene at time and observing \nabnormalities the behavior of cells, researchers are able to identify \nthe function of genes, and potentially, use silencing to reduce or \neliminate cellular activity harmful to human health. Dr. Fire's many \nachievements constitute an extraordinary contribution to our \nunderstanding of how life operates at its most basic level, and \ndemonstrate his outstanding talent and unwavering commitment to \nimproving the health of his fellow human beings.\n  Dr. George F. Smoot has for years been examining the cosmos in search \nof an answer to the biggest question of them all: How did it all begin? \nTo an amazing degree, Dr. Smoot has been answering this seemingly \nunanswerable question. For 50 years, scientists struggled in vain to \nsupport the Big Bang theory with hard, indisputable evidence. Dr. Smoot \ndealt the contentious theory a further challenge when, in 1976, he and \nothers found startling evidence that galaxies are clustered together \nand not, as previously thought, spread evenly throughout the universe. \nThis observation conflicted with temperature readings that consistently \nfound space to be an even temperature of 2.7 degrees above absolute \nzero. Dr. Smoot had presented the scientific community a quandary: How \ncould the heat be evenly distributed through the universe if galaxies \nwere not?\n  It is a testament to Dr. Smoot's brilliance, ingenuity, and diligence \nthat he, along with his colleague and corecipient of this year's Nobel \nPrize in physics, Dr. John C. Mather, would clear up the confusion \nresulting from the establishment of a ``lumpy'' universe and finally \ncement the Big Bang theory of the creation of the universe. To achieve \nthat ambitious goal, Smoot overcame nearly insurmountable obstacles and \nbroke through barriers that had thwarted previous generations of \nresearchers. Dr. Smoot was a driving force behind NASA's construction \nand development of the COBE satellite, which under the direction of Dr. \nSmoot and Dr. Mather succeeded in detecting the minuscule variations in \ntemperature that were anticipated by the Big Bang theory and the \n``lumpy'' nature of the universe.\n  As a result of Dr. Smoot's incredible achievement, we now have a much \nclearer picture of where we came from and where we are going. His \npenetrating vision challenges the limits of human comprehension, \ntransporting us to times and places that were once unreachable. Dr. \nSmoot has fundamentally changed the way we view the universe and \nsecured his place as one of the most important astrophysicists of all \ntime.\n  It is with great pleasure that I applaud all three of California's \n2006 Nobel laureates. Dr. Kornberg, Dr. Fire, and Dr. Smoot have made \nextraordinary contributions to our understanding of how the universe \noperates, from the microscopic level of the cell to the vast level of \ngalaxies. Their phenomenal insights have answered questions that have \nlong puzzled the scientific community and raised new possibilities for \nthe research of future generations. I thank these men for the many \nvaluable gifts they have given humanity, not least of which is the gift \nof unbridled imagination and the belief that anything is \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10869-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10869-S10870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF SHERIFF DON HORSLEY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize San Mateo County sheriff Don Horsley, who is retiring after \n38 years of dedicated service to law enforcement and public safety.\n  Sheriff Horsley is a San Francisco Bay Area native who was born in \nSan Francisco, raised in Daly City, and educated in the county's public \nschools. He graduated from Daly City's Westmoor High School before \ngraduating with honors from San Francisco State University in 1969.\n  After a brief time as a classroom teacher, Sheriff Horsley entered \ninto a career in law enforcement that has spanned 38 years.\n  Beginning as a patrol officer in Daly City and later serving as a \npatrol deputy officer in East Palo Alto, Sheriff Horsley was elected \nSheriff of San Mateo County in June 1993. From the beginning, Sheriff \nHorsley has been dedicated to making his community a better and safer \nplace to live. Under his leadership, the San Mateo County Sheriff's \nOffice has implemented an extensive number of innovative programs to \nmake the community safer, including community policing, graffiti \nabatement, gang intelligence/investigative unit, sexual habitual \noffender program, high-tech task force, school resource officer \nprogram, and a youth camp for at-risk youth. Sheriff Horsley also \nestablished an after school Sheriff's Activity League to help kids \nsucceed in school and stay out of gangs.\n  After the tragedy of September 11, 2001, Sheriff Horsley stepped into \na leadership role and joined the FBI in a regional Joint Terrorism Task \nForce. He established a regional information sharing network with the \nnine Bay Area counties and directed the Sheriff's Office of Emergency \nServices to take the lead to ensure that the county's first responders \nand public health workers had the equipment and training to respond to \ndisasters. Sheriff Horsley also worked with regional transit agencies \nto establish a transit unit of deputy sheriffs to patrol bus and rail \ntransportation within the county.\n  Sheriff Horsley was also a fierce advocate for the construction of a \nstate-of-the-art forensic crime lab that is used by local, regional, \nState, and Federal agencies to solve crimes. Sheriff Horsley tirelessly \nworked with the Bay Area Congressional Delegation, including my office, \nto obtain funding to ensure that the forensic crime lab had the latest \nin crime fighting technology.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Sheriff Horsley currently serves as \ncochair of the Attorney General and State Superintendent of Public \nInstruction's Safe Schools Task Force; vice chair of the Northern \nCalifornia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area; chair of the San Mateo \nCounty Vehicle Theft Task Force and Vice Chair for the County Narcotics \nTask Force. Sheriff Horsley has also been a member of the executive \nboard of the California State Sheriffs' Association since 1996, served \nas the past chair of the San Mateo County Criminal Justice Council and \nas a past member of the board\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\nof directors of the California Peace Officers' Association.\n  Sheriff Horsley has not only improved public safety but has worked \ntirelessly with local elected officials, schools, and community \norganizations to foster a strong sense of community and improve the \nlives of children and families in San Mateo County.\n  Sheriff Horsley's service to San Mateo County and dedication to \npublic safety throughout California is inspiring. I have been honored \nto work with him. I am confident that, even in retirement, Sheriff \nHorsley will continue to touch lives with his good will and \ncompassion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10870-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING CHARLES A. BIBBS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing entrepreneur and philanthropist Charles A. Bibbs as \nhe is recognized by the Black Voice Foundation for his exceptional \ncontributions to ethnic art.\n  Charles Bibbs is a recognized and accomplished artist, known for his \nrepresentations of ethnic and cultural themes. Throughout his life, he \nhas been lauded and recognized by numerous community and philanthropic \norganizations for his work in the multicultural communities and his \ndedication to music and art. His work has been featured in several \nexhibits, on the Internet, and on several local and national television \nstations.\n  Since he was a young person, Charles Bibbs has possessed a strong \ntalent for art and artistic creation. Throughout his career, he worked \nin corporate America and funded his artistic cultivation through that \nwork. In 1985, Bibbs was able to fuse his strengths in business with \nhis passion for artistic expression and formed B Graphics and Fine Arts \nto publish and distribute his own artwork. Since that time, Bibbs has \nbecome a dedicated and renowned ethnic artist and has worked \npassionately for cohesion and unity within marginalized communities.\n  Recently, Charles Bibbs has spent much of his time conducting \nseminars and workshops to educate and inspire young people and \nreinforce educational institutions. He formed Art 2000, a nonprofit \nvisual art association that works to inform local communities about \nart, and helps to inspire art patrons and artists themselves. From this \norganization has come Images Magazine, which is the first national \npublication dedicated to ethnic art. As well, this has inspirited the \ntraveling ethnic art exhibit ``Art on Tour.'' Along this same vein, \nBibbs' passion for jazz music led him to the creation and founding of \nInland Empire Music and Arts Foundation, a nonprofit organization that \nhas hosted an annual world-class jazz and art festival in southern \nCalifornia for the past 3 years.\n  Art and graphic representations are powerful tools that can help \nunite communities and inspire young people. The work and example of \nCharles Bibbs has inspired countless individuals and continues to bring \nart and music to our Nation's youth. I applaud Charles Bibbs and look \nforward to many more years of cultural representation and youth \nenrichment from this great American artist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10870-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CELEBRATING THE CITY OF LODI'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 100th anniversary of the city of Lodi, a thriving, \nfamily-oriented community located in California's San Joaquin Valley.\n  The city originally known as Mokelumne was founded in 1869 when \nCharles O. Ivory and John M. Burt established the Ivory Store, an \nenterprise that attracted scores of homesteaders and businesses to the \narea. In order to avoid confusion between the towns of Mokelumne, \nMokelumne Hill, and Mokelumne City, the city's name was officially \nchanged to Lodi in 1874. According to local folklore, the city's new \nname was inspired by a successful local racehorse, as horse racing was \na popular activity in the area during this period. By the time its \nresidents overwhelmingly voted for incorporation on November 27, 1906, \nLodi was already one of the fastest growing communities in San Joaquin \nCounty.\n  In 1907, in an effort to publicize a large carnival to promote Lodi's \nfamous Tokay grapes, a mission-style arch was erected at Pine and \nSacramento Streets. The Lodi Arch, one of the few remaining Mission \nRevival ceremonial arches left in California, has served as an entrance \ninto Lodi for the past century. In 1919 and 1926, the world-famous A & \nW Root Beer and the Supertreader, the first successful full-circle tire \nretreading mold, were respectively introduced to the world within a \nshort distance from the Lodi Arch. To many people, this remarkable \nlandmark symbolizes the city's proud history and economic vitality.\n  In 1956, the Federal Government officially recognized Lodi as a \nwinegrape growing region, thus allowing vintners to label their wine as \noriginating from Lodi. However, it was not until 1986, when the Lodi \nAppellation was formally approved, that Lodi began to shed its label as \nthe wine industry's best kept secret to become one of the emerging \nwine-producing regions in the Nation. Today, Lodi is home to a highly \nregarded and vibrant wine industry where nearly two dozen wineries \nutilize exemplary viticulture practices to consistently produce wines \nthat are renowned for their quality.\n  The city of Lodi has grown from a town of less than 2,000 residents \nfrom the time of its incorporation to a flourishing and diverse \ncommunity of 63,000 that rests in the middle of one of the most dynamic \nregions of California. The state of the city as it turns 100 is best \ncaptured by its slogan: ``Livable, Lovable, Lodi.'' The story of the \ncity's first 100 years is a testament to the value of community, \nvision, and optimism. As the residents of the city work together to \nmake their city a better place to call home, I congratulate them on \ntheir centennial anniversary and wish them another 100 years of good \nfortune and success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10870-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10870-S10871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A LIFETIME OF NATIONAL SERVICE\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

McMILLAN\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life \nand legacy of Enolia P. McMillan. She was a revered and beloved civil \nrights leader, community leader, and educator.\n  Mrs. McMillan was an amazing woman with a fantastic story. She had \nboth grace and grit, as well as a personality that would not accept the \nword ``no'' for an answer.\n  When they said: ``You can't,'' she said: ``I can!''\n  When they said: ``You won't,'' she said: ``I will!''\n  When they said: ``Wait,'' she said: ``Now!''\n  Enolia P. McMillan was born to a loving family of modest means. She \nfought hard for her education, while attending schools that were \nseparate and far from equal.\n  She wanted to be a doctor--a pediatrician. Although she would never \nattend medical school, she was certainly a healer. In fact, her thesis \nwas entitled: ``The Factors Affecting Secondary Education for Negroes \nin Maryland Counties,'' which laid the groundwork for changes in \neducation and the Supreme Court.\n  She cared not only about her own education but the education of \nothers. That is why Mrs. McMillan was so at home at the NAACP. The \nNAACP is about empowerment and it is about equality. Mrs. McMillan \nunderstood this and focused on the grassroots, which turned the \nBaltimore branch into a powerhouse.\n  As national president, she strengthened the NAACP and brought it here \nto Baltimore. She didn't throw bricks--she sold bricks--to build the \nNAACP headquarters in Baltimore, and she always supported young \nleaders, like Kweisi Mfume. Always, she fought for equality and \nfairness, whether it was for equal pay for teachers in Maryland or for \nthe freedom of the South African people living under apartheid.\n  On a personal note, I met Mrs. McMillan when I was on the Baltimore \nCity Council. She was the president of the Baltimore Branch of the \nNAACP and attended every critical meeting and hearing. She also came to \nmy office on occasion. We didn't know each other well, having come from \ndifferent sides of Baltimore, but I so admired her. She took a keen \ninterest in this spunky, chunky, feisty Baltimorean.\n  Her greatest passions were schools. We were ending segregation in our \nschools--not only tearing down old ways but building new ones. To her, \nthe word ``public'' meant a lot: public schools, public libraries, and \nthe public interest.\n  Mrs. McMillan was always so supportive and encouraging toward me. I \nwould win some and I would lose some; but she always said: Keep \nspeaking up--keep speaking out. If you were doing well, she told you. \nIf she thought you could do better, she told you; and we did.\n  She had a passion for young people and spotting new leaders. She \nthought all young people had value and always believed in the freedom \nto achieve--to follow the American dream.\n  She would say: Barbara, fight for more books and less bombs. Fight \nfor more libraries and fewer jails. Make sure people have drugs to \nfight cancer, while at the same time fighting the cancer of drugs. \nFight for more jobs and make sure people turn the corner. Don't leave \nthem standing at the corner. Most of all, she would say, Barbara, fight \nfor the freedom to achieve.\n  I marvel at how mysteriously God works. I marvel that he should call \nEnolia McMillan in the same year as he has called four other great \nmothers of the civil rights movement: Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, \nVictorine Adams, and Roberta March. I so admired Mrs. McMillan's \npassion and her activism. I am so grateful for her friendship. I will \nmiss her leadership, her vision, and her political savvy.\n  The best of her lives on in all of us, as we seek to live up to her \ncourage, conviction, and tenacity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10871-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HERREID LIVESTOCK MARKET\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I honor the owners and \noperators of the Herreid Livestock Market on its 25th anniversary. Each \nyear, hundreds of thousands of animals are moved through the sale barn \nto be purchased by farmers or by packers, and eventually find their way \nto supermarket shelves. The Herreid Livestock Market is one of the \nlargest sale barns in the region, and has proven to be a pillar of the \nlocal community both by facilitating business and through advocacy and \nphilanthropy.\n  The Herreid Livestock Market began operating in 1981. A previous sale \nbarn in Herreid had burned down in 1978. Herman Schumacher, the late \nGordie Ulmer, and the late Andy Heisler were primarily responsible for \nthe building of the current structure. Joe Vetter quickly joined in the \nenterprise as an auctioneer and soon purchased a third of the business. \nSince then, Schumacher and Vetter have remained partners, along with \nvarious other individuals, most recently J.R. Scott. Finally, though, \nlast summer the business was sold to Joe Varner. Scott still manages \nthe sale barn, however, and Schumacher and Vetter remain involved as \nwell.\n  In addition to operating a premier sale barn, Schumacher, Vetter, and \nScott have been active in a variety of issues of vital importance to \ntheir industry. They have been active in pushing for country-of-origin \nlabeling, helping to close the Canadian border for food safety reasons, \nand perhaps most notably, Schumacher was a founder of the Ranchers-\nCattlemen Action Legal Fund, R-CALF. R-CALF has advocated for producers \nby opposing market manipulation on the part of meatpackers, working to \nrestrict the importation of foreign cattle into the U.S., and food \nsafety, among other areas of concern. R-CALF has now merged with the \nUnited Stockgrowers of America and has over 18,000 members. The owners \nof the Herreid Livestock Market have also supported access to local \nhealth care by giving large donations to the Linton Hospital Foundation \nand the Campbell County Clinics.\n  While drought conditions have caused a spike in short-term sales, the \nsale barn may be facing some challenging years as producers work to \nbuild their herds back up. However, I am confident that the same work \nethic that has caused the Herreid Livestock Market to flourish for 25 \nyears will allow the business to continue prospering.\n  On October 6, 2006, the community celebrated the Herreid Livestock \nMarket with a free BBQ Beef Lunch before the 25th anniversary sale. I \nwish to congratulate the current and past owners and employees of the \nHerreid Livestock Market on reaching this milestone for their business, \nand for their years of service to the community. Once again, I commend \nthe individuals involved in this enterprise and am pleased to see them \npublicly honored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10871-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DENNIS COCHRANE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Mr. Dennis \nCochrane, a Wisconsin resident who last Thursday concluded his term on \nthe board of directors of the Northeast-Midwest Institute. The \nNortheast-Midwest Institute is a Washington-based, private, non-profit, \nand nonpartisan research organization dedicated to economic vitality, \nenvironmental quality, and regional equity for Northeast and Midwest \nStates.\n  During his tenure on the institute's board, Dennis has provided \nexceptional counsel and guidance, and in the process has helped to \nimprove the economic development and environmental quality of the \nNortheast-Midwest region.\n  Dennis is a partner in the law firm of Marcovich, Cochrane, Milliken \nand Swanson in Superior, WI. Prior to his law practice, he served as \nassistant district attorney for Douglas County, WI, and city Attorney \nfor the city of Superior. He has served as a member of the city of \nSuperior Harbor Commission and was active in the founding of the Head \nof the Lakes Council of Governments, which evolved into the \nMetropolitan Interstate Committee of the Duluth-Superior Region.\n  I thank Dennis Cochrane for his leadership on the Northeast-Midwest \nInstitute's Board.

Mr. President, last Friday, November 10, we \ncelebrated the centennial of the Order of the Theatine Fathers in \nColorado. I want the date of this milestone, so important to my\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\nState's history and culture, to be noted in the Record.\n  The Theatine Order serves parishes across Colorado, from the Sacred \nHeart Parish in Durango and St. Cajetan's Church in Denver to the \nSangre de Cristo Parish in my native San Luis Valley. The Order has a \nnoble history in my State and around the world, where its parishioners \nand pastors have worked to spread virtue and to improve the lives of \nour citizens.\n  Saint Cajetan, Paolo Consiglieri, Bonifacio da Colle, and Pope Paul \nIV founded the Theatine order nearly 5 centuries ago in Italy, partly \nin response to the upheavals of the Reformation. In the generations \nthat followed, the Theatines established missions in foreign lands, \nbuilding churches and spreading their teachings to places like Peru, \nBorneo, Sumatra, Georgia, and Armenia.\n  The Theatines arrived in Colorado at the end of the 19th century to a \nyoung State undergoing rapid changes. Thousands of new immigrants from \nIreland, Italy, Mexico, and elsewhere rushed to Colorado's mines, \nfarms, and ranches. These immigrants arrived in places like Durango, \nSan Luis, and Antonito, and found a centuries-old Hispano culture and a \ndeeply rooted Catholic faith.\n  As these towns and settlements grew, so too did the demands on the \nparishes of Colorado. In 1906, the Bishop of Colorado, Nicolas Matz, \nseeing a need for more priests in southwestern Colorado, asked the \nTheatine Order to serve Sacred Heart Parish in Durango. The Reverend \nJohn Licciotti and the Reverend Francisco Maria Blasquez Gomez held \ntheir first masses in a former schoolhouse, but the structure, and the \nmissions in the region, grew quickly. In 1920, the order established \nSt. Cajetan's Church in Denver and began staffing the church in \nAntonito. Three years later, the order expanded to San Luis and its \nmissions, and later to churches in Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. \nToday, the Theatine Order has 19 priests in Colorado, serving thousands \nof parishioners.\n  In honoring the centennial of the Theatine Fathers, we recognize the \ncontributions of the order to the parishes and parishioners of \nColorado, but we also celebrate the contributions of the fathers to the \nculture, faith, and history of our great State. Their work has helped \nbind communities, build schools, and instill virtue, compassion and \ncharacter in our citizenry. The Theatines are pillars in their \ncommunities, giants who serve the greater good.\n  I am proud to honor the Order of the Theatine Fathers and to have \nthis opportunity to thank them for their century of service. May the \nvirtues that they teach in the towns and churches across the great \nState of Colorado continue to fill our hearts and guide our service for \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10872-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10872-S10873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE RED MASS\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I wish to share with this \nbody the recent remarks of the new Archbishop of Washington, Donald W. \nWuerl, at this year's 53rd Annual Red Mass in Washington, DC. I have \nhad the pleasure of working with Archbishop Wuerl in his previous \nservice as the 11th bishop of Pittsburgh, PA. For 18 years, he \nministered to 800,000 Catholics throughout southwestern Pennsylvania \nwith generosity and compassion.\n  The Red Mass is celebrated each year in Washington, DC., at the start \nof the Supreme Court session and traditionally is held in the Cathedral \nof St. Matthew the Apostle. Supreme Court Justices, judges, Government \nofficials, lawyers, and people of all faiths regularly attend the Mass \nto offer prayers for those who administer justice. This Mass is \nsponsored by the John Carroll Society. The Red Mass enjoys a rich \nhistory, originating many centuries ago in European capitols. Red Mass \nderives its name from the traditional color of vestments worn by the \ncelebrants of the Mass, signifying the scarlet robes worn by royal \njudges who attended the Mass centuries ago. The tradition in the United \nStates began in 1928 in New York City and spread to cities across the \ncountry.\n  I hope that in sharing his comments with my colleagues, we will \ncontinue the ongoing conversations among people of faith about the \nroles of faith, law, and values in our system of democracy.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the remarks of Archbishop Wuerl to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n                            Red Mass Homily\n\n\n                      FAITH, LAW AND HUMAN VALUES\n\n          Archbishop Donald W. Wuerl, Archbishop of Washington\n\n Cathedral of Matthew the Apostle, Washington, DC, Sunday, October 1, \n                                  2006\n\n       Brothers and Sisters in the Lord, It is a privilege for me \n     to join each of you at this 53rd annual Red Mass sponsored by \n     the John Carroll Society as part of a noble tradition in our \n     nation's capital of invoking the blessing of God's Holy \n     Spirit on all who are engaged in the service of the law, \n     especially the members of the judiciary.\n       Recently I received a beautiful plant rooted in a very \n     attractive container with gorgeous flowers mixed throughout \n     the arrangement. Within a few short days, however, even \n     though I took great care of it, some of the flowers began to \n     fade. It was only after I removed one of the withered flowers \n     that I made the startling discovery that not all of the \n     flowers were attached to the plant and rooted in the soil, \n     but instead simply were placed in little plastic containers. \n     As the flowers were not part of the plant and not rooted in \n     the soil, they had no source of nourishment and died.\n       A beautiful flower in an isolated container is much like \n     the branch that Jesus speaks about in today's Gospel text \n     from St. John, the branch that gets cut off, detached from, \n     isolated from the vine. Such a branch cannot bear much \n     fruit--certainly not for long.\n       Whatever image we use, the lesson is the same. We cannot be \n     cut off from our rootedness. We cannot become isolated from \n     our connectedness and expect to flourish. As a people, we \n     have a need to be part of a living unity with roots and a \n     lived experience, with a history and, therefore, a future. \n     Our lives as individuals and as a society are diminished to \n     the extent that we allow ourselves to be cut off or \n     disconnected from that which identifies and nurtures us. \n     Branches live and bear fruit only insofar as they are \n     attached to the vine.\n       No one person; no part of our society, no people can become \n     isolated, cut off from its history, from its defining \n     experiences of life, from its highest aspirations, from the \n     lessons of faith and the inspiration of religion--from the \n     very ``soil'' that sustains life-and still expect to grow and \n     flourish. Faith convictions, moral values and defining \n     religious experiences of life sustain the vitality of the \n     whole society. We never stand alone, disconnected, uprooted, \n     at least not for long without withering.\n       A profound part of the human experience is the search for \n     truth and connectedness, and the development of human wisdom \n     that includes the recognition of God, an appreciation of \n     religious experience in human history and life, and the \n     special truth that is divinely revealed religious truth.\n       Science linked to religiously grounded ethics, art \n     expressive of spirituality, technology reflective of human \n     values, positive civil law rooted in the natural moral order \n     are all branches connected to the vine.\n       A healthy and vital society respects the wisdom of God made \n     known to us through the gift of creation and the blessing of \n     revelation. We not only need God's guidance, but we are \n     created in such a way that we yearn for its light and \n     direction. Pope John Paul II in his encyclical Fides et Ratio \n     reminds us: ``. . . God has placed in the human heart a \n     desire to know the truth--in a word, to know himself--so \n     that, by knowing and loving God, men and women may also come \n     to the fullness of truth about themselves.'' (Intro., Fides \n     et Ratio)\n       One reason we gather today in prayer for the outpouring of \n     the gifts of the Holy Spirit is our realization that it is \n     the wisdom of God that fills up what is lacking in our own \n     limited knowledge and understanding. Connected to the vine, \n     we access the richness of God's word directing our human \n     experience under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Cut off \n     from the vine, we have only ourselves.\n       At times our society, like many contemporary cultures \n     heavily nurtured in a secular vision that draws its \n     inspiration elsewhere, can be tempted to think that we are \n     sufficient unto ourselves in grappling with and answering the \n     great human questions of every generation in every age: how \n     shall I live; what is the meaning and, therefore, the value \n     of life; how should we relate to each other; what are our \n     obligations to one another?\n       The assertion by some that the secular voice alone should \n     speak to the ordering of society and its public policy, that \n     it alone can speak to the needs of the human condition, is \n     being increasingly challenged. Looking around, I see many \n     young men and women who, in such increasing numbers, are \n     looking for spiritual values, a sense of rootedness and hope \n     for the future. In spite of all the options and challenges \n     from the secular world competing for the allegiance of human \n     hearts, the quiet, soft and gentle voice of the Spirit has \n     not been stilled.\n       Just as we are told in the first reading today that the \n     Spirit of God was shared with some of the elders so, too, \n     today we have a sense that that Spirit continues to be \n     shared. The resurgence of spiritual renewal in its many forms \n     bears testimony to the atavistic need to be connected to the \n     vine and rooted in the soil of our faith experience.\n\n[[Page S10873]]\n\n       As Jesus assures us in today's Gospel: ``Just as a branch \n     cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine, \n     so neither can you unless you remain in me.'' The revelation \n     of the mystery of God-with-us is not incidental to that human \n     experience. It gives light and direction to the struggle \n     we call the human condition. Religious faith and faith-\n     based values are not peripheral to the human enterprise. \n     Our history, the history of mankind, is told in part in \n     terms of our search for and response to the wisdom of God.\n       Religious faith has long been a cornerstone of the American \n     experience. From the Mayflower Compact, which begins ``In the \n     name of God, Amen,'' to our Declaration of Independence, we \n     hear loud echoes of our faith in God. It finds expression in \n     our deepseated conviction that we have unalienable rights \n     from ``Nature and Nature's God.''\n       Thomas Jefferson stated that the ideals and ideas that he \n     set forth in the Declaration of Independence were not \n     original with him, but were the common opinion of his day. In \n     a letter dated May 8, 1825, to Henry Lee, former governor of \n     Virginia, Jefferson writes that the Declaration of \n     Independence is ``intended to be an expression of the \n     American mind and to give to that expression the proper tone \n     and spirit.''\n       George Washington, after whom this city is named, was not \n     the first, but perhaps was the most prominent, American \n     political figure to highlight the vital part religion must \n     play in the well-being of the nation. His often-quoted \n     Farewell Address reminds us that we cannot expect national \n     prosperity without morality, and morality cannot be sustained \n     without religious principles.\n       Morality and ethical considerations cannot be divorced from \n     their religious antecedents. What we do and how we act, our \n     morals and ethics, follow on what we believe. The religious \n     convictions of a people sustain their moral decisions.\n       What is religion's place in public life? As our Holy \n     Father, Pope Benedict XVI, tells us in his first encyclical \n     letter, ``Deus Caritas Est'' (God Is Love): ``[f]or her part, \n     the Church, as the social expression of Christian faith, has \n     a proper independence and is structured on the basis of her \n     faith as a community which the State must recognize. The two \n     spheres are distinct, yet always interrelated'' (DCE 28). \n     Politics, law and faith are mingled because believers are \n     also citizens. Church and state are home to the very same \n     people.\n       The place of religion and religious conviction in public \n     life is precisely to sustain those values that make possible \n     a common good that is more than just temporary political \n     expediency. Without a value system rooted in morality and \n     ethical integrity, there is the very real danger that human \n     choices will be motivated solely by personal convenience and \n     gain.\n       To speak out against racial discrimination, social \n     injustice or threats to the dignity of life is not to force \n     values upon society, but rather to call our society to its \n     own, long-accepted, moral principles and commitment to defend \n     basic human rights, which is the function of law.\n       Not only did Thomas Jefferson subscribe to the proposition \n     that all are created equal, but his writings indicate that he \n     extended the logic of that statement. All people are obliged \n     to a code of morality that rests on the very human nature \n     which is the foundation for our human dignity and equality. \n     Jefferson recognizes no distinction between public and \n     private morality. In a letter dated August 28, 1789, to James \n     Madison, who later became the fourth president of our \n     country, Jefferson wrote: ``I know but one code of morality \n     for all, whether acting singly or collectively.''\n       Perhaps nowhere is the relationship of values, religious \n     faith, public policy and the application of the law more \n     deeply rooted in its historic expression than here in our \n     nation's capital. Here is the place where our first \n     president, George Washington, and the first Catholic bishop \n     in our country, John Carroll, recognized so very early on in \n     the life of our country the need to respect, honor and \n     support the understanding that the goals of governance and \n     the expression of faith-based morality mingle and overlap. At \n     the same time, each was respectful of the prerogatives of the \n     other, and both were mindful that all the voices needed to be \n     heard.\n       In the end, the goal of public policy, and its application \n     and interpretation, must be not what we can do but what we \n     ought to do; not what we have the ability to achieve, but \n     what in our hearts, in our conscience and in our souls we \n     know we must do.\n       As believers, our hope for a better world is rooted in our \n     faith that God will help us make this happen. Faith is the \n     source of our perennial optimism and our social activism and \n     involvement. If we work and work hard enough, God will be \n     with us to bring about that world of peace, justice, \n     understanding, wisdom, kindness, respect and love that we \n     call His kingdom coming to be on earth.\n       Our prayer today is that our American democratic society \n     will continue to be a flowering plant connected to the vine \n     with roots sunk deep into the rich soil of our national \n     identity, spiritual experience and faith convictions. May our \n     religious faith, as a foundational part of our national \n     experience, continue to nurture and sustain each branch of \n     our society so that by its very connectedness to the vine it \n     can blossom and flourish.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10873-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10873-S10874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING LARRY TICE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues in the Senate the story of an awful tragedy that took place \nin Weirton, WV. Larry Tice, a steelworker at the former Weirton Steel \nnow called Mittal Steel's Weirton Plant took his own life earlier this \nyear after being overwhelmed with a misplaced feeling of failure.\n  Larry spent decades in Weirton Steel's hot mill before he was \ntransitioned to the tin mill in Mittal's reorganization and shrinking \nof its operations in Weirton. At its height, Weirton Steel employed \n14,000--nearly everyone in a town of roughly 25,000. Twenty years ago \nemployment was approximately 7,000, and today the company employs less \nthan 2,000 people in a town that has shrunk to fewer than 20,000 \npeople. Weirton is a town that had been built around the plant, and the \nplant served as the town's economic engine for nearly 100 years. \nWeirton was and is known for its world-class steelmaking.\n  Mr. Tice was a hard-working veteran at Weirton Steel. There had never \nbeen a doubt as to where Larry would work when he was growing up. He, \nlike so many others, had been raised to believe if they worked hard, \nthere would always be a job that included a living wage, competitive \nbenefits, and a guaranteed pension. Larry's father, uncles, and cousins \nhad all worked at the mill. Larry worked there his whole life after \nsigning up after high school graduation in 1973. Just before his death, \nhis job was in jeopardy, many of his benefits diminished, and his \npension had all but disappeared.\n  Mr. Tice worked at the heart of the mill, in the pit, where glowing \nmolten steel drifted overhead in 340-ton ladles, then roared out of \n3\\1/2\\-inch holes. He excelled in his area of work and was crew chief \nto six employees. Everyone says Mr. Tice enjoyed his work and took \npride in what he did. It was not an easy job. The intense heat and the \nphysical nature of the job tax workers physically and mentally, but Mr. \nTice was a true steelworker, never complaining and always doing what he \nwas asked.\n  After many layoffs at Weirton Steel and the closure of the hot end, \nMr. Tice was relocated to the tin mill, but he happily accepted this \nassignment because he was one of those who would still have a job after \nanother massive layoff. With the new job came many new stresses and \nworries. Mr. Tice had only 2 weeks to master the new machinery and \ntechnology; the tin mill was more technologically advanced and was a \nplace that required new skills and processes. At age 51, this new, \nhigh-tech job posed a real challenge for Mr. Tice. The stress continued \nto mount and Mr. Tice began to feel inferior, as his friends report, \nlooking back on his last few months of life.\n  Mr. Tice worried that the new management of Weirton would not \ntolerate a slow learning curve. He worried that if he didn't pick up \nhis new craft quickly enough that he would be fired. In the end, friend \nand family pointed to some negative reinforcement and a general feeling \nof inadequacy on Mr. Tice's part. This steelworker of two-plus decades \nworried that if he didn't catch on quickly enough he wouldn't be able \nto provide for his family or allow them the opportunities they \ndeserved--worries that anyone who cares for a family can understand. \nLarry Tice was a family man to his last days.\n  This hardship and uncertainty, along with his constant pressure and \nconcern for his family's welfare, ultimately led to him taking his own \nlife. Mr. Tice's widow, Mary, is now only left to wonder what was so \ninescapable. Mary spoke with Larry over the phone moments before his \ndeath and he told her he had `screwed up,' though he did not elaborate \nfurther. At home, Larry hung up the telephone. When Mary tried calling \nback, there was no answer. She then drove home, though it was too late.\n  I stand before you today to ask that Larry Tice's story be \nremembered, along with the ongoing struggle of all steelworkers. Many \nask why we in steel States fight so hard for our steel jobs, and it is \nbecause of stories like Larry Tice's that touch our hearts. It is so \nthat no more steelworkers will suffer the agony Mr. Tice endured and\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\nwhich conquered him. We work to ensure that fair trade conditions exist \nso no more families find themselves agonizing as a loved one worries \nabout their livelihood and ability to provide for their family. The \nsteel industry is very important to the prosperity of our State and is \nsomething that touches many West Virginians' lives and our country. My \ndeepest sympathy goes out to the Tice family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10874-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10874-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/13/senate-section/article/S10874-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10874-S10875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bills were read the first and the second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 383.

A bill to extend oversight and accountability related to \nUnited States reconstruction funds and efforts in Iraq by extending the \ntermination date of the Office of the Special Inspector General for \nIraq Reconstruction; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today Senator Feingold and I are \nintroducing the Iraq Reconstruction Accountability Act of 2006. This \nbipartisan legislation, is co-sponsored by Senators Lieberman, Leahy, \nColeman, Cantwell, Salazar, Kerry and Coburn, has a single purpose: to \nensure continuing, vigorous oversight of American tax dollars in Iraq \nby repealing the premature termination date for the Office of the \nSpecial Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR).\n  This legislation would restore SIGIR's termination date to its \nprevious schedule of 10 months after 80 percent of Iraq reconstruction \nfunds have been expended. It would repeal conference language in the \n2007 Defense Authorization Bill that would close SIGIR on October 1, \n2007, and transfer oversight to the Inspectors General of the \nDepartments of State, Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment.\n  Departmental and agency Inspectors General perform an important \nservice with dedication and expertise. However, those offices are \nconfigured to provide audits, inspections, and investigations of \ncontinuing government operations. The traditional approach of IG \noversight--extensive inquiries, lengthy preparation and delivery of \nreports, recommendations for corrective action--is thorough. But it \nalso is time-consuming and can allow wasteful or fraudulent practices \nto continue for some time.\n  Iraq reconstruction is a unique situation, with enormous amounts of \nmoney being spent in a relatively short period of time on a specific \nrange of programs and operations. A number of agencies across the \nfederal government are active in Iraq reconstruction, including the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, the Department of Justice and others. \nReconstruction managers, and ultimately the taxpayers, do not have the \nluxury of waiting months to receive recommendations to correct wasteful \nor fraudulent practices. Oversight of Iraq reconstruction requires that \nthe Inspector General be able to cross departmental boundaries and \ndeliver the results of his work quickly and efficiently.\n  Effective oversight of Iraq reconstruction requires the unique \napproach provided by the SIGIR. Special Inspector General Stuart Bowen \ndescribed this approach in testimony before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in a hearing on August 2. SIGIR's \nauditors and inspectors provide on-the-spot guidance to managers as \nsoon as problems are discovered, so corrective action can \nbegin immediately. This ``real time'' method allows most of his reports \nto document not only how problems were detected, but also how they were \ncorrected.\n\n  This method works. It should continue as long as American funds are \nbeing used for Iraq reconstruction, not terminate on some arbitrary and \npremature date. As of October 30, 2006, SIGIR estimates that the \nfinancial impact of its audit operations is $441 billion, its \ninvestigative operations is $20 million and its inspection operations \nis\n\n[[Page S10881]]\n\n$1.44 billion. It has achieved these results while costing the taxpayer \n$72 million. This means that for every dollar SIGIR has spent there has \nbeen a financial impact of $25 dollars, a very impressive ratio. SIGIR \nhas also opened 256 cases thus far, and has either referred for \nprosecution or cleared 164. SIGIR has an impressive record. The Office \nhas 92 open cases, with 25 of them at the Department of Justice. SIGIR \nhas issued 73 audit reports and 65 project assessments. Its work has \nled to the arrests of five people, and the convictions of four, with \nmore than $17 million in assets seized. During the current quarter, \nSIGIR investigators opened 20 new cases and closed 10.\n  There is no question that SIGIR has proven itself to be a much-needed \nwatchdog, auditing reconstruction contracts in Iraq and spotlighting \nnumerous cases of waste, fraud and abuse. We must keep this watchdog on \nthe job.\n  In addition, SIGIR has taken on a mission that will benefit our \nnation long after the Iraq reconstruction efforts conclude. Through its \nLessons Learned Initiative, the experience gained in Iraq--and the \nmethods developed to track, evaluate, and correct programs--will \nprovide critical guidance to managers and policymakers in the future. \nThe efficient and speedy SIGIR approach would have helped the initial \nurgent stages of Katrina recovery immeasurably, and it will be \ninvaluable in the aftermath of new disasters to come.\n  SIGIR has performed admirably in the most difficult of circumstances. \nMr. Bowen and his exemplary staff have put themselves in harm's way \nnumerous times. This incredible dedication is reflected in their work, \nwhich provides a high degree of oversight and accountability that is \nessential for Iraq reconstruction to succeed, and it is creating a \ntemplate for success in the challenges that lie ahead. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Iraq Reconstruction Accountability Act. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4046\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 531, S. 3501.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3501) to amend the Shivwits Band of the Paiute \n     Indian Tribe of Utah Water Rights Settlement Act to establish \n     an acquisition fund for the water rights and habitat \n     acquisition program.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has \nagreed to pass S. 3501, a bill to amend the Shivwits Band of the Paiute \nIndian Tribe of Utah Water Rights Settlement Act to establish an \nacquisition fund for the water rights and habitat acquisition program, \nwith an amendment that I have also offered. This bill amends the \nShivwits Band of Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Water Rights Settlement \nAct, enacted in 2000, which ratified a negotiated settlement of the \nShivwits Band of Paiute Indian Tribe's water entitlement to flow from \nthe Santa Clara River in UT.\n  S. 3501 was introduced to address a deficiency in the original \nstatutory language of the Shivwits Water Rights Settlement Act. Section \n10 of that Act authorized a water rights and habitat acquisition \nprogram. Congress appropriated $3 million that was authorized by \nSection 10. When the Department of the Interior attempted to implement \nthe law, the Treasury Department advised that the language in Section \n10 was insufficient for this purpose. The Treasury Department and \nDepartment of the Interior developed technical correction language to \naddress this deficiency in the original statutory language. S. 3501 \nfacilitates this correction in the Shivwits Water Rights Settlement \nAct.\n  However, subsequent to approval of this measure by the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, the Congressional Budget Office determined that the language \ndeveloped by Treasury and Interior, as reflected in S. 3501, could be \ninterpreted to authorize an additional $3 million to the Acquisition \nFund and thereby increase direct spending.\n  Therefore, I have offered an amendment with the bill in an effort to \navoid any ambiguity in S. 3501 concerning prior appropriations for the \nAcquisition Fund. The amendment strikes the potentially ambiguous \nlanguage in the bill, and inserts new language, to the affect, that \nfunds transferred to the Acquisition Fund are funds made available but \nnot expended. The technical amendment therefore avoids the possibility \nof any redundant appropriations, keeping S. 3501 budget neutral, as was \noriginally intended, and fully implements Section 10 of the Shivwits \nBand of Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Water Settlement Act of 2000.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the amendment at the desk be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5133) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To modify a provision relating to transfers to the \n                           Acquisition Fund)\n\n         On page 2, strike lines 19 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\n         ``(2) Transfers to acquisition fund.--There are \n     transferred to the Acquisition Fund any funds made available, \n     but not expended, under subsection (f).\n\n  The bill (S. 3501), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3501\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I also transmit, for the information of \nthe Senate, a report of the Department of State with respect to the \nAgreement.\n  This Agreement promotes the ability of U.S. design owners to protect \ntheir industrial designs by allowing them to obtain multinational \ndesign protection through a single deposit procedure.

Similarly, renewal of a \ndesign registration in each Contracting Party may be made by filing a \nsingle request along with payment of the appropriate fees at the \nInternational Bureau of WIPO. This Agreement should make access to \ninternational protection of industrial designs more readily available \nto U.S. businesses.\n  In the event that the Senate provides its consent to ratify the \nAgreement, the United States would not deposit its instrument of \nratification until the necessary implementing legal structure has been \nestablished domestically.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Agreement and give its advice and consent to its ratification, \nsubject to the declarations described in the accompanying report of the \nDepartment of State.\n                                                      George W.
