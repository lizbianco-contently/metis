Senators should gather in \nthe Chamber at 1:30 in order to depart at 1:40 to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/14/senate-section/article/S2053-7", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2053-S2054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HALABJA ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, briefly, I wish to speak to another issue, \nan issue that relates to an anniversary that will occur on March 16. On \nMarch 16, 18 years ago, Saddam Hussein launched one of the most brutal \nand indiscriminate attacks against his own people. On that day, a group \nof eight Iraqi aircraft began dropping chemical munitions on the town \nof Halabja in northern Iraq. According to Kurdish commanders on the \nscene, the planes made multiple passes before their gruesome task was \ncomplete.\n  The planes would drop chemical munitions, including mustard agent and \nnerve gas, for 45 minutes. After they had gone, another group would \ncome 15 minutes later to continue the assault with drop after drop \nafter drop. They concentrated their attack on the city and the roads \nleading out to safety.\n  I had the opportunity to visit with a number of the Kurdish \nphysicians about 2 years ago who described in detail to me what they \nsaw and what they treated following these gruesome attacks. Many of the \nvictims were drenched in liquid mustard gas, as well as these nerve \nagents, and others were breathing this toxic vapor. The physicians \ndescribed to me the fact that this mustard gas and the nerve agents \nwere segmented in parts of little hotels, where one week one wing would \nget a mustard gas, another a nerve agent, in order that the Saddam \nHussein people would see which of these would be the most deadly, which \nwould cause the most suffering.\n  After the onslaught, Saddam sent soldiers in their protective gear to \nstudy the impact in these wings of these hotels and throughout these \ncommunities. They wanted to see how effective and which agent would be \nmost effective to be used in the future. The soldiers actually divided \nthe city into\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\ngrids, determining the number and location of the dead and the extent \nof injuries inflicted on this defenseless population. More than 5,000 \npeople were killed and another 10,000 were injured.\n  To see the images of the heaps of lifeless bodies and mothers still \nclutching their babies is to see a waking nightmare.\n  Eighteen years later, the people of Halabja are still suffering the \neffects. Physicians describe to me cancer and birth defects, stillborns \nand miscarriages. For the people of Halabja, the nightmare is still not \nover.\n  Nor did Saddam Hussein limit his use of weapons of mass destruction \nto just Halabja. He used these weapons of mass destruction to destroy \nscores of Kurdish towns and villages. These gruesome attacks were a \npart of a year-long campaign which resulted in the deaths and \ndisappearances of more than 182,000 Iraqi Kurds.\n  These attacks bear on me heavily, as a Senator from Tennessee, \nbecause many of the Kurds migrated to Tennessee, especially the middle \nTennessee area. Many live in Nashville. In fact, the other day as I was \ngoing through the airport, 20 or 30 of the Kurdish people came up to \nexpress to me their appreciation to the United States in receiving them \nand in Tennessee, in particular, for receiving them so well, so they \ncould live lives that could move toward freedom and prosperity. Some of \nthe people I now represent have friends and family who suffered at the \nhands of Saddam Hussein. He killed them. He tortured them. He oppressed \nthe Iraqi Kurds for decades.\n  During the 1990s, the United States helped Iraq's Kurds achieve some \ndegree of autonomy. Last year, we helped them achieve the right to vote \nfor a Constitution and for a new Iraqi Government. The Kurds of \nnorthern Iraq knew for years what many Americans have been very slow to \nrealize. Saddam and his chemical weapons were a threat not only to the \nIraqi people but to the region, to our friends and our allies.\n  Saddam Hussein and his cohorts are now behind bars and standing trial \nfor their crimes. Unlike the victims of his regime, they are being \nafforded the opportunity to defend themselves. The Iraqi people are \ncommitted to seeing justice done, they are bravely building a new order \nbased on the rule of law and freedom. It has been a difficult journey, \nbut they are working hard to reconcile their political differences and \nestablish a government of national unity.\n  2005 was a year of progress. The Iraqis held three national \nelections. They approved a permanent Constitution. And thousands of \nyoung Iraqi citizens exhibited tremendous courage by joining the Iraqi \nsecurity forces. They accomplished all of this in the face of vicious \nterrorist violence. The attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra a few \nweeks ago was another cruel and craven attempt to ignite a civil war.\n  Iraq's political, ethnic, and religious leaders deserve credit for \nappealing for calm in working to diffuse the violence. They recognize \nthat every Iraqi has a stake in their new democracy and that a free \ndemocratic and prosperous Iraq is in the best interests of all.\n  Their task now is to swiftly forge a national unity government so \nthat leaders of Iraq's diverse population have the opportunity to \npeacefully appropriate the interests of their constituents. I am \nconfident the Iraqi people will work to include all of Iraq's ethnic \nand religious communities in the democratic process. Indeed, they have \nno other choice.\n  Iraq's political leaders must come together and continue to work for \nnational unity so that the Iraqi people can live in the freedom they \ndeserve and so that tragedies such as Halabja remain irrevocably in the \npast. The fight for Iraq is far from over. Every day ruthless criminals \nare trying to smash all of the progress that has been made, but they \nwill not succeed. Iraq has been set on a historic path.\n  This week, as we look back, we also press forward. With the continued \ncourage and determination of the Iraqi people, Iraq will emerge a \nbeacon of freedom and prosperity in the heart of the Middle East.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 83, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 83) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2007, and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2006 and 2008 through 2011.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand Senator Feingold will speak to \nthe amendment offered by himself and Senator Conrad and after Senator \nFeingold finishes speaking, I ask we go into a quorum call with the \ntime equally divided as was ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. I am very \npleased to join the Senator from North Dakota in the pay-go amendment, \nwhich I understand he will be offering soon.\n  There is no Senator more dedicated to a fiscally responsible Federal \nbudget and to restoring sound budget rules than Senator Conrad. He is \nan acknowledged expert on the budget and the rules that govern its \nconsideration. One might say he is the ``Robert C. Byrd'' of the \nbudget.\n  You do not have to be a Kent Conrad to understand the pay-go rule. \nOur amendment is the same amendment one or the other of us have offered \nsince the original pay-as-you-go rule expired a few years ago. It \nsimply reinstates the pay-as-you-go rule that had been such an \neffective restraint on the fiscal appetites of Congress and the White \nHouse.\n  Over the past 5 years, we have seen a dramatic deterioration in the \nGovernment's ability to perform one of its most fundamental jobs, and \nthat is balancing the Nation's fiscal books. In January of 2001, the \nCongressional Budget Office projected, in the 10 years thereafter, the \nGovernment would run a unified budget surplus of more than $5 trillion. \nBut little more than 5 years later, we face immense deficits and \nbackbreaking debt.\n  This must stop. Running deficits causes the Government to use the \nsurpluses of the Social Security trust fund for other Government \npurposes, rather than to pay down the debt and help our Nation prepare \nfor the coming retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  Every dollar we add to the Federal debt is another dollar that we are \nforcing our children to pay back in higher taxes or fewer Government \nbenefits. When we choose to spend on current consumption--through \nappropriated accounts or mandatory spending or tax cuts--without paying \nfor that spending, we are robbing our children of the opportunity to \nhave their own choices.\n  When we spend on our wants, by cutting taxes or through Government \nprograms, without paying for those decisions, we are saddling our \nchildren and even our grandchildren with debts they must pay from their \ntax dollars and their hard work. That is not right.\n  That is why I am joining Senator Conrad in his amendment to fully \nreinstate the pay-go rule. We need a strong budget process. We need to \nexert fiscal discipline.\n  When the pay-go rule was in effect, that tough fiscal discipline \nactually\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\ngoverned the budget process. Under the current approach, it is actually \nthe other way around: the annual budget resolution determines how much \nfiscal discipline we are willing to impose on ourselves.\n  Obviously, it is not surprising to know that simply has not worked. \nWhen Congress decides it would be nice to create a new entitlement or \nenact new tax cuts and then adjusts its budget rules to permit those \npolicies, we are inviting a disastrous result. And actually that is \nwhat we have seen happen--a disastrous result in terms of the fiscal \nhealth of our country.\n  I have tried in the past to contrast this approach to going on a \ndiet. If you want to lose weight, you set the number of total calories \nyou are allowed to consume first, and then what you are supposed to do, \nI understand, is to make the meals fit under that cap--not the other \nway around.\n  Imagine trying to lose weight by deciding what you want to eat first \nand then setting a calorie limit to accommodate all of your cravings. \nIf you want a few extra beers, fine, just dial up the limit on your \ncalorie intake. If you want some fudge brownies, that is fine, too, \njust raise the calorie limit accordingly.\n  It may taste pretty good at the time, but it is awfully sure you will \nend up gaining weight, such as the Nation is racking up debt. Because \nthis ill-advised diet is exactly how the current, mutated version of \npay-go works--and we have seen the results--the results are the debt we \nare leaving our children and grandchildren, and that debt continues to \nballoon and balloon.\n  In the case of the budget resolution before us, Members are permitted \nto indulge themselves in tax cut and mandatory spending policies--that \nare normally restrained by pay-go--to the tune of an estimated 10-year \ncost of $270 billion without having to find offsetting savings.\n  We need to return to the wise restraints under which Congress \nfunctioned during the 1990s and which were instrumental in balancing \nthe Federal budget. That is precisely what this amendment the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and I are offering would do.\n  Many of us have lived under this rule, and we know how effective it \nwas. If this budget does nothing else, it should reinstate the old pay-\ngo rule. If we do that, maybe we can begin to turn these annual budgets \naround and stop racking up these deficits and adding to the already \nenormous Federal debt.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the commonsense, time-tested pay-go \namendment by my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, of course, that time I used was, as I understand, to \ncome off the budget resolution; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, what I want to do is to follow up today on \nthe comments by Senator Feingold, who has been talking about pay-go as \na tool to begin reducing our budget deficit. As I do that, though, I \nwant to say there are a lot of things we can do to reduce our budget \ndeficit.\n  First of all, the fact is, the budget deficit last year was over $300 \nbillion; this one we expect to be over $400 billion. That is on a cash \nbasis of accounting. David Walker, the Comptroller General of our \ncountry, tells us if we were to use an accrual basis of accounting, \nwhich we require by law our businesses, our corporations to use, our \nbudget deficit for the current year would be over $700 billion. But we \noperate under a cash basis of accounting, so we are told it is going to \nbe over $400 billion.\n  As we look forward, down the road, by monkeying with the rules, by \nmaking some misassumptions, we can pretend the deficit is going to get \nsmaller over the next several years. We can pretend, for example, we \nare not going to be spending more money in Iraq or Afghanistan, and we \ncan pretend we are not going to fix the alternative minimum tax. We can \npretend a wide variety of things. But the truth is, as the baby boomers \nget ready to retire and we play this game of pretend, the budget \ndeficit does not get any smaller.\n  I think we are on a road to ruin. With the notion of $400 billion \nbudget deficits and $700 billion trade deficits for as far as the eye \ncan see, as the baby boomers get ready to retire, I do not see a whole \nlot of likelihood things are going to get better unless we do things \ndifferently in our Nation's capital. I am tired of hearing people just \nblame the Senate or just blame the House or just blame the \nadministration. We are all in this together. If we are going to get out \nof this mess, we are going to get out of it together.\n  Let me mention a couple things before I talk about pay-go that we \nought to be doing. The Internal Revenue Service reported last month \nthat the tax gap for calendar year 2005 was about $290 billion. What \nthey mean by that is there was about $290 billion--this is the net \nnumber--$290 billion that was owed in taxes that were not collected by \nthe Federal Government.\n  In a few minutes, I am leaving and going to a hearing of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. We will be having a hearing on \ncontractors, how we are doing with respect to making sure that \ncontractors we retain to do work for the Department of Defense or for \ncivilian agencies; that before we start paying them the money they are \ncharging for the work they are doing, we are taking out of that payment \nthe taxes they owe and have not paid. We are talking about literally \nbillions--with a ``B''--billions of dollars that are going uncollected, \ngoing to contractors we retain.\n  The President has proposed in his own budget some things we can do \ndifferently, some additional moneys for the IRS, to enable them to \ncollect taxes that are owed. For every extra $1 we provide to the IRS, \nthey will probably collect $7 or $8 that is not being collected that is \nowed. Senator Bayh, from Indiana, has a proposal that would probably \nenable us to collect another $15 billion a year to cut the tax gap \nfurther. There are other ideas we need to consider.\n  But before we go raising taxes--and somewhere down the road we are \ngoing to have to--but before we raise taxes, we simply need to do a \nbetter job of collecting the taxes that are owed that are not being \ncollected.\n  Let me also mention improper payments. We find, on the same committee \nI mentioned before, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs--one of the subcommittees that Senator Coburn and I serve on \nhas been working on improper payments. What do I mean by an ``improper \npayment''? It is a payment the Federal agency makes that is wrong. It \nis either too much or too little. As it turns out, there are a lot more \nimproper payments that are too much than too little. Overall, the net \nnumber for improper payments is close to $50 billion a year. That does \nnot include all the agencies.\n  Another thing we can do a whole lot better on is with respect to \noversight. I think there is something to be said for divided \nGovernment, where you do not have one party in charge of everything, \nwhether it is Democrats or Republicans, because right now we do not do \na very good job of oversight. The Democrats do not control the \ncommittees, do not control subcommittees. For the most part, we have \nnot done the job we need to do on oversight of this Republican \nadministration. I do not say that in a partisan way. It is the fact. If \nthe shoe was on the other foot and the Democrats were running \neverything--the House, the Senate, and the White House--we might be \nguilty of the same kind of thing.\n  But there are moneys we are spending in the Department of Defense--\nand some of it is in Iraq and some of it is in other places--that is \nshameful in the way we are misallocating it. And even when it is \npointed out by whistleblowers, we still go ahead and pay the money. It \nis crazy. We are doing the same kind of thing with some of our domestic \nagencies as well. We have begun putting a spotlight on this kind of \nbehavior in order to reduce it, and I think it is actually starting to \nhave an effect, but we need to keep it up.\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\n  The President has proposed something called expedited recision \npowers. It is also called a line-item veto. It is another thing we are \ngoing to be probably debating here: whether it makes any sense to help \nreduce the budget deficit. We actually passed--in fact, I authored, \nwhen I was in the House of Representatives, gosh, almost 20 years ago, \nat least 15 years ago--expedited line-item veto power for the \nPresident. I called it a sort of 2-year test drive on line-item veto \npowers, to see if the President would abuse the power.\n  The Congress could override the line-item veto with a simple majority \nof either the House or the Senate. It was a power that would last for 2 \nyears. If the President abused it, it would not be renewed. If the \nPresident did not abuse it and it was actually helpful, then it could \nbe renewed beyond that 2 years. I think that is probably a better \napproach, if we are going to try something such as this, than what the \nPresident has suggested. I think his suggestion is wrought with the \ntemptation for abuse by the executive branch.\n  That brings us to pay-go. Some of you have heard me quote Denis \nHealey, former chancellor of the Exchequer, many times--the ``theory of \nholes.'' What is the ``theory of holes''? The Senator from North Dakota \nhas heard me say this more than a few times. He has probably used this \nline a time or two as well: When you find yourself in a hole, stop \ndigging. We are in a hole. It is time to stop digging.\n  Whenever any of us come to the floor and we say we want to cut taxes, \neven though we know it is going to increase the deficit, we ought to \nhave an offset for it. When any of us come to the floor and say we want \nto increase spending on our favorite program, however meritorious, we \nought to come with an offset. We ought to come up with a way to have no \neffect on the budget deficit, which is already huge. And we can do it \nby either cutting spending somewhere else or we can do it with respect \nto raising some revenues somewhere else.\n  But these pages in front of me, I do not know how old you guys and \ngals are--probably 15, 16 years old--you are juniors in high school. \nSomeday somebody is going to have to pay the debt. Someday these \nchickens are going to come home to roost. They probably are not going \nto come home on my generation. They are probably going to come home on \nyour generation. You guys and gals are the same age as my own children. \nIt is not fair. It is not fair to you.\n  We should simply decide to set aside some of the rancor that goes on \naround here, and with Democrats who have good ideas, and Republicans \nwho have good ideas, and the White House that has some good ideas, take \nthat collection of ideas, which includes, as far as I am concerned, \nlooking at entitlement programs. I am never interested in savaging \nentitlement programs, but they should not be off limits either.\n  If some of them can be means tested, we should consider doing that. \nWe are going to have to do some things we as Democrats don't want to do \nand some things Republicans and the White House don't want to do if we \nare going to make serious progress. We need to make serious progress \nbecause we have a serious problem. One way we can start is by adopting \npay as you go. It had a great road test for many years. We ought to put \nit in place today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3013\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself, \n     Mr. Feingold, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Obama, \n     Mr. Baucus, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Clinton, \n     Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Carper, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Chafee, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3013.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To fully reinstate the pay-as-you-go requirement through \n                                 2011)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PAY-AS-YOU-GO POINT OF ORDER IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any direct spending or revenue legislation that \n     would increase the on-budget deficit or cause an on-budget \n     deficit for any 1 of the 3 applicable time periods as \n     measured in paragraphs (5) and (6).\n       (2) Applicable time periods.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term ``applicable time period'' means any 1 \n     of the 3 following periods:\n       (A) The first year covered by the most recently adopted \n     concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (B) The period of the first 5 fiscal years covered by the \n     most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (C) The period of the 5 fiscal years following the first 5 \n     fiscal years covered in the most recently adopted concurrent \n     resolution on the budget.\n       (3) Direct-spending legislation.--For purposes of this \n     subsection and except as provided in paragraph (4), the term \n     ``direct-spending legislation'' means any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     affects direct spending as that term is defined by, and \n     interpreted for purposes of, the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (4) Exclusion.--For purposes of this subsection, the terms \n     ``direct-spending legislation'' and ``revenue legislation'' \n     do not include--\n       (A) any concurrent resolution on the budget; or\n       (B) any provision of legislation that affects the full \n     funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance \n     guarantee commitment in effect on the date of enactment of \n     the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.\n       (5) Baseline.--Estimates prepared pursuant to this section \n     shall--\n       (A) use the baseline surplus or deficit used for the most \n     recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and\n       (B) be calculated under the requirements of subsections (b) \n     through (d) of section 257 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 for fiscal years beyond \n     those covered by that concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (6) Prior surplus.--If direct spending or revenue \n     legislation increases the on-budget deficit or causes an on-\n     budget deficit when taken individually, it must also increase \n     the on-budget deficit or cause an on-budget deficit when \n     taken together with all direct spending and revenue \n     legislation enacted since the beginning of the calendar year \n     not accounted for in the baseline under paragraph (5)(A), \n     except that direct spending or revenue effects resulting in \n     net deficit reduction enacted pursuant to reconciliation \n     instructions since the beginning of that same calendar year \n     shall not be available.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the Members, \n     duly chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution, as the case may be.

The amendment I have sent to the desk is the pay-go \namendment. In many ways I believe this is the most important amendment \nto be considered today. This amendment would reestablish the budget \ndiscipline that worked so well in previous years, a rule that has been \nallowed to lapse by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Here is where we are. The debt of our country is skyrocketing. At the \nend of the first year of this Presidency, the debt stood at $5.8 \ntrillion. That year the President told us if we adopted his fiscal \nplan, he would have maximum paydown of the debt. In fact, he said if we \nadopted his strategy, we would virtually eliminate the debt. The \nPresident was wrong. The debt was not paid down. The debt was certainly \nnot virtually eliminated. Instead, the debt has skyrocketed. At the end \nof this year, they now tell us the debt will be $8.6 trillion. And if \nthe budget before us is adopted, by 2011 the debt will be $11.8 \ntrillion. It will have doubled on this President's watch. All of this \nis before the baby boomers retire. We are on an unsustainable course, \nand it must be changed. We need to do it as soon as we can.\n  On the question of pay-go, that simply says if you want more spending \non mandatory programs, you have to pay for it. If you want to have more \ntax cuts, you have to pay for them, or you\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\nhave to get a supermajority vote in the Senate. That is the pay-go \ndiscipline. It says, yes, you can have more tax cuts, but you have to \npay for them; you can have more spending on mandatory programs, such as \nMedicare and Social Security, but you have to pay for them. That is \nwhat pay-go is about.\n  Here is what Chairman Greenspan said:\n\n       All I'm saying is my general rule is I like to see the tax \n     burden as low as possible. And in that context, I would like \n     to see tax cuts continued. But, as I indicated earlier, that \n     has got to be, in my judgment, in the context of a pay-go \n     resolution.\n\n  We have not only heard that advice from the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, but from the respected Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group \nthat says deficits do matter, that the buildup of debt is \nunsustainable, and said this about pay-go:\n\n       Exempting tax cuts from pay-go does nothing to promote \n     fiscal discipline. It would neither control spending nor \n     shrink the deficit. All it would do is exempt any tax \n     legislation from fiscal scrutiny, regardless of the \n     circumstances. Such an enormous and unnecessary loophole \n     would not be wise policy given that deficits are back for as \n     far as the eye can see. Since spending and tax decisions both \n     have consequences for the budget, there is no good reason to \n     exempt either from enforcement rules.\n\n  I believe they have it exactly right. Our friends, having adopted an \nenormous loophole, say: You can have all the increased spending you \nwant, all the increased tax cuts you want, as long as they are in the \nbudget resolution. If they are in the budget resolution, they are \nexempt from pay-go.\n  Here is what has happened as a result. This chart goes back to 1990. \nWe had a strong pay-go rule in effect from 1991 until 2002. We climbed \nout of the deficit ditch during those years. In fact, we actually went \ninto surplus. In fact, we went into surplus to such an extent we \nstopped raiding Social Security trust funds to pay other bills.\n  Then our colleagues on the other side got control of the White House \nand both Houses of Congress, and they ended the pay-go rule. Look what \nhas happened. Surpluses were eliminated. We have plunged back into \ndeficit, bigger deficits than we had even back here.\n  That is what has happened without the discipline of pay-go. What we \nare saying today is, let's reinstitute the discipline of pay-go. Let's \ndo it now.\n  This chart shows how we would eliminate the loophole that currently \nexists. The current loophole put in place by our colleagues on the \nother side exempts all tax cuts and mandatory spending increases \nassumed in any budget resolution, no matter how much they increase \ndeficits. What we are offering today is the budget discipline, the pay-\ngo rule that worked so effectively in the past. It says all mandatory \nspending and tax cuts that increase deficits must be paid for or \nrequire a supermajority, 60 votes, in the Senate. That is what we ought \nto do.\n  This is what has happened in terms of deficit increases when we had \nthe budget pay-go loophole that is currently in effect. In 2006, $12.5 \nbillion allowed under the Senate GOP budget with their pay-go loophole. \nIn 2007, $36 billion of additional deficit allowed. In 2007 to 2011, \nalmost $214 billion is going to be permitted, if we don't shut it down.\n  I hope my colleagues will adopt the pay-go rule, the budget \ndiscipline that has worked so well in the past. It is critically \nimportant that we do that. This is our opportunity. For those who say \nthey are fiscally responsible, here is your chance. You are going to be \nable to prove with one vote whether you are serious about doing \nsomething about these runaway debts and runaway deficits or whether it \nis all talk. This is going to be the chance. This will be a vote that \ntests whether Members are willing to stand up and take a tough vote and \nreimpose the budget discipline that has worked so well in the past.\n  I ask what the time situation is.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  If there are others who want to speak on pay-go, this is an \nopportunity. We have hopefully a few minutes left on this amendment \nbefore we go to the next one. We have been taking time so far this \nmorning off the resolution. Perhaps when the chairman returns, we can \nmake an arrangement to take additional time off the amendment as well \nso we can keep on our schedule.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 5 minutes \nSenator Feingold used be attributed to the amendment and taken off the \namendment time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Chair could inform me how much time is left on our \nside on the amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And how much time remains on the other side on the \namendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 28 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the pay-go amendment. \nPay-go is a term that has sort of taken on a motherhoodlike atmosphere \naround here. There are some terms which occur in the legislative \nprocess or in the political arena that become perceptionwise different \nthan what they are in substance. The perception becomes the issue \nversus the substance.\n  Pay-go has taken on that sort of status because it sounds like \nsomething that makes sense. But to be honest, what pay-go is is a tax \nincrease. It is that simple. The way this amendment is structured, it \nguarantees a tax increase. Rather than saying they are for tax \nincreases, they are saying they are for pay-go. In fact, the last chart \nthe Senator referred to which showed very large numbers in this bill \nwhich he didn't call taxes were just that--taxes.\n  If you want to adjust those numbers, you are going to have to raise \ntaxes by the $214 billion he cited in that chart. So pay-go is a \nstalking horse for a tax increase. It is really that simple. It is also \ntechnically not an appropriate approach, and this is why.\n  CBO scores things around here, and CBO basically drives the decisions \nof the budget process because what the Congressional Budget Office says \nis what the baseline is; in other words, how much a program will cost \nin the outyears, how much tax revenue will occur in the outyears as a \nresult of a tax proposal. But CBO uses different standards for \ndifferent groups of spending and taxes. For discretionary spending, \nthey have one set of standards. For entitlement spending, they have \nanother set of standards. For tax revenues and tax cuts, they have \nanother set of standards.\n  So when you create this pay-go language, which the Democratic side is \noffering, you are creating a one-size-fits-all and applying it to \ndifferent accounting systems, and it produces perverse effects. The \nmost perverse effect is it basically means you have to raise taxes, but \nyou will never actually impact entitlement spending.\n  Why is that? Because under the way CBO works, they say entitlement \nprograms never end. It is amazing. You can have an entitlement which \nhad an authorization life of, say, 10 years, but CBO would score it as \nif it went on forever, never sunsets, never is perceived by CBO as \nhaving to be reduced or in any way adjusted. That is the decision they \nhave made in scoring entitlements.\n  On the tax side, however, they take the exact opposite approach. If \nyou have a tax cut which is authorized for 5 years or 10 years, at the \nend of the 5 years or 10 years, they presume that tax cut is followed \nby a tax increase and, as a result, they presume there has to be more \nincome coming in because taxes will go up.\n  The practical effect of that is that this pay-go proposal will never \nactually be applied to an entitlement that already exists, but it will \nalways be applied to a tax cut that already exists,\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\nwhich results in tax cuts being significantly prejudiced by this \napproach because it is a one-size-fits-all approach.\n  If CBO were to change its scoring mechanisms and say that \nentitlements didn't go on forever, then it would be logical to have \nthis type of an approach--potentially logical--because then you would \nactually have to pay for entitlements and you would have to pay for tax \ncuts. But under this proposal, that is not the case. Under this \nproposal, only tax cuts would have to be adjusted and paid for and \nwould be affected by pay-go, and it would essentially be, therefore, a \ntax increase mechanism. So when our colleagues vote for this, they are \nvoting for tax increases. It is that simple.\n  Another problem with this technical problem is it again goes to CBO \nscoring. For example, under the CBO scoring, CBO uses capital gains as \na revenue loser. It does not score capital gains for the dynamic effect \nit has on the economy. When we cut capital gains rates--it has been \nproven every time we have done it--we generate revenue. Why is that? It \nis called human nature, and human nature usually overwhelms \naccountants. They just sometimes cannot handle the concept of human \nnature, but human nature goes to work when you cut the capital gains \nrates because when somebody owns an asset and has owned it for a while, \nit is an asset which they know if they sell they are going to have to \npay 30 percent taxes on. Then we cut the tax rate on that asset to 15 \npercent, if they sell it, and there is an incentive for them to sell \nthat asset and to reinvest those dollars in something that is probably \nmore productive. But if the tax rate stays at 30 percent, there is no \nincentive for them to go out and make that sale because they recognize \nthey are going to pay a very high level of taxes on it. So assets get \nlocked up. Stocks that might be sold get locked up, investments in real \nestate that might be converted get locked up, small businesses that \nmight be converted get locked up, and farms that might be sold get \nlocked up because the incentive to sell is reduced by the high level of \ntaxes.\n  So when we cut capital gains rates, which is what we have done, we \ncreate this huge infusion of economic activity. People start to sell \nassets which they wouldn't otherwise have sold, and that generates \nincome to the Federal Government because taxes are being paid that \nwould not have been paid before and there would be no tax revenue \ncoming in because people would sit on these assets. We generate a tax \nevent.\n  More important, the money which was invested in that asset is \nreinvested and, by human nature, it is reinvested in something that, to \nthe person doing the investing, is going to be more productive. By \ncreating more productive investments, we end up creating more economic \nactivity, more jobs--many more jobs--and, as a result, once again, we \ngenerate more revenue to the Federal Government.\n  A capital gains cut actually generates a lot of revenue. We see on \nthis chart that CBO--the blue line--simply is not willing to score that \ntype of economic activity, the real economic activity, the actual \neconomic activity generated from capital gains cuts. We have had a huge \ninfusion of revenues into the Federal Treasury as a result of the \ncapital gains tax, huge--$60 billion, $75 billion, $81 billion.\n\n  What happens is CBO uses these artificially low numbers to score that \ncapital gains cut even though capital gains is paying for itself. If \nthey used the accurate numbers, then pay-go wouldn't even apply to a \ncapital gains cut because capital gains would pay for itself. It would \npay for itself because it would generate so much revenue. But CBO \nscores it as a loser, even though it is a winner, so a capital gains \ncut is subject to the perverse approach under the CBO scoring rules of \nhaving to pay twice if you have pay-go in place. First, it would pay \nbecause it would generate the revenue to cover the cost of the cut, \nwhich CBO claims is a cost--it is not a cost; it is actually a revenue \nwinner--and then it would have to pay on the presumption it was going \nto cost money, when, in fact, it is not going to cost money, and then \nyou have to find revenues to cover it.\n  There is a perverse accounting mechanism working here if we put pay-\ngo in place relative to items such as capital gains reductions. That is \na technical reason this proposal does not work.\n  The bottom line of this proposal is simple: It is a tax increase. The \nbasic engine of this proposal, the basic effect of this proposal would \nbe the engine to drive tax increases.\n  There is a fundamental disagreement between the two parties as to \nwhether we should have tax increases driven by an accounting mechanism \nor whether we should have them driven by policy. It may be we should do \nsome tax increases around here in certain areas. The Senator from North \nDakota has pointed out some loopholes that should be closed, and I am \nfor that. And he has suggested we should collect more taxes that are \nowed. I am for that, too. But I don't think we should use an accounting \nmechanism to basically repeal the capital gains rate and the dividends \nrate, which is the purpose of this amendment.\n  This amendment is targeted to two tax cuts: dividends and capital \ngains. And then later on, when the rates adjust, when the rate \nadjustment comes to an end, it will be targeted on rates. It is like a \nlaser beam aimed at those two issues. If it were to be in place today, \nit is unlikely we would have a capital gains rate or dividend rate at \nthe present levels.\n  The result, in my opinion, would be to chill the economic recovery \nbecause I think a huge part of our economic recovery has been these \nnumbers right here, capital gains activity: people realizing their \ngains, selling an asset, and reinvesting it in something more \nproductive, which creates economic activity, jobs, and revenue.\n  There is a fundamental disagreement here. This is a stalking horse \nfor a tax increase, in my opinion. It is doing it through a technical \nvehicle, but it is clearly going to have that result. If we were to put \na major new entitlement on the books, it would actually impact that, I \ngive it credit for that. But we already have on the books a pay-go \nwhich affects new entitlements--new entitlements. I would love to have \na pay-go that affects existing entitlements, and if they want to \nredraft the amendment to do that, I would be happy to take a look at \nthat.\n  The practical effect of this amendment is singular in purpose: It \nwill force a tax increase.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I could not disagree more. I could not \ndisagree more. Pay-go doesn't require a tax increase. This is just not \ntrue. What does pay-go say? Pay-go says if you want to have new \nmandatory spending, you have to pay for it. If you want to have new tax \ncuts--new tax cuts--you have to pay for them. That is what pay-go says. \nNowhere does it say anything about increasing taxes. The chairman is \njust wrong; it doesn't say that. It doesn't require that.\n  It does say if you want new mandatory programs, such as the new \nprescription drug benefit that was passed--if we had pay-go in effect \nat the time the new prescription drug program was offered, we would \nhave had to pay for it either through increased revenue or from cuts \nelsewhere. That is what pay-go says. It doesn't say there has to be a \ntax increase. That is just a red herring argument. Frankly, I am \nsurprised the chairman makes it.\n  Here is what the chairman used to say about pay-go not so very long \nago. In 2002, the chairman, who now argues against pay-go, said this:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program or you \n     are going to cut taxes during a period, especially of \n     deficits, you must offset that event so that it becomes a \n     budget-neutral event that also lapses.\n\n  That is what the chairman said in 2002 when he was an advocate for \npay-go. He went on to say:\n\n       . . . If we do not do this, if we do not put back in place \n     caps and pay-go mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline \n     in this Congress, and, as a result, we will dramatically \n     aggravate the deficit which, of course, impacts a lot of \n     important issues, but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  That was the chairman 4 years ago, and he was absolutely right in his \nsupport of pay-go then and in his recognition that pay-go was essential \nto budget discipline. He was right. He wasn't talking about requiring a \ntax increase then. This is a new argument which has been concocted to \ntry to derail putting back the budget discipline which is absolutely \nneeded.\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\n  Pay-go doesn't require anything unless you try to increase mandatory \nspending, in which case you have to pay for it or get a supermajority \nvote. It doesn't do anything to taxes unless you try to cut taxes \nwithout paying for it. That is what pay-go does. There is no \nrequirement of a tax increase here; there is a requirement we start \npaying for programs.\n  When--when, I ask--are we going to start paying for things around \nhere instead of just increasing the spending, cutting the taxes, and \nrunning up the debt? Because that is what we are doing. Since pay-go \nlapsed, the deficits and the debt have exploded. This is an opportunity \nto begin the process to rein in the growth of deficits and debt. That \nis what pay-go is about, and that is why it should be supported today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me briefly respond to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I was right then, and I am right now. Times change and \ndynamics of what is happening around here change substantively.\n  The only thing that will be impacted by this pay-go amendment, if it \nis adopted, is tax increases. That is it, because there isn't a major \nnew entitlement being proposed. In fact, as I mentioned before, the way \nthe scoring occurs around here, all the entitlements will continue.\n  These are the entitlements that are exempt: Food Stamp Program, TANF, \nCommodity Credit Corporation, veterans compensation, child care, State \nchildren's health, rehabilitation services, ground transportation, \nFederal unemployment insurance, child nutrition, and the list goes on \nof entitlement accounts exempt from the Senator's pay-go and pay-go \ngenerally. There is a pay-go in the bill.\n  What isn't exempt is the fact if this were in place today, capital \ngains and dividends would be subject to it. And that is totally \ninconsistent because capital gains, as I pointed out--what happened to \nmy chart? Somebody took it down, I guess as a courtesy to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota because this is such a devastating chart and he \ndidn't want it to undermine his arguments.\n  As this chart points out definitively, the money is in the bank, or \nat least it is in the Federal Treasury until we spend it. We are \ngenerating huge amounts of revenues from capital gains. Under this pay-\ngo amendment, were it in place, you would have to pay for capital gains \nbecause CBO does not score it relative to what it actually does.\n\n  The next event to which this is going to apply is the death tax, if \npay-go is in place. That is the only thing it will impact in this \nbudget window over the next 5 years because the only thing that is \nplanned in this next 5 years will be the death tax and the rates, and \nit will be used as the club to generate tax increases. That is all it \nis for in the context of today.\n  You look over this 5-year window of what this budget says, you take \nthis pay-go language and lay it over that 5-year window, and the only \nthing it will impact is taxes, and it will basically be used as a \nlever, as a club, to raise taxes. It shouldn't be called pay-go, it \nshould be called tax-go. The Senator from North Dakota made this case \nfor us when he held up his chart that showed all these bars--and he \ndidn't identify what they were--of numbers that this budget allegedly \ndoesn't cover that are losses of revenue, according to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, because we have cut taxes. He didn't actually say they \nwere loss of revenue from tax cuts, he used some other term for it. I \ndon't know what the term was, but he had one bar that was $216 billion. \nWell, that is death taxes, rate cuts, dividends and interest, for the \nmost part.\n  There might also be some R tax credits in there and some State and \nlocal deductibility. So it is ironic, to say the least, that they would \nclaim that this is a balanced approach.\n  Another ironic thing is we have heard the Senator from North Dakota \nand other Members come to the floor and say the AMT is an outrage, the \nalternative minimum tax. Well, I haven't heard them suggest how they \nare going to pay for fixing the AMT, but under their amendment, they \nwould have to, and that is an $800 billion hole. I happen to think we \nshould fix the AMT, and we should fix it in the context of revenue \nneutrality. But I don't see any amendments floating around here, and I \nhaven't seen any amendments floating around here to accomplish that.\n  So I don't see how you can argue anything other than the fact that \nthis proposal, as it is presented, has one fundamental impact: and that \nwill be that over the next 5 years any attempt to extend any tax cut \nwill be put to a 60-vote point of order and will be, therefore, \npressure to raise taxes. It will be pressure to raise taxes to do that \nextension. It will have no impact on anything else because there are no \nnew entitlement programs planned in this bill. And because CBO scores \nall entitlements that already exist as going on forever, they won't be \nhit by this proposal.\n  So as I said earlier, it is a one-size-fits-all proposal that \ndisadvantages tax cuts. The irony is the tax cuts that pay for \nthemselves, such as capital gains and dividends cuts, which generate \neconomic activity, which generate income, will end up having to be paid \nfor twice. That really doesn't make any sense, and it will be driven by \nan accounting mechanism. I don't think policy should be driven by an \naccounting mechanism when it is so unfairly applied where it basically \nimpacts tax policy one way and entitlement policy another way. I would \nrather see something that was fair. But, in any event, I don't support \nthis because it is a tax increase mechanism.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the chairman keeps repeating himself: this \nis a tax increase. You can use the words, you can repeat it 100 times, \nit doesn't make it true. It is not a tax increase. Pay-go very simply \nsays: if you want to increase or create a new mandatory spending \nprogram, you have to pay for it. You don't have to pay for it with a \ntax increase, you can pay for it by cutting other spending. If you want \nto have more tax cuts, you can have them, but you have to pay for them, \neither through cutting spending or raising other taxes. That is what \npay-go says. That is what pay-go does. It restores a budget discipline \nthat is desperately needed.\n  The chairman says they have pay-go. They have a figment of pay-go \nbecause their pay-go exempts all tax cuts and mandatory spending \nincreases that are assumed in any budget resolution, no matter how much \nthey increase the deficit. The record is very clear. What has happened \nwith weakened pay-go? What has happened?\n  Let's go back. Pay-go was put in place right here, and we climbed out \nof the deficit ditch and we actually achieved budget surpluses. When it \nwas weakened, here is what happened: surpluses were eliminated, we \nplunged back into deficit, and the debt is skyrocketing.\n  That is the choice before the body. Do we really want to continue on \nthis path of running up the debt of the country to record levels? That \nis the course we are on.\n  I would again remind my colleague of what he said in previous years. \nBack in 2002 the distinguished chairman, in floor debate, said this \nabout pay-go:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program, or \n     you are going to cut taxes during a period, especially of \n     deficits, you must offset that event so that it becomes a \n     budget-neutral event.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If we do not do this, if we do not put back in place caps \n     and pay-go mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline in \n     this Congress.\n\n  He was right then. He continued:\n\n       And, as a result, we will dramatically aggravate the \n     deficit which, of course, impacts a lot of important issues, \n     but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  The chairman argues on one tax type alone. He argues on capital \ngains. Let me say that CBO has reviewed that question, and they wrote a \nletter to the chairman of the Finance Committee that said this:\n\n       After examining the historical record, including that for \n     2004, we cannot conclude that the unexplained increase in \n     capital gains tax revenue is attributable to the change in \n     capital gains tax rates.\n\n  This is after their careful analysis. I would acknowledge the \nchairman's chart that shows increased capital gains tax receipts higher \nthan previously projected. CBO has studied\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\nthis, and they say they can't attribute that to the lower rates. I \nthink most people would say the increased revenue is initially, in \npart, an effect of lower capital gains rates. But over time, a capital \ngains tax reduction loses revenue, not gains it. In other words, you \nget an initial bump, but after that you start losing it.\n       On the larger question of whether tax cuts pay for \n     themselves, we don't have to have a theoretical discussion. \n     We have what has happened in the real world.\n\n  In 2000, we collected over $2 trillion in revenue. Then we had the \nbig tax cuts of 2001, and our Republican colleagues and the President \nall assured us: Don't worry, that will generate more revenue.\n  Well, guess what. It didn't. That is the problem with their argument. \nIt didn't work. It failed, and it failed miserably.\n  In 2001, we had almost $2 trillion in revenue, big tax cuts, and the \nrevenue went down; in 2002, less revenue than 2001; in 2003, less \nrevenue than in 2001; in 2004, less revenue than in 2001. We didn't get \nback to the revenue base we had in 2000 until 2005. In real terms, we \nare nowhere close to the revenue base we had in 2000. We are nowhere \nclose because this ideological argument failed in the real world. That \nis a fact. It failed. It didn't work.\n  One of the reasons we have runaway deficits and debts is our \ncolleagues have just been wrong. They bet the farm on a concept that \ndidn't work in the real world. Now the question is, Do we do something \nto reestablish budget discipline, or don't we? I hope we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time is left on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from North Dakota has \n5 minutes. The Senator from New Hampshire has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me simply respond to some of the things \nthe Senator said.\n  We haven't seen a budget plan from the Democratic side of the aisle \nfor the last 2 years. In fact, even when they were in control of the \nSenate, we didn't get a budget across the floor from the other side of \nthe aisle. I think one of the reasons is because they would have to \nopenly admit to the fact that what they are basically saying, in \nlanguage which is not specific but which is clear, is that they are \ngoing to raise taxes, that they want to raise taxes, and pay-go is just \na stalking horse to accomplish that. It is that simple. The facts are \nvery clear.\n  If you take this pay-go language and you template it over this \nbudget, there are no entitlements that are going to be impacted. None. \nBut there are taxes that are going to be impacted: specifically, \ncapital gains, dividends--if they aren't addressed in this \nreconciliation package that is still being worked on--and the death \ntax.\n  I think most people in this country know that when their rates go up, \nthey are getting a tax increase. And the effect of the pay-go language \nwill be that if you get to the time when the rates have to be extended, \nthe pay-go language will either force them to go up or force taxes to \nbe raised somewhere else. It will be basically a major club used for \nthe purpose of defeating the maintenance of things like the capital \ngains rate, dividend and interest rate, the dividend rate, and the \ndeath tax. That is the purpose, and it couldn't be any clearer from the \nfacts.\n  I wish the Senator would present a budget because I think if he did, \nyou would see that. Clearly, he hasn't addressed how they are going to \ndo AMT. That amendment has been offered from their side. It was in \ncommittee, and it is, I presume, going to be offered again before we \nfinish. Are they going to offset that with tax increases, that almost \n$1 trillion tax event? If they are going to stick to their language, \nthey should. I don't think they will. So there is a different standard.\n  The point is obvious. This language, as it is presently structured, \nbecause of the facts that we have before us, which is a 5-year budget \nwhich has no new entitlements in it, and because CBO scores \nentitlements as going on forever and therefore they are never impacted \nby this pay-go language, this pay-go language will not affect the \nspending side of the ledger at all. But it will affect the tax side of \nthe ledger. And when the death tax needs to be extended, this pay-go \nlanguage will require a tax increase. When rates need to be extended, \nthis pay-go language will require a tax increase. When dividends and \ninterest, dividends and capital gains, should they not be extended in \nthis reconciliation agreement need to be extended, this pay-go will \nrequire a tax increase, and that is the purpose of this.\n  This concept that CBO writes us back and says: Well, we can't really \nfigure out that the capital gains cut generated capital gains income, \nthat is one of the problems here. The CBO is taking a very strict \ngreen-eyeshade approach to budgeting. The way they build their \nbaseline, they use four or five different major assumption groups. The \nassumption group they use for entitlement, the assumption group they \nuse for taxes is entirely opposite and unfair and disproportionately \nimpacts the capacity to do anything on the tax side of the ledger \naround here. And this amendment, if it were agreed to, would lock in \nthat unfairness.\n  Clearly, capital gains generate revenue. Now, maybe the Senator from \nNorth Dakota wants to repeal the capital gains rate. He is saying in \nthe outyears they don't generate revenue, they lose revenue. I happen \nto think they create a great deal of capital activity and investment \nand people are willing to take risks because they have a tax rate that \nis reasonable.\n  In the industrialized world, in major industrialized countries, we \nstill have one of the highest rates of taxation on capital there is. \nMost industrial nations don't even tax capital formation because they \nrecognize it creates jobs. We do, and the rate we have is reasonable, \nin my opinion. But if the Senator from North Dakota wants to raise it \nbecause he thinks in the outyears it is a revenue loser--fine. Say so. \nOffer a budget that does that. I would be happy to debate that rather \nthan move under the terminology that is misleading, this motherhood \nterminology of pay-go, which is nothing more than ``tax-go'' in the way \nit will be applied to this bill and to the next 5 years. Obviously I \noppose this amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, again the chairman repeats over and over \nthat this requires a tax increase. He is wrong. No colleague should be \nfooled by that rhetoric. It requires new mandatory spending to be paid \nfor. You can pay for things one of two ways: You could do it with a tax \nincrease. You could also do it by spending cuts.\n  The same is true of new tax reductions. Under pay-go, you have to pay \nfor them. You could pay for them with tax increases elsewhere, but you \ncould pay for them by reducing spending elsewhere. The chairman seems \nto have forgotten that is the way pay-go works.\n  What the chairman is saying is he doesn't want to worry about \nincreases in the deficit and debt. What the chairman is saying is he \nwants to continue this pattern because this is what has happened under \nhis fiscal plan. The debt is skyrocketing: $5.8 trillion at the end of \n2001, $8.6 trillion at the end of this year, headed toward $11.8 \ntrillion if this budget is adopted.\n  What the chairman is saying is he doesn't want to worry about paying \nfor tax cuts or more spending. He wants to continue to charge up the \ncredit card. He wants to continue sending this debt to our kids and our \ngrandkids. He wants to be free to take the easy political course, that \nis saying we can have new spending, such as the new prescription drug \nplan, and not pay for it; that we can have more tax cuts even though we \nare deep in deficit and not pay for them. That is the position he is \ntaking. If we want to be clear here, that is what this debate is about. \nDo you want to stay on this reckless course of running up the debt? And \nthe chairman says, not only with his speech here today and his position \non pay-go here today, but with his budget, that he wants to run up the \ndebt. He wants to take no responsibility to either reduce spending or \nto pay for more tax cuts. Instead, he prefers to send the bill to our \nkids and our grandkids. Let the foreigners continue to loan us the \nmoney so they can buy up U.S. assets. That is his position.\n  I think that is a reckless position. I think that is a position that \nweakens America. I think that is a position that makes us more \nvulnerable. I take the chairman back to the position he took\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\npreviously on pay-go. At that point he was right. In 2002, he argued \nfor pay-go and he said then:\n\n        . . . if we do not do this, if we do not put back in place \n     caps and pay-go mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline \n     in this Congress and, as a result, we will dramatically \n     aggravate the deficit which, of course, impacts a lot of \n     important issues but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  That is what he said then. He was right then and it is the right \nposition now. If you don't have this budget discipline, you are going \nto continue on this path and this course of running up the debt. That \nis what the chairman's budget does. It is precisely what we should not \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota \ntelling us what I am saying. I do wish the Senator from North Dakota \nhad brought forward a budget so we could see what he is saying and what \ntheir side thinks they should do. Right now their budget is a blank \npiece of paper as an overall document, and it has been for the last few \nyears. But if we look at what they did in committee, I think you can \nget an idea. They proposed amendments which would have increased \ndiscretionary spending by almost $19 billion and mandatory spending by \n$127 billion. That is a lot of new spending. And they raised taxes by \nabout $130 billion. That is a lot of new taxes. So there is no \ndiscipline on their side of the aisle relative to controlling the rate \nof growth of this Government. In fact, just the opposite. They want to \nexpand the rate of growth significantly and they want to raise taxes on \nthe American people to accomplish that. That has always been their \nposition and we are going to see amendment after amendment offered to \nthis budget which will essentially increase spending.\n  We have already got a few in line here. I think Senator Kennedy is \ngoing to offer one for $6.5 billion as the next amendment, or one of \nthe coming amendments here. There are others coming down the pike. They \nare all going to be paid for by raising taxes.\n  The position of the other side of the aisle on this, although they \nmanage to keep it a little foggy because they don't put forward their \nown budget, is pretty clear. They want to increase and grow the size of \nthis Government significantly and they want to raise taxes to do that.\n  What the pay-go amendment does is raise taxes. You can't deny this. \nThere are only three items of any significance that they are going to \nimpact in this budget. My budget has no new entitlement spending in it \nso pay-go won't apply to any entitlement spending. It has a lot of \nentitlement spending presumed in it because entitlement spending is, of \ncourse, a big part of the budget. But none of that entitlement spending \nis affected by pay-go because, as a practical matter, pay-go will be \nexempting those entitlement accounts.\n  This reflects what were the amounts of tax increases offered from the \nDemocratic side in committee when we marked this bill up: $133 billion, \nand the amount of new spending, $127 billion. It puts in stark terms \nhow much new spending was proposed in committee by the Democratic \nmembership, and new taxes.\n  Now they want to use this vehicle of pay-go to essentially repeal the \ntax cuts. That is what they are trying to do. The only items, as I \nmentioned, that are going to be impacted by this pay-go language will \nbe the extension of the tax cuts. What tax cuts will need to be \nextended in the next 5 years? There are the rates, there are capital \ngains and dividends, and there is the death tax. Those are the big \nones. Also maybe State and local deductibility in that category; I am \nnot sure. That may be extended further than this window. But in any \nevent, those are the big ones.\n  They are saying to a person whose rates go up: Your rates are either \ngoing to go up or taxes are going to have to be raised somewhere else \nto keep them at their present level. This argument that you are going \nto cut spending around here, and to raise taxes--I would love to see \nthe other side of the aisle come forward with that proposal. I might be \nwilling to do that and there might be two other people on this side of \nthe aisle who might be willing to do that, but I have not seen a \nproposal from the other side of the aisle to cut spending anywhere.\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota argues that this budget adds enormously \nto the debt. It adds a lot less to the debt than anything the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has presented because he is not willing to freeze \nnondefense discretionary spending. He has not put forward a budget that \nreduces debt.\n  What this budget at least does is put in place discipline on the \ndiscretionary side of the ledger. It sets a cap--$873 billion. As long \nas you have that cap you have something around here to enforce so you \ncan limit spending. It doesn't do as much as I would like to do on the \nentitlement side, but at least it puts in place a mechanism for us to \nhave a point of order should entitlement spending get out of control--\nshould more than 45 percent of an entitlement account, which is \nsupposed to be an insurance account, end upcoming out of the general \ntreasury--and I understand they are going to try to repeal that point \nof order. And then they claim they are for budget discipline?\n  The inconsistency of their position is reflected by the facts on the \nground and the facts on the ground are pretty clear. The only thing \nthis pay-go amendment will affect is taxes and it will force tax \nincreases and it will make the extension of the tax cuts much more \ndifficult to accomplish, which will be a tax increase.\n  If your rates go up, if your tax rates go up, that is a tax increase. \nI think everybody in America probably understands that. You can call it \npay-go if that is the term you want to use. If that is the new term we \nare going to use around here for raising taxes, we will call it pay-go \nand I guess that is what they want to say. When you raise taxes around \nhere, we will call it pay-go.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the chairman says we have offered no \nbudget. The chairman well knows the majority has the responsibility to \noffer a budget. Our responsibility is to critique that budget. We have \ndone so by pointing out that this is the effect of the chairman's \nbudget. It increases the debt every year by over $600 billion. That is \nthe budget that has been offered by the majority. When we were in \ncontrol, they didn't offer alternative budgets.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is because you didn't offer a budget.\n  Mr. CONRAD. They didn't offer alternative budgets.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am afraid I have only got a minute left.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will give you another minute if you want to yield on \nthat point.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to complete my thought and finish.\n  Over all the years when we were in control, Republicans did not offer \nalternative budgets.\n  With respect to what we did in committee, every amendment we offered \nwas paid for. The Senator is entirely correct. We offered amendments \nwith revenue of $133 billion and with increased spending of $126 \nbillion. So we paid for every amendment. We didn't pay for it with tax \nincreases. We paid for it by closing the tax gap, money that is owed \nthat is not being paid, which the revenue commissioner has said could \nbe collected.\n  I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for 30 seconds also.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let's take a minute and a half.\n  Mr. GREGG. Take a minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We ask unanimous consent for a minute apiece.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And we offered to close tax loopholes, these egregious \ntax loopholes that we have pointed out repeatedly. That is not a tax \nincrease. It is more revenue. It is not a tax rate increase on anyone.\n  But that gets us back to the fundamental question of, What is the \ndirection we are going to take? Are we going to continue to run up the \ndebt of the country, as the chairman proposes? Or are we going to take \na new turn and go back to the budget disciplines that have worked in \nthe past? I urge my colleagues to go back to the budget disciplines we \nhave had in the past. If you\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\nwant to spend more money, you have to pay for it. If you want to have \nmore tax reductions, you have to pay for them. It is a simple \nprinciple. We have had it in the past. The chairman has endorsed it in \nthe past. It is the right course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think the Senator is making my case. \nBasically, he is admitting the fact that he is proposing to raise taxes \nby $133 billion. You can't do it the way he is reflecting. You are \ngoing to have to do it some other way. In fact, all his offsets raise \nabout $11 billion, according to the Finance Committee. The uncollected \ntaxes there--sure, we would like to get them, but CBO won't score them \nso we can't use it. The fact is the pay-go language is one way to \ngenerate a lot of new revenue because it will essentially say you can't \nextend the tax cuts and you are going to have to raise taxes \ndramatically if you do try to extend those tax cuts, so if you want to \nraise some big-time taxes around here you vote for this pay-go \nlanguage.\n  Simply as an aside, I have to say the reason we didn't offer a \nbudget, in response to the Senator, when they were in control of the \nSenate was because the last year they were in control of the Senate, \nthey didn't offer a budget themselves. They haven't offered a budget \nnow for 6 years, I think--maybe it is 5. We would love to have them \noffer a budget because then we would see very specifically this \nphilosophy which is reflected in the amendment process, which is one of \ngrowing the Federal Government, spending a lot more money and raiseing \na lot of taxes to do it.\n  Mr. President, I understand under the prior order the Senator from \nMissouri is to be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I speak in favor of the PAYGO amendment \nintroduced by my friend, and ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad. This amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, seeks to \nfully reinstate the pay-as-you-go requirement for direct spending and \nrevenue legislation in the Senate through 2011.\n  During the 1990s, the Senate's PAYGO rule worked well to reduce \nFederal deficits, and the rule is badly needed today. Back then, PAYGO \napplied equally to increases in mandatory spending and decreases in \nrevenue. It neither forced tax increases nor spending cuts but rather \nenforced fiscal balance and budget discipline. New spending or tax cuts \ncould only become law if they were offset or found 60 votes in support.\n  Unfortunately, the original PAYGO rules were abandoned to provide for \na series of unfunded tax breaks. Those tax breaks were not paid for by \nreductions in Federal spending and there was only one way to pay for \nthem--by increasing our deficit to historically high levels and \nborrowing more and more money. Now we have to pay for those tax breaks \nplus the cost of borrowing for them.\n  Instead of reducing the deficit, as some people claim, the fiscal \npolicies of this administration and its allies in Congress will add \nmore than $600 million in debt for each of the next 5 years. This \nbudget does nothing to reduce our deficits and, in fact, makes them \nworse.\n  Americans deserve better financial leadership. The people I talk to \nin Illinois are not fooled by what's going on. Working families \nunderstand that the same principles that apply to their family budgets \nshould apply to our national budget as well. They understand that, in \nthis life, you get what you pay for and if you don't pay for it today, \nit will cost you more tomorrow.\n  You don't have to be a deficit hawk to be disturbed by the growing \ngap between revenues and expenses. Americans are willing to share in \nthe hard choices required to get us back on track, as long as they know \nthat everyone is pulling their weight and doing their fair share. \nThat's why it is so important that we reinstate PAYGO in a way that \nmeaningfully enforces the budget discipline that both sides of the \naisle need in order to honestly tackle our country's short-term and \nlong-term fiscal challenges.\n  This is an important amendment at an important time for our country. \nI am pleased to once again join Senators Conrad and Feingold on this \namendment and to be part of a bipartisan group of cosponsors. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for fiscal responsibility and for good budget \nleadership. I urge my colleagues to support this PAYGO amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3011\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for arranging the debate on this amendment. I call up an \namendment we have at the desk, Talent-Lieberman amendment No. 3011.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Talent], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Thune and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3011.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To increase funding for defense)\n\n       On page 9, line 20, increase the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 21, increase the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Carper as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, this amendment is a rather simple one. It \nraises the number in the budget for defense up to what the \nadministration proposed. The budget resolution, as it came out of \ncommittee, would have reduced the amount of money requested for \nnational defense by $3 billion. This restores that. It is in my \njudgment, as I said often on the Senate floor, not all we need to do \nbut it is a first step.\n  We have to understand context here. The number the President \nsubmitted was itself almost $4 billion the President submitted was \nitself almost $4 billion less than what only a year and half ago the \nPresident and the administration said they would need for fiscal 2007.\n  Under the pressure from the Office of Management and Budget, the \nDepartment of Defense has had to reduce its request for the last 2 \nfiscal years by an amount totaling almost $10 billion and, at the same \ntime, has reduced the amount it said it is going to request for the \nnext 5 years by almost $670 billion--this while we are in a war and \nthis while our responsibilities around the world and even outside the \nglobal war on terror have never been greater is a mistake.\n  I think the first step to correcting that mistake is to pass this \nbipartisan amendment and restore at least what the President has \nrequested for fiscal 2007.\n  Let me give some history, some context. We need to go back to the \nearly 1990s and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n  At that time, there were concerns about the budget as well and the \nGovernment took those concerns out on the national defense. All \nthroughout the 1990s, the Defense budget shrunk. It was the only part \nof the budget that shrunk. There were some years it shrunk in normal \ndollars, not even just as against inflation. There was a belief at the \ntime of the collapse of the Soviet Union that we were in an era of \npeace and we would not need to spend as much on the national defense. \nCertainly, that was true with regards to certain parts of the national \ndefense. Unfortunately, it turned out not to be true with the Defense \nbudget. I will explain that in a minute.\n  First, in order to accommodate those shrinking budget there were \nreductions in the force structure. The number of people we have in the \nDepartment was cut across the board by anywhere from a quarter to a \nthird.\n  The problem with that is we anticipated we would need the men and \nwomen in America's military less with the collapse of the Soviet Union, \nbut it turns out that we needed them more. It turned out that history \nhad not ended--it had been frozen during the time of the Cold War, and \nit thawed out with a vengeance. All the regional and ethnic rivalries \nthat had been submerged in the bipolar nature of the Cold War era came \nto the surface. We had to deploy our men and women in conventional \nexercises of one kind or another far more in the 1990s than we\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\nhad to do in the Cold War decades in the years before.\n  What happens when you have fewer people and you use them more? You \nstress the force, you stress the people, you stress the equipment, you \nincrease the operation and maintenance budgets.\n  In an era when we thought we would be able to save money on defense, \nwe actually had to spend more, and increasingly the urgent crowded out \nthe important.\n  Money was put in O in order to keep the tip of the spear sharp, if \nyou will, while the rest of the spear rusted.\n  We took, for many years as a practical matter, a procurement holiday. \nWe did not buy the equipment we needed to buy to recapitalize the \nplatforms, which is what we in the Armed Services Committee call the \nweapons, the trucks, the support equipment that the men and women in \nAmerica's military use.\n  In the 15 years from 1975 to 1990, we typically bought 78 scout and \nattack helos. In the years from 1991 to 2000, we bought, on average, \nseven. Whereas, we would buy 2,083, tanks, artillery, and other armored \nvehicles; we bought, on average, 145. In some cases we acquired about \n10 percent of the platforms that we had bought in the 15 years previous \nto 1990. As a result, the capital equipment that the military is using \nis old.\n  Let us talk about some of our aircraft: B-52 bombers are 44 years \nold; C-130 transports, 33 years old; and KC-135 tankers, 43\\1/2\\ years \nold. I could give similar statistics for the other parts of the \nservices as well.\n  The number of ships we have is going down. In the 1980s we aimed at a \n600-ship Navy, and we are now below 300. If we continue at the current \nshipbuilding levels, we will get down to 200 or below. That is not \nconsistent with the national security of the United States.\n  But what happened? The Bush administration took over, and to their \ncredit, they raised Defense spending above inflation. There were modest \nincreases in the early part of this decade, and part of the hope was we \ncould recapitalize the infrastructure and make up for that procurement \nholiday. For a lot of reasons, that didn't happen. The operational \ntempo continued to grow.\n\n  We all know about the military employment level in the global war on \nterror. There has been what we call mission creep in other areas as \nwell. Think about the tsunami that occurred about a year and a half \nago. It was American military forces that were the structure through \nwhich we delivered that relief.\n  We have increased the homeland security mission, the international \nhumanitarian relief operation, special operations, ongoing training \noperations. The operational tempo was at a historic high, and that ate \nup a lot of the increases.\n  Personnel costs: We have great men and women in the military. They \nare very highly skilled people. There is no such thing as a ``grunt'' \nanymore in America's military. Today, you have highly skilled people, \nand we owe it to them, and we must pay them accordingly.\n  Personnel costs are now $17 billion more per year, adjusted for \ninflation than in 1999. Seventeen billion dollars more comes out of the \nhide of the rest of the budget.\n  China is 5 to 10 years ahead of schedule in what we figure would be a \nrearmament process. I am not saying China needs to become an enemy of \nthe United States. I hope that doesn't happen. I believe it need not \nhappen. But they are clearly attempting to develop a military \ncapability to exclude the United States from the Western Pacific, \nshould she choose to do so. And the thing that is more likely to \nencourage them in that ambition than anything else is the reality or \neven the perception of American weakness.\n  In addition, we now have the new generation of platforms coming on \nline. Remember, platforms are ships, planes, tanks, trucks, and other \nkinds of support equipment.\n  For the generation of platforms that the new generation of servicemen \nand women are going to be using to replace the old ones, it is \nessential that we complete the development of these programs and that \nwe buy out the platforms that we have proposed to buy. The DDX \ndestroyer and the Joint Strike Fighter combat systems, which is the \nheart of America's Army, its F-22, air-to-air superiority fighter, the \nnew aircraft carriers, the submarines which are essential to our \nnational defense strategy both for intelligence and also in the western \nPacific, all of these are coming online in the next few years.\n  Even with the President's submitted proposal, we cannot purchase the \nrequired new generation of platforms.\n  For all of these reasons, I have been urging for months--in fact, my \nadvocacy on this point goes back to 1993, when I was a new Congressman \nin the House--I have been warning that we needed to spend more on \ndefense.\n  I need to point out to the Senate that this is an obligation of the \nUnited States we cannot escape. It is similar to the basic capital \nassets of a company. You have to keep it up. It is not optional to \nallow the military equipment that our men and women use to age and \neventually to collapse. We are going to pay this bill. The longer we \nwait, the bigger the bill will be.\n  That is one of the reasons why the investments which the President \nhas proposed and which this Congress has provided in the last 5 years \nhave not been enough even to allow us to tread water. We have continued \nto slip backward because we did not do what we needed to do in the \n1990s.\n  What do we need to do now? There are a number of us on both sides of \nthe aisle who are proposing, first of all, to restore the number the \nPresident has proposed.\n  I would like to see us go above that in this fiscal year, about $3 \nbillion more than what the President has proposed. That is the amount \nthat the Department of Defense said it needed for fiscal 2007 in the \nfall of 2004. That was the last budget projection we got from the \nDepartment of Defense that was unaffected by the stricture of the OMB. \nI think we need to go to that point. I said that in speeches on the \nfloor of the Senate last fall. A number of us sent a letter to the \nPresident urging him to submit a budget at that number. That is about \n$443 billion apart from the spending on the Department of Energy that \nis also included in the defense budget.\n  Then I think we need to take next year for a searching and honest \nreview of what the Defense budget needs to be in the near future.\n  I am not the only one who has proposed that. There are a number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle and the Armed Services Committee \nwho suggest that we need a systematic increase in the Defense budget. \nIt is now about 3.7 or 3.8 percent of the gross domestic product.\n\n  Let me emphasize that. I don't want that figure to slip by without \npeople marking it.\n  We are spending about 3.8 percent of the gross domestic product on \nnational defense. That includes the supplemental, 3.8 percent in a time \nof war.\n  Whatever else is causing the deficit--and there are obviously \ndisagreements on the floor of this body, and we just witnessed an \neloquent debate highlighting those disagreements--whatever else is \ncausing it, the Department of Defense and military budget is not. That \nfigure is historically very low. It is much lower than the late 1970s \nwhen Jimmy Carter was President.\n  To try to save money on defense, to believe that you are saving money \nby reducing the Defense budget below the minimum, is a classic example \nof being pennywise and pound foolish because the bill comes due. We do \nnot have the option of not meeting our responsibilities in the world \ntoday.\n  The reality, the perception but much less the reality of American \nweakness encourages instability in the world. Instability in the world \nis antithetical to the kind of security that people need for economic \ngrowth. So I can put it on as low a level as possible. If we do not \nadequately support the national defense, we are certainly going to get \nourselves into bigger economic trouble.\n  American weakness leads to conflict abroad, conflict abroad can lead \nto war, and war is very bad for the national deficit.\n  So we need this searching review. We can have that. We can decide \nwhere we need to be structurally beginning next year. I think the Armed \nServices Committee is going to do that.\n  I want to close on a hopeful note. This is well within our \ncapability. This is a great nation, a strong nation.\n  If the Government will meet its obligations and do what it is \nsupposed to\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\ndo, the people will drive the prosperity of this country. They will \nproduce the wealth on which they depend, on which this Government \ndepends, to sustain those programs that are necessary to protect our \nsecurity and also help the weak and the helpless among us.\n  We had a funeral for President Reagan in the recent past. He laid in \nState. And I thought Members of both parties did a wonderful job \neulogizing him.\n  We should learn the lesson of history that his administration taught \nus. He understood the importance of American power in the world.\n  When he became President, we also had gone through a time when the \nforces had become hollow, when that shaft of the spear, if you will, \nhad rusted. President Reagan dealt with it decisively. He proposed two \ndouble-digit increases in the national defense, which the Congress \nsustained him on. And it was that action which was a key factor in \nwinning the Cold War because the rest of the world saw America's \ncommitment, America's willingness, America's strength, America's \nconfidence in the future and eventually decided that freedom and \ndemocracy was the future of the world because we were leading in that \ndirection. We were willing to make the commitment necessary to walk \nthat path.\n  Let us do the same thing today. This is a bipartisan amendment. \nSenator Lieberman and I are offering it.\n  I have been handed a note that Senator Graham wishes to be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that he be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. We can do this.\n  Yes, we have to resolve the other problems in the budget that are \ncausing the deficit, but defense is not that area. Defense has given at \nthe office. Now it is time to tend to American security and American \nneeds. For that reason, I offer the amendment. I hope the Senate will \nsustain it and support our men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. TALENT. Sure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will not argue with the Senator on the \nneed for this additional defense spending. My own view has been that \nwhat the President asks for at a time of war with respect to the \ndefense, we ought to provide. We ought to stand shoulder to shoulder \nwith the President at a time of war with respect to defense \nexpenditures.\n  What I do want to ask the Senator, how is he funding this increase? \nIs it correct that the Senator is paying for this increase with cuts in \nfunction 920?\n  Mr. TALENT. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Am I correct, then, in understanding that the Senator \nwould pay for this increase in defense in part by cutting homeland \nsecurity?\n  Mr. TALENT. The function 920, as I understand, is essentially the \noverhead across the board from a number of different agencies. So it \ncomes out of administrative overhead, travel, et cetera, and I believed \nthat funding these essential programs for the military was more \nimportant than that. So I challenge the agencies to find that funding \nto support this amendment.\n  It is similar to what has happened in the past. We had several \namendments last year that took substantial amounts out of function 920 \nin order to increase programs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, the Senator is \ncorrect; function 920 is the other discretionary accounts. So the \neffect of the Senator's amendment is to ``plus up'' defense, but he \ndoes so by cutting homeland security, cutting law enforcement, cutting \nveterans' benefits, cutting defense itself.\n  I say to my colleague, there is no new money here. This is taking out \nof one pot and putting it into the other pot. And one of pots that is \nbeing taken from is defense itself, homeland security, law enforcement, \nand others. My own assessment of cutting these function 920 accounts is \nthat it is kind of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I hope we do not do much \nof this in the process of writing this budget.\n  I support the underlying interest of the Senator in restoring the \ndefense money that was cut in the Committee on the Budget by the mark \nof the Committee on the Budget chairman. However, I alert my \ncolleagues, it is being paid for--are you willing to cut homeland \nsecurity and law enforcement, veterans, and other defense accounts?\n  Mr. TALENT. No. I am willing to ask all the agencies to sacrifice \ntravel budgets and expenses in order to fund the national defense.\n  I say again, this has happened in the past to support other important \nprograms. The Coleman amendment last year, for example, increased CDBG \nfunding by $2 billion with a function 920 offset. I am telling the \nSenator what he knows. The Senator is an expert on the budget.\n  So we have gone into administrative overhead in the past, where \nnecessary, to support important programs. I cannot think of anything \nmore important than giving the President at least what he has asked for \nfor national defense. This is a question of whether we will fund the \nnational defense in time of war at the President's request, at least.\n  Who has the floor, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded for a question. The \nSenator from Missouri still has the floor.\n  Mr. TALENT. Again, I thank the Senator and admire very much the \nsincerity with which he confronts these budgetary problems.\n  Perhaps in view of the Senator's question, it would be good for me to \nemphasize the point I made during the speech. There are certain \nfunctions of the Government which, if we do not perform at least at a \nminimal level, have the opposite effect that people want when they seek \nto reduce the deficit. This is one of them. These bills must be paid, \nand the longer we wait to pay them, the more they will cost.\n  For me, it is deja vu all over again. I said this in the 1990s. We \nwere successful as a Congress in the 1990s in the latter part of the \ndecade in getting more money into the budget above what the Clinton \nadministration requested, but we did not get enough in. So those bills \nwhich were not paid have accumulated, with compound interest, at very \nsubstantial amounts.\n  It is true that an increase which is slightly above inflationary \nrates, which would have been adequate if we had done it in the 1990s, \nis not adequate anymore. And if we do not do something of the nature I \nam talking about now--not just with this budget but next year's budget \nas well--then the bill will grow and grow and grow, and 2 and 3 and 4 \nyears from now, it will be even greater. My friend and the Senator from \nNew Hampshire are going to have an even bigger problem to confront in \ntrying to deal with the budget deficit.\n  It is not an option to not sustain the national defense. To the \nextent America is perceived as weak, much less to the extent that \nAmerica is weak, it promotes instability and conflict in the world. \nApart from the threat to human freedom, I will say to those who are \nconcerned about the budget, that is very bad for the deficit. That is \nreally negative for the deficit.\n  Let us sustain the national defense. I encourage the Senator to \ncontinue working with his friend and my friend from New Hampshire to \nsolve these other structural problems in the deficit and would be happy \nto support some bipartisan resolution. Let us not take it out on \ndefense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say this Senator agrees with the \nSenator on the need to deal with the fundamental defense needs of the \ncountry. I say to the Senator, I know it is his intention to be cutting \ntravel and overhead, but the way function 920 works is these will be \nacross-the-board cuts to the other domestic elements of the budget; \nthat is, homeland security will take a cut. They will decide where it \ngoes. The Committee on the Budget does not decide that. So homeland \nsecurity, in the programs themselves, may take reductions. That will be \nup to the Committee on Appropriations. Law enforcement will be cut to \npay for this increase in defense. Defense itself may well be cut to pay \nfor this increase in defense. Veterans programs will be cut, or at \nleast the veterans function will be cut.\n\n  I want my colleagues to understand how this works. Although I know it \nis the stated intention to cut overhead and to cut travel, that may \nwell not be\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nthe result here because the way function 920 works, there will be an \nacross-the-board cut to discretionary programs, and those accounts--and \nthis will be a decision by the appropriators, how they spread these \nreductions--will be the money used to pay for an increase in defense. I \nfind it a troubling approach in terms of the pay for--not the plus-up. \nThe Senator is correct to ask that we provide the funding the President \nhas requested in defense.\n  Let me say that one of the great concerns I have in these defense \naccounts going forward--and I say this to my colleague from Missouri, \nand I think the Senator referenced this--we have these systems which \nare aging, whether it is our bombers, our fighters, our ships in the \nNavy, our aircraft carriers. The tanker fleet is more than 40 years \nold, much of the bomber fleet is more than 40 years old, and many of \nour naval ships are reaching the end of their useful lives. So how are \nwe going to recapitalize the defense accounts? It will be one of the \ngreat challenges of our generation. I don't begrudge for a moment this \nincrease in defense. It will help us take on some of those very \nsubstantial challenges we will confront in the future.\n  We will have to do some thinking outside the box on how we will \nrecapitalize the force going forward. I am told by National Guardsmen \nthat much of the equipment they took to Iraq is never coming back. It \nis junk. The incredible heat, the combat conditions they have faced--\nmuch of this equipment is simply being eaten alive.\n  Mr. TALENT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. TALENT. Given the time available, I did not speak as long as I \ncould on this subject, but the Senator is referring to what the \nPentagon calls resetting the force. In other words, after a war, we pay \nthrough the supplementals for the equipment that is actually destroyed. \nBut a lot of the equipment is not destroyed; it is either left there or \nit suffers what a business would call accelerated depreciation. It \ncomes back, but it only has a few years of useful life.\n  The Senator is correct, we have that bill to deal with, as well.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have now talked to officials at the Department of \nDefense, I have talked to the leaders of the services, at least some of \nthem, about the daunting challenge we face for the future. My own view \nis we are probably going to have to think outside the box in terms of \nhow we fund recapitalization on the force going forward. It will \nbehoove us to begin thinking how we will take on those challenges.\n  I personally believe we will need to consider leasing or some other \nway of spreading costs instead of our current practices of paying for \nnew systems with cash on the barrelhead. I do not believe we are going \nto be able to recapitalize the force in the way we have in the past.\n  I thank the Senator for, on the one hand, the proposal on restoring \nsome of the proposed cuts here, but I am concerned about the way it is \nbeing paid for. I know the intention is to take it out of overhead. The \nway 920 works, we really do not know how it will be done. The fact is, \nthe budget resolution controls the numbers that will be given to the \nCommittee on Appropriations, but it does not tell them how to make the \nreductions. We do not control that. That is controlled in the \nappropriations process, as the Senator knows. The unintended \nconsequence might be that actually this increase in defense be paid for \nby reducing homeland security, law enforcement, veterans, and defense \nitself. Those are decisions which will be made by the appropriators. \nThat is why I wish that instead of paying for it in this way, we paid \nfor it in some other way that assured that it was not just taking out \nof one pocket and putting it in the other.\n  With that said, we need to restore this funding. We have a very \nserious problem going forward. Because of the burgeoning debt of the \ncountry and the deficits, defense is going to face very difficult \nchallenges in the future when we try to rebuild these aging systems \nwhich are critically important to our national defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. I think I had half an hour. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I will not take the whole 11 minutes. I \nwill do the Senate that favor, anyway.\n  First of all, the Senator is tremendously knowledgeable about the \nbudget. I respect very much what he is saying. I am pleased he \nrecognizes the importance of the underlying thrust of the amendment. My \nunderstanding is the function 920 line has about $11 billion in it, so \nwhat I am calling for is a reduction of about a quarter in our overhead \nexpenses, travel expenses. That has been done in the past in order to \nfund important programs.\n  We are in agreement that there is a shortfall in defense. Nothing is \nmore important across the board right now than sustaining at least the \nPresident's request. I argue, and perhaps will argue further in this \nprocess, that we need to do a little more this year, but we should at \nleast do this, and we can do this with a reduction in overhead that \noccurs all the time in the private sector. I think we should.\n\n  Now, the Senator mentioned various efficiencies we can use to make \nthe money go further. I have been a strong supporter of those on the \nArmed Services Committee. I think there are efficiencies we can gain in \nterms of leasing and other kinds of measures. I would not want to leave \nthe floor this morning leaving the Senate with the impression that is \ngoing to be enough to meet the obligations we have before us for \nnational defense and national security.\n  Remember, we are talking about the security of our homes, our \nfamilies, our jobs. Remember what the attack on 9/11 did to the \neconomy. We just saw numbers about how revenues were off in the early \npart of the decade. Well, that was not unrelated to the fact we were \nattacked. I am not saying we would not have been attacked had we been \nstronger throughout the 1990s; I am saying that right now, we are too \nfar out on a margin of risk. The further you go on that margin of risk, \nthe greater instability, the greater the lack of confidence in the \nworld, and that hurts our economy.\n  I said substantially the same thing a couple years ago when we were \ndebating the highway bill. I was arguing in favor of bonding for \ninfrastructure investment. Investment in defense, like investment in \ninfrastructure, is not an optional expenditure of the Government. We \nhave, if you want to look at it this way, a deficit in the national \ndefense. As bad as the budget deficit is, I would argue the deficit in \nthe national defense is worse because that deficit imperils both the \nnational security and the economic security of the United States.\n  So we need to make some tough decisions. I agree with the Senator \nwhen he says that. We can at least take this decision now. This \namendment is offered on a bipartisan basis. And this concern is \nbipartisan in the Armed Services Committee. When we had what we call \nour posture hearing, looking at the posture of defense, Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Dayton, Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman, and I all raised the \nissue of whether, going forward, we needed a structural increase in the \nnational defense.\n  We are not asking for that here. We are not asking for that this \nyear. We want to do a study of this issue. We want to look at it in a \nsearching and bipartisan way and then report back, I hope next year--\nearly next year--to the Senate on what we need to do. But right now, we \nneed at least to give the President what he has asked. I would hope we \ncould find a way to go a little further than that in this budget and \ngive the President what he asked for in the fall of 2004, before the \nOffice of Management and Budget got at the Defense projections. That is \nwhy I am offering the amendment.\n  I very much appreciate the spirit in which the Senator has responded. \nI hope he can stretch a point and perhaps find a ``yes'' vote for this \namendment, and then debate, in as bipartisan a fashion as possible, the \nother structural issues we are dealing with with the deficit.\n  I thank the Senate again, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to say to the \nSenator, I intend to support his amendment.\n  Mr. TALENT. I am very grateful.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Even though I think using section 920 is the wrong way to\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\ngo. The Senator indicated he has been informed there is $11 billion in \nthe 920 accounts. I just direct the Senator's attention to page 29 of \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget.\n  If the Senator would direct his attention there and go down the table \nto allowances, 920, I think the Senator would see there, in fact, is no \nmoney in section 920. In fact, section 920 is $500 million in the hole. \nThere is no $11 billion there. That is the problem we have. There is no \n$11 billion there. Section 920 is actually $500 million underwater. \nThis will just put it further underwater, which will require an across-\nthe-board cut in these other areas: homeland security among them, law \nenforcement, veterans benefits, defense. Actually, we do not know what \nthe appropriators will do. So I just say that for the information of my \ncolleagues, who may have some sense that there is money in this \naccount, that there really is not.\n  Mr. President, is the Senator prepared to yield back his time? \nBecause I would be willing to yield back our time in the interest of \ntrying to get back on schedule.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I am more than happy to yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back time on this \nside as well, so we can go to Senator Kennedy's amendment and try to \nget back on schedule as much as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time \non the pending amendment is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Massachusetts is now \nrecognized for the purpose of offering an amendment. Under the \nagreement, there will be 1 hour of time equally divided.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3028\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and the Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Menendez, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Ms. Collins, and Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3028.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To support college access and job training by: (1) restoring \n program cuts slated for vocational education, TRIO, GEAR UP, Perkins \n  Loans, and other student aid programs; (2) increasing investment in \n student aid programs, including increasing the maximum Pell Grant to \n $4,500; and (3) restoring cuts slated for job training programs; paid \n        for by closing $6.3 billion in corporate tax loopholes.)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $1,479,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $3,988,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $634,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $206,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $19,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $1,479,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $3,988,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, increase the amount by $634,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $206,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $19,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $6,326,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $1,479,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $3,988,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $634,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $206,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, increase the amount by $19,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 24, increase the amount by $6,326,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 25, increase the amount by $1,479,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 4, increase the amount by $3,988,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 8, increase the amount by $634,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 12, increase the amount by $206,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 16, increase the amount by $19,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 1, increase the amount by $6,326,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 2, increase the amount by $1,479,000,000.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment will provide $6.3 billion \nto restore the cuts in key student aid programs, vocational education, \nand job training, and increase investment in those programs by 15 \npercent. That is the total: $6.3 billion. To pay for these investments, \nwe close tax loopholes, laws that have no purpose, that allow corporate \ntax evasion. These offset provisions have been passed in the Senate on \nnumerous occasions and have not survived the conference. But they have \nbeen voted on and passed. So this amendment effectively pays for \nitself. That is enormously important.\n  These two charts indicate where the United States is internationally \nin the areas of math and science. The chart on the right shows that the \nUnited States has fallen behind in mathematics, and this other chart \nshows that American colleges and universities have fallen behind in the \ndevelopment of professionals in the natural sciences. That is \neffectively math, science, and engineering. If you look at this chart, \nit shows that in 1975, the United States was third in the world. If you \nlook at the year 2000, we are 15th in the world. Really, no one \ndisputes these findings and these conclusions.\n  I once again draw the attention of our Members to three excellent \nstudies. These three excellent studies, which have been done by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Engineering, and the \nInstitute of Medicine, all make the same case as these charts do and \nmake a number of recommendations. We have included a number of the \nrecommendations that these institutions which reviewed our education \nsystem have made in order that the United States continue to be a \nhighly innovative economy in the next 15 to 20 years. They make the \nvery strong and powerful case that by being an innovative economy, we \nare also going to be the strongest economic power in the world and also \nhave the strongest national security.\n  Education is key to our national security. This is ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm'', the report by the National Academy of Sciences. That \nreport was requested by our former Secretary of Education, Senator \nLamar Alexander, and Jeff Bingaman. It is an excellent study and \nreview. I am going to include just selected parts of these reports in \nmy remarks.\n  And now we have the report from the Council on Competitiveness which \nhas reached effectively the same judgment and decision as the National \nAcademies report. The Council on Competitiveness talks about \nrecommendations organized in three broad categories: education; \ntraining; and lifelong skill development, the continuation of training. \nThat is exactly what our amendment addresses.\n  And then, finally, the National Association of Manufacturers--not \nknown to be a particular Democratic organization--talks about the \nimportance--again, these are studies that were completed in 2005--the \nimportance of emphasizing science and math technology, including \nenhancing our education, career training, and continuing education and \ntraining programs.\n  These are exactly the programs included in our particular amendment \nthat the Senator from Maine and I offer with the Senator from New \nJersey. It is in response to the challenge we are facing \ninternationally. We offset that by closing tax loopholes.\n  First let's talk about Pell grants. In this amendment, we have \nincreased the maximum Pell grant to $4,500. As you can see, this has \nbeen frozen at $4,050 over the period of the last 4 to 5 years. There \nwill be those who will say: Well, we have increased the total amount of \nfunding because there are more children who are receiving the Pell \ngrants. But the reason there are more students receiving Pell grants is \nbecause there are more students in need.\n\n       This amendment will increase immediately the Pell maximum \n     up to $4,500. This is not enormously inconsistent with what \n     the President has said. In his last two Presidential \n     campaigns, he has indicated that he favored the $4,500 \n     maximum. The cost for this will be $1.8 billion. So this is \n     the increase in the Pell Grant Program.\n\n  The second aspect of this amendment is to open up access to \neducational opportunity by investing in the TRIO Program, the GEAR UP \nprogram, and the LEAP program. This amendment provides the additional \nhelp and assistance for those programs.\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\n  Let me show who is affected by these programs. Nearly 1.5 million \nstudents benefit from the tutoring, the counseling, and other services \nprovided by the Gear Up programs in over 1,700 schools. This program \nkeeps students interested in school and prepares them to attend \ncollege. It has been enormously successful in opening up opportunities \nfor helping young children, many from disadvantaged communities, into \nthe colleges and universities across our country.\n  The amendment also addresses the TRIO Talent Search and Upward Bound \nPrograms, special programs to recognize talented young people who \nperhaps might not have had the range of courses in their high schools \nbut, nonetheless, have demonstrated a commitment and a desire to \nenhance their own educational opportunities. The results have been \nabsolutely extraordinary.\n  If you look at the difference in the success of students in these \nprograms compared to students who don't participate, you will see that \nnearly 90 percent of the Upward Bound students graduate from high \nschool, compared to only 68 percent of all low-income students.\n  You will also find that nearly 70 percent of Upward Bound students \nattend college, compared to only 54 percent of low-income students. And \n50 percent of Upward Bound students attend a 4-year college, compared \nto just 22 percent of low-income students. So this is really about \naccess to higher education. We are basically saying, with these \nreports, the United States needs every talented person in our country, \nand these programs help achieve that goal. We are offering an amendment \nthat is going to open up that kind of opportunity for individuals to \ntake advantage of and participate in this effort to maximize our \nability to be competitive.\n\n  Next, there is an important aspect for us in this amendment, as it \nwill invest in critical career and technical education programs. I have \ntaken the figures from Massachusetts, but this is typical of what is \nhappening around the country. We have a total of 61,000 students in \ncareer and technical education in Massachusetts, and about 90 percent \nof them pass what they call the MCAS test. That is a stringent test \nthat our State has instituted and has been commended on for years as \nbeing the gold standard in terms of measuring the academic achievement \nof students. This is the continuing vocational education programs, and \nit amounts to $1.3 billion of the amendment.\n  What this does show is that individuals are gaining the skills they \nare going to need to compete in this era of globalization. About 90 to \n95 percent of those who graduate from career and technical education \nprograms in Massachusetts go on to college or get good jobs. This \namendment invests in these programs that are critically important.\n  We have seen in the chairman's mark on the budget that with regard to \ndiscretionary spending in 2000, the chairman's mark includes the \nPresident's proposed level of $873 million. You will hear descriptions \nof how that provides additional opportunities to enhance education for \nyoung people. But the fact remains, we need a quantum jump in investing \nin young people. We need it in the areas I have outlined, and we need \nit in additional areas. This year the Chinese will be graduating \n600,000 engineers, according to one report. India graduates 350,000 \nengineers. The United States is graduating 72,000 engineers, and half \nof those are foreign students. We have seen the expansion of research \nthat is taking place in India, where Intel has just hired 2,500 Indian \nengineers to do some of their most advanced research. IBM is following \na similar kind of program. We are talking about outsourcing and \noffshoring jobs, and we are not talking about blue-collar jobs. We are \ntalking about those who are going to be at the cutting edge of \ninvestment.\n  What we are saying now is that we have to equip every young person \nwith the ability to deal with the challenges of globalization. That \nmeans they are going to have to attain these kinds of skills for \nthemselves. This is going to be a continuing learning process, and it \nhas to be a national commitment.\n  This Nation has responded when it has been educationally challenged. \nWhen we had the Industrial Revolution, we developed the public school \nsystem. At the end of World War II, we had 10 to 12 million Americans \nserving in the armed forces who had given 3 to 4 years out of their \nlives. We had the GI bill. Those Americans came back and they \nparticipated in our educational system. What we found is that they \nrepaid $7 for every dollar invested in them. When you are investing in \neducation, the benefits to society are huge. They come back manyfold in \nterms of our prosperity and our world leadership. This is not a no-sum \ngame. This is a process by which the Nation gains.\n  Then we were faced with the Sputnik challenge when the Russians sent \nSputnik into space. Virtually overnight Republicans and Democrats came \ntogether and passed the National Defense Education Act. Many of those \nstudents who have gone through the National Defense Education Act \nScholarship Program serve in our Defense Department today with great \nsuccess.\n  Today we have a similar challenge with globalization. Are we going to \nsay it is business as usual, as this budget says, or are we going to \nsay this is serious business? In a budget that reflects a nation's \npriorities, are we going to say we are sufficiently concerned about \nthis kind of challenge that we are not going to hold the young people \nbehind by denying them the opportunity to deal with the challenges of \nglobal education? That is what the amendment is basically about. That \nis why we strongly believe in it. It is clearly in the national \ninterest. It is a reflection of what the priorities are for the \nAmerican people. The American people understand the importance of \ninvesting in students and workers. It is key to their prosperity. We \ncannot have a competitive economy with breakthroughs in innovation \nunless we have highly skilled, highly trained individuals. If you look \nover the various scientific magazines you see that in the last twenty \nyears the U.S. share of research articles has declined from 38 percent \nto 30 percent. Meanwhile, China's share of articles more than doubled. \nOther countries are investing in their young people, and the United \nStates can't afford to fall behind in this regard. The challenge to the \nSenate is whether we are going to begin that process of investing in \nthe young people of this Nation or whether we are going to be an also-\nran Nation down the line.\n  I will include in the Record the names of the more than 100 groups \nthat support this amendment.

I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment is a classic tax-and-spend \namendment of which we have seen a large number coming from the other \nside during markup. In fact, $133 billion in new taxes and $126 billion \nin new programs were offered by the other side. That is called growing \nthe Government--dramatically. It is also called putting a lot of burden \non people working to pay taxes.\n  This amendment is a continuation of that approach. The euphemism \n``loophole'' is used to try to avoid the fact that what we are \nproposing is major tax increases to pay for this. If you are going to \nhave a responsible budget, you have some budget discipline. You have \nset priorities. We have attempted to do that with this budget.\n  Certainly this Presidency has done a great deal in the area of \neducation. The Senator from Massachusetts says we need a massive effort \nin the area of education. I would say adding $9 billion just last month \ninto the higher education accounts is a pretty big effort. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts voted against that. It was in the Deficit Reduction \nAct where we took a big chunk of money and put it into higher \neducation. I believe $4.5 billion went to low-income students who were \ncollege bound. There was about $4 billion which went to reduce \norigination fees for students who want to go to college. Those are big \nnumbers. And $1.9 billion went to people who were taking up special \neducation as their vocation when they got out of college or math/\nscience. There was loan forgiveness for those folks who decided to \npursue those disciplines which are in great need. That was a huge \ninfusion, and this administration supported that.\n  In general, this administration's support for education has been so \nmuch more dramatic than the last Democratic administration that it is \nalmost embarrassing, I would think, for members of the other party to \ncome to the floor and claim this administration hasn't done too much in \nthis area when you consider what they have done in comparison to what \nthe Clinton administration did.\n  This chart reflects that in dollar terms, the type of increases we \nhave seen on an annual basis. You can see that the Clinton increases \nfor title I, for example, were about a third of what this President \ndid. Clinton increases in IDEA special education were about one-seventh \nof what the President has done. The Pell grants, this President has \nsignificantly increased Pell grant funding. The Clinton administration \nactually reduced it. And the total discretionary funding on an annual \nbasis, this administration has added an annual $3 billion increase; the \nClinton administration about half a billion dollars. Those are big \nnumbers, a big commitment to education.\n  Yes, the President's budget, as it was sent up, in some of those \naccounts that have grown so dramatically did limit the rate of growth \nthis year. But we actually adjusted that in our bill, and we have put \nanother $1.5 billion into these accounts which is reasonable.\n  Of course, I have to emphasize that we don't actually control that \nnumber. That is controlled by the Appropriations Committee. All we do \nis control the top number. The Appropriations Committee makes the \nallocations. We have departed from the guideposts which the President \nput out there and put in some ideas of our own, but they will all be \ndecided, of course, by the allocations made by Senator Cochran, \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The number commitment which is shown by this chart is dramatic, and \nit is reflected in the fact that we just did a $9 billion infusion in \nthe higher education accounts over 5 years, which is significant. Every \ntime we have done a Republican budget, the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas, in his own inimitable way, come to the floor and offered an \namendment to dramatically increase spending. This year isn't any \ndifferent. I am not surprised by the amendment. But I do think if you \nare going to have a disciplined budget, you have to live within the \nspending restraints with which you are confronted.\n  We have heard a lot from the other side about the failure to address \nthe issue of debt. The failure to address the size of the Federal \nGovernment is what drives debt. If you are going to allow the Federal \nGovernment to grow by $6.3 billion, which is what this amendment does, \nif you are going to raise the cap so that spending is not limited but \nis suddenly exploded by $6.3 billion, you are going to aggravate the \ndebt. You are going to pay for it with loophole closings, but we all \nknow it is a little difficult to do that. The spending is easy, but the \npaying for it is hard. As a result, you will end up without any \ndiscipline.\n  This amendment is essentially an attempt to break the caps, to \neliminate fiscal discipline, and to do it in account areas in which \nevery account could use more money, but these accounts have not been \nunderfunded. These accounts have been aggressively funded by this \nadministration, especially in comparison with the prior administration. \nIt is hard to argue that on top of these dramatic increases, the $9 \nbillion which we specifically put in for higher education is not a \nfairly significant commitment--in fact, a very large commitment--to \nfunding higher education. Where this money is going to flow, I am not \nsure. That will be the decision of the Appropriations Committee. But I \nam confident that, because year in and year out the Appropriations \nCommittee has supported programs such as TRIO and GEAR UP, those \naccounts will be funded because we have adequate resources to do it.\n  I strongly oppose the amendment on the grounds that, A, it breaks the \ncaps and therefore ends fiscal discipline; B, it is a tax-and-spend \namendment in the tradition of some of our more liberal colleagues; and, \nC, it is spending money in accounts where we have already made very \nstrong commitments as a party and as a Government under\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\nthis President. Those accounts have received substantial increases and \nwill continue to receive strong support.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the time agreement, the Senator from \nMassachusetts controls 15 additional minutes; the Senator from New \nHampshire controls 23 minutes. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 minute and then I yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from Maine.\n  I quickly want to respond to my colleague from New Hampshire. When \nyou say there was $9 billion in aid added last month to higher \neducation, this includes 3.7 billion for a grant program that only \nhelps ten percent of students who need it. Most of this $9 billion \nhelps banks, not students. The $6 billion increase for the Pell grant \nthat I supported and worked on with the Chairman of the HELP Committee \nwas jettisoned completely in the Senate bill. Instead there was no \nadditional grant aid for 90 percent of poor students, and this is at a \ntime when 400,000 students would like to go to college, are ready to \nattend college, but can't because of cost. Now I will yield to the \nSenator from Maine.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts in sponsoring this important amendment. I want to \nrecognize that the Senator from New Hampshire is a longtime champion of \neducation programs and, indeed, under President Bush, education \nprograms have received considerable additional spending. But we can and \nwe should do more. There is no greater investment in the future of this \ncountry than to invest in the education of our young people. This \namendment would restore cuts and increase funding for absolutely \ncritical education and job training programs in this budget.\n  Let me talk about some of those programs. Let's begin with the Pell \nGrant Program. Pell grants go to our neediest families. The average \nincome of a family whose student is receiving a Pell grant is only \nabout $16,000 a year. We are proposing to provide a $450 increase in \nthe Pell grant maximum award. That would increase it from $4,050 to \n$4,500.\n  The maximum award has not been increased for 4 years, while the cost \nof higher education has skyrocketed. Let's look at the impact on \nstudents.\n  In 1975, the year I graduated from college, the amount of the maximum \nPell grant award was sufficient to cover approximately 80 percent of \nthe average costs of attending a public 4-year institution--80 percent. \nToday it covers less than 40 percent of those costs. That disparity \nmeans that higher education is further and further out of reach for too \nmany low-income students.\n  Let's talk about the impact of another program. It is the TRIO \nPrograms, the aspirations-raising programs. I know firsthand what a \ndifference these programs make in my home State of Maine where too few \nfamilies have experience with higher education and, thus, their \nchildren find higher education to be something unknown or something \nthey are not sure they can handle.\n  These aspiration-raising programs give the mentoring assistance, the \nencouragement, the help that is needed so that talented young people \nrealize that higher education is within their grasp.\n  The Upward Bound Program is a wonderful program that has changed so \nmany lives. Just yesterday, I talked with a student from the University \nof Southern Maine who told me that but for the TRIO Programs, he would \nnot today be in college.\n  The GEAR UP Program has been very successful in my State. I have met \nwith members of the University of Maine at Farmington GEAR UP \npartnership which partners with the middle school in Dicksfield, ME. \nListen to these results and I think it will help convince my colleagues \nof the need to maintain an increased funding for this important \nprogram.\n  When this middle school first got its GEAR UP grant in 1999, only 37 \npercent of the graduating high school students went on to postsecondary \neducation--only 37 percent. But last June, the first group of students \nthat had gone through the GEAR UP Program graduated. Mr. President, do \nyou know how many of them went on to higher education? More than 82 \npercent. What a difference this program has made. It doubled the number \nof students going on to higher education. It has completely changed the \naspirations of students growing up in this small rural community in \nwestern Maine.\n  Another important restoration in the Kennedy-Collins amendment is for \nvocational education under the Perkins program. Again, I have seen \nfirsthand the incredible results of Federal investments in vocational \neducation. The United Technology Center in Bangor is a wonderful \nexample of a regional technical high school that encourages students to \nstay in school, to expand their horizons, and to gain new skills.\n  I visited the United Technology Center twice and, believe me, the \nFederal funding, the $171,000 that this school receives, is making all \nthe difference in the lives of the students enrolled there. I saw an \nexcitement about learning. I talked to students who told me that the \nstandard high school curriculum didn't reach them. They are learning so \nmuch in this vocational education setting, and that Federal investment, \nagain, changes lives.\n  I hope very much that we will adopt this amendment. The budget is all \nabout setting priorities, and surely--surely--in this country we can \nmake the investments we need to help our neediest students pursue \nhigher education, to help families who may not have the experience of \ngoing on to college so they receive the encouragement, mentoring, and \nsupport they need, and to help our vocational education programs.\n  Finally, my State has seen a real loss of manufacturing jobs in the \npast decade. The workforce investment training programs have been \nessential in helping displaced workers start new careers and new lives.\n  I hope we will adopt this amendment. I think it will make a great \ndeal of difference to individual families, to our States, and to our \neconomy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am not sure what budget the Senator from \nMaine is talking about, but it is not the budget we brought to the \nfloor as a Republican Senate. The budget that was reported out of \ncommittee by the Republican membership funds vocational education. The \nPresident's may not have, but our does, and there is $1.4 billion in \nthe budget for that program. We actually put in money that would allow \nthe TRIO Program, the GEAR UP Program, the LEAP Program, and the \nPerkins loan programs to be increased if the committee wants to do \nthat. We added $1.5 billion of additional funding.\n  What the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Massachusetts are \nsuggesting is that we should blow the caps by $6.3 billion, raise taxes \nby $6.3 billion, and do that to fund accounts which already have \nreceived significant dollars and which are going to continue to receive \nsignificant dollars.\n  As I mentioned, the higher education funding has received a $9 \nbillion infusion just by the passage of the reconciliation bill in \nFebruary which was voted against by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  This budget has a very strong commitment to education, as have \nbudgets that have come before this body, as has this President who has \ndone more for title I, IDEA, and Pell grants by a factor of three, \nfour, five times what the prior administration did and has made a \nstronger commitment in the education accounts than probably in any \nother account, with the exception of accounts necessary to fight the \nwar on terrorism that are discretionary.\n  It does seem to me a bit over the top to say that within the number \n$873 billion, which is what we are already spending in discretionary \nmoney, there is no ability to adequately fund education in light of the \ntrack record that we have funded education very well.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire I think has laid out a very strong \ncase for why this amendment fails to enact the kind of basic fiscal \nrestraint, basic fiscal responsibility that is essential--\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nessential in this particular time and place in our country's history, \nbut I think essential at any time exercising that financial \nresponsibility on the behalf of the taxpayers.\n  I wish to talk, though, about the broad failings of this amendment, \nand I am concerned that we are going to see similar failings in \namendment after amendment offered in this debate. This amendment fails \non a number of counts.\n  First, to pick up on the point that was made by the committee \nchairman, there is a complete failure to recognize the additional funds \nand resources that are already part of this budget, the additional \nfunds in the education account that have been made available for \nvocational education, for TRIO, for Perkins, depending on what the \npriorities and desires and goals of the committees of jurisdiction are.\n  By offering this amendment, the suggestion is that those resources \nmean absolutely nothing in this debate, that we cannot possibly get the \njob done with the allowances made in those areas, and I think that \nsuggests either a lack of leadership within the Congress or the Senate \non those particular areas, a lack of confidence in the committees of \njurisdiction to do their job, or a lack of homework being done to \nunderstand how much has been made available in the last several years \nand what resources are actually available.\n  Second, this amendment carries with it a suggestion that under no \ncircumstances should any program in the education accounts ever be \neliminated or redirected to better use those resources elsewhere. I \nthink anyone outside of Washington who hears that statement--that no \nprogram should ever be eliminated, no funds should ever be redirected--\nwould think that cannot possibly be so; people within Washington, \nwithin the beltway, within the Senate cannot possibly think in those \nterms. But, unfortunately, this amendment makes plain they do think in \nthose terms and, in fact, some legislation now being proposed in this \nvery area creates 10 or 15 new education programs without looking at \nwhat exists currently and trying to find a way to better use those \ndollars.\n  It is unfortunate because it does those who are in the greatest need \nof these kinds of programs, support, and services an injustice because \nwe don't want to do the hard work of oversight, of looking at when \nprograms were created and how funding can be better used.\n  In the case of TRIO, for example, which has been mentioned, it is a \nworthwhile program, it is a program I have supported, but I have always \nmade clear that I am willing to look at other programs in the \nDepartment and redirect funds and redirect resources to make sure a \nworthwhile effort such as TRIO gets the resources it needs.\n  So, one, there is no regard made for the resources that are actually \nin the budget.\n  Two, there is the suggestion that we couldn't possibly ever modify or \neliminate a program to get more resources into the areas targeted by \nthis amendment.\n  Three, there is the suggestion that we couldn't possibly redirect \nresources in any other part of the budget to education, that we \nwouldn't want to touch something politically sensitive such as \nagricultural subsidies, such as spending subsidies for fossil fuel, oil \nand gas research and development, which we greatly expanded in the \nEnergy bill that was passed last year. No effort has been made to \nhonestly identify areas that should be a lesser priority than those \ntargeted by this amendment.\n\n  Fourth is the assumption that seems all too common, that if we want \nto spend more money, we should just raise taxes. We can talk about \nloopholes all we want, but the fact is, it is a tax increase, and they \nare tax increases that may have been passed in the United States Senate \nbut were not signed into law, were not supported in the other body, and \nhave little or no likelihood of ever making it through. So I think \nthrowing out a tax increase in an effort to make an amendment budget \nneutral when you know those resources are never going to be delivered \nis deficit spending, pure and simple. It is wrong, it is not fiscally \nresponsible, and it should be rejected.\n  Budgets are about setting priorities. We can do a better job, a more \nhonest job of setting priorities. I am always willing to look at \nredirecting resources, whether it is from within the Department of \nEducation to things that should be a priority, whether it is from other \nprograms to this. If we are not willing to do that, we shouldn't be \nwilling to vote for amendments that blow the budget caps.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey and 1 minute to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy-\nCollins-Menendez amendment. It is an amendment that sends an important \nmessage to our Nation. Yes, budgets are about values and priorities. We \ntell our children in this country that education is a fundamental value \nthat is of the highest importance, and then we submit a budget that \nspeaks of much different values than that which, in fact, we hold up to \nour children.\n  If this amendment is passed, it says: If you work hard, if you are \naiming for a goal, we will help you achieve it. It says no matter the \nhappenstance of where you were born, the station in life into which you \nwere born, we will give you the opportunity to fulfill your God-given \npotential. That is what this amendment says. It says we are willing to \nmake the investments necessary in our young people to strengthen our \ncountry's future.\n  However, the budget before us does none of those things. I sat as a \nmember of the Budget Committee listening through this process and, I \nmust say, eventually cuts have to come from someplace. The suggestion \nthat everything is in the education budget that we have had in the past \nis simply not reality. At the end of the day, we are still over $700 \nmillion short in higher education than from where we were. It does \nnothing to increase the maximum Pell grant, and we can see from this \nchart no matter what we talk about in terms of how we try to portray \nthe numbers, there is one unmistakable fact: In the cost of attendance \nat a 4-year college institution, at a public college, versus the \nability of what you can maximally achieve with a Pell grant, there is a \nhuge gap, and that gap has continued to grow. So what we are telling \nour young people is, yes, education is a value, a higher education, \ncollege education degree is incredibly important for your own \nfulfillment, for the Nation's success in a global economy, but, sorry, \nwe are just largely not going to help you. You are going to have to do \nthat on your own. You are going to have to borrow and graduate under a \nmountain of debt. That is not a value that I think Americans share. \nThey want to see the fulfillment of their children's potential \nrealized.\n  So this does nothing to increase the maximum Pell grant, which will \nbe frozen for the fifth year, and will decrease the actual real dollars \nin values as it has over the last 4 years. It does nothing to increase \nwork-study grants, which will mean 1,000 fewer students will receive \nawards next year. It would take away low-cost loans in terms of the \nunderlying budget for nearly a half million low-income students, loans \nthat are forgiven--forgiven--for those who are serving in vital public \nservice sectors such as teachers, nurses, law enforcement, or military \nofficers. It will mean that more than 1.5 million low-income students \nwould lose out on early intervention and college preparation programs \nthat help make sure they are enrolled in and graduate from college.\n  That is why I am proud to be offering this amendment with my \ndistinguished colleague and a tremendous leader on education, Senator \nKennedy. I am also glad to be joined with Senator Collins in this \neffort. This amendment provides a real opportunity to change the course \nof events for our Nation and to meet our competitive future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the need to more widely invest in \neducation is widely recognized by our Nation's employers. We have seen \nrecent\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\nstudies by the National Academy of Sciences warning that our country is \nlosing its edge in math and science education. We have seen employer \ngroups such as the National Association of Manufacturers call for \ngreater investment. We have the opportunity to answer those calls by \napproving this amendment.\n  Prior to my election to the Senate, I worked at a college in Maine, \nand I saw firsthand how vital these Federal programs were. I hope we \nwill adopt the amendment. It will make a difference to our families, \nour States, and our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 50 seconds \nremaining. The Senator from New Hampshire has 15\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there is an inconsistency in the argument \ncoming from the other side of the aisle. The Senator from New Jersey \nand the Senator from Massachusetts argue that we need a significant \ninfusion of funds into higher education funding to assist students \ngoing on to college. Yet they both voted--I believe the Senator from \nNew Jersey, in the House at the time, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, in the Senate--against the deficit reduction bill which \nincluded a $9 billion infusion into higher education. That was a big \nnumber.\n  The argument that Pell grants haven't been increased flies in the \nface of the fact that we have created a new account which actually \nallows up to $8,000 of the cost for a low-income individual to go to \ncollege, to be reimbursed on the basis of the Pell structure, and as a \nresult those funds which weren't available prior to the deficit \nreduction bill are available today. That is $8,000 for low-income \nstudents who pursue certain types of disciplines that they can get.\n  In addition, our commitment as a Federal Government since President \nBush took office has been dramatic in the area of title I. These are \nthe numbers. They have gone up exponentially--exponentially--under \nPresident Bush. Look at what they did under President Clinton. They \njust crept along. They just crept along. President Bush came into \noffice and we increased them dramatically.\n  What about the IDEA? IDEA funding, once again, under President \nClinton, just crept along. When President Bush came into office they \nincreased dramatically. Massive increases in funding in IDEA, massive \nincreases of money in title I, massive increases of money going into \nhigher education accounts to assist people wanting to go to college. \nNot enough. Not enough. You have to come here and propose an amendment \nwhich breaks the caps and ignores the fact that we put an extra $1.5 \nbillion into these education accounts over what the President requested \nwith our budget and ignore the fact that we fully funded the vocational \naccounts over what the President requested and say, no, we have to \nraise taxes by $6.3 billion and raise the caps by $6.3 billion. Tax and \nspend.\n\n  I have to say this President has had a commitment to education which \nhas been unique in the history of this country relative to dollars, \nrelative to philosophy, and relative to results. I take a back seat to \nno one on funding education in this institution, and I believe we have \na record to stand by, and this budget continues that record.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee. First of all, let me try and set up my remarks. I \nchaired the State Board of Education in the State of Georgia from 1996 \nto 1998, which is a period of time during the last administration. When \nI heard some of the speeches this morning about our commitment to \neducation and about this budget, I found myself compelled to come to \nthe floor and maybe add a perspective that might not yet have been \nheard on some of the comments that were made.\n  First of all, I commend Senator Gregg and the committee on what they \nhave done. As the Senator said as he left a minute ago, this represents \na $1.5 billion increase over the President's budget for education. When \nthis Education bill passes this year in the appropriations act, we will \nhave increased Federal spending on education by 33 percent since the \nelection of President Bush. It is unprecedented in the history of this \ncountry, our commitment to elementary and secondary education.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made a comment about the Pell grants. \nHe said: Well, you will hear us say that we are really spending more on \nPell because there are more students receiving them. And his comment \nwas--and I wrote it down: Well, there are more poor children receiving \nPell money. That is why there is more money going out.\n  There is a phrase that was left out of that. Today, there are more \npoor children qualifying for higher education, and that is a good \nthing, not a bad thing. That is why more money has gone out while the \nlevel of Pell funding might not have been raised from the $4,050 level.\n  In fact, this President's commitment to leaving no child behind, \nseeing to it that students can read and compute math at grade level and \ncan go to high school ready to learn in the sciences and those other \nareas that are a prerequisite for a postsecondary education, no \nadministration ever in the history of this country has made the \ncommitment this one has.\n  With regard to the comments on Perkins--and I am a big Perkins \nperson. I will tell you now, I will be on the floor of the Senate when \nthe appropriations bill comes through fighting for Perkins money. But \nthe illusion was created that the President zeroes out Perkins. Perkins \nis a discretionary program. Perkins was not delineated in last year's \nbudget resolution, but it was fully funded in the appropriations act. \nSo anyone who says this budget cuts out Perkins is making the \nassumption that of the $1.5 billion in increased funding that we are \ngoing to spend in this budget resolution, none of it would be \nappropriated by this Senate to go to Perkins.\n  Let me tell you how bad that is in terms of an idea. Last year, the \nbudget read exactly the same way, and this Senate, by a vote of 99 to \n0, funded Perkins. So this budget resolution gives a $1.5 billion \nincrease in discretionary spending so that programs such as Perkins, \nwhich are not delineated because they are not mandatory in the budget \nresolution, are funded in the appropriations act.\n  But let us get to mandatory. IDEA is kind of my special passion. \nChildren with disabilities is something I have worked on all my life. I \nmarried a special education teacher. I married a special education \nteacher 10 years before Public Law 94-142 was passed, which was the \nSpecial Education Act that really put in the mandates that today are \nIDEA. And for years, this Congress and this Nation mandated on our \nlocal governments that they spend 40 percent more per FTE, full-time \nequivalent, on a special needs child than they did on an average child \nor a nonspecial needs child. Yet we funded none of it. For years we \nfunded none of it.\n  Under this administration, we have gone from funding what was about \n10 percent when the President was elected, to where now we are almost \nto half of that 40 percent mandate or 20 percent in total of the FTE \nthe Federal Government is funding. In this budget resolution, as a \nmandatory item, there is inclusion from now through 2011 for that \ncommitment to IDEA and to children with disabilities to increase so \nthat we meet the Federal promise made over 30 years ago, or almost 30 \nyears ago. So we shouldn't play word games.\n\n  I will be the first person to tell you that I will be on the floor \nwith the appropriations bill fighting for pieces of that $1.5 billion \nincrease to go to enhanced programs such as Perkins. I believe in our \ncommitment to the less fortunate, whether they be disabled or whether \nthey be in poverty, and I was proud to be one of the coauthors of No \nChild Left Behind which, in and of itself, is a commitment to our title \nI children who are free and reduced lunch children and, in fact, our \nchildren most in need. But we should not characterize this budget as \ncutting short a commitment to America's children but, rather, a \nreaffirmation of a commitment that was made in 2001 and has continued \nto result in a 33-percent increase in the investment in our children.\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\n  One last point. I didn't hear this said, but I know I will hear it \nsaid before this debate is over, or certainly before the appropriations \nbill passes. We do two things in the Congress of the United States. We \nauthorize and we appropriate. A lot of times because of the public \nmisunderstanding of the difference between the two, people will say we \nare cutting short our commitment to this or to that or the other \nbecause we authorized X but we appropriate Y. Well, from defense to \neducation to everything in between, we always have an authorization \nthat is higher than the appropriation. but the appropriations for \neducation are not in this budget resolution. It does not portend a \nreduction but an increase--in this case, $1.5 billion, and in the case \nof education, 33 percent in the first 5 years of this President of the \nUnited States, the President who declared and this Congress affirmed \nthat we shall leave no child behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, the Senator from \nNew Jersey, and myself understand that we are facing a worldwide \nchallenge. That is not just what we are saying; that is what the \nAcademy of Sciences is saying, the Academy of Engineering is saying, \nthe Institute of Politics is saying, National Association of \nManufacturers, Council of Competitors. You can't do business as usual. \nThe rest of the world is playing for keeps. The question is whether we \nwill or not. When we faced the challenge of Sputnik, America responded \nand doubled its involvement in education. We are facing a worldwide \nchallenge now, and we believe these investments will make sure we move \ntoward the goal of maintaining the United States as No. 1. Anything \nelse will put us behind.\n  I believe my time is up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Massachusetts has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator's passion. I just wish he had \nbeen there when we voted on the deficit reduction bill and we put $9 \nbillion in student assistance and increased the Pell grant concept \n$8,000 per student, students with low income to pursue academic careers \nwhich are needed in this country so we could be more competitive.\n  As I have mentioned before, the numbers are pretty staggering, what \nwe put into education accounts, and this budget puts in another $1.5 \nbillion over what the President suggested, although again it is not \nbinding. Nothing we do in this budget is binding in a specific account. \nThe only binding number we have and we should keep is that top line on \nthe issue of how much we are going to spend as a Government. I would \nsay not only is it important to pass along good education to our \nchildren, but it is also important to pass along a healthy economy to \nthem and a nation which they can afford to live in. But raising their \ntaxes as this amendment does is not going to make us more competitive \nor make them have a better lifestyle. It means they end up paying more \ntaxes. Not living within your budgets is not a good idea for \ngovernment, it is not a good idea certainly for students, and I think \nthis amendment sets a bad precedent. It establishes a precedent of \nsaying, well, we will just blow the cap off with either higher taxes or \nmore debt. It is a very inappropriate approach and certainly unfair to \nthose kids who want to go to college and have a country they can afford \nto live in and be able to make a decent living in and not have to pay \ntoo much in taxes.\n\n  This amendment, in my opinion, is excessive, inappropriate, and \nclearly, as a result of busting the budget, is not constructive to \nfiscal responsibility and to maintaining fiscal discipline here at the \nFederal level.\n  Now I would yield back the remainder of my time. I understand the \nnext amendment will be offered by the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is to be offered by the \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I ask my colleague from Rhode Island \nif we could allow Senator Kennedy to pay respects to Maggie Inouye for \n1 minute? We will extend the time of the Senator appropriately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleagues.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3014\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I call up amendment 3014 which is at the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3014.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase funding for part B of the Individuals with \n                      Disabilities Education Act)\n\n       On page 18, line 24, increase the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 25, increase the amount by $40,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 4, increase the amount by $1,320,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 8, increase the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 12, increase the amount by $40,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $40,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 2, decrease the amount by $1,320,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 5, decrease the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the amount by $40,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the Senator from Rhode Island \nis recognized and in control of 30 minutes and the opposition controls \n30 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Hagel, Collins, Kohl, Coleman, and Roberts be added as \ncosponsors if they are not already so listed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I rise today to offer an amendment that moves us closer \nto honoring the promises we made when we enacted the Education For All \nHandicapped Children Act of 1975 which later became the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act or IDEA. IDEA has its genesis in the \nSupreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. As we \nall know, this decision declared separate but equal is inherently \nunconstitutional. Prior to 1975, it was estimated that 2 million young \npeople either were not receiving any public educational services or the \nservices they were receiving were inadequate.\n  Based on the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, \nparents of disabled children sought redress through the courts. In \n1972, the District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in \nPARC v. Pennsylvania and the U.S. District Court of the District of \nColumbia in Mills v. Washington, DC Board of Education applied the \nprinciple in Brown to the education of disabled children. As a result, \nStates felt compelled to provide educational services to individuals \nwith disabilities and sought the Federal Government's help in providing \nthose services.\n  On November 18, 1975, the House of Representatives passed the \nEducation for All Handicapped Children Act by a vote of 404 to 7. The \nSenate followed the next day by passing the bill by a vote of 87 to 7. \nThey were overwhelming majorities, as they should have been.\n  As it was enacted, IDEA mandated that States provide public education \nto all children, and it also must provide a free appropriate public \neducation to special needs students. In return, the Federal Government \npromised to pay 40 percent of the per-pupil expenditures for students \nwith disabilities. Unfortunately, we have failed to fulfill our promise \nto this program. We have made great strides since 1995 when we were \ncontributing just 7.3 percent of the cost. I would like to say a little \nbit about who pays these costs. There is a lot of talk in this Chamber \nabout income taxes and marginal rates and dividend taxes and capital \ngains taxes. There is not enough talk in this Chamber about property \ntaxes and that\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nthese special education costs are borne by the property tax payer. Now, \nthe income tax--obviously you pay more the more you make no matter what \nthe percentage. The more you make, the more you pay. The less you make, \nthe less you pay. If a streak of bad luck hits and you unfortunately \nlose your job, you pay less income tax. The same thing with a sales \ntax. You don't have to buy the deluxe model, whatever it might be. You \ncan buy the economy model and pay less sales tax. If you want to buy a \nCadillac, you pay more sales tax. If you buy a Chevrolet, you pay less \nsales tax. That is your choice. But with property taxes, they are \nalways there. You lose your job, that property tax is always there. And \nfor many people, even if they have paid for that house, their castle, \nwhatever it might be, their 2-bedroom castle, 10-bedroom castle, those \nproperty taxes are still there. And if an area gets gentrified or \nincreases in value, sometimes those property taxes can soar. So for \npeople on fixed incomes in particular, this is a very difficult tax, \nespecially compared to income and sales taxes. And this IDEA is borne \nby the property tax payer.\n  In fiscal year 2005, we were providing 18.5 percent--far from the \ngoal of 40 percent for IDEA--and last year, we actually regressed. We \nwent down to only 17.8 percent of our promised 40 percent for IDEA--\ncontributing only 40 percent. We are not to 40 percent of these special \neducation costs which are borne by the property tax payer. Essentially \nwhat these percentages mean is this: For fiscal year 2006, we provided \n$10.5 billion for part B grants to States, and our Federal share last \nyear should have been $23.8 billion--far, far away from our goal. In \nfiscal year 2007, the President has proposed a $100 million increase. \nOur estimated full funding cost is $25.1 billion. Under this proposal, \nwe fall further behind, and my amendment would increase funding by $2 \nbillion and have the Federal Government pay at least half of what was \npromised or 20 percent. We are only going half of what was promised \nback in 1975.\n  Mr. President, our budget decisions have real-life consequences for \nour constituents. The burden of the Federal Government's failure to \nlive up to its promises as I said is borne by these property tax \npayers. Full funding of IDEA is not a choice for State and local \nschools; it is a mandate. Schools are the largest cost to property tax \npayers; sometimes as much as 80 percent of the municipal cost is borne \nby its tax payers. It is usually above 50 percent. For any municipality \nall across the country, the most rapidly increasing school costs are in \nspecial education.\n  Listen to this. In North Providence, while general school spending \nhas gone up $11 million or 19 percent over the last 5 years, special \neducation has gone up $7.5 million or 74.9 percent in 5 years. And this \nis typical. That is just one town in Rhode Island, North Providence, \nRI. General school spending has gone up 19 percent over 5 years, \nspecial education has gone up 74 percent. And that is typical.\n  The Federal Government has an obligation, as we set forth in 1975, to \nhelp with these rising costs. That property tax is a tough tax to pay, \nas we all know. The IDEA burden on school districts is increasing \nbecause the costs are rising the more we learn about children's \ndisabilities. We are getting better at diagnosing, but that is why \nthese costs are increasing so much.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his continued leadership on \nthis issue. I also thank Senators Collins, Kohl, Coleman, and Roberts \nfor their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just say----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from North Dakota speaking in \nopposition to the amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am just going to take time off the \namendment on our side, not speaking in opposition. I do want my \ncolleagues to know what is occurring here. I entirely agree with the \nSenator from Rhode Island in terms of his priorities, in terms of \nadditional funding for IDEA. I just want to rise and make the point \nthat I made on the previous amendment that used section 920 funding.\n  The problem is there is no 920 money available. In fact, if we look \nat the budget, we see that 920 is already $500 million in the hole. So \nthe result of this amendment, which seeks to add $2 billion, is really \na nullity because what it is going to do in terms of what the \nappropriators see is on the one hand they will get $2 billion, on the \nother hand $2 billion will be taken away. So what happens, what do the \nappropriators do? We don't know what they will do. They could add $2 \nbillion to this account and take $2 billion from other accounts. They \ncould. They could just wind up doing nothing.\n  That is the reality of the budget resolution. I know it is confusing \nto people. But I am entirely in sympathy with the Senator from Rhode \nIsland in what he is seeking to do in terms of adding funding. The \nproblem we have is using 920 as the function to fund these things \nbecause there is no money there. It is an across-the-board cut, and the \nappropriators will see no real increase. This becomes more than \nanything a statement of what one wants to accomplish. But the hard \nreality here is there is no 920 money available. It will have to be an \nacross-the-board cut, however the appropriators determine to make it. \nThere is no new money here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Rhode Island yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first I want to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. I think this is a good amendment, and it is done the \nright way. He has basically come to the conclusion--and a lot of us \nagree--that IDEA could use some more money, that there is an unfunded \nmandate.\n  There are some issues here, of course, as to whether, like a dog \nchasing its tail, we can ever catch up with the level of Federal \nfunding that should be in IDEA because some States in some ways are \novercoding too many kids in the system. But that is a debate for \nanother time.\n  We have already tried to address that in the most recent IDEA \nreauthorization. But his initiative of putting $2 billion into this \naccount is an appropriate one and he has done it the right way. He \nbasically says within the budget we are going to set the priorities \nworking with a spending cap. He is saying let us do it as an across-\nthe-board cut and put the additional money we would have into the IDEA \naccount. It is a legitimate way to approach this 920 act because it \nactually delivers the message which the Senator from Rhode Island \nwishes to deliver, and as it is executed the Appropriations Committee \nwould actually get the money over there into that account with an \nacross-the-board cut.\n  The argument which is made is, Well, this has no substance because \nthe 920 account is going to be left up to the appropriators as to \nwhether they would take the approach of the across-the-board cut, which \nis equally applicable in moving this budget, other than the top line \ncap number. The top line cap number, which is $873 billion, is the only \nnumber in this budget that has force of law. Everything else below \nthat--$400-plus billion that we have allocated in this budget \ntheoretically to defense, an extra $1.5 billion we put into education, \nthe money we put into health care, the money we put into environmental \nprotection--all of those are suggestions essentially to the appropriate \ncommittee, which is the Appropriations Committee in this context, in \nthe discretionary account. They may or may not follow it.\n  But I think the Senator from Rhode Island is bringing this forward in \na way which is responsible, staying within the caps provision increase, \nand proposing an across-the-board cut to pay for it. He is giving \nresponsible suggestions to the Appropriations Committee, which is all \nthe budget does, anyway. It gives suggestions, and they have no binding \neffect other than the top line cap number, as I mentioned before. I \ncongratulate him on the proposal. Considering the cards which we \nplayed, which were dealt relative to the budget, he is doing it in the \nproper way.\n  We all recognize that there is a certain illusoriness to all of these \nnumbers because they do not have the force of law. But even the \namendment offered by Senator Kennedy has no impact other than to raise \nthe cap by $6.5 billion. It doesn't raise taxes. He claims it does. But \nwe have no authority to raise taxes in this resolution,\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\nand we are certainly not doing anything that would legally bind the \nFinance Committee to raise taxes. All he is doing is raising the caps \nby $25 billion. That could be spent on defense, all of it, if the \nAppropriations Committee wants to do that. He is suggesting that it be \nspent somewhere else.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is at least doing it the right way, \nwhich is living within the spending priorities which will make the \nGovernment fiscally responsible on the discretionary side of the \nledger, but within those let us allocate some more money for IDEA. He \nhas a good proposal. It is the way it should be done. I congratulate \nthe Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the State of New Hampshire doesn't have an \nincome tax or State sales tax. All of its revenue is generated by a \nproperty tax. Am I correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. We do have a State corporate income tax but all of the \nschool funding in the State essentially is generated by local property \ntaxes--the vast majority of it. There is a sliver of it that comes from \nthe State government but it is not a significant amount in the treasury \noverall.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Does the Senator hear from his school committees and \nlocal councilmen about the rising costs of special education and the \ndifficulty that places on the property tax payer?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there is no question that the Senator from \nRhode Island has touched on an important subject with this amendment, \nwhich is the fact that the Federal Government has never fully lived up \nto the commitment to special education as initially made. We have made \ndramatic progress under this President, especially in comparison to the \nprior Presidency. We are almost up to 20 percent of funding. But there \nwas an original commitment of 40 percent. Certainly every community in \nNew Hampshire--and I am sure Rhode Island--feels they have to pick up a \nFederal share from here and take it from some other part of the \neducation which they think is important in order to pay the Federal \nshare of special education.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Chafee \namendment, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  Prior to the enactment of IDEA, students with disabilities were too \noften left out of our public education system. Today, IDEA is making \nsure that they have the same access to a high quality education and a \nreal chance to live successful, productive lives--as their peers. Yet \nyear after year, school districts in Wisconsin tell me that IDEA needs \nmore funding. This year's budget is especially worrisome. It proposes \nto cut the Federal share of IDEA costs from 18 percent to 17 percent. \nThat is less than half of the 40 percent ``full funding'' level that \nCongress committed to paying when IDEA was first adopted 31 years ago.\n  I believe that a budget resolution serves as a statement of our \nNation's values and priorities. Even though this amendment will not \nprovide the funding increase needed for special education, it states in \nno uncertain terms that our Nation's priority must be to fully fund \nspecial education. I support the Chafee amendment and expect to support \nadditional IDEA amendments that will go a step further and provide real \nincreases for this important program. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin making a strong statement in support of special education as a top \npriority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the remainder of his \ntime?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls the \ntime in opposition, 28 minutes. Does the Senator wish to use any of \nthat, or does the Senator yield that time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for a moment, let me consult with the \nchairman and bill manager. Let me take one moment to consult with him \nand see how we might proceed.\n  I ask if the Senator from Rhode Island would be prepared to yield \nback his time.\n  The Senator has already yielded the time. I am prepared to yield back \nthe time on our side as well.\n  Let me say that it would be very helpful, if Senator Burns and his \nstaff are listening, if he could come and do his amendment next--I know \nit is not scheduled until 1 o'clock--so we are using the time \nefficiently here on the floor.\n  With that, I yield my time on the Chafee amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be allocated equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it might be useful to use this time to \nalert our colleagues on where we are. We will have six votes at roughly \n3 o'clock. At 1 o'clock Senator Burns will offer his amendment on \nveterans, and then Senator Akaka will offer his. I urge colleagues to \nbe alert to what is actually occurring on the floor. It may be that we \nwill have other circumstances in which the full time is not used.\n  If Senators are in the queue, it would be very helpful if they can be \nprepared to come if all time is not used on an amendment.\n  The other thing I want to make certain colleagues understand is right \nnow we have over 100 amendments pending. Let me repeat that. We have \nover 100 amendments pending. We know we can do three amendments an hour \nwhen we are voting. If we were to vote starting now on all of these \namendments, it would take 33 hours of straight voting. And we are not \ndone debating amendments yet.\n  Colleagues need to understand exactly where we are. If we play this \nout, if everybody insists on their amendment, we are going to be here \nprobably until the wee hours of Saturday morning. We will be here all \nday today, on into the night, all day the next day, and all day the \nnext day. We won't complete business until some time Saturday morning \nin the wee hours. That is where we are headed.\n\n  The chairman and I are asking Members to take shorter time \nagreements. We will ask the next sponsors of amendments to take half an \nhour, equally divided. If Members could take less than that, please do \nso. Remember, the alternative is to be in vote-arama where Members get \na minute per side.\n  The only conceivable way we get done Thursday night is No. 1, Members \ntake short time agreements; No. 2, some Members reserve their \namendments and save them for another day or another vehicle.\n  That is where we are. Colleagues should know that. I hope very much \ncolleagues and their staff understand the posture of the Senate. If we \ndo not find a way to get cooperation from Members on taking short time \nagreements, if we do not get agreement from Members on restricting the \nnumber of amendments, we will be here until some time early Saturday \nmorning. Do the math. It is inescapable that is the case.\n  With that, I hope Members will take this opportunity. If colleagues \nwant to speak on the budget, we have time now until 1 o'clock. At 1 \no'clock the next amendment will be offered. It will be Senator Burns on \nveterans. There is time now. We have half an hour. I hope colleagues \nwill use that time so it is not lost.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment and to \nspeak on the budget. I congratulate my good friend from New Hampshire \nwho has had this job, and my good friend from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator intend to send an amendment \nto the desk?\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent the amendment now before the \nSenate be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my amendment which \nis at the desk be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as \nfollows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for himself and Mr. \n     Chaffee, proposes an amendment numbered 2999.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide increased funding for veterans health programs, \n  and to negate the need for enrollment fees and increase in pharmacy \n                              copayments)\n\n       On page 23, line 24, increase the amount by $823,000,000\n       On page 23, line 25, increase the amount by $733,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 3, increase the amount by $854,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 4, increase the amount by $845,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 7, increase the amount by $888,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 8, increase the amount by $880,000,0000.\n       On page 24, line 11, increase the amount by $923,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 12, increase the amount by $914,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 15, increase the amount by $958,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 16, increase the amount by $949,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $823,000,000\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $733,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 1, decrease the amount by $854,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 2, decrease the amount by $845,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 4, decrease the amount by $888,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 5, decrease the amount by $880,000,0000.\n       On page 28, line 7, decrease the amount by $923,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the amount by $914,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 10, decrease the amount by $958,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 11, decrease the amount by $949,000,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 30 \nminutes. Under the order, time is equally split, 30 minutes to the \nSenator and 30 minutes to the other side.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this amendment, \nbut first I congratulate the managers of this bill. It is their \nresponsibility to hammer out a budget in very difficult times. I cannot \nthink of two managers who are more capable of doing this.\n  I understand the need to hold the line in discretionary spending and \nto make some reasonable modifications to a lot of programs. I support \nthose goals. We need to get a handle on Government spending, but in \ndoing so, we have to make sure we do not ask some folks to bear more \nthan their fair share when it comes time to cutting back.\n  I speak in two areas today, one in agriculture and agricultural \nprograms. Right now, it has been forecast there will be some cuts \nthere. We want to make sure those are moderated or do not happen. We \nhave a situation in agriculture right now where with the unprecedented \namount of dollars we are spending on energy and fertilizer costs, the \nfarm is in dire trouble. We will be talking about that later. In fact, \nnext year when we redo the farm bill, that will be the proper time to \nstart talking about any kind of cuts or modifications to agriculture.\n  The amendment I am offering today, along with Senator Chafee, is \ndesigned to ensure that the U.S. Government keeps our promise to our \nveterans. There is nothing more important to the American people than \nthis particular item in our budget.\n  The VA budget proposes $795 million in savings by increasing fees \nplaced on Priority 7 and 8 veterans. The suggested increases includes a \n$250 annual enrollment fee and more than doubling prescription copays, \nfrom $7 to $15. This increased burden placed on our veterans is not \nacceptable.\n  Approximately half of these cuts come from the expected collection \nfrom fees and the other half is through forcing over a million veterans \nto opt out of the system. That is not right, either.\n  Prescription drug costs have risen steadily over the past few years. \nI have a chart that shows this. On the national average, $634 was the \naverage annual prescription drug cost for veterans in Fiscal Year 1999 \ncompared to what we see instead now, with $762 in prescription drug \ncosts for veterans in the Rocky Mountain region.\n  Recently, we have also seen spikes in the price of gas. The \ninflationary pressures add a burden to our veterans and those retirees \nwho live on fixed income.\n  This budget asks our veterans to pay even more just to be part of the \nVA health care system. These fees lead us down the road to turn the VA \ninto another HMO, which will make it harder and harder for our veterans \nto be able to afford basic care.\n  We need to reject these fees and copays. When we do, we need to \nensure that we include the additional $795 million in the budget or we \nwill leave the VA underfunded. This increase I am proposing will be \nfully offset with no additional taxes or added taxes.\n  These fees are not what we promised our military folks when they went \noff to war and when they stood ready to defend this country. For those \nfolks who signed up to fight for this country, this was not their \nexpectation, and it was not our promise at the time, either.\n  In addition, my amendment includes a $27 million increase in budget \nrequests in the area of medical and prosthetic research. The increase \nwill maintain funding for critical medical research programs.\n  The budget proposes a decrease in funding for medical and prosthetic \nresearch, from $412 million down to $399 million. When inflation is \nfactored in, these programs need to be increased to $426 billion in \norder for us to maintain the critical research regarding serious \ninjuries for our veterans returning home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Let's face it, we have a lot more research to do while we \nare involved with this particular conflict than any other conflict we \nhave ever faced.\n\n  This research funding is critical for unique problems associated with \nour veterans who are returning from overseas with traumatic \namputations, central nervous system injuries, loss of sight or hearing, \nand other serious injuries which prevent them from returning to a full \nand productive life. We have to do everything we can to make sure they \nhave the ability to recover. I am a veteran. I know how important VA \nhealth care programs are to those who served this Nation.\n  We have invested a great deal in health care services for veterans. \nBecause of these investments, the quality of care offered at VA \nfacilities has surpassed the care at regular health care facilities. In \nfact, our satisfaction rate with the veterans today is much better than \nit was just 5 or 6 years ago.\n  The VA hospital and our 10 outpatient clinics in Montana are some of \nthe best in the Nation. We must ensure that our veterans can afford the \ncare offered in these great facilities.\n  We did not used to have outpatient clinics in the VA. We all had to \ngo to the hospitals that were in each State or in each region. Those \noutpatient clinics have filled a void by helping to cut down on travel \nand to serve people instead of serving a bureaucracy.\n  I am committed to doing everything I can to help our Nation's \nveterans, and this amendment today is a first step to ensure that our \nveterans get the health care they deserve.\n  I have never felt so strongly about this as I did after visiting \nIraq. Whenever you visit Bethesda Naval Hospital, whenever you visit \nWalter Reed, you will see our young men and women coming home with \ninjuries we have never seen before because we are saving more lives on \nthe battlefield--lives that would have been lost. Now we save them \nthere, and we are able to bring them home, repair them, and get them \nready for public life.\n  Mr. President, I see no other person on the floor.\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to respond to a statement made by my \ngood friend, Senator Burns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator speak in favor or in \nopposition to the amendment?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment \noffered by my friend, Senator Burns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls the time in opposition.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we must go beyond what his amendment seeks \nto accomplish. In a few minutes, we will begin discussion of our \nalternative amendment. Our amendment would provide the funds to ensure \nthat veterans will not see their out-of-pocket costs increase. Our \namendment would add resources to care for newly returning \nservicemembers. Our amendment would shore up the system for all \nveterans needing mental health care.\n  The Burns amendment is based on the premise that the President's \nbudget is ``good enough.'' The opposition urges veterans to be pleased \nthat they are getting an increase at all in this tough budget climate. \nIn my view, especially in this time of war with so many competing \ndemands, we can and should do much better. Veterans should not have to \n``get what we give them.'' They ought to be provided with what they \ndeserve. Let us not forget the sacrifices made by these men and women \nand the sacrifices made by their families.\n  What we have heard much about is that VA is already adequately \nfunded. The administration, and my friends on the other side of the \naisle, continually cite a 50-percent increase in veterans spending \nsince the year 2001. I applaud my colleagues for their support of \nveterans as demand for VA's top-quality health care services has \nincreased.\n  It only makes sense for spending on veterans programs to increase in \naccordance with the increases we have seen in the defense budget, \nparticularly since Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. Colleagues, \nthese increased costs for veterans are a direct result of our global \nwar on terrorism. As we so willingly fund them while they are on active \nduty, we must be willing to fund taking care of them after they have \nserved our great Nation.\n  Let there be no mistake, it is, in fact, Congress that has done the \nheavy lifting. Each year, it is the veterans' leaders in the Senate and \nthe House who go beyond what President Bush has proposed. I do not say \nthis to laud Congress. I say it to remind my colleagues that we need to \nmake veterans a priority. We need to make sure veterans are taken care \nof. Veterans are looking to us to make a difference, and we cannot let \nthem down.\n  The opposition warns that too many veterans are eligible for VA care \nand too many are depending upon VA for help. I take a different \napproach. I am thrilled that veterans are turning to VA for their care. \nFor years, we struggled to make the VA health care system something to \nbe proud of. And it has accomplished that. It is highly rated. It seems \ncruel now to tell veterans: Now that VA care is good, we are going to \nforce you out.\n  We must go beyond ``good enough.'' I urge my colleagues to support \nour alternative amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. With regard to what my friend from Hawaii has done today, \nI remind my colleagues that there has already been an increase in this \nbudget since a year ago. We are basically prioritizing our money to be \nspent where it is supposed to be. If you look at the total budget \ngrowth, it has grown from about $72.6 billion to $74.9 billion in the \nlast 5 years, an increase of around 50 percent. The result is a 69-\npercent increase in veterans health care since President Bush has taken \noffice. So we are not underspending. We are just not doing a very good \njob of assigning our priorities where the money should be spent.\n  We asked the VA to look at their costs to give us some idea of how \nthey are being more efficient now. The reporting of the VA has become a \nlot better. It gives us a better handle on where we should be spending \nthose dollars. My amendment does not shortchange any veteran. We just \nhave to do a better job in our priorities. We have asked the VA to be \noutcome-oriented, and the outcomes have been improved. Access to health \ncare has increased. The quality of care has increased. Patient \nsatisfaction is up to 83 percent. That was unheard of just 4 or 5 years \nago.\n  By asking for increases over and above, basically we are doing \nnothing more than engaging in a bidding war. I can use the auction \nmethod pretty easily because that is where I cut my teeth. I don't mean \nto make light of the process, but we have to draw the line somewhere.\n  I am a veteran. I respect the effort to take care of veterans. In our \nState of Montana, we now have outpatient clinics that are taking care \nof our veterans, not just at Fort Harrison but at several other \nlocations where veterans do not have to travel long distances either to \nget their drugs, be a part of their prescription drug programs or to \nget their health care. What we are doing with this amendment is putting \nthe money right back into the system where it should be spent. We are \npaying for it with no impact on the budget and without raising taxes.\n  I think my good friend from Hawaii raises taxes with his amendment. I \nthank him for his diligence and his love for veterans. I don't have any \nopposition to that. What we are doing right now is talking about how we \napproach taking care of these fine young men and women who find \nthemselves needing medical care that they can get nowhere else in \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the chairman for yielding. I will speak softly \ntoday because I am just recovering from laryngitis. I believed it was \nimportant, as chairman of the authorizing committee who proposed to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee the underlying budget proposal for the \nfunding of the VA for this coming year, that I discuss the Burns \namendment.\n  When I consider the Burns amendment, I feel the same way I felt with \nthe President's 2007 budget and the announcement for VA. On the one \nhand, I am pleased that the VA budget is a top priority during debate \non the budget resolution. It should be. America's veterans have always \nbeen and will remain a top priority of this Senate. On the other hand, \nI am sobered that the President and the underlying resolution propose a \n9.6-percent increase in funding for veterans medical care, with \nadditional revenue generated on top of that through various fee \nproposals on higher income veterans with no service-connected injuries. \nThe chart to my left clearly demonstrates my concerns. From 2001 to \nthis budget, it is visible what this Congress has done to fund \nveterans, a 69-percent increase in a very short time.\n  Let me remind everyone that there is plenty of money in the \nPresident's budget request for returning Iraqi veterans and Afghan \nveterans. They represent only 2 percent of VA's patient population. \nThey are and will remain our top priority, and they are funded. There \nis also plenty of money in the President's budget for the care of \nservice-connected veterans and low-income veterans. I believe those are \nstatements of fact. They should not be, nor do I believe they can be, \nchallenged. There are significant increases for important initiatives \nwe all support for our veterans: an additional $345 million for mental \nhealth services, including PTSD treatment; $64 million for homeless \nprograms; and $161 million for prosthetics and sensory aids.\n\n  The question before us now is the extent the Congress will fund \nmedical care services to every veteran who shows up at the door, \nirrespective of their income or their need for treatment associated \nwith a service-related disability. In other words, are our veterans \nhospital doors open for all?\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\n  Assuming the adoption of the Burns amendment, this resolution will \nassume a 12.4-percent increase in direct appropriations for VA medical \ncare. Senator Akaka is proposing an amendment of an increase of about \n15 percent, or may. Any way you cut it, the spending proposed for the \n2007 budget under either amendment will result in a 70-percent-plus \nincrease in VA medical care from 2001 to 2007. That is the reality of \nthe numbers being played within these amendments. Assuming a 12.4-\npercent rate of growth, VA medical care will double every 6 years. I \nnever dreamed when I became chairman of the VA Committee that in my \ntenure I could preside over a $100 billion-a-year VA budget.\n  These amendments simply advance that to a reality. With Senator \nAkaka's 15 percent annual growth, the budget would double every 5 \nyears. Is it right? Is it justifiable? Is it reasonable in today's care \nof America's veterans? The bottom line is this: At these rates, VA \nspending will soon collide with demands made on all other areas of \nGovernment. The President's budget proposal began to address the fiscal \nchallenge we faced. I thought he was responsible in doing it. I could \nnot deny that it was a responsible act, and I encouraged the Budget \nchairman to put it in the budget. I continue to believe those proposals \nwere eminently reasonable. However, I know that the majority of my \ncolleagues do not find these proposals reasonable. Why? In large part \nbecause every veteran service organization in the Nation doesn't want \nthem. They have lobbied and argued that they should not happen. I \nunderstand why.\n  I have also spoken directly to all of those organizations and \nsuggested if not now, when. If not now, when do we begin to face the \nreality of not a doubling every 6 years but a doubling every 5 years? \nWhen do we face the reality of VA colliding with Social Security and \nMedicare and Medicaid and the military defense budget itself? Those are \nthe realities we face in this Congress, not in 2007. We will not face \nthem because we are going to choose not to face them. I do not believe \nthat is responsible.\n  I am left with a tough decision. Without enactment of the President's \nproposal, the system will need an additional $800 million. That is what \nSenator Burns recognizes. That is what he is offering. I cannot in good \nconscience vote to purposefully underfund VA medical care, if the \nPresident's fee proposals will not be carried forward. Therefore, I \nwill support the Burns amendment. Is it fiscally responsible? I will \nleave that to the decision of fellow Senators.\n  What isn't fiscally responsible under today's budget system is to \nsuggest that we will double this budget every 5 years and have it \ncollide directly with every other program that is out there, without \nsaying to those veterans who are capable and able that if they want \nservice from the finest health care delivery system in the country \ntoday--and that is our VA--and they are not service connected and they \nare not disabled and they are income disqualified, that they ought not \npay $21 a month to gain access to the best health care system in the \ncountry. That is less than a carton of cigarettes. No, this Senate does \nnot have the political will to say so. Or $15 a month for a \npharmaceutical that could cost you $300. It is the best deal in the \ncountry, folks. I am proud of it. I defend it because I support our \nveterans. But I am also asking every veterans service organization, \nstarting today, working through next year, to help us find a solution \nto this problem other than just dumping billions more into it each year \nout of the general fund budget.\n  To suggest that these needs are not there is to deny reality, but to \nsuggest there are alternative and responsible ways of funding them is a \nreality we must face. Simply throwing more and more money at the budget \nis shirking that responsibility, especially when doing so sets up \npainful choices. I have spoken to them. Those choices collide directly \nwith Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. We won't face those \nchoices yet, either.\n  I want to avoid the painful choices because I want to make sure the \nVA system is there today for America's veterans and there tomorrow for \ntomorrow's veterans because our history would suggest to us there will \nbe tomorrow's veterans. We are a nation which has found it necessary \nfrom time to time to use force as an extension of our foreign policy \nfor the purpose of securing our freedoms and maintaining our Nation. \nThat policy approach produces a veteran. And because of that, in the \nwords of Abraham Lincoln, for he who hath borne the battle and for his \nwidow and for his orphan, that is our responsibility as a nation. The \nBurns amendment recognizes it in the broad sense. I believe it fails to \nrecognize the reality of where we must go in the long term. The \nPresident attempted that this year. I agreed with him. The Budget \nchairman agreed with him.\n  We will see where the Senate takes us. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21 minutes 14 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I say to my friends, the Senator from \nMontana and the Senator from Idaho, that we agree that veterans need \nquality care and services, but we differ on how much to provide for \nthis care and who is eligible.\n  I believe all veterans deserve access to quality care. I also believe \nthat we must make this a priority. I say again to my friends, VA health \ncare should grow, and that is not a bad reality. We spend exorbitant \namounts on these men and women while they are in active service. They \ndeserve our care when they are done serving.\n  The budget has gone up. Let's think about what we have purchased with \nthat budget: hundreds of new clinics, hundreds of thousands who never \nhad insurance and who can now come to the VA for world-class care, a \nleading research program, and a system where care is second to none. \nLet's not deny that health care costs money. We agree on that.\n  Indeed, there is an increase in the VA budget, but it undercounts the \nnumber of returning service members. It does not do enough for mental \nhealth, and it flat lines rehabilitation care.\n  As I have said, we are pleased that the President's budget is much \nbetter than last year's. This is not a bidding war; this is getting it \nright.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time on this amendment to \nSenator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Akaka for his \ntremendous leadership on this veterans issue. I couldn't agree with him \nmore. This isn't about a bidding war; this is about getting it right.\n  I want to, first of all, thank Senator Burns for his amendment \nbecause what it does is recognizes and acknowledges the serious problem \nwe have today in making sure we have the funds available to pay for the \nservices that our veterans not only deserve but were promised to them.\n  We are at a critical time in our Nation's history. We are at war. \nWhat message does it send to those we have sent overseas if we are \ntelling veterans today that they are going to have to pay copays and \nincreased fees once they return? What message does it send to those who \nare serving us overseas today that the veterans who have gone before \nthem are waiting in long lines, they are not getting help and the \npromises that were given to them?\n  What I appreciate is that Senator Burns' amendment acknowledges the \nserious challenge we have within this budget in making sure we meet the \nrising demand for our veterans today.\n  I know Senator Craig has said we have increased the VA budget \ndramatically. My colleagues all remember us last year having to come to \nthe floor to add billions of dollars to the veterans budget because we \nwere shorthanded. But, Mr. President, to many of us, you will recall, \nit was not a surprise. We have hundreds of thousands of men and women \nwho are coming home from a war in which we are currently engaged who \nare now needing to access veterans health care facilities. Of course, \nthere is an increased cost. At the same time, we have an aging Vietnam \nveterans population who are accessing our veterans health care \nservices. At the same time, health care across the board is increasing \nthe costs. Everyone who is\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\nproviding health care has to pay increased costs. So of course the VA \nbudget, as a health care system, has to increase its costs as well.\n  I also should remind my colleagues that because so many employers \ntoday cannot afford the cost of rising health care, they are not \nproviding health care to their employees, and those who are veterans \nare turning to the VA, increasing the numbers who access it, and they \nhave a right to do that.\n  On top of that, Medicare Part D, which we need to talk about, is \nalready a problem. Our folks across the country are calling in to ask: \nWhom do we sign up with for Medicare Part D? And they are being asked \nby our own DHS: Are you a veteran? And if they say, yes, they say: \nDon't sign up for Medicare Part D, go to the VA. That is great. They \ndeserve that, but it is increasing the numbers accessing our VA.\n  Yes, of course, the budget has gone up, but does it meet the need? \nThat is the test this country needs to consider and that we as Senators \nneed to consider in this budget.\n  Again, my colleague from Montana has acknowledged that in his \namendment. Here is where we have a problem. How do you pay for it, and \nwhen you pay for it, is it a reality?\n  This function 920 everybody is robbing from is merely saying that we \nare not going to increase the budget to pay for this, we are going to \npretend there is money out there. That may work very well now, but it \nwill not work when we get to next fall, probably after the election, \nand we actually are sitting down and writing our appropriations bills \nand passing them on this floor, within the cap of those appropriations \nbills, and there will not be the funding to increase this.\n\n  So let's not do some imaginary proposal and all go home and get well \non making sure we provide the services. We will be offering an \namendment with Senator Akaka that actually provides the increased \ncosts, to make sure we have the funding available.\n  The acknowledgment is clear on this floor. Charging our veterans a \nfee and a copay for health care that they were promised is not the \nright way to balance this budget.\n  Should we be providing tax cuts for the wealthiest or should we be \nproviding within our budget the means to keep the promises that were \nmade to those men and women who served our country honorably before and \nare serving it honorably today and, I might add, we will be asking \nanother generation, no doubt in the future, to serve us.\n  They will watch what we do on this floor. They will watch what we do \nand how it impacts us next fall and whether we have the actual money \nwithin our budgets to provide the health care that is promised when we \nask them to sign on the dotted line and serve our country in the \nfuture.\n  Although I commend the Senator from Montana for the sentiments in \nthis amendment, I actually believe the amendment coming from Senator \nAkaka and myself is the right amendment because it is not an empty \npromise. It actually is a promise fulfilled, and our veterans deserve \nthat.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I retain the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Texas in \nsupport of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Burns \namendment and ask to be added as a cosponsor.\n  It is very important that we add something to this budget to \naccommodate the extra needs we are seeing for veterans coming back from \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  I think it is especially important that we not make the decision \nright now about the copays. I do not support what is in the President's \nbudget regarding copays for the category 7 and category 8 veterans. I \nam looking for some alternatives that might bring in some income, that \nmight give health insurance capabilities to these people who have no \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  We are looking at some other threshold besides $27,000 annual income \nof a veteran who does not have service-related injuries. That is the \ndefinition of a category 7 and category 8 veteran. They are not \nveterans who have had service-related injuries, they are veterans who \nhave had no service-related injuries who make about $27,000 a year or \nmore. I think that is a pretty low floor.\n  I would like to look at ways to increase it to a higher floor or make \nsure they have access to health insurance, which many of them do not. I \nhaven't run the numbers on that, but I certainly think we should be \nworking with the veterans groups to determine what would be reasonable \nand still allow us to prioritize the health care for our veterans which \nis what all of us want.\n  Senator Burns is right, we need more research into prostheses. The \ngood news is that they are coming back, they are not being killed in \nwar, as we have seen in so many previous wars. But the bad news is they \nare losing limbs, and we need to help them have the very best \nprostheses they could possibly have and enhance their ability to use \nthem.\n  We will be working on those items. Senator Burns' amendment is the \nright approach because we do need to have that flexibility in this \nbudget to try to come up with the right approach. It is too early to \nsay what we are going to do with the President's proposal, that there \nbe a $250 enrollment fee for these category 7 and category 8 veterans. \nI thank the Senator from Montana for putting this amendment forward, \nand I certainly hope we will adopt his amendment, which I think is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am a proud original cosponsor of Senator \nBurns's amendment to the budget resolution that increases VA funding by \n$823 million. Properly caring for our veterans is our Nation's duty. We \nasked these men and women to risk their lives in service of our \ncountry, and medical care is the least our country can give in return.\n  The President's budget request for VA medical services assumes an \nadded $795 million in revenues; but it does this by more than doubling \ncopays and instituting a $250 enrollment fee for certain categories of \nveterans. The cost of $795 million then is shifted from the Government \nto veterans themselves.\n  Not only would many veterans have to pay higher fees under the \nPresident's proposals, but those who could not afford the fees would \nhave no choice but to abandon VA healthcare altogether.\n  Especially in a time of war, a policy that leads to increased denial \nof service to veterans is simply unacceptable. Battlefield medicine has \nmade huge strides in the last few decades. The result has been a much \nhigher percentage of wounded soldiers living through their initial \ninjuries, able to return home to their families. These wonderful \nadvances in medicine deserve and receive our praise, but they mean that \nthe VA will be caring for more and more injured soldiers as they return \nhome. And many of these injuries, such as burns, amputations, and \nblindness, are of the type that will require care for a lifetime. The \nUnited States owes these injured soldiers this care, and thus the funds \nto provide it should not come from other veterans.\n  Senator Burns' amendment will address these problems by adding $795 \nmillion to the VA budget in order to eliminate the higher copays and \nenrollment fees. Furthermore, it adds another $28 million to compensate \nfor cuts in VA medical R\n  I will proudly cast my vote for this veterans healthcare funding \nmeasure, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3007\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to call up amendment No. 3007 and \nask for its consideration.\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time on the amendment is yielded back, \nthe clerk will report the next amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], for himself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Bill Nelson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Schumer, \n     Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Obama, Mr. \n     Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Rockefeller, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3007.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase Veterans medical services funding by $1.5 billion \n     in FY 2007 to be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $1,350,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $135,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $1,350,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $135,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, increase the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $1,500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $1,350,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $135,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 24, increase the amount by $1,500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 25, increase the amount by $1,350,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 4, increase the amount by $135,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 8, increase the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 12, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 1, increase the amount by $1,500,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 2, increase the amount by $1,350,000,000.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Hawaii restate that \nunanimous consent request? He just yielded himself 10 minutes? I have \nno objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nRockefeller, Clinton, Durbin, Feingold, Dodd, Bingaman, and Lautenberg \nas cosponsors to amendment No. 3007.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand here with my \ncolleagues who join me in offering this veterans health care amendment \nwhich adds $1.5 billion for health care. What we have before us are two \ndifferent approaches, similar to what we had last year.\n  I want to take my colleagues back a year when we offered a similar \namendment to the budget resolution at that time. We argued that more \nattention must be given to mental health, prosthetics, and to keeping \nveterans from being homeless.\n  The opposition questioned our number, as there was the belief that \nthe VA could continue providing quality care with fewer resources. And \nthat belief prevailed. Our amendment was rejected at that time, \nvirtually along party lines. The prevailing votes were misled to \nbelieve that the budget year was too tight and that a much smaller \namount of funding was needed.\n  Unfortunately, this turned out to be the wrong course. Four months \nand two supplemental requests later we finally ended up with more \nfunding, nearly the exact amount we advocated for earlier in the year. \nWe must not repeat this mistake and we must get it right the first \ntime.\n  I want to say at the outset that the President's budget is much more \nrobust than his budget last year. The veterans called last year's \nbudget ``tight-fisted'' and ``miserly.'' I view this budget as a much \nbetter starting point.\n  What is again missing--in dollars and in deed--is this administration \nstill does not count caring for veterans as part of the cost of war. \nDefense spending for our servicemembers while in combat has necessarily \ngone up; accordingly, so must our commitment to caring for our veterans \nonce they return home.\n  We are all too familiar with the scenario last year. You remember the \nVA wildly underestimated the number of younger vets returning from Iraq \nand Afghanistan. And this year, the administration thinks even fewer \nvets will come for care. This is a terrific gamble, as this \nmiscalculation was one of the primary causes of last year's shortfall.\n  While I largely agree with the President on the overall amount needed \nfor VA health care this year, I take issue with how he chooses to fund \nthe system.\n  Let's make this crystal clear: The administration's approach and the \nresolution that is before us asks veterans to pay more for their care \nthrough increased copayments for medications and a new user fee for \nmiddle-income veterans. Our approach instead asks for appropriated \ndollars.\n  Middle-income veterans will see their prescription drug bills \ndoubled, and it forces veterans to pay a $250 fee for simply choosing \nVA as their health care provider. With these substantial new out-of-\npocket costs, the administration is banking on 200,000 veterans being \nunable to afford VA care.\n  Many have argued that a user fee imposed upon middle-income veterans \nis only fair. They say it equates to a modest sum each month. If my \nfriend, Lou Green, a veteran from the Korean war, living in New Jersey \non a fixed income, could stand here, he would ask which of his monthly \nexpenses would we have him forgo. If these proposals were enacted, his \nfive prescriptions would add $35 per month, and the new fee would add \n$21 per month. This would bring his new expenses to $670 a year. He \nwould have to choose which bills to pay. Would it be his medications? \nWould it be his gas bills for his car? Would it be the cost of heating \nhis home?\n  What we have heard much about is that the VA is already adequately \nfunded. The administration, and my friends on the other side of the \naisle, are claiming a 50-percent increase in veteran spending since the \nyear 2001.\n  Let there be no mistake: It is in fact Congress that has done the \nheavy lifting. Each year, it is the veterans' leaders in the Senate and \nHouse who go beyond what President Bush has proposed. The simple fact \nis that the administration has requested less than half of the new \nfunding made available to veterans during its tenure. Congress, by \napproving amendments to increase VA funding, has added another 39 \npercent of funding. Even with large increases since fiscal year 2001 \nthis is an average increase of less than 10 percent to accommodate high \nmedical care inflation and a high annual growth in patients. The growth \nin the number of patients is almost twice the amount in resources. \nThese facts underscore the need to support my amendment.\n  Our amendment would add $1.5 billion to the resolution in real money \nby closing tax loopholes. The Burns amendment is merely a budget \ngimmick which fails to raise the top line for VA funding. I would like \nto elaborate on how our $1.5 billion number was arrived at, and you can \nsee it on this chart.\n  We add $825 million to reject the policy proposals--the copay \nincrease and enrollment fee. In addition, there is a seldom-talked-\nabout proposal to discontinue the practice of using insurance moneys to \noffset out-of-pocket costs for veterans. Each of these proposals must \nbe rejected. It seems shortsighted and cruel to enact proposals which \nwill drive veterans out of the VA health care system.\n  The VA also requires funding to absorb new patient workload from new \nveterans returning home from both Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom \nand from older veterans who are just now turning to the VA. In the \nfirst quarter of this year, the VA saw a 21-percent increase in OIF/OEF \nveterans seeking VA care. They are now seeing 144,424 OIF/OEF veterans \ntotal. This is 32 percent more than they project for fiscal year 2007.\n\n  Our amendment adds $231 million, taking into account that new \nveterans are eligible for 2 years of VA care immediately upon their \nreturn and separation from service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask for additional time to complete my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the other amendment accepts the \nadministration's estimate, which already looks wrong.\n  Funding is added for vet centers and rehabilitative care--two \naccounts which did not fare well under the proposed budget. Both \nprograms are critically important. Vet centers are the first place \nreturning servicemembers go for care. Yet vet centers have continually \nbeen underfunded. Again, the alternative amendment provides not one \npenny more than the administration.\n  The amendment also provides funds to allow for a substantial increase \nin mental health care. Experts predict that as many as 30 percent of \nthose returning servicemembers may need some kind of mental health care \ntreatment, from basic readjustment counseling to care for debilitating \nPTSD.\n  A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation reported that 35 percent of Iraq veterans received mental \nhealth care during their first year home. Our amendment adds $321 \nmillion for mental health care. Again, the opposing amendment chooses \nto rely on the administration's estimate, despite these recent \nfindings.\n  Each year the Congress debates its priorities and concerns for our \nNation through the budgetary process. This is one of the few times the \ncitizens of this country can cut through the rhetoric and the \ncomplicated legislative maneuvers to see what each of us truly stands \nfor. This budget is a good starting point for our veterans, but we \ncertainly can and should do more.\n  At this time I yield to the Senator from Washington, my good friend, \nSenator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wonder if I might take a few moments to \nspeak in opposition, if it is all right with the Senator from \nWashington, and then also there are a couple of other housekeeping \nissues I would like to deal with.\n  No. 1, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time on the Burns \namendment on both sides be yielded back. I have checked with the other \nside, and they agreed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Second, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mikulski be \nadded as a cosponsor to the Burns amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Akaka \namendment. The reason I do is I am supporting the Burns amendment \nprimarily because it negates the need for the fee proposals in the \nPresident's budget and increases funding for research. The President \nalready provides an 11-percent increase from the fiscal year 2006 \nlevel, and over the years from 2001 it is a 69-percent increase. There \nmay be some increased needs as we move through the next budget year for \nveterans. If that happens, then I see no problem with us going ahead, \nand the Senate historically has always been more willing to put that \nmoney in an emergency supplemental.\n  The concern I have with the Akaka amendment is that it increases \ntaxes. There were a number of amendments that were offered--and I \nassume they will be offered on the floor--in the Budget Committee that \nraise taxes to take care of this program or that program. The point I \nwould make is that the tax reductions we did a number of years back \nhave served this economy well, and when you allow the economy to grow, \nthen all these programs are going to benefit indirectly because you \nincrease revenues to the Federal Government. I would like to elaborate \non that just a little bit before the Senator from Washington makes her \nstatement.\n  If I might just talk a little bit about some of the comments made by \nthe other side, in particular Senator Conrad, as to what happens when \nwe cut those taxes, reduced those taxes known as the President's \neconomic growth package. It was predicted that when we would do that we \nwould reduce employment. Senator Conrad noted for the record that the \nPresident has ``put us on a fiscal course that means lower \nemployment.'' In reality, employment went up as reflected in this \nchart. He predicted that there would be ``a raise in interest rates,'' \nthat the Republican budget would ``raise equilibrium real interest \nrates.'' That is Senator Conrad, again, in the Congressional Record.\n  In reality, interest rates have stayed down. The statement was made \nthat ``the economic growth package will crowd out private sector \ninvestment.'' Again, the comments were proven wrong by what happened to \nour economy. We see here that the private business investment surges.\n  Then, the ``determining the economic growth'' comment that was made \nby Senator Conrad, again in the Congressional Record, that ``the budget \nwill undermine potential gross domestic product and hurt economic \ngrowth,'' we see right here that we sustained economic growth.\n  So the bottom line is that when we cut taxes, we help the economy. So \nI think it is bad to try to increase taxes at a time when our economy \nis doing so well. That is the objection I have to the Akaka amendment.\n  I sympathize with him in making sure that we have enough money to \ntake care of our veterans, particularly at a time when we are in \nconflicts. But I also need to make sure we have some accountability as \nfar as taxpayer dollars are concerned, how they are spent. I think the \nPresident has been very generous with the 11-percent increase he is \nadvocating from 2006 to 2007. He does that without increasing taxes. He \nhas found a source of funding which negates the fees that were proposed \nin the President's budget a lot of us would just as soon not be there.\n  So I find myself supporting the Burns amendment and opposing the \nAkaka amendment pretty much based on tax issues that are in those two \namendments. I just think this would be the wrong time to increase \ntaxes, when it would have just the opposite effect of the tax cut we \nimplemented a few years back.\n  So I just wanted to make that point. I think on this side you are \ngoing to find that we all support veterans. I can't recall a year when \nwe haven't given substantial increases to veterans. But we also need to \nhave some accountability in this process, and I think we restore that \nthrough the Burns amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is just under 17 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Akaka and the amendment he \nhas offered today that will truly and in reality help make sure we keep \nthe promises we made to the men and women who serve this country \noverseas and who fought for us in the past and are fighting for us \ntoday and will be asked to fight for us in the future. These are people \nwho have served our country. They have kept us safe. They have \nsacrificed for each and every one of us, and now they need our help. \nThey need the support and the health care that was promised to them \nwhen they joined the service, and they need the health care and support \nin coming home and making sure that we have the services available to \nthem.\n  Unfortunately, the budget that is now before us is going to leave \nmany of those veterans who have served this country so honorably \nwithout health care, without job assistance, and without the support \nthey need to rebuild their lives on the homefront.\n  Any of my colleagues who have gone out to their State and talked to \nthese men and women, particularly the ones coming home today, you know \nthey are having a hard time with getting jobs, dealing with health care \nissues, dealing with posttraumatic stress syndrome, facing lines at our \nveterans facilities, and not being adequately served, much less those \nveterans who are facing the same long lines and who are being \nultimately denied care. Our veterans deserve better. That is why \nSenator Akaka and I are here today offering this amendment to provide \n$1.5 billion to keep that promise to America's veterans.\n  There are two amendments in the Chamber, one offered by Senator Burns\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\nand one offered by Senator Akaka. Our colleagues need to understand \nthat the amendment that has been offered by Senator Burns is window \ndressing. How do I know that? Because we were offered the same \namendment last year by, I believe it was Senator Ensign. And what \nhappened? As we warned our colleagues time and time again from the \nbeginning of last year until June, we are billions of dollars short in \nhealth care. Finally, in June, the VA Secretary came to us and he said: \nYou know what, you are right; we were $3 billion short. If we sit here \nin the Chamber and do an empty-promise amendment again, we are going to \nfind ourselves back in the same position.\n  The Akaka amendment adds real dollars. It puts real, actual money \ninto the budget, so next fall, when we are writing our appropriations \nbills, we have the capacity within the veterans subcommittee to make \nsure we can provide the real services our veterans were promised.\n  I believe our veterans deserve better, and I believe America can do \nbetter, and I believe the Senate ought to stand up right now when we \nare at war and tell those who are serving us that we are going to be \nthere for them and support the Akaka amendment which provides real \ndollars.\n  One of the real concerns I have with the budget that is in the \nChamber today, that Senator Akaka is trying to amend, is it balances \nthe VA health care dollars by assuming fees and copayments, new fees \nand new copayments to our veterans. I will tell you, I have talked to \nmany people who have served our country. Not one of them signed a form \nsaying, I will join the service and fight for my country with an \nasterisk on it, without the promise that we will provide the health \ncare for them when they come home. It is a disservice to those veterans \nnow for us to have a budget in the Chamber of the Senate that says, \nnever mind, now that you have served, now that you are home, now that \nyou need health care, we are going to charge you a fee, we are going to \ncharge you copayments which will dissuade you from getting the health \ncare that you need. That is really the wrong message to send. There is \nno fine print when someone signs up to serve our country saying \n``exclusions apply.'' For us to impose those fees is wrong, and I hope \nthis Senate goes on record today supporting the Akaka amendment that \nwill make sure that next fall when our budget is tight, there is money \nthere to make sure we are not having to come forward with proposals to \ndo that.\n\n  That is why it is so important that we support the Akaka amendment. \nIt is the real amendment in the Chamber. It is not an empty promise. It \nis not just a be-happy amendment, everything is great, we-supported-\nveterans amendment. It has real dollars in it, and it is absolutely \ncritical.\n  Senator Akaka has done an excellent job of defining what is in this \namendment. It is really critical that we help our Iraq war veterans who \nare making the transition back home with the $231 million for \ntransition assistance. Any one of us out talking to our veterans knows \nthey are having trouble coming home and getting a job and getting \nhealth care. This is critical outreach money, increasing support for \nPTSD and menatl health care.\n  Senator Durbin is on the floor. He has been a strong advocate for \nmaking sure we adequately fund PTSD for veterans out in rural \ncommunities who do not have access.\n  I talked to a woman the other day who was talking about the fact that \n80 percent of our Guard and Reserve are coming home and getting a \ndivorce. Divorce should not be a result of serving your country. We \nought to make sure we have the funds to help those in need, to make \nsure they transition back into our communities.\n  This amendment includes support for our veterans clinics, $81 \nmillion. Anyone who has been out there knows we do not have enough \nclinics available, especially in our rural communities, to make sure \nthose folks who have served us get the services they need. Importantly, \nthis amendment and this amendment alone eliminates the fees and \ncopayments that are a tax on our veterans, that this Senator says they \nshould not have to pay. I heard my colleagues from the other side say \nthis amendment raises taxes. What this amendment does is pay for this. \nSenator says they should not have to pay with real dollars by closing \ncorporate tax loopholes.\n  I would ask any one of us to go home and ask a corporation or ask a \nmillionaire: Are you willing to pay a little bit more to make sure that \nthose who served us are taken care of when they return home? I doubt \nany one of us will get a letter from any one of them saying: I am not \nwilling to pay.\n  The Akaka amendment is the real amendment. It provides real dollars, \nassures that when we are here next fall doing the VA budget that we \nactually have the dollars to make sure we are supporting our veterans. \nThis amendment is supported by the independent budget.\n  I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nletter from AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars in support of the Akaka \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Independent Budget,\n                                                   March 14, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the authors of The \n     Independent Budget, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars \n     of the United States, we are writing in support for the \n     Akaka-Murray VA Health Care Amendment, which would add $1.5 \n     billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical \n     care account in fiscal year (FY) 2007.\n       We firmly believe that asking veterans to pay for part of \n     the benefits a grateful nation provides for them is \n     fundamentally contrary to the spirit and principles \n     underlying the provision of benefits to veterans. No \n     requirement that veterans be burdened with co-payments is \n     justified, especially in a time of war.\n       To ensure that VA would have the necessary resources, your \n     amendment would mitigate additional burden otherwise intended \n     to be placed on sick and disabled veterans through the \n     expansion of VA's collection authority, increased co-\n     payments, and new enrollment fees. Moreover, this amendment \n     would provide additional funds for VA to treat Operations \n     Iraqi and Enduring Freedom veterans. Over 144,000 have \n     already sought care from the VA for such services as mental \n     health, readjustment counseling, and rehabilitative care, \n     which is well over the projected number of 109,191 for \n     FY2007.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of our nation's sick \n     and disabled veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n     David G. Greineder,\n       Deputy National Legislative Director, AMVETS\n     Richard B. Fuller,\n       National Legislative Director, Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America\n     Joseph A. Violante,\n       National Legislative Director, Disabled American Veterans\n     Dennis Cullinan,\n       National Legislative Director, Veterans of Foreign Wars of \n     the United States.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I commend Senator Akaka, and I tell my colleagues, when \nwe vote in a few minutes, you can vote for the Burns amendment if you \nwant to say: I support veterans. But if you want to make sure we are \nthere for our veterans when they come home with real dollars, you will \nvote for the Akaka amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Senator from Washington for her eloquent \nstatement. I know we have other Members who want to speak on this \namendment. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Durbin from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  How many of us in this Senate have been visiting with the families of \nveterans, welcoming the veterans home, being there when the soldiers \nare sent off to battle, standing and saying: We will not forget you--\ntrust us, we will not forget you? Now we have a chance to vote. And the \nAmerican people can judge whether we are going to remember these \nsoldiers and these veterans.\n  Senator Akaka and Senator Murray have come forward with an honest way \nof paying for the help veterans need. They have said it is not free. \nThey acknowledge that it is going to cost us, but they acknowledge that \nit is a promise we made. Did we not say to these young men and women: \nIf you will risk your life for America, if you\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nwill put your life on the line for our country, we will not forget you, \nwe will stand by you? And they come home, some of them wounded, some of \nthem broken in spirit, and need our help. As Senator Akaka has said, \nnow is the moment to stand up and say that we will be there.\n  There is an amendment to be offered on the other side without money. \nSenator Akaka does the responsible thing for our veterans.\n  We are going to say to the wealthiest among us and to the most \nprofitable corporations: You have to give back a little bit. Is that \nsuch a hard ask? Is that difficult for us to do at a time when we are \nasking hundreds of thousands of our sons and daughters, brothers and \nsisters, the husbands and wives of America, to give up parts of their \nlives in service of our country? Is it too much to ask that a wealthy \ncorporation give back a little bit so that these veterans will be taken \ncare of?\n  I have been out to Walter Reed. Senators on both sides of the aisle \nhave visited veterans. We meet these young men and women. Some of them \nhave lost a leg, an arm, sometimes two legs, some suffered head \ninjuries. They are fighting to come back through rehabilitation, and \nonce they have made it through the critical phase and they are back \nhome, we want the veterans hospitals to be there to help them, and that \nis what the Akaka amendment is all about, so that we keep that \ncommitment.\n  We know as well many of these veterans come back without any visible \nscars, but because of what they have seen, the stress they have lived \nunder, things they have been asked to do, they are haunted by that \nexperience. They don't want to lose their marriage. They don't want to \nturn to alcohol and drugs. They want the helping hand of counseling.\n  I went out to the Heinz VA Hospital outside Chicago and sat in on one \nof these sessions with these returning bright, strong, healthy looking \nsoldiers who were torn inside because of demons in their minds from \nwhat they had seen, and they sit there in counseling sessions and try \nto come to grips with the struggles that they have in their lives. \nShould we not be sitting there with them? Should we not give them the \nvery best counseling? That is what Senator Akaka proposes. The Senator \nchallenges this Senate not just to wave the flags in the parade but to \nstand up for the soldiers and the veterans who march behind those flags \nevery single day for America.\n  I am proud to support the Akaka and Murray amendment. I do not stand \nalone. Virtually every major veterans group in America knows that this \nis the real deal, the Akaka-Murray amendment is the real amendment. \nThat is why it has the support of so many organizations--the Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, Retired Enlistment \nAssociation, the American Legion. These are men and women we counted on \nfor America's safety and America's future. Now they count on us. I urge \nmy colleagues to join in supporting the Akaka-Murray amendment. It is \nthe real amendment to help our veterans.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, Senator Vitter has asked to be added as a \ncosponsor to the Burns amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I do not have any further speakers on this \nside of the aisle. I don't know whether Senator Akaka has any further \nspeakers on his side or whether he is willing to yield back some time.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I had another Member who had wanted to \nspeak. I would at this time reserve my time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he needs to Senator \nSalazar of Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii controls 3 minutes.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I would like to speak in support of \nSenator Akaka's amendment to provide an additional $1.5 billion in \nfunding for veterans' healthcare.\n  As our Nation struggles with a growing healthcare crisis, we can all \nagree that the VA healthcare system serves as an example for how \nhealthcare should be provided. In addition, through its medical \nresearch programs, the VA is frequently responsible for great strides \nin medical science that contribute significantly to the quality of \nhealthcare services across the country.\n  We owe it to our service members, our veterans, and our Nation to be \nhonest about our needs, and to provide funding adequate to meet those \nneeds.\n  While this budget represents an improvement in terms of VA healthcare \nover last year's budget, it continues to propose revenue-generating \npolicies that would increase costs for our Nation's veterans and serve \nto drive many of those veterans out of the system.\n  For example, the administration has once again proposed to raise \npremiums and co-pays for Priority 7 and 8 veterans. But we all know the \nimpact these policies will have on veterans in our States--over 27,000 \nveterans in my State of Colorado alone would be forced out of the \nsystem.\n  This amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, would add $1.5 billion \nin funding for VA medical services, and would offset that increase by \nclosing corporate tax loopholes. It would ensure adequate funding for \nVA healthcare without increasing costs for Priority 7 and 8 veterans, \nand would provide needed resources for the specific areas of mental \nhealth, readjustment counseling, and rehabilitative care.\n  At a time when some of our veterans are returning home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, it is important that we stand up as a Senate in full \nsupport of our veterans.\n  Our veterans deserve better. They deserve our support of Senator \nAkaka's amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this important \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue on which I hope \nwe can find common ground--veterans care.\n  At this moment, we are debating two different amendments; one is very \ngood, the other is significantly better. I remind my colleagues that we \nwere in the same position almost exactly 1 year ago.\n  In March of last year, we stood here and debated competing veterans \namendments. The Senate voted down an amendment by Senator Akaka 47 to \n53. It instead embraced a smaller amendment by Senator Ensign. Just a \nfew months later, we learned the VA would face a billion-dollar budget \nshortfall. This shortfall was avoidable, regrettable, and threatened \ncare for our veterans.\n  I know that none of us wants to relive the experience of last summer. \nWe don't want to have to explain to our veterans why we didn't support \nthem, why we didn't demand a budget that matched their sacrifice, why \nwe yet again took the President's word on how much funding our veterans \nneeded.\n  Senator Burns' amendment is a good step forward. It eliminates, for \nthe fourth year in a row, the President's proposal to establish a new \nenrollment fee and double prescription drug copayments for Priority 7 \nand 8 veterans. That proposal would have balanced the budget on the \nbacks of moderate-income veterans. It sends the wrong message to our \ntroops in Iraq. I urge my colleagues to vote for Senator Burns' \namendment.\n  But like last year, Senator Akaka's bill offers a better option, \ngrounded in real estimates of the VA's need. In addition to blocking \nthe new fees, Senator Akaka's amendment would add $231 million for \ntreating Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. The underestimation of this \nworkload was one of the major contributors to the shortfall crisis last \nyear.\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\n  It also would add $321 million for mental health initiatives. A \nrecent Army report indicates that more than one-third of soldiers and \nmarines who served in Iraq have subsequently sought mental health care. \nThis is a rate that is higher than in other recent conflicts. The \nreport may even understate the issue because two-thirds of Iraq \nveterans who screened positive for PTSD and other psychiatric disorders \nare not receiving treatment, according to The Washington Post.\n  It would add $122 million for readjustment counseling at vet centers, \nand rehabilitative care. These are areas that desperately need \nadditional resources.\n  Today, we have thousands of brave men and women risking their lives \nfor us halfway around the world. At home, we have millions more who \nwere equally courageous in defending our freedom in previous wars and \nconflicts. When it comes to honoring these soldiers and these veterans, \nwe can and must do more.\n  Today, the state of care for America's veterans is not worthy of \ntheir service to this country. The VA, for example, continues to insist \non banning new Priority 8 enrollments. Through this ban, the VA has \ndenied health care to 260,000 vets who assumed upon enlistment that a \nworking class salary of $25,000 wouldn't prevent them from receiving \nthe health care they were promised. In Illinois, 8,944 Illinois \nveterans were denied health care through the ban just in the last year.\n  When it comes to America's veterans, it is not only our patriotic \nduty to care, it is also our moral duty. When our troops return from \nbattle, we should welcome them with the promise of opportunity, not the \nthreat of poverty.\n  Senator Burns' amendment is an improvement over the President's \noriginal budget. But given this President's record of underestimating \nveterans' budgets in the past, we must do more.\n  It is time to reassess our priorities. A budget is more than a series \nof numbers on a page; it is the embodiment of our values. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Akaka amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the proposed budget, while far more \nrealistic than previous years, falls short of our commitment to \nAmerica's veterans. The amendment would provide an additional $1.5 \nbillion for VA health care in fiscal year 2007, improving funding for \nmental health, vet centers, and rehabilitative care, among others. The \nincrease would be offset by closing corporate tax loopholes, rather \nthan by increasing overall taxes. I am pleased to cosponsor this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  We have a moral responsibility to provide this care to all veterans, \nregardless of income. This amendment removes both the $250 enrollment \nfee for Priority 7 and 8 veterans, and the copay increase from $8 to \n$15. While these amounts may seem inconsequential to some, many of \nthese veterans make as little as $26,902 a year. At this income level, \nsuch added expense forces difficult choices between essential needs. \nAll veterans have served our country without reservation. Our \ncommitment to them should not be contingent on income level.\n  The VA faces a growing challenge as soldiers return to their homes \nand families from Iraq and Afghanistan. Their return will impose new \ndemands for care directly related to injuries and experiences in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and for routine health care. Growing demand, coupled \nwith the rising costs of health care nationally, increases pressure on \nthe VA budget. We must ensure that the VA has adequate funding to meet \nthese growing costs.\n  This amendment provides support for an essential program and has a \nfiscally responsible source of funding. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of this amendment. Our moral responsibility to America's veterans \nmust not be limited.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of an amendment \nto the budget resolution that would provide an additional $1.5 billion \nfor our veterans. I am a cosponsor of this amendment because this \nbudget's modest increase in veterans funding is only a small step \ntoward addressing the needs of veterans in Arkansas and across the \ncountry. It does not go far enough.\n  I continue to hear from Arkansas veterans who have been subject to \nincreasingly long waiting lists for VA hospital appointments and who \nhave experienced unnecessary hardships because the VA does not have the \nresources to process their benefits applications in a timely manner. \nThis situation is unacceptable and our veterans deserve better.\n  As we look to the VA to provide for our growing veterans population \nand to meet the evolving health care needs of our returning brave men \nand women in uniform, we must ensure that the VA is provided with the \nresources it desperately needs to meet these challenges.\n  This amendment, which I am proud to support and cosponsor, would \nenable the VA to better absorb the new veterans being added to the \nsystem and would provide much-needed funding for the growing mental \nhealth care needs of our veterans. Additionally, this amendment rejects \nthe budget provisions proposed by the President that would impose a \n$250 enrollment fee and a doubling of the cost of prescription drug \ncopayments from $8 to $15. These provisions would force thousands of \nmiddle-income veterans to pay substantially more for their care.\n  As the daughter of a Korean war veteran, I was taught from an early \nage about the sacrifices our troops have to make to keep our Nation \nfree, and have been grateful for the service of so many of our brave \nmen and women from the State of Arkansas. On behalf of them and their \nfamilies, I will continue to fight to ensure they are provided with the \nbenefits, pay, and health care that they have earned. It is the least \nwe can do for those whom we owe so much and to reassure future \ngenerations that a grateful Nation will not forget them when their \nmilitary service is complete. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment because it is our moral responsibility to do so. It is the \nright thing to do and it should be a priority for each and every one of \nus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for that excellent \nstatement.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we yield back the remainder of our time on \nthe Akaka amendment.\n  I believe the next amendment in order will be the Talent-Cantwell \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3019\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Talent], for himself and \n     Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n     Johnson, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. Coleman, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3019.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide $99,000,000 in COPS Hot Spots funding as \n                   authorized in the Combat Meth Act)\n\n       On page 24, line 24, increase the amount by $99,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $99,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $99,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $99,000,000.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment with my \ncolleague from California, Senator Feinstein, to provide additional \nfunding for the COPS Hot Spots Program.\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\n  I am grateful, also, for Senator Cantwell's work in this area and her \ncommitment to provide additional funding to help our law enforcement \nofficers in fighting methamphetamine. As my colleagues know, last week \nPresident Bush signed into law the most comprehensive \nantimethamphetamine legislation ever offered in the Congress, much less \npassed. I am pleased we were able to pass an initiative that is going \nto reduce the number of methamphetamine labs around the country and \ntherefore the number of methamphetamine addicts and kids who are raised \nin settings where there are toxic meth labs. That legislation is going \nto reduce the number of fires related to methamphetamines but this is \nnot a fight that is ever over.\n  Methamphetamine is the most deadly, fiercely addictive, and rapidly \nspreading drug America has ever known. The drug is not only sold and \nconsumed in our neighborhoods--that would be bad enough--it is made \nthere as well using a toxic process that combines cold medications with \nharmful chemicals such as iodine, ammonia, starter fluid, drain \ncleaner, and rubbing alcohol. The hazardous byproducts of meth \nproduction threaten the health and life of those making the drug, but \nalso their families, the communities around them, as well as law \nenforcement officers who respond when somebody spots the meth lab.\n  These makeshift chemistry laboratories are found in homes, in hotels, \neven the trunks of cars. In addition to the risks of those around the \nlabs, these kinds of laboratories create a huge amount of environmental \nwaste. Cleaning up even one of the laboratories can cost $10,000 or \nmore. That cost alone is devastating to the budgets of State and local \ngovernments around the country.\n  That is one of the reasons the National Association of Counties lists \nmethamphetamine as the No. 1 problem counties are confronting.\n  Among the many provisions in the Combat Meth Act that was passed as \npart of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization last week is a provision that \nauthorizes an additional $99 million per year for the next 5 years \nunder the COPS Meth Hot Spots Program, which is a program designed to \ntrain State and local law enforcement to investigate and lock up meth \noffenders, and also to expand the funding available for personnel and \nequipment for enforcement, prosecution, and environmental cleanup. This \nadditional $99 million is meant to supplement the $63 million that is \nalready authorized under the Hot Spots Program.\n  I cosponsored an amendment with my colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. \nLincoln, to restore full funding to that account. This assistance to \nState and local agencies has a national impact in importance.\n  I know many of my colleagues have seen firsthand the immense need for \nand benefit of this funding. State and local law enforcement personnel \nare fighting on the front lines in the struggle to stop drug \ntrafficking. They need our help.\n  I urge the Senate to vote in favor of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as \ncosponsors: Senators Lincoln, Smith, Biden, Cantwell, Kohl, Harkin, \nBayh, Wyden, Johnson, Dole, and Coleman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, as the Senate can see, methamphetamine is \nnot a partisan issue. There is strong support on both sides of the \naisle for fighting this drug and for this amendment.\n  I urge the Senate to support it.\n  Senator Feinstein has done great work in this area. I know she would \nlike to be here to speak. I do not know if she will be able to get down \nto speak on it. I congratulate her again on her leadership in this \nfield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me indicate that on our side Senator \nCantwell had this very same amendment funded in a somewhat different \nway. Nonetheless, it is the identical amendment. The two Senators have \nagreed to make this the Talent-Cantwell amendment because that \neliminates, then, one amendment that we would otherwise have voted on. \nI thank Senator Cantwell for her leadership. I very much thank her for \nher willingness to work together with Senator Talent to achieve this \nbipartisan amendment.\n  I also want to say how critically important dealing with this \nmethamphetamine threat is. I just held a Budget Committee hearing in \nNorth Dakota with the attorney general of North Dakota, the U.S. \nattorney from North Dakota, the State's attorney in the affected \ncounty, and with the heads of law enforcement. Without exception they \ntold me the meth threat is the worst thing they have ever faced in \nterms of a drug; that it is destroying people's lives.\n  I was recently at a meeting. The man next to me was clearly terribly \nupset--somebody I have known for a long time, a prominent member of our \ncommunity in North Dakota. Finally, he told me his son had that day \nbeen diagnosed as a methamphetamine addict. He told me it was \ndestroying his family, that he was on the brink of bankruptcy as a \nresult of a long meth addiction by his son, a meth addiction that was \nproving extremely difficult to treat.\n  We need more money for prosecutors. We need more money for law \nenforcement. We need more money for treatment.\n  This meth epidemic, which may have started in rural areas--I know \nsome of our colleagues in urban areas have acted as though they are not \naware of this, that this is not on their agenda. Let me assure Members, \nit will be on their agenda because we have never seen anything worse. \nNothing has affected rural communities in a more adverse way than this \nmeth epidemic.\n  I again thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership and for \nher willingness to work across the aisle to come up with a bipartisan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I rise in support of this amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Missouri who has played a leadership role in trying to \ntackle a very difficult problem that is impacting various parts of our \ncountry. It is unfortunate the parts of our country that have seen this \nproblem have to come to the Senate and wage this battle to convince \npeople who have not had this problem occurring in their communities how \nimportant it is.\n  I say that because if we do not fight meth and combat it on a \nnationwide basis, we will see the meth problem continue to grow across \nthe country. That is why this particular amendment is so important.\n  Two weeks ago we took an important step in combating this crisis by \npassing legislation to actually authorize a comprehensive program to \ncombat meth across the country and in the Hot Spots Program. In \nWashington State, we have seen methamphetamine grow, first being the \nsecond State in the Union with the number of meth drug labs. Only with \na comprehensive approach by law enforcement, prevention, and a variety \nof people in the community were we able to lower that ranking from \nsecond in the country down to fifth in the country. While we have made \nsome progress, unfortunately, we pushed the problem to our neighboring \nState to the south and Oregon became the No. 1 spot in the country for \nmeth labs.\n  As we have lowered the number of meth labs being discovered in \nWashington State, we also saw a different effect taking place, an \nactual increase in the number of deaths related to methamphetamine. We \nsaw the superlabs coming in, in bigger and stronger positions, trying \nto continue to move this deadly product through our communities.\n  What the Combat Meth Act does is provide resources to State and local \nGovernments, law enforcement and investigative teams in shutting down \nlabs, investigating the violent crimes, educating the public, and \nhelping children impacted by this terrible product. In one county \nalone--the Presiding Officer will understand because it is a \nneighboring county to his State--in the city of Spokane, 90 percent of \nidentity theft and 70 percent of burglaries are related to \nmethamphetamine. During the bust of meth houses in Spokane County, \npolice find children at least 50 percent of the time. This is a problem \nthat is much more comprehensive in the impact it is having on \ncommunities than people realize.\n  When we have a meth house in a community, it not only impacts that\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\nparticular neighborhood and community, but it impacts law enforcement \nwho also have to come in and investigate and clean up the drug labs. We \nknow of law enforcement officers injured from trying to fight this \nproblem by not having the proper equipment when going into these \nlocations.\n  This is a problem that is not small or isolated or one that is going \nto be fought and won in 1 year's battle. That is why we need to support \nthis amendment today and continue our efforts, not just authorizing but \nactually appropriating the resources to fight this problem.\n  We must continue to be true to what we have said, that we believe \nthis battle is worth fighting and that we are going to provide the \nresources to do so.\n  I applaud my colleague from Missouri for his leadership on this \nissue. I am sure the people of Missouri, as in Washington State and \nother places throughout the country who have this problem, know how \nimportant it is to battle this issue.\n  It is important we realize a comprehensive approach is showing \nsuccess. In Washington, we have seen a comprehensive approach has \nactually educated more people and the public to understand how one use \nof methamphetamine can be so addicting and lead to such a devastating \nresult, for individuals, families, communities, and to everyone \nimpacted in its path.\n  I applaud my colleague from Missouri for his leadership. I am glad to \njoin him in this bipartisan effort. I also congratulate Senator \nFeinstein who has made this a priority, and to our budget leader for \nhis help in this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor to the Talent-Cantwell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be added \nto the Conrad-Feingold amendment on pay-go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman is available.\n  How much time remains on the Talent-Cantwell amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 56 minutes remaining in favor of the \namendment and 52 minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I don't think that is correct. We only had an hour \navailable on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The previous order did not cover this \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will allow me, I suggest we go to the \namendment of Senator Bingaman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Bingaman wishes to speak on the Cantwell \namendment for 2 minutes and then to his amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That will take us to 3 o'clock, at which time we will be \nvoting.\n  I yield to Senator Bingaman 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I congratulate \nSenator Talent and Senator Cantwell for their leadership on this \namendment related to methamphetamine use and the epidemic of that use \nin my State and in many parts of the country.\n  I have had a series of meetings with law enforcement and local \nofficials throughout New Mexico over the last year. During that time, \none thing rings loudly and clearly: That is that the chief law \nenforcement problem facing many of our communities in New Mexico is \nmethamphetamine use; not just the use itself but all of the resulting \ncrime that occurs by virtue of people using this terrible drug.\n  The addiction is very difficult to shake once you become addicted. We \nhave done way too little to alert young people in our country, as well \nas adults, about the dangers involved. We see catastrophic, tragic \nresults in many of our communities.\n  This funding will help. It will allow the Federal Government to \nassist local law enforcement to some extent in coming to grips with \nthis. I compliment the Senators on this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nCOPS Hot Spots amendment to S. Con. Res. 83, the budget resolution, \nwhich increases funding for the Meth Hot Spots program to $99 million. \nLast week, the Combat Meth Act was signed into law as part of the \nlarger USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization measure. The Combat Meth Act is \ndesigned to stop the production, sale, and use of methamphetamines. It \nauthorizes funding for the Meth Hot Spots program, which trains local \nand State law enforcement officials to combat this destructive and \naddictive drug.\n  Illegal drugs are a devastating problem in communities across the \ncountry. The production and abuse of methamphetamine, more commonly \nknown as ``meth,'' has become rampant in recent years, especially in \nrural areas--including many counties in Nevada.\n  In 2005, 50 meth labs were busted in Nevada alone. This drug affects \nthe health of those who consume it, destroys families, and harms the \nfuture of our communities. This drug is especially dangerous because it \nis extremely addictive, inexpensive to manufacture, and created from \ncommon household products.\n  There is no doubt meth is sweeping the Nation, and we must work \ntogether to stop it. Despite the fact that many of our Nation's \ncommunities, especially those in rural areas, are fighting valiantly \nagainst the devastating effects of this drug, the President's fiscal \nyear 2007 budget provides only $40 million for the Meth Hot Spots \nprogram, nearly a 24 percent decrease from fiscal year 2006.\n  Meth is insidious; it literally robs its victims of their lives. We \nmust aid local enforcement, as well as fund treatment and prevention \nefforts, if we are to emerge victorious.\n  I applaud the Senate for accepting this amendment in light of the \nPresident's decision to try to slash funding for this important \nprogram. I urge my colleagues to maintain this funding in the final \nversion of the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Talent \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3019) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank again both Senator Cantwell and \nSenator Talent for the work on that amendment, first, for working \ntogether to come up with an amendment that is bipartisan; second, for \nthe good manners to the rest of the Members of the Senate for agreeing \nto take a voice vote. That is an excellent example for others. We \ndeeply appreciate Senators accommodating the work of the Senate on this \nmatter.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Collins be added as a cosponsor of my \npay-go amendment numbered 3013.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3039\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3039.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and many of my colleagues does three things. First, it \nfulfills the commitment to secure affordable and clean energy that we \nmade in the Energy bill we passed through the Congress last year, which \nis a commitment that has been essentially not honored by the \nadministration in the budget they have sent to us and not honored in \nthis budget resolution.\n  The second thing the amendment does is enable us to take the major \nstep forward to clean and affordable electricity beyond what was \ncontained in the Energy bill by extending for 4 years the renewable \nenergy production tax credit.\n  Third, the amendment accomplishes these goals in a budget-neutral \nfashion. In fact, the amendment overall reduces the deficit by $3.2 \nbillion over 5 years because it raises more funds than it would spend \nby assuming the reinstatement of the superfund tax.\n  Every Senator knows that America faces huge energy challenges. Energy \nprices and energy security are among the top concerns we hear about as \nwe go around our State. Americans want their energy to be more secure, \nthey want it to be more affordable, and they want it to be cleaner. \nEvery one of us has devoted a lot of our time in the last three \nCongresses to developing legislation that delivers secure, affordable, \nand clean energy. Last year, we were successful in passing the first \ncomprehensive energy bill in 13 years, the Energy Policy Act of 2005. \nWe did so after repeated requests from the White House to send the \nPresident a comprehensive energy bill. It was a substantial bipartisan \naccomplishment.\n  The President, of course, spoke very glowingly about this legislation \nwhen he signed the bill last August in my home State of New Mexico. If \nwe finally have a new energy strategy for the 21st century, as the \nPresident said we do now, then where is the funding to implement that \nstrategy when it comes to energy? Where is the beef in this budget \nresolution? If we look at the budget that was sent to the Congress in \nearly February by the President and at this budget resolution, you \nwould have a hard time finding that beef.\n  Let's begin with the President's budget request. Instead of making a \nstrong push forward on programs to deliver new forms of secure and \naffordable energy, the administration budget request basically treads \nwater. The bottom line proposed for the Department of Energy in the new \nbudget is almost exactly the same funding level as the current fiscal \nyear. Some individual programs are up, other programs that are equally \nimportant to our energy security and to affordable energy are cut.\n  When you look at this budget resolution, you also see an energy \npolicy that is dead in the water. The budget resolution has a specific \nfunction that is devoted to energy. That is function 270. In the tables \nthat have been distributed by the chairman of the Committee on the \nBudget describing the mark he has presented to the Senate, \ndiscretionary spending in the energy function, function 270, falls from \n$3.84 billion in the current fiscal year to $3.83 billion next year. In \nfact, the projected spending on energy in 4 out of the next 5 fiscal \nyears in this budget resolution is less than we are spending this year \non energy. I don't think it is acceptable to have an energy policy over \nthe next 5 years that is basically a policy of less of the same. That \nis not what we voted for. That is not what we supported last year when \nwe passed the Energy bill.\n  Let me describe in detail the areas in which this Amendment will \nenable us to meet the challenges of energy security and affordability.\n  The first area is the area of energy efficiency. Nothing lowers your \nenergy bill more than saving energy. Nothing makes us less dependent on \nforeign oil than using less of it. Maximizing the usefulness of every \nbarrel of oil we consume and every watt of electricity we generate \nenjoys broad bipartisan support because it is almost a no-brainer. For \nthat it was very disappointing to see major cuts to energy efficiency \nbeing proposed by the administration and being carried forward in this \nbudget resolution.\n  The disconnect on saving energy dollars and being more secure through \nefficiency is even more striking, because energy efficiency is one of \nthe areas of the energy bill that the President singled out for praise \nwhen he signed it.\n  Here are his words:\n\n       The bill makes an unprecedented commitment to energy \n     conservation and efficiency--an unprecedented commitment. The \n     bill sets higher efficiency standards for federal buildings \n     and for household products. It directs the Department of \n     Transportation to study the potential for sensible \n     improvements in fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks \n     and SUVs. It authorizes new funding for research into \n     cutting-edge technologies that will help us do more with less \n     energy.\n\n  Yet in this first budget that we are getting after the enactment of \nthe bill, those authorizations for cutting-edge energy efficiency \ntechnologies are being cut, as is funding for energy efficiency in many \nother programs.\n  I think that this budget resolution needs to keep the commitment to \nenergy efficiency in the Energy Policy Act that the President praised, \nand then his administration ignored.\n  In the area of transportation vehicles, we have identified $629 \nmillion of funding, over what the President proposed, that would be \nrequired to meet the levels we all authorized when we voted for the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2006, including:\n  This amendment would allow full funding for the advanced vehicle \ndeployment programs at the Department of Energy.\n  It would accelerate new hybrid vehicle technologies into the market.\n  It would encourage the development of engines that would run \nbiodiesel.\n  It would give a strong push to fuel cells in school buses and transit \nbuses, and would make the Federal government a leading-edge customer \nfor fuel cells.\n  This amendment would bolster other technology programs for vehicle \nefficiency, and provide full funding for the\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\nhydrogen research and development programs contained in the Energy \nPolicy Act. There was a lot of enthusiasm in the Senate last year for \nthe long-term promise of hydrogen-fueled vehicles. But the current \nbudget proposal short-changes these hydrogen programs, compared to what \nwe authorized, by $268 million. If we want to see a technological \nrevolution in the long term that takes us toward hydrogen-powered cars, \nthen we need to step up the funding at the Department of Energy beyond \nwhat this budget resolution will allow.\n  Another key area in keeping energy affordable relates to the \nefficiency with which we heat and cool buildings, and the energy we use \nwhen operating appliances in our homes and commercial equipment in the \nworkplace. This winter, consumers have been paying unprecedented prices \nfor heating oil and natural gas. And we have been lucky--the \nexceptionally mild winter prevented us from seeing sharp price spikes \nand spot shortages resulting from the loss of natural gas and oil \nproduction from the hurricanes of last year. But consumers are still \npaying too much for energy, and improved energy efficiency can make a \nreal difference to families struggling to pay the bill from one month \nto the next.\n  In this area, the administration's budget request makes some \ncompletely wrongheaded choices. For example, there has long been a \nFederal program to help States implement weatherization programs to \nreduce energy waste and save consumers money. By all accounts, it is an \neffective way to help cut monthly energy bills for working families. In \nthe Energy Policy Act, we slated that program for a substantial \nincrease. In the administration's budget request, though, that program \nis going to be cut by 32 percent. That makes no sense, so my amendment \nto this resolution provides for the full funding of weatherization \nprograms, as well as other State energy programs to help consumers, at \nthe levels we all agreed to in the Energy Policy Act last year.\n  In the area of energy efficiency for affordability, then, this \namendment would add $1.17 billion. That's the amount that we have \nauthorized for these programs last year that the administration left \nout of its budget request. This funding would fully support key new \nprograms to help keep energy costs down for consumers.\n  It would fund rebate programs for energy-efficient appliances.\n  It would help utilities with new programs to encourage their \ncustomers to save energy.\n  It would help States improve their building codes for energy \nefficiency.\n  It would accelerate Federal energy conservation standards.\n  It would capitalize on opportunities to save energy in low-income \ncommunities, where some of the most energy-inefficient buildings and \nequipment can be found.\n  Finally, this amendment provides full funding for the energy \nefficiency research and development authorized last year by the Energy \nPolicy Act. The administration's budget request was $462 million short \nof what we agreed made sense for these programs in the Energy Policy \nAct and we provide this additional funding, that will make American \nindustries--like our steel, aluminum, and forest industries--more \ncompetitive by lowering their energy requirements. This funding will \nalso allow us to make a stronger push towards the next generation of \nlighting, in which the old incandescent bulb, which wastes most of the \nenergy you put in it as heat, is replaced(, by semiconductor lighting \nthat is incredibly long-lived and energy efficient.\n  Saving energy through conservation is one way in which we can make \nenergy more affordable. But conservation is just part of the answer. We \nalso need to develop new supplies of clean energy to meet our future \nneeds.\n  All of us are concerned about the security implications of our \ndependence on foreign oil. Improved transportation efficiency is one \nkey part of the solution, but so is greater reliance on domestic \nsources of energy for transportation. One area that captured a great \ndeal of attention and support in the Energy Policy Act is making \nethanol out of cellulosic plant materials. This would expand the \nresource base for ethanol beyond cornstarch, which is the current \nfeedstock for making ethanol. It would allow ethanol to be made in a \nwider geographic area than the Midwest. This is important, because \nethanol is difficult to transport in pipelines and needs to be trucked \nto fuel terminals in order to be mixed into gasoline. The energy bill \nauthorized a half billion dollars in production incentives and \nconversion assistance for making ethanol from cellulosic biomass. The \nadministration's budget request did not include any funding for this \npurpose. The budget amendment I have offered would allow for full \nfunding for important initiatives in the production of ethanol from \ncellulose.\n  This amendment also allows for full funding of the renewable energy \nresearch and development programs in the energy Policy Act. In the \nBudget request, the administration proposed to terminate research and \ndevelopment programs in geothermal energy and in hydropower. These are \nimportant resources that we can't ignore as part of the energy mix. If \nmy amendment were adopted, they could be fully funded, instead of being \nterminated.\n  Finally the area of renewable energy production, this amendment takes \nthe first big step beyond the Energy Policy Act. The Energy Policy Act \nexpanded the renewable production tax credit, and created a companion \nClean Renewable Energy Bond program for public power. Both the tax \ncredit and the bonds aimed at stimulating the construction of new \ncapacity for generating electricity from solar, wind, biomass, \ngeothermal, and other renewable energy sources. These fiscal \nincentives, though, expire on December 31, 2007. To qualify, generating \nfacilities have to be placed in service by that date, which is less \nthan 2 years away. That means that these incentives are not going to be \nstimulating much activity over the next year, because unless your \nproject is already well along, you will not be completed in time to \nbenefit from the tax credit or the bond.\n  My amendment allows for a 4-year extension of both the renewable \nenergy production tax credit, and the comparable Clean Renewable Energy \nBonds. We need to get these fiscal incentives on a time scale that \nactually matches the requirements of putting electric generation \nconstruction projects together. I believe that there is tremendous \ninterest in building new renewable electricity capacity in this \ncountry. If we could give the market the certainty of knowing that this \ntax credit would remain in place until 2011, at this juncture, I \nbelieve that we would see an explosion of new construction. That would \nhelp us in two important ways. First, the new renewable generation \nwould tend to back out power generated by natural gas, which would take \npressure off of natural gas prices. All consumers would benefit from \nthat. Second, the additional construction would provide employment both \nin States with renewable resources and States where renewable energy \ngeneration equipment is manufactured.\n  Right now, the extension of these fiscal incentives for energy \nproduction is not in the budget resolution or in the plans of the \nFinance Committee for this year. If this amendment were to pass, \nthough, we would have the resources to act on extending this tax credit \nin this Congress, when it can do the most good.\n  This amendment also adds funding for a variety of other secure, \naffordable, and clean energy generation technologies that were left out \nof the administration's budget request.\n  It fully funds the Clean Coal Technology program, which received \nalmost no funding in the administration's proposals. This program is \nessential to helping coal find a place in the generation mix of the \nfuture, which will place a premium on controlling emissions and \ncapturing carbon. This amendment also makes a major commitment on \ndistributed electric generation technology, which is likely to have \ngreater overall system efficiencies.\n  This amendment also allows us to fix one of the most glaring errors \nin the administration's energy budget request--its recommendation that \nwe terminate all domestic oil and gas research and development \nprograms. For a country facing $60-per-barrel oil and high natural gas \nprices, the idea that we will cut off R spending for domestic \nproduction is a little bizarre.\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\nWhen you realize that most of the Department of Energy program being \nterminated is focused on helping independent oil and gas producers, and \nnot the major oil companies, it is even harder to understand. There are \na lot of small oil and gas producers in my State of New Mexico, and \nthey certainly are benefiting from current high prices. But none of \nthem are in the position to start up R departments. And oil and gas \nis a boom-and-bust business, while R is something that you need to \nhave a long-term commitment to, in order to achieve results.\n  The administration's proposed termination of domestic oil and gas \nresearch and development flies in the face of its own statements.\n  For example, when the President signed the Energy Policy Act last \nAugust, he favorably singled out some of the oil and gas programs it \nauthorized. Here are his words:\n\n       The bill authorizes research into the prospects of \n     unlocking vast amounts of now--energy now trapped in shale \n     and tar sands.\n\n  Last October, the Secretary of Energy announced funding for 13 R \nprojects aimed at tapping unconventional sources of natural gas. That \nfunding, like most of DOE's funding for oil and gas R, went to \nuniversities, National Laboratories, and independent oil and gas \nproducers. In announcing these projects, he stated, ``The projects we \nare funding today are an investment in our Nation's energy security and \neconomic security, and will help us obtain the maximum benefit of our \ndomestic energy resources in an environmentally sensitive way.'' But 3 \nmonths later, the administration proposed to zero out those same \nprograms in the Budget request, at a time when our need for new \ndomestic sources of natural gas and oil are quite clear.\n  Finally, just earlier this month, the Department of Energy made \nanother announcement. It released a set of reports stating that state-\nof-the-art enhanced oil recovery techniques could significantly \nincrease recoverable oil resources of the United States in the future. \nAccording to the Department's reports, 89 billion barrels or more of \noil could eventually be added to the current U.S. proven reserves of \n21.4 billion barrels. That would be a huge improvement to our energy \nsecurity--an amount of oil that is 9 times greater than even the most \noptimistic projection of the resources of the Arctic Refuge. And this \noil would mostly be produced from existing drilling sites in the United \nStates, with little additional environmental impact. So here is the \nirony--both the program that produced the reports and the program \nconducting the research on enhanced oil recovery is the same program \nthat the administration is terminating.\n  Our need for new domestic sources of oil and gas is quite clear, as \nis the need to use advanced technology to find and produce those \nresources. There is no argument about the promise of such research--\neven the administration agrees. I believe that the Senate should be \nmore willing to match its rhetoric with funding than the administration \nhas been. Therefore, my amendment restores the existing oil and gas \nresearch and development programs to the levels appropriated for the \ncurrent fiscal year. In my view, that is the bare minimum that we \nshould do.\n  Our amendment would add $500 million to Function 600 to increase \ndiscretionary spending for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram. The pending Budget Resolution assumes that appropriations for \nLIHEAP will be $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2007--the same as the \nPresident's budget request. We know from recent experience that this \nsimply is not enough money. Due to very high oil, gas and electricity \nprices, the fiscal year 2006 funding of about $2 billion has been \ntotally inadequate, despite a winter that was milder than normal many \nstates.\n  Applications for assistance this winter increased an average of 11.4 \npercent across the country. In New Mexico, the number of fiscal year \n2006 applications is projected to be 20 percent higher than last year. \nNew Hampshire--30 percent more applications. Texas--63 percent more. \nWyoming--47 percent more. Several states have completely run out of \nfunds. Because of this dire situation, the Senate recently passed \nSenator Snowe's bill adding an additional $1 billion for LIHEAP grants \nin fiscal year 2006 by a vote of 68 to 31.\n  Experts predict that energy costs are going to remain high this year \nand next winter. Contracts for natural gas to be delivered in January \n2007 are currently selling for over $10 per MMBtu. Our amendment \nprovides for a needed increase in LIHEAP funds for next winter.\n  Good energy policy is not something that happens by default. You need \nto set out with a clear, comprehensive vision and then--most \nimportantly--stick with it when it comes to implementation. If we don't \nkeep our focus on a comprehensive, balanced approach to both energy \nefficiency and energy supply, we will not achieve the goals of energy \nsecurity and energy affordability that we want. I think that the \nadministration's budget suffers from that loss of focus. Somewhere \nbetween the signing ceremony and the submission of the next budget, the \nenergy security of our country was not given a high enough priority. I \nbelieve that this budget resolution before us now perpetuates that loss \nof focus. Under its terms, we will actually spend less on our energy \nsecurity in four out of the five next fiscal years than we did before \nwe passed comprehensive energy legislation. Something is wrong with \nthat picture.\n  I don't think it's appropriate to set up some zero-sum game on the \nDOE budget, where we have to rob Peter to pay Paul down in the \nAppropriations Committee this summer. The provisions of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005 are important enough to the country that we should \nbe working together to increase the bottom line for all energy programs \nin the energy function of the budget.\n  A lot of hard work went into crafting the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \non the part of all of us in the Senate. Important priorities for \nSenators--both Republican and Democratic--in areas such as energy \nefficiency, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and others have not been \nrequested at levels that will allow the Act to be properly implemented.\n  I believe that we should use this Budget Resolution to get to better \nenergy outcomes for the nation. At a minimum, we need to fund the \nprograms we authorized to bring us better energy security and make \nenergy more affordable in the future. It is not a mystery as to what \nthose programs are. We extensively debated them at the Committee level, \nhere on the Senate floor, and in conference during the passage of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005. Seventy-four Senators voted to set up those \nprograms when they voted for the Energy Policy Act of 2005. There may \nbe those who say we should go beyond those authorizations and do even \nmore for our energy future, and I would not disagree. But if the good \nwork we have done to date on energy bill is not to be wasted, then we \nneed to vote on this budget resolution to at least fund the programs \nthat we established. That is what this amendment does, and I hope that \nI will have the support of a broad majority of my colleagues to pass \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time do \nI have in opposition to the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Up to an hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fine. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum, and let it be charged to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe there was a unanimous consent \nagreement that the Bingaman amendment would run until 3 o'clock, and \nthen we would start voting. I believe the time was to be equally \ndivided between the proponents and the opponents. So my understanding \nwould be the Senator from New Mexico would have about half of that \ntime. I think it started at about 2:25, so the Senator from New Mexico \nwould have half of 35 minutes.\n  Was that not the understanding that was reached? I thought it was the \nunderstanding reached.\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no such order requested.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe we could at this moment then put that in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would ask that the time between now and 3 \no'clock be divided so that the senior Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, would have 15 minutes, the junior Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Bingaman, would have 5 minutes, and at 3 o'clock the voting will \nproceed, and that all time on this amendment will have expired, and \nthat it will be included in the votes which we will proceed with. I \nwill ask for unanimous consent. In fact, I ask unanimous consent right \nnow. I ask unanimous consent that--\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I wish to ask the chairman \nif he would withhold for a moment, as I make a personal request.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent, and \nthen I am going to modify it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes for 3 p.m. \ntoday occur in the following order, with 2 minutes equally divided \nbetween the votes, and all votes after the first be limited to 10 \nminutes in length: The first would be Conrad and Feingold, No. 3013; \nsecond, Talent, No. 3011; Kennedy, No. 3028; Chafee, No. 3014; Burns, \nNo. 2999; and Akaka, No. 3007. I further ask consent that immediately \nfollowing the votes, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nBingaman amendment No. 3039, with the same 2 minutes of debate time, \nand no second degrees in order to the amendment prior to that vote. I \nfurther ask consent that the votes now start at 3:05, and that the time \nbetween now and 3:05 be divided as follows: 5 minutes to Senator \nBingaman, 15 minutes to Senator Domenici, and then, at 3 o'clock, 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will start my 15 minutes. I ask I be \nnotified when I have used 10 minutes, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will be glad to notify the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  First, might I say to my friend Senator Bingaman, it is not to my \nliking we are here opposing each other. We produced the Energy bill, \nwhich we are discussing or debating today, together. Today we have an \nargument about how to implement it, how fast to implement it. I am on \nthe side of the President in terms of implementing it, and the Senator \nwants to implement it faster. That does not mean we are at odds with \nreference to what we tried to do. It is just how fast we will do it.\n  I wish to suggest to the Senate that when you have a budget, you have \nto make choices. The President made some very significant choices in \nthis area of how much of the Energy Policy Act should be implemented. \nIn his State of the Union Address, he spoke rather eloquently about our \naddiction to oil. It is interesting, when he spoke about that, he then \nturned to issues and matters within the Energy Policy Act, which was \npassed by 74 Senators--bipartisan--when he said: Let us move ahead to \nsubstitute in the tanks of our automobiles--instead of gasoline, let us \nsubstitute ethanol and a related product that eventually will come from \ncellulose that will be produced, that grows. And we are about to the \npoint where we know exactly how to convert that to something that can \nbe used in the tanks of our cars. The President asked for that. That is \na very large item. That is funded. Senator Bingaman has no argument \nwith that. Obviously, he is for that.\n  In addition, the President said: We should move ahead with a \ntechnology toward batteries so a hybrid automobile will come onboard \nmore quickly. That is another $31 million add-on. I am sure the \nproponent, my friend, my colleague, supports that also.\n  He asked for $289 million for hydrogen fuel cells and $281 million \nfor the development of clean coal technology, including $54 million for \nthe FUTGEN Initiative, one of the most important projects in the \ncountry. In addition, the President asked for $250 million for the \nGlobal Nuclear Energy Partnership--the name for that is GNEP; we have \nall heard about it; $148 million for the new Solar America Initiative, \na very important initiative--again, I am sure that is wholeheartedly \nsupported by the proponent of the amendment, and which I oppose; and \nthen there is $44 million for wind research to try to make the \ntechnology for wind energy, which is good. It is already producing, and \nwe are generating great quantities in the State of Colorado, the State \nof New Mexico, and many others.\n  But the distinguished Senator, my colleague, asked for much more than \nthat. He asked that we add $3.5 billion to this function called \nfunction 207. That just means it is the function that contains energy. \nI wish it were increasing funding for all the items the amendment \nseeks. I wish the President asked for them. I wish it were possible. I \nbelieve we can go much further for the cause of energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy as well as conventional forms, but we can't do it all \nright now. We have to be realistic about using the funds currently \navailable.\n  For that reason, although many of the proposals are very good and I \nbelieve we will do them in due course, I can say to the Senate and \nthose who are interested in the issues and ideas raised by my \ncolleague, I believe they are going to be implemented, just not by this \nbudget. How do you pay for them? Because you see, Senator Bingaman \nwould not want to say we broke the budget. So he says: Let's pay for \nthem. The way he suggests we pay for them is dubious. He suggests that \nwe pay for them by reauthorizing Superfund taxes. That is an assumption \nmade in this amendment, that we will find the money, the $3.5 billion, \nby reauthorizing the Superfund, which has been controversial. It has \nnot been reauthorized in a long time. I don't believe there is a way to \ndo it. So we are increasing taxes that should not even be used for \nthese programs. We are assuming that will happen in order to make this \namendment look as if it is a budget-neutral amendment, and then we are \nasking for these good things to be paid for in that manner. I believe \nthe Senate should reject it.\n  Again, many, if not all, of the items are good for the country and \nshould eventually be done. To the extent that we work together to get \nthem in an energy act, I think we will ultimately work together to get \nthem funded one way or another. I hope we don't do it today because I \ndon't think that will add to the budget and to the requirement that we \nas an institution produce a budget. That is our primary requirement, to \nproduce the outline. I think this amendment will not help do that.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague, Senator Salazar of \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me say to my friends and colleagues \nfrom New Mexico, Senators Bingaman and Domenici, I very much appreciate \nthe bipartisan leadership they are exercising in moving us forward in \ngrappling with the imperative of national energy independence. I \nbelieve the National Energy Policy Act of 2005 was a first step in the \nright direction, and we must take additional steps.\n  It is because I believe we must take additional steps that I rise \ntoday in support of this amendment for energy independence and energy \nsecurity. Our amendment will add about $3.5 billion to energy \nefficiency and renewable energy programs authorized in the bipartisan \nenergy bill of last year; $500 million for the LIHEAP program to help \nlow-income families heat their homes; it importantly extends the \nproduction tax credit and clean energy bonds for renewable energy. This \nis a fiscally responsible way of fulfilling our mandate\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nto lead America to energy independence.\n  In his State of the Union Address, we heard the President commit to \nreplace 70 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by the year \n2025. This is actually a modest goal. I am a member of a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators--six Republicans and six Democrats--that supports S. \n2025, the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act. That \nlegislation would lead our country on a path to save 2.5 million \nbarrels of oil per day by the year 2016, 7 million per day by 2026, and \n10 million barrels per day by the year 2031. We can reach these goals \nand the President's goals, but we can only do it if we invest adequate \nresources in renewable and energy efficiency programs for the Nation.\n  The importance of making these investments now could not be more \nclear. Today we import almost 60 percent of our oil, accounting for \none-quarter of the U.S. trade deficit. At our current rate of \nconsumption, we will be importing 70 percent by 2020. We are currently \nheld hostage by our dependence on foreign oil, jeopardizing our \nnational security and our Nation's economic stability.\n\n  This amendment takes concrete steps toward the goal of energy \nindependence. It builds on proposals we have been working on in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, ideas we have laid out in S. \n2025 and ideas that I have discussed with the President in his recent \ntrip to the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, CO.\n  Our amendment would speed up development of renewable energy \ntechnologies, incentivize alternative fuels production, and improve \nenergy efficiency in our cars and homes. Currently, transportation \naccounts for two-thirds of domestic oil consumption. That is why this \namendment is so important, because it will provide full funding for the \nEnergy Policy Act advanced vehicle deployment programs. We want to \naccelerate the development of hybrid vehicle technology, create fuel \ncells for school buses and transit buses, and improve the technology in \nbiodiesel engines. Our amendment makes smart investments in renewable \nenergy to make it affordable and accessible to all Americans.\n  It will fund research and development for renewable energies to the \nlevels we authorized last year as a Senate in the Energy Policy Act of \n2005. This amendment will double the funding for renewable energy \ndevelopment at DOE's top renewable energy lab, the National Renewable \nEnergy Lab in Golden, CO. By supporting the technological advances \noccurring at places such as the National Renewable Energy Lab, we will \nusher in a new era in solar production, wind power, and biofuels.\n  It extends existing production tax credits for electric power and \nliquid fuels produced from renewable resources until 2011. This will \nprovide greater predictability for manufacturers and purchasers that \nwant to make renewables a viable alternative.\n  Our amendment will also place an additional $296 million into clean \ncoal R We are on the brink of breakthroughs in coal gasification and \nclean coal technology that will allow us to take full advantage of \nAmerica's unparalleled coal resources. We must support these \ntechnologies and get them to the market as soon as possible. This \nenergy independence amendment will also provide funding for the \nproduction incentives for cellulosic ethanol that we authorized in last \nyear's Energy bill. Cellulosic ethanol is an untapped and potentially \nmassive energy source. I appreciate the President's expression of \nsupport for its development. Current methods of producing ethanol have \nan energy return of about 35 percent. We can do much better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 20 seconds to \nfinish my statement.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield the Senator off the resolution an \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, the investments we make as a nation in \nwind energy, solar power, and cellulosic ethanol are important for the \nenergy independence of America. As I have often said, the bipartisan \nleadership of the Senate Energy Committee can get us to energy \nindependence if we make sure that what we do is take care of the \ncornerstones of energy independence, which include renewable energy, \nconservation, new technologies, and balanced development of our natural \nresources.\n  I yield the floor and thank Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nReid of Nevada be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico \nhas 8 minutes remaining. Does the senior Senator wish to yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are we there now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If I yield back, do we go to votes? Are we finished?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, we would not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is to be recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Durbin has a disaster in his hometown.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his time.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as the Senator from Illinois is coming to \nspeak about a natural disaster that has hit his hometown, let me alert \ncolleagues to once again please cooperate with the chairman and myself \non trying to work out the timing of amendments. We have a series of \namendments we are trying to get lined up to be debated tonight which we \nwould then vote on tomorrow morning. We are running into a little bit \nof difficulty because of Senators' schedules. We urge people to try to \nwork with us to resolve those matters as expeditiously as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nfirst vote in the seven votes that are coming at 3:05, that all further \nvotes would be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n\n\n                          Springfield Tornados\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Gregg, as well as Senator Conrad, for yielding this time.\n  For the last 2 days, I have been asked by many of my colleagues in \nthe Senate and I have received calls and e-mails from across the \ncountry about my hometown of Springfield, IL, which was hit by two \ntornados on Sunday evening. I wanted to take a few minutes to tell the \nSenate where things stand.\n  On behalf of the people of Springfield, IL, our State capital, Mr. \nLincoln's hometown, we are grateful for the outpouring of support from \nall across the State and all across the region. We will get through \nthis disaster together, and we will rebuild Mr. Lincoln's hometown. A \nseries of photographs which I have here show homes and businesses blown \napart by the tornados. Imagine this image multiplied by hundreds of \ntimes, and you have an idea what Springfield looks like.\n  This morning, I was on the phone early with Mayor Tim Davlin, who had \ngone through the area, visited some of the neighborhoods, and was \nspeechless to describe what has happened to the homes of so many fine \nfamilies in Springfield, IL. These two tornados were part of a violent \nstorm system that claimed at least nine lives across the Nation and \nwreaked havoc along a 350-mile corridor from Lawrence, KS, through \nIllinois. They were the worst tornados people can remember in Illinois. \nWe are somewhat proud of the distinction of being Tornado Alley, so we \nhave seen some bad ones. They tore through Springfield at 120 miles an \nhour, followed by fierce rain and hail. The first tornado touched down \naround 8:20 Sunday evening. It was on the ground for almost 6 minutes \nand left a path of destruction 5.5 miles long and a half mile wide. The \nsecond tornado touched down at 8:25. It was on the ground for 5 minutes \nand left damage 4\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\nmiles long, 300 yards wide. The winds ripped off the roof of our \nSpringfield Wal-Mart, peeled the siding off buildings, and blew the \nwindows out of countless buildings, including our State capitol \nbuilding. Many homes and businesses were completely leveled by this \ntornado.\n\n  Trees were pulled up by their roots, utility polls were snapped in \nhalf, traffic signs and signals were toppled, forcing the closure of \nmajor roads into the city of Springfield.\n  Twenty-four people in central Illinois were injured in the storms, \nincluding 19 in my hometown of Springfield. We are very grateful no one \ndied. That is due partly to luck but also to the excellent storm \nwarning system operated by the city of Springfield and Sangamon County. \nI salute the Sangamon County government, as well as the city of \nSpringfield, Andy Van Meter, chairman of the board, and Mayor Tim \nDavlin for their great cooperation during this disaster.\n  The early warning gave people a chance to save their lives. Governor \nBlagojevich has already declared a State disaster in Sangamon County \nand in six neighboring counties--Ford, Greene, Logan, Morgan, Randolph, \nand Scott.\n  The worst damage by far is in Springfield. Nearly 1,000 homes have \nbeen damaged or destroyed, 10,000 people without electricity, schools \nremain closed, and many roads are still not passable.\n  The worst disasters tend to bring out the best in Americans. That is \ntrue in Springfield today. There has been an amazing outpouring of \ncourage and generosity. The Red Cross, God bless them, are already \nseeking temporary housing for 50 families who have no place to turn. \nAll the other people whose homes were damaged or destroyed have been \ntaken in by friends and family.\n  I commend Governor Blagojevich, Springfield Mayor Tim Davlin, \nChairman Andy Van Meter, and their staffs, and so many community \nleaders who have been working around the clock to get help to the \nvictims.\n  I commend the mayors of two neighboring towns that were also hit. \nMayor Harry Stirmell of the village of Jerome, which is just a few \nblocks from where I live, and Mayor Joe Rusciolelli of the village of \nRiverton, which were hit hard, are also working with State and local \nofficials and with FEMA.\n  The Governor's office and the mayors' offices are scheduled to meet \nwith FEMA officials tomorrow. It is my understanding that the FEMA \nofficials are on their way to Springfield to assess the damage and map \nout a recovery plan.\n  I know I speak for Senator Obama, my colleague, when I say we stand \nready to help. We are going to bring together a bipartisan delegation \nthat represents this area, including Congressman LaHood, Congressman \nShimkus, and Congressman Evans. We will work together in concert on a \nbipartisan basis to make sure help is on the way.\n  Based on what we already know, we expect Springfield and other \ncentral Illinois communities hit by these tornadoes will qualify for \nFederal emergency disaster assistance. We are going to do our best to \nmake sure that comes quickly.\n  I close with a real-life story. A story in today's Springfield \nJournal Register quotes a man named Tim Williams. Before the tornado, \nMr. Williams' garage in Springfield was filled with antiques, including \na 1955 Buick Roadmaster Riviera that he had just finished restoring and \nhad driven only 87 miles. Today the car is damaged, but Mr. Williams' \nantiques are scattered across the neighborhood.\n  Like everybody else, he considers himself really lucky. He and his \nfamily made it through this tornado of 2006 alive. Like many in our \ntown, he is feeling a renewed empathy for the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina. As Mr. Williams told a reporter:\n\n       You don't realize until it happens to you.\n\n  I want to say to my fellow residents of Springfield and to others who \nsuffered severe losses in these storms: You are not alone. We are part \nof an American family. We stand together when times get tough. I didn't \nknow that today I would be asking for help from across the Nation for \nmy hometown, but tomorrow it can be the hometown of any Senator on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, government at every \nlevel, will do everything they can to put Mr. Lincoln's hometown back \ntogether again. That is the American spirit. That is the American \nfamily. We are 50 States, but we are one American family.\n  I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to make sure we \ndeliver and that the people of Springfield, Sangamon County, and all \nthe affected counties from this tornado are made whole as quickly as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3013\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Conrad-Feingold amendment No. 3013.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we deem the \nyeas and nays to have been ordered on all seven amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to requesting the yeas and \nnays on all the amendments?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let's make clear, when we say ``all the \namendments,'' what we are intending is that all the amendments that are \nin order to be voted on at this point.\n  Mr. GREGG. Correct, the seven amendments we are about to vote on.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There is no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GREGG. To all of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is it not correct that under the previous \nunderstanding, there will be 2 minutes before each vote for a wrapup? \nThat has been our usual practice. That was the unanimous consent \nagreement previously entered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we vitiate \nthis rollcall so we can do the 2 minutes and go back to the rollcall as \nwould be the proper order. It has not started.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The rollcall has not started. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is the pay-go amendment. In some \nways, I think this is the most important amendment we face. It is an \nattempt to reestablish the budget disciplines that have worked in the \npast. Here is where we are headed: Debt up, up, and away.\n  Pay-go simply says: If you want new mandatory spending, you have to \npay for it. If you want more tax cuts, you have to pay for them. I know \nthe chairman says that means a tax increase. Not at all. You can pay \nfor increased tax reductions or increased spending by offsetting other \nspending reductions. It is critically important we do this.\n  I want to emphasize, here is what has happened: We weakened the pay-\ngo rule after we got back into surplus, and it has been red ink all the \nway down. This is our opportunity to reenact the budget discipline of \npay-go. I urge my colleagues to vote aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the practical effect of this is to raise \ntaxes. That is the only effect it has. If you take the pay-go language \nand put it on top of the 5-year budget we offer today, the only thing \nit will impact is the fact that taxes will have to be increased to pay \nfor extending the rate cuts, for extending the repeal of the death tax, \nand capital gains and dividends.

There are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Kennedy amendment.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I offer this amendment along with the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nMenendez.\n  As we confront the global economy, America is facing a massive new \nchallenge. It affects our jobs, our way of life, and even our national \nsecurity. Education is the key to meeting that challenge.\n  This last year, we had many important reports ranging from the \nNational Association of Manufacturers to the National Academy of \nSciences and Engineering and the Institute of Medicine. All of them say \nwe have to invest in education to meet the global challenge.\n  When we faced the challenge of Sputnik, we doubled our investment in \neducation overnight. We need that kind of commitment again so that we \ncan compete with China and India and maintain our position as No. 1 \neconomically and militarily.\n  The amendment that Senators Collins and Menendez and I offered \nincreases Pell Grants, student aid, and job training. It pays for these \nnew investments by closing egregious tax loopholes that the Senate has \napproved before.\n  The amendment is supported by 100 organizations, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to include in the Record a sample of the letters of support we \nhave received.\n  This amendment is a downpayment on our future. I urge the Senate to \naccept it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Student Aid Alliance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Student Aid Alliance, a \n     coalition of 60 associations representing college students, \n     parents, college and university presidents, faculty, \n     administrators, and others, we urge you to support the \n     amendment to the FY 2007 Budget Resolution being offered by \n     Sens. Kennedy, Collins and Menendez. This amendment will help \n     millions of students fulfill their dream of a college \n     education.\n       The administration's budget will put college out of reach \n     for far too many American children. It calls for the \n     elimination of seven higher education programs: the Perkins \n     Loan Program, the Leveraging Educational Assistance \n     Partnerships Program (state grants), the Thurgood Marshall \n     Legal Educational Opportunity Program, GEAR UP, and three of \n     the highly successful TRIO programs: Upward Bound, Upward \n     Bound Math/Science, and Talent Search. It also freezes \n     funding for the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, \n     the Federal Work-Study Program, and freezes the maximum award \n     for the Pell Grant--the anchor of the federal commitment to \n     ensuring equal educational opportunity--at $4,050 for the \n     fourth year in a row.\n       The Kennedy-Collins-Menendez Amendment puts a halt to this \n     backward momentum, and sends a clear message that as a \n     nation, we can ill afford to fall behind nations like China, \n     India, South Korea, and much of the European Union in \n     producing the intellectual capital needed to boost economic \n     growth and challenge the United States in the decades ahead. \n     Given the high stakes involved, this is not the time to cut \n     federal student financial aid.\n       We urge you to adopt the Kennedy-Collins-Menendez \n     Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Ward,\n       Co-Chair.\n     David Warren,\n       Co-Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Workforce Alliance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2006.\n     Re Menendez-Kennedy-Collins Amendment to FY07 Budget \n         Resolution\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The Workforce Alliance wholeheartedly \n     supports the budget amendment offered by yourself, Senator \n     Menendez and Senator Collins to increase our nation's \n     investment in higher education, job training and vocational \n     education programs that are so vital to economic future of \n     this country, as well as to the economic prosperity of \n     America's working families.\n       Your amendment would bring an additional $6.3 billion into \n     the FY07 budget in order to expand these critical education \n     and training programs at a time when our country desperately \n     needs to increase the skill levels of its workforce in order \n     to compete in a 21st Century global economy. Your amendment \n     would finally stop the several-year slide in combined federal \n     funding for these programs.\n       The Workforce Alliance (TWA) is a national coalition of \n     local leaders from the field of workforce development--\n     including community-based organizations, community colleges, \n     labor unions, business and trade associations, and state and \n     local public agencies--who want to improve our nation's \n     investments in the skills of all its workers, so that more of \n     America's workers will have the skills they need to advance, \n     and so that more American businesses will have the skilled \n     workers they need to compete in today's economy. Your \n     amendment takes an important step in that direction.\n       We appreciate your attention to this important matter and \n     look forward to working with you to ensure that our nation's \n     budget reflects the right priorities for American workers and \n     businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Andy Van Kleunen,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Association of Jesuit\n\n\n                                      Colleges & Universities,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Ranking Minority, HELP Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Robert Menendez,\n     Member, Budget Committee U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Menendez: On the behalf of the \n     Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities and the \n     twenty-eight Jesuit higher education institutions, I write in \n     strong support of the Kennedy-Menendez Student Aid and Job \n     Vocation Amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution for FY07. \n     This amendment totals $6.3 billion and critically addresses \n     the increases needed in all student aid programs.\n       For over four years, the Pell grant maximum award has been \n     frozen at $4,050. Last year, we finally retired the Pell \n     Grant shortfall and we had hoped for some increase on Pell \n     grant maximum award for FY06, but that did not occur. Even \n     though there were remaining Pell grant surplus funds from \n     FY06, the administration did not use that additional $273 \n     million for an increase on the FY07 Pell grant maximum award. \n     This amendment will increase the Pell grant maximum award and \n     would address the declining value of the Pell grant program \n     resulting from four years of level funding.\n       Your amendment also restores critical higher education \n     access programs such as TRIO programs and GEARUP, in addition \n     to restoring LEAP and the Perkins Loan Program which were \n     called for elimination in\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\n     the President's budget. We greatly appreciate the restoration \n     of the Perkins loan program, an integral part of student aid \n     on Jesuit campuses across the country.\n       Ironically, the White House and Members of Congress talk \n     about America being globally competitive, but we cannot \n     continue to do so unless the investment to federal student \n     aid programs increases, remains consistent, and involves \n     students from low incomes. Otherwise, those global \n     competitive goals are only rhetoric.\n       Thank you for your efforts in offering this amendment. AJCU \n     stands ready to assist your efforts throughout the budget \n     process and the year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Cyndy Littlefield,\n     Director of Federal Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             National Alliance for\n\n\n                                       Partnerships in Equity,\n\n                                 Cochranville, PA, March 13, 2006.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: When the President released his FY \n     2007 Budget we were all in a state of dismay. Considering the \n     increasingly competitive global economy and the importance of \n     maintaining our competitive edge, the budget cuts to \n     education and job training were short sighted. Critical \n     programs that open the doors of opportunity for students, \n     workers and families will be closed if the administrations \n     budget proposal is not corrected.\n       The National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity applauses \n     your effort to rally your colleagues by developing the \n     Menendez-Kennedy Student Aid/Job Training Budget Amendment \n     and wholeheartedly support its introduction and eventual \n     passage. We are particularly concerned about the elimination \n     of the Perkins Vocational Education program and are pleased \n     to note that your proposal will restore full funding to these \n     very important programs.\n       The National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity is a \n     consortium of state agencies and affiliates who have joined \n     forces to work collaboratively to promote equity in education \n     and workforce development, including career and technical \n     education. NAPE's membership is committed to the creation of \n     equitable classrooms and workplaces where there are no \n     barriers to opportunities. Budgets, such as the one proposed \n     by the administration, will only eliminate opportunities for \n     students.\n       Thank you for your vision and support for education \n     programs and the students who benefit from them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Mimi Lufkin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         The State PIRGs' Higher Education Project; United States \n           Student Association,\n                                                   March 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of students across the \n     country we would like to thank you for introducing an \n     amendment to restore cuts to, and provide critical increases \n     for, education funding in the FY07 Senate budget.\n       Students and families face one of the most difficult years \n     in to attempt to finance a college education, as increased \n     tuition costs and severe state budget cuts are creating \n     enormous barriers for students pursuing higher education \n     degrees. Already, too many students take on substantial loan \n     debt and work long hours in order to cover the costs of a \n     college education. Nearly two-thirds of all students graduate \n     with federal education loan debt, and the average student \n     loan debt has nearly doubled over the past eight years to \n     almost $17,000. In addition, nearly half of all full-time \n     students who were employed while in school during this time \n     worked 25 hours or more every week.\n       Without change, the FY07 Senate budget threatens to leave \n     millions of students and families in a deep financial hole. \n     The original budget proposal called for the elimination of \n     several vital student aid programs that make college more \n     affordable, including LEAP funding, Perkins Loans, the \n     Thurgood Marshall fellowship, and the TRIO and GEAR UP \n     programs. We support the effort to restore funding for these \n     programs.\n       In addition your amendment provides increases to critical \n     grant programs such as the Pell Grant. The maximum Pell Grant \n     has been frozen at $4,050 for the past four years. As college \n     costs continue to rise, students experience these increases \n     as a cut to funding.\n       We thank you for standing up for students and introducing \n     this amendment. We look forward to working with you to build \n     support for increase funding for our nation's students.\n           Sincerely,\n     Luke Swarthout,\n                          State PIRGs' Higher Education Associate.\n     Jasmine Harris,\n     Legislative Director, United States Student Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Coalition of Higher Education\n\n\n                                     Assistance Organizations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2006.\n       Dear Senators: I am writing to urge your support for \n     amendments that would permit an increase in federal funding \n     for education that may be offered during Senate consideration \n     of the Congressional Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2007. \n     I understand that Senators Specter and Harkin and Senators \n     Kennedy, Menendez and Collins plan to offer such amendments. \n     We strongly urge all senators to vote yes on these \n     amendments, which would permit extremely important \n     investments in our nation's future. Without additional \n     spending authority for education provided for in the Budget \n     Resolution, it will be impossible for the Appropriations \n     Committee to adequately complete its work this year.\n       The Coalition of Higher Education Assistance Organizations \n     (COHEAO) is a coalition of colleges, universities and \n     commercial organizations that work to foster improved access \n     to postsecondary education, particularly through the Perkins \n     Loan Program. The Perkins program plays a critical role in \n     our nation's financial aid system, especially for the lowest-\n     income students. It is the original student loan program \n     created by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 in \n     response to the Sputnik launch by the Soviet Union. National \n     Defense Student Loans were needed then, and, renamed, they \n     are needed today as our country continues to face challenges \n     that require a highly educated workforce to respond. In order \n     for this program to remain healthy and to avoid cutting \n     students off from the financing they need, annual \n     appropriations are needed of a modest capital contribution \n     and to reimburse schools for loans cancelled when borrowers \n     go into public service jobs. Schools partly match the capital \n     contribution and when Perkins Loans are repaid, the funds are \n     re-lent to other students who need to borrow, making this a \n     highly efficient way to finance students' higher education.\n       America's students need your support. Please vote for the \n     Spector-Harkin and Kennedy-Menendez Amendments to expand \n     funding for education as part of the Congressional Budget \n     Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alisa Abadinsky,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this budget commits a tremendous amount of \nresources to education, as has this President. A few weeks ago, we \nvoted for an additional $9 billion for student assistance for students \nwho are going to college. This budget adds in an extra $1.5 billion. In \naddition, it sets up a reserve fund with $6 billion for the American \ncompetitiveness proposal. It fully funds vocational technical \neducation.\n  So the commitment is strong in this budget, as it has been for many \nyears under the leadership of this President, with dramatic increases \nin education.\n  This amendment would significantly raise the caps by $6.3 billion and \nin turn would raise taxes by $6.3 billion. It is a classic tax-and-\nspend amendment.\n  I hope Members will vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 39 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 3028) was rejected.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Nothing would preclude the Senator from asking \nfor the yeas and nays after the voice vote but before the result is \nannounced.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I call this amendment the Property Tax \nRelief Amendment of 2006. This amendment moves funding of IDEA to 20 \npercent of the cost of a municipality, only 20 percent of the promised \n40-percent goal set in 1975.\n  Schools account for the majority of property taxes and special \neducation costs are rising much faster than inflation. If we fund this \nto 20 percent, it will go right down to the property tax payer. We all \nknow the property tax is one of the most difficult taxes of all we pay.\n  I urge passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator's intention to \nplus up IDEA. The problem is the pay-for here is section 920. There is \nno money in 920. What will happen is other domestic accounts will be \ncut. There is no new money here. The appropriators will get $873 \nbillion without this amendment; they will get $873 billion with this \namendment. There is no new money here, just so my colleagues understand \nthat before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator from Rhode Island still have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 23 seconds.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nWarner and Senator Santorum as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I also add that of all the talk about tax relief in this \nChamber, we do not get enough talk about property tax relief.\n  I urge your support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3014) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2999\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we now turn to Senator Burns, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We now have 2 minutes equally divided on the \namendment.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I assume this is my amendment. Everybody is \nlooking toward me, so I will make that assumption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Burns amendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this amendment is a responsible method of \naddressing the essential needs of veterans health care. The amendment \nis cosponsored by Senators Chafee, Hutchison, and Vitter. Also, Senator \nHagel and Senator Sessions are on this amendment.\n  It proposes, we cannot live with a copay and then the additional cost \nas far as prescription drugs. I realize there is a litmus test that is \ntrying to be imposed into our VA care. I would say that anybody who \nqualifies for veterans health care has already passed his litmus test; \nthey served. So we should not ask of them who have given so much for \nthis Nation to offer up a copay or any other fees that might come with \nVA.\n  I urge your support of this amendment. It is fully paid for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me indicate, once again, this funding, \nwhich is absolutely meritorious, is paid for out of section 920. There \nis no money in 920. In fact, 920 is $500 million underwater already. \nWhat this will result in is an across-the-board cut in all \ndiscretionary accounts. So in voting for this amendment, you are voting \nto reduce homeland security, you are voting to reduce defense, you are \nvoting to reduce law enforcement, you are voting to reduce all of the \nother domestic accounts, because there is no money in 920.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I have a letter in support of my amendment \nfrom the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter in support of this amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2006.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: On behalf of the Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars of the United States, we are writing in support of your \n     amendment which would eliminate the need to raise co-payments \n     and charge enrollment fees by providing increased funding for \n     Veterans Administration (VA) health care programs.\n       We firmly believe that asking veterans to pay for part of \n     the benefits a grateful nation provides for them is \n     fundamentally contrary to the spirit and principles \n     underlying the provision of benefits to veterans. No \n     requirement that veterans be burdened with co-payments is \n     justified, especially in a time of war.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of our nation's sick \n     and disabled veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dennis Cullinan,\n                           Director, National Legislative Service.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want my colleagues to know that this \namendment fails to raise the top line of VA funding and would not fully \nfund mental health. I will tell you, we are going to have an \nopportunity, in a moment, to do better with our Akaka-Murray amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, our amendment would add $1.5 billion, real \nmoney, by closing tax loopholes. We said last year that more attention \nshould be given to mental health and prosthetics. The opposition \nprevailed. It took months and two budgets to get to the right number. \nWe must reject the administration's new fees, and we must shore up the \nsystem for returning veterans who will need all kinds of health care. \nVA's estimates for returning service members who will come for care are \nalready off by 35,000 at least. I urge support for the Akaka-Murray \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have just passed the Burns amendment. \nThe Burns amendment is a 12.2-percent increase for veterans, the \nlargest increase in the history of this Government for veterans. All \nincoming veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are paid for. All veterans \nof current service needs, both disability and service related, are paid \nfor. This is a doubling of the veterans budget every 5 years on the \namendment we just voted for.\n  There is a fundamental question to be asked: How much is enough? This \nCongress, this Senate just now was generous, and appropriately so, to \nAmerica's veterans. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Akaka amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate before a vote on the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this will be the last vote, I suspect, \ntonight.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could we ask Members, we are getting a \nfeedback through the system of somebody's BlackBerry. If Members can \nmake sure to check their electronics before they come on the floor.\n  Will the Chair inform us what the order is?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to voting on the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Durbin of Illinois be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last year 74 of us voted to pass the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005. The amendment I have offered is to provide \nthe funds to implement that act. If Members want to be able to tell \ntheir constituents that they actually were serious about those \nprovisions and wish to see them implemented before 2012, they need to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The budget resolution before us through 2011 does not provide the \nfunding that was called for in that legislation either for clean energy \nproduction or for energy conservation and energy efficiency. If my \ncolleagues want to be able to say that we are taking serious action in \nWashington to provide secure and affordable and clean energy for this \ncountry in the future, support this amendment. This amendment provides \nthe actual funds. This is the beef, if you are interested in where the \nbeef is in this energy debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think my colleague knows it is with \nreluctance that I must stand and oppose his amendment. We wrote the \nbill he is talking about. The President chose to fund provisions in the \nEnergy Policy Act amounting to $1.2 billion. He didn't fund everything. \nMy colleague intends to add items that were not funded.\n  We will have an opportunity in the appropriations process to move the \nmoney around and do some of what he seeks rather than some of those the \nPresident seeks. But the issue here is that to do what he wants, we \nhave to add more than $3.5 billion. We add that to the bottom line \nwhich we have to pay for. The Senator pays for it by assuming that we \nwill reauthorize the Superfund tax. That is how he pays for it. That \nhas not been reauthorized for years. If it was, it shouldn't be used \nfor this purpose.\n  So essentially, we should not adopt this amendment because it breaks \nthe budget.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 \nminute to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after we \nconclude the vote on the Bingaman amendment, the next amendment in \norder will be the Specter-Harkin amendment for half an hour, followed \nby the Stabenow amendment for half an hour. We are working on a \nunanimous consent request to line up a whole series of amendments, \nwhich unanimous consent request we hopefully will be able to offer at \nthe end of this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Bingaman amendment No. 3039. The \nyeas and nays were previously ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 42 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\n\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 3039) was rejected.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Kyl \nas a cosponsor to Senator Burns' amendment No. 2999.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now proceed \nto the consideration of the following amendments in the order listed \nand the times for debate equally divided for today and into the \nevening:\n  Senator Specter relative to Labor-HHS, 30 minutes; Senator Stabenow \nrelative to interoperable, 30 minutes; Senator Frist, or his designee, \nrelative to Menendez subject matter, \\1/2\\ hour; Senator Menendez \nrelative to port security, \\1/2\\ hour; Senator Byrd on mining, \\1/2\\ \nhour; Senator Chambliss and Senator Dayton, Byrne grants, 30 minutes; \nand Senator Murray on CDBG, 30 minutes.\n  Beginning on Wednesday at 9 a.m., the following will be considered: \nSenator Kyl on immigration, 15 minutes; Senator Grassley on Medicare, \n30 minutes; Senator Nelson on Medicare, 30 minutes; and Senator \nSantorum on CDBG, 30 minutes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the debate or yielding \nback of time on these amendments the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelationship to the amendments with no second degrees in order to \namendments prior to the vote; further, that the time used during the \nvotes count equally against the resolution. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that the votes occur in the order listed above with the \nexception of the Santorum vote which will occur immediately following \nthe Murray amendment; provided that prior to each vote there will be 2 \nminutes equally divided for debate, and that in each stacked series all \nvotes after the first be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  For clarification, tomorrow morning after the debate on the Santorum \namendment, we will begin a series of votes. We have some scheduling \nissues and, therefore, we will pause that sequence at some point and \nresume around 1 p.m. We have a joint meeting beginning at 2 p.m., and \ntherefore we will then begin the next series of votes at 3 or 3:15.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that no other amendments or motions \nbe in order other than those listed during the pendency of this \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could the \nchairman of the committee clarify when he intends to bring the so-\ncalled Specter-Harkin amendment to a vote?\n  Mr. GREGG. That will be the first amendment voted on, beginning \nprobably around 11, maybe a little earlier, tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am advised there will be two Senators \nabsent at that time who are in favor of this amendment. If I may have \nthe indulgence of the chairman for one moment to find out when they \nwill be here, may I inquire of the chairman when the last vote is \nscheduled in his unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. GREGG. We presume it would occur at some time around 3:35 or 4 \no'clock.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I inquire of the chairman if the vote \non the Specter-Harkin amendment could be scheduled at the end of the \nsequence.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will amend the unanimous consent request so that the \namendment on Specter-Harkin will be the last amendment to be voted on \nin the series.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say that Senator Harkin is telling \nus they do not know yet whether they will be back at that hour. So \nmaybe we can leave that, have the debate tonight, and schedule that \nvote tomorrow as we know better the information that is of interest to \nthe two Senators.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think that is an excellent idea. I \nthought we would be in the safe range, but if there is some possibility \nthat 3:30 will not be a time when those two Senators will be present, I \nask that the suggestion by the Senator from North Dakota be agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we amend the unanimous consent request to say \nthat the Specter-Harkin amendment will be voted on when the managers of \nthe bill reach an agreement as to a time certain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I add that with the concurrence of \nSenator Harkin and myself.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is asking for a lot, it seems to me. But I guess it \nwill be all right.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is not asking for a lot in my short tenure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to again say to our colleagues that \nI thank all of our colleagues who have worked very hard to put these \nagreements together today and ask for additional cooperation through \nthe evening as we work to put a list together for tomorrow. If we want \nto get the Senate's business completed, including dealing with the debt \nlimit, it is going to take very serious cooperation from Members.\n  I repeat that we have 100 amendments pending. We could be voting \nright through Friday. We could be voting into Saturday if Members don't \ncooperate. The vast majority have. We have a number of colleagues who \nhave been somewhat reluctant to make commitments to us about time \nagreements, and about the staging of their amendments. That makes it \nextremely difficult to reach a conclusion.\n  I hope some people have an epiphany here overnight and realize that \nif we don't find a way to cooperate and work together, we will be here \nuntil Saturday.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have one more unanimous consent request \nwhich is that during the time we are in joint session with the House \nand hear the message from the President of Liberia, for which I guess \nwe would be in recess, that time be counted against the bill equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there is no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3048\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am sending an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senators Harkin, Smith, Kennedy, Lautenberg, Murray, Lincoln, \nLieberman, Kerry, Clinton, Bingaman, Akaka, Obama, Cantwell, Kohl, \nDodd, Mikulski, Dayton, Durbin, Collins, Landrieu and myself, and ask \nfor its consideration in terms of the unanimous consent agreement \nalready reached.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Mr. Harkin, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Obama, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kohl, \n     Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Collins \n     and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 3048.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the advance appropriations allowance in order to \n     fund health, education and training, and low-income programs)\n\n       On page 44, line 13, strike ``$23,158,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$30,158,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before proceeding into the details of \nthis amendment, let me state that it is an amendment which seeks to \noffer $7 billion to increase the cap on advanced appropriations under \nsection 401 of this resolution. The budget resolution has increased the \nPresident's mark by some $3 billion so that if accepted this amendment \nfor $7 billion will constitute an increase over the President's mark of \nsome $10 billion.\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\n  Let me say at the outset that notwithstanding the sizable figure \ninvolved here, the funding for the subcommittee, which I chair and \nwhere Senator Harkin is the ranking member, we will still be more than \n$5 billion short of where we would have been had the budget for fiscal \nyear 2006 been frozen with an inflation increase, and then the budget \nfor 2007 again frozen accommodating an inflation increase. That has \ncome about. The figures are complicated and technical, but I think it \nis important to understand where we are coming from on this amendment.\n  For fiscal year 2005 the budget enacted was $143.4 billion. The \nbudget enacted was $141.5 billion for fiscal year 2006, almost $2 \nbillion less. The inflation factor was $4.8 billion. If we take the \n$1.9 billion reduction and the $4.8 billion, our budget for the fiscal \nyear 2006 was $6.7 billion under a freeze.\n  The budget for fiscal year 2007 has come in at $137.5 billion. What \nwe have is a President's budget which is $5 billion under the enacted \nbudget for fiscal year 2006. If we add an inflation factor of $5 \nbillion, the budget for fiscal year 2007 should be $153.2 billion, \nwhich means that under the current figures we are $15.7 billion short.\n  Now, that is on a freeze. There has been a lot of rhetoric about \nmaintaining fiscal responsibility, which I subscribe to. That is \nsomething we should be doing. We should be, as a nation, living within \nour budget. It is unfortunate we did not pass a constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget, which would have compelled us to live \nwithin our means, as every citizen must do so and the States and the \ncities and other governmental units, but we did not pass that.\n  But what I call fiscal restraint is if you have a freeze; that is, \nyou do not increase the spending. But when you have had this sequence \nwhere the budget has been cut, plus the failure to have an allowance \nfor an inflation factor, we have done more than cut out the fat, we \nhave done more than cut through the muscle, we have done more than cut \nthrough the bone; we have cut into the marrow. It is that serious as to \nwhat has happened.\n  In the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, \nwe are dealing with our two major capital assets--health and education. \nWithout health, individuals obviously cannot function. And without \neducation, individuals cannot reach their potential. And the Department \nof Labor--workforce, job training, worker safety--again, very vital \nfunctions.\n  In an earlier vote today, I voted against the amendment offered by \nSenator Kennedy for $6.3 billion which would have increased Pell grants \nby $1.8 billion, would have increased funding for other higher \neducation programs by $2.4 billion, would have increased funding for \nPerkins vocational education by $1.3 billion and other revenues by $750 \nmillion. Much as I would have liked to have voted for the Kennedy \namendment, I voted against it because it seemed to me an impossibility \nfor Senator Kennedy's amendment to be agreed to and to have the \nSpecter-Harkin amendment agreed to.\n  I tried to persuade my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, to \nvote against the Kennedy amendment and join me on that. He told me \nabout some of the practical facts of life on his side of the aisle. I \nrelented, notwithstanding our general partnership agreement, and \nreleased him from his obligations. So Senator Harkin voted for the \nKennedy amendment, which I would have liked to have done, and I voted \nagainst it, although it was a very painful vote.\n  Now we come to the addition of $7 billion. Let me explain briefly, \nbefore yielding to Senator Harkin, what this amendment does. In the \nDepartment of Labor, the fiscal year 2007 budget proposes to eliminate \n$49 million for reintegration of youthful offenders. This will be \nreinstated, but this is what the resolution calls for. Would reinstate \nthe $7 billion as added, $49 million for the reintegration of youthful \noffenders, obviously, a very important program. The budget eliminates \n$79 million for training migrant and seasonal farmworkers and \ndislocated worker assistance by $232 million, cut adult training by \n$152 million, and cut the Job Corps by $62 million. This amendment will \nrestore those indispensable items.\n  This amendment restores $637 million for the Community Service Block \nGrant Program. This amendment also provides funding for low-income \nenergy assistance. This amendment restores funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. The current budget resolution recommends $29.350 \nbillion, which is $1 billion over the fiscal year 2006 appropriation \nand the President's request. This amendment provides NIH with a $2 \nbillion increase over the President's budget. Even with this increase, \nthe amount is below what has been provided in the 2005 budget, adjusted \nfor inflation.\n\n  Just a word or two about the National Institutes of Health. The \nsubcommittee has taken the lead in the past several years of more than \ndoubling funding for the National Institutes of Health from $12 billion \nto more than $29 billion. What has happened in the last 2 years, has \neventuated in a reduction in the number of grants which may be offered. \nIn this field, there is panic among the applicants for NIH funding.\n  Dr. John Glick, noted oncologist, Philadelphian--happens to be my \noncologist; I am unfortunate to need one, but he is a superb \noncologist--has confirmed what I have heard reported around the country \nabout how the National Institutes of Health are not able to perform \ntheir function. They are dealing with rock-bed American health. They \nare dealing with the potential cures for heart disease, cancer, \nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes. When we have the hearing in a few \nweeks, we will be bringing in 21 experts of these various disciplines \nto testify what the impact has been.\n  The Department of Education has had the President's budget proposal \nto reduce it by more than $2.1 billion. This budget resolution assumes \nan increase of $1.5 billion over the President's budget request but \nwould still result in cuts below the fiscal year 2006 level. We detail \nwhat we are doing for education. We will be providing the kind of \nfunding, in large measure, which the Kennedy amendment was looking for \nwhich, as I say, I had voted against.\n  The managers of this budget resolution have done an outstanding job \nof dealing with a very difficult situation. What we are doing is simply \nnot looking at reality on discretionary spending. There is a great deal \nof spending which is being undertaken by the Federal Government at the \npresent time. Entitlements are precisely what they say. They are \nestablished. We have tremendous expenses with the hurricanes. We have \ntremendous expenses with Afghanistan. We have tremendous expenses with \nIraq.\n  I am not going to direct any comments on any of those directions as \nto whether we are doing the right thing in what we are spending. I do \nknow, when it comes to health, education, worker training, worker \nsafety, we cannot move below a freeze on fiscal year 2005 and have \nanything but chaos. I have detailed why we are now $15.7 billion below \nwhat we should have been in 2005 had there been a freeze without the \ncuts and allowing for inflation.\n  When you talk about fiscal responsibility, I do not think anyone, \nincluding our so-called base, would expect us to do more than freeze--\nnot to cut education, not to cut health care, not to cut job training, \nnot to cut worker safety but to hold the line, tighten our belts, and \nhave a freeze. So when we end up with $3 billion added by the committee \nand $7 billion if this amendment passes, we are still far short of \nwhere we need to be.\n  As I have advised the leadership, I have grave doubts about \nsupporting the budget resolution, even with the adoption of this \namendment. The budget resolution does not end the day. There has to be \na conference. There have to be allocations in the Committee on \nAppropriations. I put the Republican leadership and the Democratic \nleadership and the House and the White House and the Presiding Officer, \neveryone on notice that I will want to see some real assurances that we \nare dealing with hard money, not with confederate dollars, not with \nsomething on a printout but something which will eventuate in having an \nappropriation for our subcommittee which will enable us to do a decent \njob--not an adequate job, not the proper job but at least a decent \nminimal job on these important functions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to offer a \n     $7 billion amendment to increase the cap on advance \n     appropriations under section 401 of this resolution. By \n     increasing allowable advance funding, this amendment would \n     add to the amounts already included in the resolution for the \n     National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention and other public health service \n     activities; education and job training; and anti-poverty \n     programs, including Low-Income Home Energy Assistance. By \n     increasing advance funding, this amendment does not raise the \n     overall discretionary spending limit.\n       The Harkin/Specter amendment adds $7 billion to the $3 \n     billion increase over the President's request assumed in the \n     resolution reported by the Budget Committee and thereby \n     allowing a $10 billion to partially restore funding for \n     programs within the jurisdiction of the Labor-HHS-Education \n     Appropriations Subcommittee. This is a modest amendment when \n     you take into account inflationary costs and that fact that \n     last year's appropriation was reduced by $1.9 billion below \n     the previous year's funding level.\n       The amendment restores the President's proposed cuts in \n     workforce investment programs, including dislocated worker \n     assistance and the Job Corps. It will also prevent the \n     termination of 6 Labor Department programs the Administration \n     has proposed to eliminate, including Reintegration of \n     Youthful Offenders, and Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers. \n     With the shortage of skilled workers in many fields, \n     including health care occupations such as nursing, we should \n     not be cutting back on training programs for the unemployed. \n     This amendment will restore 124,000 training opportunities \n     for youth and adults. It will also provide services to an \n     additional 1.2 million workers through job placement at our \n     nation's One Stop Career Centers.\n       My amendment would restore the $637 million for the \n     Community Services Block Grant Program that the budget \n     proposed to eliminate. This block grant program provides \n     services and activities to reduce poverty. The strength of \n     the program is in its ability to tailor itself to best \n     enhance local community programs and address their individual \n     needs. Dollars are used for food programs, administration of \n     LIHEAP services, employment issues, or for a variety of other \n     issues that are vital to healthy communities. These funds \n     leverage $20 for every $1 provided through state, local and \n     private contributions.\n       LIHEAP helps states assist low-income households to meet \n     the cost of home heating and cooling. This winter, we saw \n     drastic increases in home heating fuel costs. To respond to \n     the need for immediate relief, the Senate has passed \n     legislation shifting $1 billion appropriated for fiscal year \n     2007 for use in 2006; the House Appropriations Committee has \n     taken similar action. Once completed, this shift will require \n     at least a $1 billion restoration of fiscal year 2007 funds.\n\n\n                        department of education\n\n       My amendment also intends to ensure that discretionary \n     funding for the Department of Education is not cut below the \n     amount provided by Congress last year. The resolution \n     currently assumes a cut of $600 million below the FY'06 \n     appropriation. My amendment would provide additional \n     resources to help schools raise achievement levels for all of \n     their students and to ensure that they are prepared for \n     postsecondary education and work.\n       Many members have pointed out that the budget for the \n     Department of Education has been increased significantly over \n     the past several years. In fact, discretionary funding has \n     been raised from $24.7 billion in FY'95 to $56 billion in \n     FY'05, an increase of 129%. My subcommittee has taken the \n     lead in raising funding for Title I grants for Disadvantaged \n     Students, Special Education and Pell Grants. The spending \n     limit established in the FY'06 budget resolution forced my \n     subcommittee to reduce investments in education for the first \n     time in a decade. The FY'06 Labor-HHS-Education bill, \n     including the 1 percent across the board reduction, provided \n     $624 million less for the Department of Education than the \n     agency had in FY'05. The progress that was achieved over \n     the past decade in specific areas was halted, and in some \n     cases, reversed. For example, the federal contribution for \n     special education has increased from 7.3 percent in FY'96 \n     to 18.5 percent in FY'05, almost halfway to the 40 percent \n     goal. However, under the President's budget request the \n     federal contribution will drop to 17 percent.\n       In the area of Title I--grants for disadvantaged students, \n     the foundation of federal support for elementary and \n     secondary education, significant increases have been made \n     since the No Child Left Behind Act was passed in 2000. \n     However, with more than 9,000 schools nationwide identified \n     as in need of improvement, this is the time to ensure that \n     struggling students get the extra help they need to \n     demonstrate that they have the knowledge and skills to \n     proceed to the next grade.\n       In the area of postsecondary education, the President's \n     budget proposes a $4,050 maximum grant under the Pell \n     program, which, if adopted, would mean the fifth straight \n     year that the maximum award was at that level. The budget \n     also proposes to eliminate LEAP and the Perkins Loans \n     program. More than 1 million additional students are \n     receiving Pell Grants than they were five years ago. However, \n     last year, the average tuition and fees increased by more \n     than 7 percent, decreasing the purchasing power for low- and \n     middle-income Pell grant recipients.\n       The budget also proposes to eliminate the $303 million GEAR \n     UP program, which the Administration itself has acknowledged \n     is performing adequately and successfully prepare students \n     for college enrollment. The $1.1 billion Perkins Vocational \n     and Technical Education programs, which the Senate voted 99-0 \n     to reauthorize last year is also proposed for elimination. \n     Additional resources provided by this amendment will ensure \n     that these investments can be made without reductions to \n     other education initiatives.\n\n\n                     national institutes of health\n\n       The budget resolution currently recommends $29,350,000,000 \n     for the NIH in FY'07, which is $1 billion over the FY'06 \n     appropriation and the President's request. This amendment \n     would provide NIH with a $2 billion increase over the \n     President's budget. Even with this increase, the amount is \n     below the amount provided in FY'05 when adjusted for \n     inflation.\n       As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, \n     Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, I \n     have said many times that the National Institutes of Health \n     is the crown jewel of the Federal Government--perhaps the \n     only jewel of the Federal Government. When I came to the \n     Senate in 1981, NIH spending totaled $3.6 billion. The FY \n     2003 omnibus appropriations bill contained $27.2 billion for \n     the NIH which completed the doubling begun in FY 1998. The \n     successes realized by this investment in NIH have spawned \n     revolutionary advances in our knowledge and treatment for \n     diseases such as cancer, HIV-AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, \n     Parkinson's disease, mental illnesses, diabetes, \n     osteoporosis, heart disease, ALS and many others. It is clear \n     that Congress' commitment to the NIH is paying off. Now it is \n     crucial that increased funding be continued in order to \n     translate these advances into additional treatments and \n     cures. Our investment has resulted in new generations of AIDS \n     drugs which are reducing the presence of the AIDS virus in \n     HIV infected persons to nearly undetectable levels. Death \n     rates from cancer have begun a steady decline. With the \n     sequencing of the human genome, we will begin, over the next \n     few years, to reap the benefits in many fields of research. \n     And if scientists are correct, stem cell research could \n     result in a veritable fountain of youth by replacing diseased \n     or damaged cells. I anxiously await the results of all of \n     these avenues of remarkable research. This is the time to \n     seize the scientific opportunities that lie before us.\n       On May 21, 1997, the Senate passed a Sense of the Senate \n     resolution stating that funding for the NIH should be doubled \n     over five years. Regrettably, even though the resolution was \n     passed by an overwhelming vote of 98 to nothing, the Budget \n     Resolution contained a $100 million reduction for health \n     programs. That prompted Senator Harkin and myself to offer an \n     amendment to the budget resolution to add $1.1 billion to \n     carry out the expressed sense of the Senate to increase NIH \n     funding. Unfortunately, our amendment was tabled by a vote of \n     63-37. We were extremely disappointed that, while the Senate \n     had expressed its druthers on a resolution, it was simply \n     unwilling to put up actual dollars to accomplish this vital \n     goal.\n       The following year, Senator Harkin and I again introduced \n     an amendment to the Budget Resolution which called for a $2 \n     billion increase for the NIH. While we gained more support on \n     this vote than in the previous year, our amendment was again \n     tabled by a vote of 57-41. Not to be deterred, Senator Harkin \n     and I again went to work with our Subcommittee and we were \n     able to add an additional $2 billion to the NIH account for \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       In fiscal year 2000, Senator Harkin and I offered another \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution to add $1.4 billion to the \n     health accounts, over and above the $600 million increase \n     which had already been provided by the Budget Committee. \n     Despite this amendment's defeat by a vote of 47-52, we were \n     able to provide a $2.3 billion increase for NIH in the fiscal \n     year 2000 appropriations bill.\n       In fiscal year 2001, Senator Harkin and I again offered an \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution to increase funding for \n     health programs by $1.6 billion. This amendment passed by a \n     vote of 55-45. This victory brought the NIH increase to $2.7 \n     billion for fiscal year 2001. However, after late night \n     conference negotiations with the House, the funding for NIH \n     was cut by $200 million below that amount.\n       In fiscal year 2002, the budget resolution once again fell \n     short of the amount necessary to achieve the NIH doubling. \n     Senator Harkin and I, along with nine other Senators offered \n     an amendment to add an additional $700 million to the \n     resolution to achieve our goal. The vote was 96-4. The Senate \n     Labor-HHS Subcommittee reported a bill recommending $23.7 \n     billion, an increase of $3.4 billion over the previous year's \n     funding. But during conference negotiations with the House, \n     we once again fell short by $410 million. That meant that in \n     order to stay on a path to double NIH, we would need to \n     provide an increase of $3.7 billion in the fiscal year 2003. \n     The fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill contained \n     the additional\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\n     $3.7 billion, which achieved the doubling effort. In FY'04, I \n     and Senator Harkin offered an amendment to add an additional \n     $2.8 billion to the budget resolution to ensure that the \n     momentum achieved by the doubling could be maintained and \n     translated into cures. The vote was 96-1. Unfortunately, the \n     amendment was dropped in conference. We worked hard to find \n     enough funding for a $1 billion increase in FY'04. We fought \n     long and hard to make the doubling of funding a reality, but \n     until treatments and cures are found for the many maladies \n     that continue to plague our society, we must continue our \n     fight.\n       In FY'05, once again, Senators Harkin, Collins and I \n     offered an amendment to add $2 billion to discretionary \n     health spending, including NIH. The amendment passed 72-24. \n     However, the Subcommittee's allocation did not reflect this \n     increase. The final conference agreement contained an \n     increase of $800 million over the FY'04 funding level.\n       In FY'06, the Senate voted 63-37 to accept my budget \n     resolution amendment to add $1.5 billion for NIH and $500 \n     million for education, but again, the funding was dropped in \n     conference with the House. With overall funding for the \n     Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee cut $1.9 billion below the \n     FY'05 enacted level, NIH did not receive an increase for the \n     current fiscal year.\n       I, like millions of Americans, have benefited tremendously \n     from the investment we have made in the National Institutes \n     of Health and the amendment that we offer today will continue \n     to carry forward the important research work of the world's \n     premier medical research facility.\n       In summary, this amendment permits greater use of advance \n     funding for existing health, education and job training \n     programs, in order to free up resources to restore proposed \n     cutbacks and increase high-priority activities. Currently, \n     the cap on advance funding is $23.1 billion, which this \n     amendment would raise to $30.1 billion. The portion of \n     advances in the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee would \n     increase from $18.8 billion to $25.8 billion. The $7 billion \n     freed up in fiscal year 2007 budget authority would be used \n     as I have described.\n       Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield to my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa for some forceful rhetoric on this \nimportant subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 1 minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 45 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't seem to understand why this situation has \ndeveloped where the Senator from Iowa has 45 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 minutes on the amendment equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How long did I speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Less than 10--7 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Did we not have 1 hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We had 30 minutes equally divided between the \nopponent and proponents.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I express my regrets to the Senator from Iowa, I thought \nit was an hour.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So did this Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I took one half of what I expected our allocation to be.\n  Mr. GREGG. I can help this situation. I am claiming the time in \nopposition and I will yield to the Senator from Iowa 8 minutes off of \nmy 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. GREGG. So there are 8 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Specter-Harkin amendment would add \nback $7 billion to the President's proposed budget, allowing us to fund \nthe 2007 Labor, HHS appropriations bill at the level of 2005.\n  I am proud to join my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania in \noffering this amendment. I thank Senator Specter for his great \nleadership in all the areas of health, education, human services, \nmedical research. He has been a tireless leader in all these areas. \nOnce again, he has stepped to the forefront to basically say that we \nare not going to keep cutting back to the bone and the marrow, which he \nsaid earlier today.\n  This is not a radical proposal. In fact, it is almost an \nembarrassingly modest proposal. But it is important. It is an important \nfirst step. At least we are saying it is enough, no more; it is time to \nreorder our priorities. Year after year we have been cutting the \nprograms that support working families, people with disabilities, \nstudents struggling to afford college, elderly trying to heat their \nhomes, put food on the table, people with cancer and other diseases \ndesperate for a cure.\n  As my friend, Senator Specter, said this morning we are beyond \ncutting the fat and beyond cutting bone. We are now into the marrow. I \nadd, when you start cutting into the marrow, you are endangering the \nvery lifeblood of an organism--in this case, our American society.\n  Something is seriously wrong in terms of our priorities and our \nvalues when we are presented with a budget that slashes funding for the \nNational Cancer Institute, jeopardizing critical lifesaving research.\n  That is just one of the many critical program areas threatened by the \nproposed budget. President Bush, in his budget, proposed to slash the \nLabor-Health-Education budget by $4.2 billion for this year. Meanwhile, \nin Iraq, he is spending nearly $5 billion a month. These are not the \npriorities of the American people.\n  I believe this amendment is the single most important amendment that \nwe will consider on this budget resolution. I want to emphasize to my \ncolleagues, this is very likely our last, best chance to restore \nfunding for critical health, education, and social services programs.\n  Last year, we saw what happens when Congress passes a bad budget \nresolution. The reason why we had a bad Labor-HHS bill last year and \ncould not get it done is because we were boxed in by the budget \nresolution. Exactly the same thing will happen this year. It will be \nworse. It will be worse since it is an election year, unless we pass \nthe Specter amendment, which he just offered, putting back this $7 \nbillion.\n  So I say to my colleagues, this is the decisive vote. This is sort of \nthe showdown. This is our best, maybe last real opportunity to change \nour budget priorities. If we fail to act, then we will indeed be \ncutting into the bone and marrow of our most important programs.\n  Let me be somewhat specific.\n  This budget would cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control, \ndespite the fact we are facing the twin threats of bioterrorism and a \npossible avian flu pandemic.\n  This budget would cut funding for 18 of the 19 institutes at NIH. It \nwould cut the Social Services block grant by $500 million, completely \neliminate the Community Services block grant--two of the biggest \ndiscretionary programs for the poor.\n  The number of children served by Head Start would be reduced. Even \nMeals on Wheels would be cut.\n  At the Labor Department, the Disability Employment Office would be \ncut by 26 percent, on top of a 41-percent cut last year. Funding for \nthe Workforce Investment Act would be cut. Even the program we have had \nfor several years now to combat child labor and child slavery would be \ncut.\n  In education, the President's budget proposes the largest cut to \nFederal education funding in the 26-year history of the Department of \nEducation.\n  And I speak to the occupant of the Chair, who is a distinguished \nformer Secretary of Education, and who has a deep and abiding interest \nand support for education.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act would be underfunded by a whopping $15.4 \nbillion from what we were planning to spend when we passed it.\n  Title I would be frozen. Twenty-nine States would get less title I \nfunding next year. How are we ever going to expect poor kids to meet \nthe demands of No Child Left Behind if we are cutting title I funding, \nwhich President Bush himself said was the cornerstone of No Child Left \nBehind?\n  In special education--this is something the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has talked about and has been supportive of for a long time--\nwe are going backwards. We promised years ago--30 years ago--that the \nFederal Government would pick up 40 percent of the additional costs of \nfunding for special education.\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\n  Two years ago, which was a high watermark, we were at 19 percent. \nLast year, we went to 18 percent. This budget will take us to 17 \npercent. We are supposed to be at 40 percent. So we are going in the \nwrong direction. What that translates into is more property taxes for \nour beleaguered property tax owners in our school districts.\n  And need I talk about Pell grants? They are frozen at $4,050 for the \nfifth year in a row. I asked Secretary Spellings, when she was before \nour committee, name me one college in the country where tuition is the \nsame today as it was 5 years ago. Meanwhile, the Perkins Loan Program \nwould be completely eliminated. And the two TRIO programs--Upward Bound \nand Educational Talent Search--were eliminated in the President's \nbudget.\n  So again, I think these are misplaced priorities. That is why we are \noffering this amendment. That is why Senator Specter and I have worked \ntogether to try to get us at least back on the road. As I said, this is \na modest proposal. It only takes us back to 2005.\n  The amendment offered, I repeat, by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nsimply takes us back to where we were before all of the cuts and the \nacross-the-board cut of 2006. It puts us right back where we were in \n2005. I do not think that is radical. I think it is very modest.\n  Again, I say to my friends, fellow Senators, I believe this is the \ndecisive vote on priorities on this budget, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Senator Specter's amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for giving me \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment, \nalthough I yielded time off my time in support of the amendment to \nSenator Harkin. I was happy to do that, obviously.\n  First, on the substance, Senator Harkin was speaking to the \nPresident's budget, not to this budget. I can understand, he probably \nhas a lot of things going on and maybe has not had the time to take a \nlook at this budget. But we actually--assuming we had any force of law \nin allocation, which I pointed out a number of times is not the case--\ntook $3 billion and moved it from Defense over to the Labor-HHS bill--\n$3 billion; $1.5 billion for education, $1.5 billion for health care.\n  In fact, we address some of the concerns specifically. We upped NIH \nby $1 billion. We put enough money in so the GEAR UP and TRIO and voc \ned was fully funded. We increased funding for bioterrorism. So we \nadjusted.\n  Furthermore, we put in a reserve fund of $6 billion to address the \nAmerican Competitiveness Initiative, which is the initiative of the \nSenator and the Presiding Officer. And that is a big number.\n  We have made a strong commitment toward education, and we have \nbasically relieved the pressure that was put there by the President's \nbudget--which would have actually cut, by going to levels slightly \nabove a freeze--with our budget. So I think a lot of what the Senator \nfrom Iowa said may have been directed to the President's budget, but it \nis not accurately directed at this budget.\n  Secondly, I have a problem with the way this is paid for. This is an \nadvance appropriation. What is an advance appropriation? Well, \nbasically, it is borrowing from next year to fund things this year, \nwhich creates a hole in the next year, which then has to be filled.\n  So as a practical matter, what you are doing is adding to debt, but, \nmore importantly, you are adding to the base and you are basically \ncreating a problem for the next budget, as well as creating significant \nincreases in spending in this budget.\n  This advanced appropriation in this amendment is, I think, about $8 \nbillion, or something in that range. The practical effect of it would \nbe that advanced appropriations--which have grown over the years, \nunfortunately, and are now up to about $23 billion--would jump to about \n$30 billion--$30.1 billion, $30.2 billion. That is a big number because \nthat number gets carried forward every year. It is not good budgeting \nto do that type of action, where you borrow from a future year to fund \nthis year and represent that you are basically doing sound budgeting. \nThat is not sound budgeting.\n  Advanced appropriations are a thin ice of budgeting to step on. We \nshould not be moving in that direction. We should not be expanding the \nadvanced appropriations. We have carried the $23 billion advanced \nappropriation number in this bill. That has, over the years, been built \nup. But I do not want to have to, next year, have a $30 billion \nadvanced appropriation, which is what this amendment would create if we \nwere to approve it.\n  So I must, regrettably, oppose this amendment. I understand the \nposition the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee for \nLabor-HHS find themselves in. But I think there are other ways to solve \nthis problem. I hope we would not do it in this manner. Plus, I do \nthink we did make a genuine attempt within this budget to try to \naddress these concerns by moving $3 billion into these accounts.\n  With that said, I believe we are on to the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. Stabenow. Mr. President, I actually have two amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3055\n\n  Mr. President, the first one I will send to the desk. I want to \nindicate what this is, and I appreciate the fact that I understand my \nleadership on the Budget Committee is willing to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kohl, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Reed, and Mr. \n     Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 3055.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure appropriate funding for the Manufacturing Extension \n          Partnership Program of the Department of Commerce.)\n\n       On page 15, line 21, increase the number by $60,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 22, increase the number by $10,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 1, increase the number by $29,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 5, increase the number by $14,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 9, increase the number by $6,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 13, increase the number by $1,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the number by $60,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the number by $10,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 2, decrease the number by $29,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 5, decrease the number by $14,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the number by $6,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 11, decrease the number by $1,000,000.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3055) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to indicate that this amendment \nis a bipartisan amendment that is cosponsored by Senators Snowe, Reed, \nLieberman, Kohl, DeWine, and Graham. It is an amendment that restores \nthe critical funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nProgram, which has helped over 150,000 small- and medium-sized \nmanufacturers in this country.\n  It is based on the cooperative extension model with Agriculture in \nthat it is set up to provide best management practices, efficiencies, \nand support for our manufacturers as they compete in a global economy. \nIt has helped them to maintain and increase jobs and be able to \nincrease sales by----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend, please.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I was simply explaining the amendment \nthat was adopted.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there is 30 minutes on her amendment, \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator send her amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Actually, Mr. President, I think the confusion is that \nI am\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\nspeaking for a moment about what was just accepted and wanted to say \nthank you to the chairman and the ranking member for accepting our \nrestoration of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program funding. \nThere was a 60-percent cut proposed by the President. This, in fact, \nrestored it. And I want to say thank you, and then also indicate that \nthe chairman of the committee, while there are not always amendments or \npolicies or approaches we agree on, has been extraordinary as a leader \nof the Budget Committee. I want to say thank you to him and to our \nranking member, Senator Conrad, who have worked so well together.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3056\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, that time will be taken \nfrom the resolution.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3056.\n\n  Ms. Stabenow.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthis budget resolution that would provide $5 billion for our first \nresponders so they can effectively and reliably communicate with each \nother with equipment that can speak to each other: interoperable \ncommunications equipment.\n  I regret to say this administration has been dangerously incompetent \nin providing homeland security funding, and particularly when we talk \nabout what is happening for our first responders in their ability to \ncommunicate, whether it is a terrorist attack, whether it is in the \ngulf and what has happened with our natural disasters, or any other \nkind of emergency in our communities.\n  We have seen a dangerously incompetent situation that has put our \nfamilies and our communities at risk. We have known for a long time \nthat too many of our police and fire and emergency medical workers and \ntransportation officials cannot communicate with each other or they are \nnot able to link up with State or Federal agencies.\n  The September 11 attacks highlighted this problem, when New York \npolice and fire personnel were on different radio systems, couldn't \ncommunicate, people running into buildings when they should have been \nrunning out. The 9/11 Commission found that the inability to \ncommunicate was a critical element at the World Trade Center, at the \nPentagon, and in Somerset County, PA, where multiple agencies and \nmultiple jurisdictions responded.\n  Last December, the 9/11 Commission gave Congress a failing grade--an \nF--because it had not set a date for the transfer of analog spectrum to \nfirst responders for their interoperable communications needs.\n  A June 2004 U.S. Conference of Mayors survey found that 98 percent of \ncities do not have interoperable communications. In other words, the \npolice department can't talk to the fire department or can't talk to \nemergency medical personnel, or they can't talk to folks at the county \nor the city or the township or the State. And 60 percent of the cities \ndo not have the ability to talk with their State emergency operations \ncenters. This is not acceptable. I believe this shows a dangerously \nincompetent situation. Almost half of the cities that responded to the \nsurvey said that a lack of interoperable communications had made a \nresponse to an incident within the last year difficult.\n  The most startling finding was that 80 percent of the cities don't \nhave interoperable communications with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity or the Department of Justice--80 percent of our cities not \nwired to be able to talk to Homeland Security or the Justice \nDepartment. This is a dangerously incompetent situation. Despite these \nwarnings, the Federal Government still has not taken decisive action to \nsolve the problem, and we saw the devastating cost of this with \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. In New Orleans, the police departments and \nthree nearby parishes were on different radio systems. Police officers \nwere calling Senator Landrieu's office here in DC because they couldn't \nreach the commanders on the ground in New Orleans. That is \nunacceptable. We can do better than this, and we must.\n  During my visit to the region with the Senate leadership, I had the \nopportunity to speak to many men and women who were working very hard \nin those initial days. Sitting in front of the New Orleans Convention \nCenter talking to someone from the Michigan Army National Guard and the \nMichigan Coast Guard, which were both there working very hard, I asked \nthem if they had radios, and they said yes. I asked if the radios could \ntalk to each other, and they said no.\n  I said: What happens when you are out in a boat? What happens when \nyou are trying to communicate?\n  One gentleman said: We use hand signals.\n  In the United States of America, in 2006, that is a dangerously \nincompetent situation.\n  We know this is an ongoing problem, not only because police and \nfirefighters tell us that it is, but high-ranking Government officials \nconcede this is a problem. In November of 2003, the White House Office \nof Management and Budget testified before a House committee that there \nwas insufficient funding in place to solve the Nation's communications \ninteroperability problem. It would cost over $15 billion to begin to \nfix the problem. Yet again we have been dangerously incompetent in \naddressing this critical threat.\n  The Federal Government must make a substantial financial commitment \nto solve this problem. At this time, our State and local governments \nare stretched too thin and have too many urgent and competing \npriorities to effectively and completely solve this on\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\ntheir own. In fact, we have an obligation. As we talk about security, \nas we talk about making sure we are safe, how in the world can we do \nthat if we in 2006 have not figured out how to have the radios \nconnected to each other so folks can talk to each other in an \nemergency? The Federal Government has not made the necessary \ncommitment. My amendment begins to do that. It takes a major step in \nthe right direction.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security, from 9/11 through \n2005, the Federal Government has spent only $280 million directly on \ninteroperable communications. But none of those funds has been provided \nto help State and local emergency responders purchase equipment they \nneed to talk to each other. I know our esteemed leader on the Budget \nCommittee will argue that Congress has provided Homeland Security \ngrants to our State and local emergency responders and that \ninteroperable communications are an eligible expense. Saying that radio \nequipment is an eligible expense for funding and actually providing the \nfunding are two different things.\n  The problem is, these Homeland Security grants have also been \nsubjected to repeated cuts, including in this year's budget. Our first \nresponders are being given less overall support in funding to try to \nmeet a growing list of homeland security needs that includes radio \ncommunications. That is not a real solution. We can do better, and we \nmust.\n  We need direct funding to solve this problem. That is what my \namendment does. God forbid there is another terrorist attack or a \nnatural disaster. Are we going to tell the American people that we \ndidn't provide direct funding to fix a failed communications system \nbecause it was eligible under another underfunded grant program? This \nis a dangerously incompetent response to a critical threat to our \nfamilies' safety.\n\n  I understand fixing our first responders' interoperability crisis is \nnot only a funding problem but also a problem of allocating necessary \nspectrum. I know this is a difficult issue to solve. I believe we need \nto eliminate these barriers as quickly as possible.\n  I also agree that nationwide standards must be set to ensure that any \nmoney spent is spent wisely. I am a cosponsor of legislation introduced \nby Senator Lieberman and approved by the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs. The Assure Emergency and \nInteroperable Communications for First Responders Act not only begins \nto provide the resources necessary to solve this problem but ensures \nthat the Federal Government takes a strong role in leading our State, \nlocal, and Federal assets toward true communications interoperability.\n  I have offered several amendments since 9/11 to provide our first \nresponders with the equipment they need to keep our communities safe. \nLast year, I offered this same amendment to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill and the Science-State-Justice-Commerce \nappropriations bill. While I have not yet been successful, I assure \nyou, I will continue to fight until the men and women in Michigan and \nall across our country and their families, the people on the front \nlines of our homeland security, have the equipment they need and the \nability to communicate effectively and reliably when we have an \nemergency. This is one of the most fundamental issues for us in making \nsure our families are safe. I am hopeful that my colleagues will \nsupport this amendment.\n  May I ask how much time remains on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, is that the time on my side or the time \nin total?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the side of the sponsor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will take the remaining 4 minutes and then turn it \nover to the chairman.\n  This evening, there will be an amendment offered by Senators Dayton, \nChambliss, and myself to address what is another important part of \nhomeland security or law enforcement funding that the Federal \nGovernment provides, and that is through the Byrne/JAG grant program. \nThis was proposed for complete elimination in the administration's \nbudget. It provides critical support as it relates to addressing drug \ncrimes, helping with juvenile delinquency, addressing community \npolicing, other important items that help keep our communities safe. I \nam very pleased to be a sponsor. It is a bipartisan amendment. I am \nhopeful that it will pass.\n  In my State, we have 1,543 fewer police officers on the street since \n9/11/01. Those are shocking numbers. The Byrne program is critically \nimportant in supporting our law enforcement officials. For example, in \n2004 alone, Michigan drug task forces rescued 423 children from drug \nhouses and arrested 659 major drug traffickers. They have been able to \ndeal with the meth problem and assist victims of domestic violence. The \nlist goes on and on. The Byrne program is an incredibly important part \nof supporting law enforcement. My colleagues and I will be offering \nthis later this evening. I am hopeful we will receive support for it.\n  We are seeing too many cases where law enforcement is losing the \nresources they need to be effective. I am hopeful that the Byrne grant \nprogram will be reinstated and that we will join in a bold, effective \napproach for interoperability communications so that we know, whether \nit is natural disasters, a terrorist attack, or just keeping us safe in \nour communities, that, in fact, our local responders will be connected, \nnot only to each other but to State and Federal agencies. It is \ncritical that we get this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I greatly respect the Senator from \nMichigan. I especially respect and appreciate her dedication to trying \nto make sure we straighten out this issue of interoperability because \nshe clearly has identified it as a critical issue in the area of first \nresponders. And we know it is. We know it has to be addressed. I don't, \nhowever, agree with the approach she is taking, which is essentially to \nput significantly more dollars into the pipeline. Why? Basically for \nthis reason: In the last budget process, the Commerce-State-Justice \ncommittee put $2 billion of additional money into the interoperability \npipeline. Then in the deficit reduction bill, which no Democrats voted \nfor, but this was not the big item that caused that to happen--\nactually, I am sorry, I think two Democrats voted for it--we put an \nadditional billion dollars into interoperability. And really a large \npart of that was in response to some of the points that have been made \nby the Senator from Michigan. So she has done a pretty good job of \nenergizing money flowing into these accounts--in fact, so much so that \nwhen you tie that in with the first responder funds which are already \nin the pipeline, $5 billion of which have not been drawn down yet, \nwhich funds will go disproportionately, I suspect, toward \ninteroperability issues, easily being a plurality the way the funds \nwill be spent, if not a majority of the way the funds will be spent, \nyou literally have a huge amount of money in the pipeline headed out to \nthe States, to communities for the purposes of addressing the issue of \ninteroperability.\n  The problem isn't dollars right now. The problem is the technical \nability of different agencies to agree on an interoperable standard. \nEvery State sees it. You certainly see it across State lines where \nState police organizations have trouble communicating with local police \norganizations and fire departments have a different system than the \nother police in the community. And then the Federal agencies on top of \nthat--Customs, Immigration, FBI, ATF--have problems communicating with \nthe State people. The county people have problems communicating with \nthe State people. They have all, over the years, bought different \nsystems. There is already in place a massive amount of communications \nequipment out there, and you can't just replace it all. We could never \nafford to do that. You have to create an atmosphere where, as they \neither upgrade or they change or they basically agree to try to work \ntogether, there is a system to accomplish that.\n  The problem we have today is that those systems are not in place. \nMost of the State plans we have received that involve interoperability \nas an element--every State plan has interoperability as one of its \npriorities--have not been executed because of the fact\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\nthat they can't figure out how to do interoperability. Literally, they \nhave been negotiating now for 5 or 6 years on a regime, an \nunderstanding, a protocol for general interoperability, and they can't \nreach agreement.\n  What is happening is--and the Senator from Michigan makes this point, \ntoo. I don't know if she did in her statement; I regrettably had to \nleave the Chamber--there is a lot of inventiveness out there. We have \nturned loose the creative juices of America on this because there is a \nlot of money in the pipeline, and a lot of people want to participate \nin it. There are a lot of good ideas coming up quickly as to how to do \ninteroperability without having to do massive hardware changes, and how \nyou can get different systems built by different contractors to \ncommunicate with each other. They are not in place yet, but the dollars \nare there to buy them. A lot of money is there to buy them. We do not \nneed this money at this time.\n  At some point in the future, we are going to need the money--when the \nhouse starts to get in order and there is a sugaring off of what the \nproper technology is and maybe there is an agreement on a national \nstandard or something, then we will need some more money. We will put \nmore money in at that time. To put more money in at this time is \nunnecessary, to be very honest. I am afraid we will simply overwhelm \nthe system with dollars and end up with a lot of blue lights and \ncruisers being purchased and not a lot of good, standardized, \ninteroperable communications systems. That is one reason I oppose it.\n  The other reason I oppose the amendment is it would raise the caps. I \ndon't think we should be raising the caps in this budget. I made that \ncase about 15 times in the last 2 days, so I won't state that case. It \nis a pretty valid case. We are opposed to this amendment. I appreciate \nthe energy of the Senator from Michigan on this issue. I think she has \nhad an impact already, and I believe it is reflected in the fact that \nthere is so much money presently in the pipeline. But it has not been \nspent. Until there is a better plan to spend it, I don't think we need \nadditional funds.\n  I yield back our time on this amendment. I think the Senator's time \nhas expired; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 24 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back our time.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are ready to go to the next amendment. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3054\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3054 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], for himself, \n     Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \n     Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Schumer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3054.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide an additional $965 million to make our ports more \n  secure by increasing port security grants, increasing inspections, \n improving existing programs, and increasing research and development, \n and to fully offset this additional funding by closing tax loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $704,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $517,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $445,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $264,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $704,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $517,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, increase the amount by $445,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $264,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $965,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $352,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $259,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $223,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $132,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, increase the amount by $352,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 21, increase the amount by $258,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 23, increase the amount by $222,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 25, increase the amount by $132,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 8, decrease the amount by $352,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 10, decrease the amount by $610,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 12, decrease the amount by $832,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 14, decrease the amount by $964,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 16, decrease the amount by $964,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 22, decrease the amount by $352,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 24, decrease the amount by $610,000,000.\n       On page 7, line 2, decrease the amount by $832,000,000.\n       On page 7, line 4, decrease the amount by $964,000,000.\n       On page 7, line 6, decrease the amount by $964,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 22, increase the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 23, increase the amount by $60,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 3, increase the amount by $222,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 7, increase the amount by $186,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 11, increase the amount by $132,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 24, increase the amount by $365,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $292,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 4, increase the amount by $37,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, increase the amount by $37,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 1, increase the amount by $965,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 2, increase the amount by $352,000,000.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of not \nonly myself but Senators Clinton, Durbin, Lautenberg, Boxer, Nelson of \nFlorida, and Lieberman. I also ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nReed of Rhode Island and Senator Schumer as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the 9/11 Commission told us that to \nprevent a terrorist attack, we had to think outside the box. If an \nordinary envelope could be turned into a biological weapon and a \npassenger plane into a weapon of mass destruction, then it takes little \nimagination to see how a container could be used to transport a nuclear \nweapon to the port of New York and New Jersey, or any other seaport, \ncausing tens of thousands of casualties.\n  The 9/11 Commission told us to think outside the box, but when it \ncomes to port security, I believe we must think inside the container. \nThe bottom line is, we don't know what is inside the vast majority of \ncontainers entering this country because despite repeated warnings from \nsecurity experts from both within and without our Government, only 1 of \nevery 20 containers that passes through our ports is inspected--\ninspected. That is very important. Not screened but inspected. Ninety-\nfive percent of the cargo received no inspection other than a cursory \nglance at the cargo manifest.\n  Now, let me point out what the Government Accounting Office said when \nit stated that the manifest information, the listing of what goes into \nthese containers ``may be unreliable and incomplete. There is no method \nto routinely verify whether the manifest data accurately reflects the \ncontents within the cargo container.''\n  That is why I am offering this amendment with our colleagues, which \nwill put us on the road to 100 percent container scanning.\n  As port security experts Stephen Flynn and James Loy point out--James \nLoy was the former Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security and the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard, and Stephen Flynn is well known in this \nfield. They said:\n\n       To ensure port security, we must construct a comprehensive \n     global container inspection system that scans the contents of \n     every single container destined for America's waterfront \n     before it leaves a port.\n\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\n\n  We need to take advantage of existing technologies that can scan the \ninside of a container and create a downloadable image of what is \ninside. That image can be viewed in real time back here in the United \nStates so we know what exactly is in these containers. When this \ntechnology is combined with scans for radioactive materials, we can \nfind dangerous materials before it is too late.\n  That is why our amendment provides $105 million for this dual \ntechnology in the United States. It provides $50 million to help \ndeveloping countries which may not have the funds to buy this new \ntechnology. In fact, these ports could be the weakest link in our \ninternational port security chain. We must be sure they do not become \neasy targets for terrorists looking for lax security practices. And it \nprovides $10 million to make sure the United States can integrate these \nnew technologies into our existing scanning and inspection system.\n  While we are waiting for this new international scanning system to \nbecome fully operational, we must make sure we increase inspections \nthrough our existing programs and improve on-the-ground security at our \nports. That is why this amendment provides $100 million for at least \n400 additional inspectors, both here and abroad. I would note the \nfunding in my amendment is specifically for staff at ports, both here \nand abroad. I believe we need to make this increase in port security \nand staffing explicit in our budget.\n  I would also note that the Government Accounting Office--in a report \non the container security initiative, which is supposedly this \nadministration's focus on how we do the best we can as it relates to \nport security, and which is designed to target and inspect high-risk \ncargo before it leaves the ports, pointed out that staffing problems--\nthe GAO specifically noted that:\n\n       Staffing imbalances are one of the factors which limit the \n     Custom and Border Patrol's ability to successfully target \n     containers to determine if they are high-risk.\n\n  The Government Accounting Office went on to say:\n\n       As a result of staffing shortages abroad, 35 percent of \n     U.S.-bound shipments from these CSI ports were not targeted \n     and were not subject to inspection overseas . . .\n\n  The essence, the key goal of the CSI program, they said it wasn't \naccomplished.\n  In the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, the C-TPAT \nProgram, staffing was also a problem. Specifically, the GAO report \npoints out that the Customs and Border Patrol is not able to validate \nthe self-reported information of C-TPAT members because of ``staffing \nconstraints.'' This means companies which receive less scrutiny and \ninspection under the C-TPAT Program receive these benefits before \n``they undergo the validation process, which is the Custom and Border \nPatrol's method to verify that members' characterization of their \nsecurity measures are accurate and that the security measures have been \nimplemented.''\n  We also provide $600 million for the Port Security Grant Program, \nmore than tripling last year's budget. As this budget reflects no \nchanges over the President's request, we can only assume there is no \nspecific money going to port security grants. The American Association \nof Port Authorities notes that their recommendation to double the funds \nis only ``a modest investment.'' In fact, they point out that doubling \nthese funds would represent ``36 percent of the Coast Guard's projected \ncost of the facility improvements.'' I believe that falls short of the \nmark.\n\n       Security experts tell us that we could more than triple the \n     funding for these grants, and we still wouldn't meet the \n     requirements to implement security measures at our Nation's \n     ports.\n  Finally, we must make sure that we have cutting edge technology to \nsafeguard our ports. This amendment provides $100 million for research \nand development. Up to now, we have not focused enough on creating \nsecond generation technologies for nonintrusive inspections, which the \nprivate sector is unlikely to develop. It is time for that to change.\n  Strengthening security at our ports will not be cheap, and given the \nbudgetary challenges our Nation faces, every dollar is hard to come by. \nBut the status quo is unacceptable. An attack on one of our ports would \nnot just cause a tremendous loss of life that has no monetary \nequivalent, but would also shut down a port and all of the economic \nactivity it generates at a cost of billions of dollars to our economy.\n  If we could roll back the clock 10 years and spend a few billion \ndollars to raise the levees in New Orleans to be able to withstand a \ncategory 5 hurricane, we could have saved hundreds of lives, as well as \nthe billions of dollars it will take to rebuild the city. I don't want \nthis country to look back in hindsight a few years from now with the \nrealization that had we spent the necessary dollars to improve the \nsecurity at our ports now, we could have prevented a major terrorist \nattack.\n  Who among us would be satisfied in the aftermath of an attack that we \ndid not take the steps that could have prevented it because we were \nunwilling to dedicate the necessary resources? That is the choice the \nCongress faces, and for the security of our country it is essential \nthat we make the right one.\n  This amendment is also fully paid for by closing corporate tax \nloopholes that this body has supported before. I urge all of our \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment, as the Senator from New \nJersey mentioned at the end, raises taxes. It raises the cap, so it \nspends a lot more money. And in the context of overall port security, \nalthough it makes a statement, it is not necessarily going to do a \nwhole lot more than what we are doing already.\n  There is, of course, because of the Dubai Ports World situation, a \nhuman cry for more port security. We have attempted over the last few \nyears to try to address port security, and there is still a lot more to \ndo. But there has been a very large commitment to port security, and \nthere has been a lot done. Over $10 billion has been committed to port \nsecurity since 9/11. By next year, 2007, 85 percent of all cargo coming \ninto the United States will be screened. We have in place at the 42 \nlargest shipping ports that ship to the United States significant \ninfrastructure which actually checks the cargo that is going on those \nships.\n  What has happened here is that there has been a decision made, and it \nis the right decision, that the best way to protect ourselves is not to \nwait for the cargo, the container to end up on a shipping dock in \nNewark or a shipping dock in Long Beach, but to have that container \nchecked before it gets on the boat that is going to bring it across the \nocean to Long Beach or to Newark.\n  So a huge amount of infrastructure commitment, people and personnel \nand technology, is being put into that goal. Of course, it doesn't get \nscored as port grants, which is what this amendment is offering up, a \nport grant. Rather, it actually does what the port grant money can't \ndo: it gives us offshore protection of cargo coming into the United \nStates.\n  As I said, by 2007, as a result of this initiative, 85 percent of all \ncargo will be screened. In addition, the Coast Guard has been tooled up \nso that it can actually physically go out and stop a container vessel \nor a tanker on the open ocean if it is concerned that the vessel is \ncoming from a port that doesn't have adequate security relative to the \nloading of the ship, or if it has some other concern, such as \ninformation that the ship might have some threatening cargo. We have \nput in place an outer curtain, which the Coast Guard is pursuing. So a \nlot has been done.\n  Not only has a lot been done, but we are still doing more. In the \nlast budget from Homeland Security, we dramatically increased port \nsecurity funding for this type of a grant program that the Senator from \nNew Jersey has proposed. In this budget, we propose $2 billion of new \nspending for border security, which can be used for port security in \nthe underlying budget over what the President asked for, and then we \nproposed another $2 billion of border security which can be used for \nport issues in the supplemental budget, which runs parallel to this \nbasic budget.\n  So that is $4 billion of new funds which are going to flow into \nborder security, of which a fair amount will go into the ports. So the \ncommitment has been significant and continues to be\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\nsignificant, and it is hard to claim that we aren't actually starting \nto get results from what we are buying.\n  A lot of this port grant money, on the other hand, which goes to the \nport that is in place, that goes to the facility on American soil, is \nending up, unfortunately--maybe not so much going to--it is going to \nsecurity needs, but it is going to security needs which traditionally \nwould have been paid for by the managers of these ports. Basically what \nthey are doing is they are taking the Federal grant money, and instead \nof building a fence, which they should have built anyway and they \nneeded anyway, or instead of building major lighting which they needed \nand should have put in place anyway out of their own funds, they are \nreplacing those funds with Federal dollars and using Federal dollars to \ndo what they should have done anyway. So there is an issue there as to \nwhether we are getting the most bang for the buck through the Port \nSecurity Grant Program.\n  But, in any event, independent of that, to represent that this has \nnot been a very robust effort in the area of port security is wrong. Is \nthere a way to go? Of course there is a way to go.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is suggesting that we should physically \ninspect every cargo container coming into the United States. We don't \nphysically inspect every car that comes across our border. We don't \nphysically inspect every individual who comes across our border, or \nevery piece of luggage that comes across our border. And there is a \nreason for that. It is called: You can't do it and still have an \neconomy that is going to function.\n  What we do, however, is set up a very aggressive regime at these \nvarious ports around the world that are shipping to us, especially the \nmajor ports where we check for what we think is the most threatening \npotential cargo, which we all know what it is. And we are expanding \nthat regime out beyond those shipping ports to the actual place where \nthe containers are filled and putting in place certification programs \nwhich are reviewed and which have on-the-ground inspection capability.\n  Is there more to do? Yes, there is more to do, no question about it. \nBut the point is, this budget assumes there is more to do and puts the \nmoney in it to do more, significantly more. However, this is the cause \ndu jour--I recognize that--and the relevance of what is actually being \ndone isn't considered. The relevance of the money that is in the \npipeline isn't considered. It simply becomes an issue of throw more \nmoney at it and therefore claim that we are resolving the problem \nfaster.\n  As a practical matter, the $4 billion that we have allocated towards \nborder security in this bill is a huge increase, and it significantly \nincreases accounts. The $10 billion that we have already put into this \neffort is showing results, and we are on the path to a very organized \napproach toward how we deal with our ports. We intend to do more, and \nwe believe we have funded that adequately in this bill.\n  However, I know there are going to be additional amendments. I think \nthe leader has an amendment on this point which is at least paid for \ndirectly. The biggest problem with this amendment is it is not only a \nlarge number, especially in the context of the $4 billion that is \nalready there on top of that, but it is a number that is paid for with \na tax increase. I do not believe increasing taxes is the right way to \ngo, nor do I believe breaking the cap is the right way to go.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 5 minutes 45 seconds, and the \nmanager has 6 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nDemocratic whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an interesting amendment. I am \nhappy to cosponsor it with Senator Menendez, Senator Schumer, and \nSenator Clinton.\n  Consider this: When you went to the airport this week and you wanted \nto get on an airplane, they asked you to take your shoes off, right? \nThat is what we do every week around here. That is what we do in \nAmerica to make sure we are safe on an airplane.\n  Now comes the Senator from New Jersey with a request and a suggestion \nthat, in the scheme of things, is much more valuable to our security. \nMillions of containers come into the United States every year. The \nGeneral Accounting Office took a look at the containers we inspect and \nfound that fully one out of three of the most risky containers are not \neven being looked at. We are not inspecting them. So the next time you \ntake your shoes off at the airport, you might ask yourself: Is this \nkeeping America safe? Or would it be keeping America safe to have our \ncontainers inspected, as Senator Menendez is suggesting with his \namendment?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire says it is a lot of money. It is a lot \nof money. It is $900 million for new technology, for new inspectors, \nfor better approaches to looking at these containers. But when you talk \nabout the security of America and the expense we are going through and \nthe lives that are at risk across this Nation and overseas in keeping \nAmerica safe, can we do anything less? I think the Senator from New \nJersey has an excellent suggestion to make America safer.\n  Improving port security is an important part of homeland security \nbecause the U.S. maritime system includes more than 300 sea and river \nports. The system also has more than 3,700 cargo and passenger \nterminals and more than 1,000 harbor channels spread along thousands of \nmiles of coastline.\n  Port security is a multi-layered system of defenses that includes \nmonitoring the people, cargo and vessels entering our ports from the \ntime they leave a foreign port to the time they arrive in the United \nStates. Additional port security funding is needed to improve dockside \nand perimeter security, provide important security upgrades such as \nsurveillance equipment, access controls to restricted areas, \ncommunications equipment, and the construction of new command and \ncontrol facilities.\n  This funding is crucial because our Nation's ports were identified by \nGAO as the remaining ``vulnerability'' in our transportation system and \nthat efforts to secure our Nation's ports ``lacked clear goals and \nmeasures that track progress.'' GAO has also stated that, as a result \nof staffing imbalances, 35 percent of high-risk containers were not \ninspected.\n  In addition, GAO reported that the security checks performed by \nCustoms and the Border Patrol are not rigorous enough and that staffing \nproblems have kept Customs from validating participant's security \ninformation.\n  In Illinois, the Chicago Port is the 36th largest port in the Nation \nand the largest on the Great Lakes. Chicago is also the largest inland \ngeneral cargo port in America, and the city as a whole is the \ncommercial transportation crossroads of the Nation. Illinois and the \nPort of Chicago link waterborne commerce, foreign and domestic, via our \nvast rail and highway systems for distribution throughout all of North \nAmerica, Canada, Mexico, and the world. Global cargo movement through \nthe Chicago area in containers, barges, vessels, trucks, airplanes, and \nrailcars totals hundreds of millions of tons annually. Chicago ranks \nseventh in the Nation among the United States Census Bureau 2004 \nstatistics of the ``Top Twenty-Five Customs Districts. Chicago's total \ndollar value of goods imported and exported is about $94 billion.\n  The City of Chicago and the Chicago police department provide local \nsecurity and the Coast Guard patrols the waterways but additional \nfunding is needed for patrol vessels, security enhancements and \ncameras, and inspection equipment.\n  The Coast Guard estimates that over $7 billion is needed through 2012 \nfor ports to comply with Federal security standards and to date, only \n13 percent of that amount has been provided.\n  In 2006, $175 million was provided for port security which is not \nnearly enough to secure all of the Nation's ports.\n  In 2006, $138 million was provided for the Container Security \nInitiative--CSI--which is not enough to examine high-risk containers at \nevery foreign port with vessels destined for the U.S.\n  I am concerned that 6 percent of the 9 million containers arriving at \nU.S. ports are scanned or inspected each year due to a billion dollar \nfunding\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\nshortage for critical port security needs. Until the administration is \nwilling to work with Congress to fund, equip and hire the needed \npersonnel to protect our ports from being used by terrorists, it will \nnot matter if a U.S. or a foreign company is in charge of our ports. In \nthat regard, our Nation's ports and infrastructure are so important to \nthe security of our homeland that the approval process for foreign \ncompanies that want to manage U.S. infrastructure should include \ngreater Congressional oversight and involvement.\n  The President's budget folds port security in with all other \ntransportation and critical infrastructure needs, eliminating the port \nsecurity grant program in favor of a Targeted Infrastructure Protection \nGrant.\n  The budget also forces ports to compete for limited resources with \nmass transit, rail, and other critical infrastructure sectors.\n  The President's budget requests $139 million for CSI whereby \ncontainers deemed to be high risk are opened and inspected. The \nPresident's budget also requests $76 million for the Customs Trade \nPartnership Against Terrorism--C-TPAT--program which screens shipping \ncompanies and the companies that provide them with any services. More \nmoney is needed than is provided in the President's budget for the CSI \nand C-TPAT programs to inspect containers at foreign ports and validate \nsecurity information.\n  The Menendez-Clinton-Durbin Port Security Amendment moves the U. S. \ntoward the goal of 100 percent scanning of containers. Currently, \nCustoms screens all cargo coming into the U.S. using a combination of \nintelligence information and data provided on shipping manifests. The \namendment provides an additional $600 million for port security grants, \n$100 million for at least 400 new staff to increase inspections and \nidentify high-risk containers as part of CSI and C-TPAT, and $105 \nmillion for radiation portal monitors and gamma/x-ray imaging \ntechnology.\n  Specifically, the amendment triples the current amount of funding for \nthe Port Security Grant Program to $600 million. These funds are highly \nsought by local port authorities such as the Port of Chicago.\n  The amendment provides $100 million to increase the number of \ninspectors at foreign ports and improve the process for validating \nsecurity information.\n  The amendment also provides $100 million in funding for more finely \ntuned technologies that can locate contraband material in shipping \ncontainers.\n  The amendment provides $105 million for U.S. ports to install cargo \nimaging and radiation portal monitors to detect radiation and identify \nhigh density shielding used to block radiation emissions.\n  In addition, the amendment provides $10 million for U.S. ports to \nupdate technology so that officials can receive and integrate \ndownloadable images of containers at foreign ports into our existing \nscanning and inspection system.\n  Finally, the amendment provides $50 million to help developing \ncountries purchase equipment to scan and inspect containers.\n  I ask all my colleagues to stop and reflect for a moment. This is \nabout more than Dubai and who is going to manage our ports. It is about \nthe safety of America. God forbid something happens, let's be on the \nright side of history. Let's support the Menendez amendment and make \nsure these containers are inspected.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding the Senator from New York and the \nSenator from New Jersey wish to speak, and the junior Senator from New \nJersey only has 2 minutes remaining or something like that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 39 seconds remaining to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. GREGG. My understanding was the Senator from New York wanted 2 \nminutes and the Senator from New Jersey wanted 2 minutes. Does the \njunior Senator from New Jersey desire more time?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. One minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield 2 minutes off my time, even though I disagree \nvociferously with their position, but out of the kindness of my heart, \nI yield a minute to the Senator from New York, the senior Senator from \nNew York, so they can make their case, which is only worth about 2 \nminutes, anyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire. He is a tough old New Englander, but he has a heart of gold, \neven when he is wrong on the merits.\n  Mr. President, I salute my colleague from New Jersey for offering \nthis amendment. It says one thing loudly and clearly. Even though, as \nwe hope and believe, the Dubai Ports World deal is now scuttled as far \nas American ports, we have miles and miles to go on port security. This \nis not new to this Chamber. I have introduced amendment after \namendment. I know my colleague from Washington, Patty Murray, and the \nSenator from Maine, Susan Collins, and others have all tried to do more \nfor port security. This amendment does much of the job. We have to \ninspect more than 5 percent of the containers. We need a crash research \nproject so we can develop devices that can scan for nuclear or \nbiological or chemical weapons. We need our ports to have employees who \ncannot forge documents and get a job for bad purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed the 1 minute given to \nhim by the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we need to make sure, for those who \noperate the ports, when they are checked for security that it is a real \ncheck and they can't forge documents or sneak in.\n  There are so many things to do on port security. Even if every port \nwere owned by an American company that had the best of intentions, we \nwould not be doing close to enough.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of my colleague from \nNew Jersey because we have such a long way to go on port security. It \nis a neglected stepchild of our homeland security project, and you \ncannot do it, you cannot do it without the dollars the Senator from New \nJersey has suggested.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to make sure more \ncargo is scanned, to have better screening equipment, tighter security \namong employees, and the other many good things this amendment does.\n  I yield my remaining time back to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, can you tell me how much time there is \non both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 2 minutes 25 \nseconds. The Senator from New Hampshire has 4 minutes 3 seconds.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, when you look over at this section of \nthe Chamber, you see three Senators who were front and close to what \nresults from an act of terrorism. We saw it in the World Trade Center. \nWe lost over 700 people from the State of New Jersey, and the \ncombination was almost 3,000 people. We know what you have to do to \nprevent anything like that from ever happening.\n  We are going to spend up to $500 billion before this year is over on \nour security interests in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we have an \nobligation to do as much as we can for people we serve in an area that \nhas been subjected to terrorism and is classified as the worst 2 miles \nin the country for terrorist attack. Much of that will come as a result \nof the activity in our harbors and our ports.\n  I salute my colleague, new to this body but leaderly in his actions \nthat we have seen thus far, and particularly with this, stepping up, as \nwe say in the vernacular, to the plate to say: OK, Mr. President, you \nwant to protect our people? The leadership here in the Senate certainly \nsays they want to protect our people. Then, by golly, spend the money. \nWe are looking for $900 million for the additional port security funds. \nLet's do it.\n  We survey 5 percent of the cargo that comes in, in containers, to the \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\nThat is nothing, on a relative basis. We ought to spend the money and \nsay to the people in those neighborhoods, the people across the country \nwho would be affected by a terrorist attack: We are going to do what we \ncan to protect you. We say it all the time. Now we have to put up or, \nas they say, be quiet.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the sponsor has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the junior Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include \nSenator Murray as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me make three quick points.\n  No. 1, we don't raise taxes here. We fully pay for it by closing \ncorporate tax loopholes that the Senate has voted on before. That is \nmuch more important to be done, closing those loopholes in favor of \nsecurity, than keeping them open.\n  Second, this is not about physically going into each container, but \nit is about scanning each container so we can see its contents, because \nonly 5 percent get screened. Screened is not an inspection, physical or \notherwise. That means 95 percent of the cargo that comes into the \nUnited States is really untouched.\n  Last, we cannot have it both ways. Either that $4 billion that the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire talks about is about the \nnorthern and southern border and border patrol and inspection and the \nIraq contingency funding, or it is about port security. But it cannot \nbe about both. If you want to protect the ports of the United States, \nif you want to make sure the economic consequences of an attack do not \ntake place, if you want to make sure that we save lives, the only way \nto do that is to adopt the Menendez amendment.\n  I urge our colleagues to do so. We believe in doing so we will have \ncome a significant way on securing the ports of the Nation and, most \nimportantly, securing the citizens of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3061\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself \nand Senator Hutchison and Senator Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself, \n     Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Frist, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3061.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for maritime security, including the \n    Container Security Initiative, improved data for targeted cargo \nsearches, and full background checks and security threat assessments of \n                  personnel at our nation's seaports)\n\n       On page 16, line 21, increase the amount by $978,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 22, increase the amount by $782,400,000.\n       On page 17, line 1, increase the amount by $195,600,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $978,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $782,400,000.\n       On page 28, line 2, decrease the amount by $195,600,000.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this amendment will provide funding for \nmaritime security, including the container security initiative, \nimproved data for targeted cargo searches, and, most important for \npurposes of this amendment, full background checks and security threat \nassessments of personnel at our Nation's seaports. It makes no sense to \nbe obsessed with what is in the containers and ignore those in our own \nports who will handle the containers.\n  In the past few weeks, there has been a new focus on national \nsecurity concerns surrounding our seaports. We have had a lot of \ndiscussion about that issue. Many have called for greater limitations \non foreign ownership as well as increased oversight and inspection of \ncargo ships and loading facilities. This amendment says: Yes, fund port \nand maritime security. But if this is truly a national security issue, \nwe should ensure that we have background checks and security threat \nassessments of the personnel at our seaports.\n  So I repeat, unless we are certain of the individuals who are \nhandling this cargo at our own seaports here in the United States, we \nclearly have not done the job. This amendment provides $978 million to \ninitiate an enhanced maritime security. Of that amount, $728 million is \nprovided as recommended by the Commerce Committee for maritime security \nin S. 1052, the Transportation Security Act, and another $250 million \nis provided to fund these background checks that I was just talking \nabout of the people in our ports who are handling the cargo, the \nsecurity of which and the contents of which we have all indicated we \nare so concerned about. The cost of this amendment is offset within the \nbudget's overall discretionary allocation.\n  So if we really believe, as I know we all do, that our Nation's \nseaports are a national security issue, we ought to enhance port \nsecurity, of course, but all that is completely meaningless unless we \nare certain of the qualifications, the integrity of the individuals in \nour ports here in the United States handling this cargo when it comes \nin. When it comes to port security, you can check all the containers \nyou want, but it does no good unless you have also checked those who \nhandle the containers. We have seen numerous reports of false ID's, \ncriminal activity, and organized crime right here in our own country at \nour seaports. We can't place Americans at risk because we turn a blind \neye to this risk.\n  Let me just sum it up before yielding the floor. What this is about \nis making sure that these individuals at our ports here in America who \nare handling this cargo we have all indicated we have enormous concern \nabout, coming from overseas into the United States, into our ports--\nthat the people handling this cargo in our ports meet the highest \nstandards of integrity because it does not make any difference in the \nworld if we have made sure that the container at its original port of \nembarkation is OK, it doesn't make any difference if we have made sure \nit is OK on the ship on the way over here. If we have the wrong people \nhandling the cargo here in the United States, America is at risk.\n  The amendment I have offered on behalf of Senator Hutchison and \nSenator Frist would secure the funding for these background checks and \nassessments of employees here in our own country handling the cargo in \nour ports.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set side so I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3062\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3062.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, historian and author Henry Adams wrote that \n``practical politics consists in ignoring facts.''\n  Here is a fact.\n  Without offsets, we cannot afford to continue to cram hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of new tax cuts into the federal budget. To create \nthe illusion of affordability, this budget already excludes the costs \nof the war in Iraq beyond next year. It excludes the costs of \nprotecting middle-income taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax \nbeyond next year. It excludes the costs of putting Social Security and \nMedicare on sounder footings. It excludes a host of critical domestic \ninvestments--everything from education funding to highway maintenance--\nand continue to postpone them year after year. Even while it excludes \nor hides all of these inevitable costs, this budget still projects that \nour national debt will continue to rise to stratospheric levels.\n  Here is another fact.\n  Relying primarily on domestic discretionary funding cuts will never, \nnever seriously reduce the annual spending-spree deficits of this \nadministration. The part of the federal budget known as domestic \ndiscretionary spending comprises only one-sixth of the total federal \nbudget. The squeeze on domestic discretionary spending these past few \nyears has already produced funding shortfalls that are not only \nimpractical, but also wholly irresponsible and damaging to our \ncountry's future.\n  These cuts have real-world consequences. They are not just accounting \nexercises. Look at what happened to FEMA's ability to respond to \nnatural disasters. Look at the shortfalls in the LIHEAP program \naffecting so many needs of our citizens in our States. Look at the \ncostly reduction of federal mine safety inspectors, and at the spike in \nmine fatalities this year.\n  Look at the paltry amount included in the budget to prepare and \nrespond to a possible Avian Flu Pandemic--one of the most dangerous \nhealth threats confronting the United States today. Medical experts \nwarn that a global, cataclysmic pandemic is not a question of ``if,'' \nbut ``when.'' Like any natural disaster, it could strike at anytime. \nAvian flu could take the lives of tens of millions of people, and \ndeliver a devastating $675 billion blow to the U.S. economy. Yet, we \nare failing to adequately safeguard the American people because of \npolitical convenience and lust for cuts in domestic spending.\n  Look, for instance, at the shortfalls in veterans funding, with the \nadministration trying to backfill by raising copayments and fees for \nveterans health care services, not to mention the submission of a \nsupplemental budget amendment last year to avoid emergency cuts in VA \nmedical care and services.\n  Witness the gaping holes in our border security, marked by federal \nagents releasing or not even bothering to pursue illegal aliens because \nof lack of detention space and personnel. We can only hope and pray \nthat those determined folks who daily circumvent our border security \nare not al-Qaida operatives.\n  Congested roads, overcrowded schools, deteriorating rail and transit \nsystems, corroding and structurally deficient bridges, functionally \nobsolete locks and dams, overflowing sewers and wastewater \nmismanagement, energy bottlenecks causing higher prices and electricity \nfailures and power outages--these are the festering signs of a nation's \ninfrastructure being slowly starved. Meanwhile, our once strong and \nproud manufacturing sector is buckling from intense foreign competition \nby companies heavily subsidized by their governments. Health care and \neducation expenses are both rising to prohibitive levels for families \nand their employers, and the United States of America is becoming more \nand more addicted to foreign capital and immigrant labor to power our \neconomy.\n  For years we have been determinedly squeezing the wrong pieces of the \nfederal budget in order to fund other pieces, and believe me the \nchickens are coming home to roost.\n  This week, the Congress will vote to raise the debt ceiling to $9 \ntrillion--the fourth nasty increase in 5 years. President Reagan said a \n$1 trillion debt ``can only be compared to the universe because it, \ntoo, is incomprehensible in its dimensions.'' One way to put that \nnumber in perspective is to imagine counting $1 trillion at the rate of \n$1 per second. At that rate, it would take 32,000 years to count $1 \ntrillion. Imagine, 32,000 years to count $1 trillion, and then, when \nfinished, counting it eight more times to reach the total debt of this \ncountry. Such massive debt, and what have we to show for it?\n  An editorial in The Washington Post last year described the \nsituation: ``[We] have let the nation's plumbing rust, its wiring fray, \nits floor joists warp and its walkways crumble . . . Sooner or later, \nthough, we're going to have to pony up . . . If you continue to ignore \nthat drip, drip, drip in the upstairs bedroom, pretty soon you're going \nto be pricing a new roof.'' And don't forget, we will have to borrow to \npay for that roof.\n  This editorial appeared only weeks before Hurricane Katrina. The \ninvestments we delayed and postponed for years in New Orleans are now \ncosting tens of billions of dollars in repairs and new building. It is \na painful lesson, and the government of this country does not seem to \nlearn very fast. We are foolishly ignoring the drip, drip, drip in the \nupstairs bedroom, while the plaster weakens and costs for repairs \nmount.\n  I sympathize with the plight of the chairman of the Budget Committee. \nChairman Gregg didn't craft the budget submitted by the administration, \nbut he has made the loyal decision to adopt and defend the president's \ndiscretionary spending limits. I say to my colleagues that the Congress \ncannot fund this great country's essential needs within those limits. \nToo much of that money is eaten by fighting wars without allied \nassistance, and by waste in the defense discretionary budget for \ncontracts that rip off the taxpayer and skimp on essential services for \nour troops.\n  Within a few days, I will offer two amendments to accommodate the \ncritical investments that we must not continue to postpone. I will \npropose amendments for mine safety, and Amtrak.\n  Today, I offer the first of those two amendments, which would add \n$184 million to the budget for mine safety inspectors and rescue \ntechnology.\n  West Virginia has lost 16 miners this year. Their emergency \ncommunications and breathing equipment proved insufficient, and the \nfederal mine regulator, known as the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration, MSHA, of the U.S. Department of Labor, is operating on \nan insufficient budget.\n  There is no question that the federal coal enforcement budget has \nbeen squeezed in recent years, and that the attrition of federal mine \nsafety inspectors has been ignored as part of an effort to carve out \nmore room in the budget for non-essential tax cuts. Those budget cuts \nhave resulted in gross deficiencies at the Department of Labor.\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\n  The miners trapped underground at the Sago and Alma mines had only a \none-hour oxygen supply to last through a 40-hour rescue. The miners \ntrapped underground could not communicate with the rescue effort on the \nsurface, and the rescue effort on the surface could not locate the \nminers trapped underground. Meanwhile, the number of safety inspectors \ncharged with enforcing the Mine Act has dwindled since 2001, with 217 \nfewer inspectors today to ensure the safety of miners, and the vigorous \nenforcement of the Mine Act.\n  These budget cuts have had real and deadly consequences for coal \nminers. Ask the families about how that feels.\n  This amendment, which I offer with Senators Rockefeller and Kennedy, \nwould be sufficient to replace the 217 safety inspectors that have been \nlost since 2001, and to help get emergency communications and breathing \nequipment into the mines rapidly.\n  In the wake of 21 coal mining deaths this year, and the closure of \nmines for emergency safety inspections, it is essential that the \nCongress provide the Department of Labor with the funds it needs to \nkeep our nation's coal mines operating safely.\n  I am also hopeful that we will soon see legislation from the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, Committee to address the other \nmine safety initiatives that still have not been implemented by the \nDepartment of Labor--emergency communications and tracking \nrequirements, increased and minimum penalties for habitual violators, a \nsuspension of belt-air ventilation for the working areas of mines. \nThese components are addressed by the West Virginia Delegation mine \nsafety authorization bill that still awaits action by the HELP \nCommittee and the Senate. I, and the miners and mining widows of my \nstate, continue to urge the HELP Committee to act quickly on this \nessential legislation. We could have more deaths in the mines any day.\n  In the meantime, we have an opportunity today to address the mine \nsafe1y budget. It is a critical piece of our infrastructure that we \ndare not continue to ignore. The fact is that cuts in domestic \ndiscretionary spending are weakening mine safety efforts. Decency \ndemands that we not wait until more miners die before we do something \nabout it.\n  I urge Senators to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the amendment of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. I understand the personal involvement and concern \nhe has for the mine safety in his State and the extraordinary tragedies \nthey have experienced. I hope there is a way we can work this amendment \nout. In its present form it does raise taxes to pay for it, which I \nwill not be able to support, but I am hopeful we can work something \nout.\n  I yield back the balance of our time in opposition to this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia and am pleased to cosponsor this \namendment. This amendment would add $184 million to the budget for mine \nsafety inspectors.\n  The need for this type of investment is clear. Twenty-four miners \nhave already died this year, 21 of them in coal mines, just one of the \ntotal number of coal mine deaths for all of last year.\n  We know that coal plays a vital role in meeting the Nation's need for \nenergy. Over half of Americans get their electricity from coal. It is \nessential for mines to remain productive. But safety can't yield to \nproduction goals.\n  Protecting our miners is a moral obligation and a national priority. \nWe must do everything in our power to minimize the risk of injuries and \ndeaths.\n  This January, I joined Senator Isakson, Senator Enzi, and Senator \nRockefeller on a trip to the Sago Mine. We met with the families of the \nfallen miners, and they shared their thoughts and memories in a way \nthat deeply touched us all, and made action by Congress all the more \nessential.\n  We need strong mine safety enforcement and inspections. The Bush \nadministration has jeopardized the safety of our Nation's miners by \ncontinuing to cut the number of positions from coal mine safety \nenforcement. The administration's fiscal year 2007 budget continues \nthis trend by proposing a cut of 27 more positions, for a total of an \n18 percent reduction in staff since fiscal year 2001. And there are now \n217 fewer mine safety inspectors than we had in 2001.\n  NIOSH warns that our Nation's mine safety inspectors are aging. \nApproximately 44 percent of the MSHA's underground coal mine inspectors \nemployed in 2003 will be eligible for retirement by 2008. MSHA has not \nadequately prepared for their departure from the workforce.\n  This amendment will help us restore the critical funding needed to \nprovide more mine safety inspectors and ensure that our Nation's miners \nare safe now and in the future, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting it.\n  Mr. GREGG. The next amendment in order, I believe, is the amendment \nof the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3018\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 3018 be called \nup at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss], for Mr. Dayton, \n     for himself and Mr. Chambliss, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Talent, Mr. \n     Obama, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \n     Biden, and Mr. Durbin, propose an amendment numbered 3018.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restore funding for the Byrne/JAG grant program to the FY \n  2003 level of $900 million, offset with an across the board cut to \n       administrative expenses, travel, and consulting services)\n\n       On page 24, line 24, increase the amount by $900,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $198,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 4, increase the amount by $270,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, increase the amount by $180,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 12, increase the amount by $135,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 16, increase the amount by $117,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $900,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $198,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 2, decrease the amount by $270,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 5, decrease the amount by $180,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the amount by $135,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 11 , decrease the amount by $117,000,000.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this amendment is offered by Senator \nDayton and myself, along with Senators Talent, Hagel, Ben Nelson, \nStabenow, Obama, Snowe, Mikulski, Levin, Kohl, Kerry, Bingaman, Salazar \nand Baucus. It restores funding to Fiscal year 2003 funding levels for \nthe Byrne-JAG law-enforcement grant program. I have worked closely with \nSenator Dayton on this issue for some time. Last year we succeeded in \namending the CJS Appropriations bill in the Senate to restore funding \nto the 2003 level, only to see the funds thereafter again removed from \nthe final appropriations bill.\n  The increasingly sophisticated techniques employed by drug \ntraffickers requires a coordinated response by State, local and Federal \nlaw-enforcement. Multijurisdictional cooperation is an essential \ncomponent of any national response.\n  The Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, have been an important part of \nthis essential coordinated response. Programs funded by Byrne/JAG \ngrants have shown dramatic results in reducing crime, particularly drug \nand firearm trafficking, gangs, pharmaceutical diversion, and organized \ncrime. According to data compiled by the National Criminal Justice \nAssociation from self-reported metrics submitted by individual State \nAdministering Agencies for the 2004 grant year, task forces funded in \npart by Byrne-JAG were responsible for: 54,050 weapons seize, 5,646 \nmethamphetamine labs seize, $250,000,000 in seized cash and personal\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\nproperty, and massive quantities of narcotics removed from America's \nstreets, including: 2.7 million grams of amphetamines/methamphetamine, \n1.8 million grams of powder cocaine, 278,200 grams of crack, 73,300 \ngrams of heroin, 75 million cultivated and non-cultivated marijuana \nplants, and 27 million kilograms of marijuana.\n  These are real results which have made America safer and contributed \ngreatly to a 30 year reduction in violent crime in America.\n  Our amendment restores funding to fiscal year 2003 levels, and \nprovides an offset from administrative expenditures. It is money well \nspent to protect Americans from criminal activities.\n  I appreciate greatly the cooperation of the Senator from Minnesota \nand his working together with me on this issue. He has been tireless in \nhis efforts to make sure this amendment has been passed in the budget \nprocess and that we have it included in the appropriations process. \nWhile we were successful last year in the budget and in appropriations, \nin the end it lost this year. We will work harder together to make sure \nthe full spending for the Byrne/JAG grants is included.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota for such time as he may consume \nof the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague and \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, for his leadership on \nthis amendment. It has been a privilege to work with him during the \nlast couple of years. I appreciate his deep commitment to this program. \nIt means a great deal because it demonstrates very clearly to our \ncolleagues that this is a bipartisan commitment, as demonstrated by the \ncosponsors for our amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Harkin, Rockefeller, Nelson \nof Florida, Biden, and Durbin as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am astonished that there is any \ndisagreement about the need for increased funding for the Byrne grants. \nThis is one of the critical programs we fund through the Congress. I am \namazed, as my colleague from Georgia said, that last year the amendment \nwe passed together, which the Senate passed unanimously, was then \nbasically gutted entirely in the conference committee at the insistence \nof the House and the administration. And, in fact, the funding for the \nByrne grant program for this year is cut by one-fourth from what it was \nthe previous year.\n  I have heard suggestions from people that this money is not well \nspent or that it is not needed in particular States. To them, I say, \nplease, please, send your money back. Send it to Minnesota, send it to \nGeorgia. I can assure Members the money in Minnesota is extremely well \nused. It is absolutely necessary.\n  Let me quote, as evidence of that, Mr. Robert Bushman, president of \nthe Minnesota Police and Peace Officers:\n\n       Without the support of the Byrne Justice Assistance Program \n     funding, these drug task forces face reductions that will \n     decrease their abilities and effectiveness. Should this \n     occur, Minnesota's ability to fight the war on drugs would \n     undoubtedly be diminished, with potentially dangerous \n     consequences.\n\n  We talk of the need to protect this country from terrorists. I \nsupport that as strongly as anyone. We have terrorists operating on the \nstreets of Minnesota and I suspect through this country every day. They \nare drug-dealing terrorists.\n  The methamphetamine epidemic which is plaguing my State--small \ncommunities, large cities, rural, urban, everywhere, drugs that I am \ntold are coming in from Mexico in increased numbers, concentrations, \nand potency--is destroying the lives of children as young as 10 years \nold and senior citizens who are in their eighties. It is an equal \nopportunity destroyer.\n  These drug-dealing terrorists are operating with impunity because our \nlocal law enforcement officers do not have the resources, do not have \nthe funds, do not have the numbers, do not have all the resources \nnecessary to combat it and defeat it. That is shameful. This is a \nmatter of priorities.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I commend the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget and the ranking member \nfor their support. I hope we can have this pass as a voice vote, one \nthat will demonstrate clearly to the House overwhelming support. I ask \nthey do their utmost to preserve our position in conference so we can \nget this funding back up from its devastating cut last year to where it \nneeds to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I know I speak for the entire Senate when I \nsay we fully understand the importance of supporting our Nation's law \nenforcement officers and that we all want to do everything possible to \nmake the safety of our communities one of our top budgetary priorities. \nThis is why I rise today to support the amendment offered by my \ncolleagues, Senators Dayton and Chambliss, to restore funding for the \nByrne Justice Assistance grants program.\n  Unfortunately, once again, the President's budget request for fiscal \nyear 2007 does not recognize this priority. In fact, it cuts the entire \nprogram for the second year in a row.\n  During Senate debate on the fiscal year 2006 Department of Commerce, \nJustice, Science and State Appropriations Act, I cosponsored a Byrne \ngrant amendment with Senators Dayton and Chambliss that would have \nincreased the funding for the JAG program to $900 million. That \namendment passed the Senate, but was stripped in conference.\n  I am disappointed that the President's fiscal year 2007 budget \nrequest once again cuts this important law enforcement program, a \nprogram that has suffered significant cuts in the last few years, \ndespite providing real results and benefits around the country. For \nfiscal year 2005, the Byrne/JAG program was appropriated $634 million, \nan overall cut of 12 percent for both programs from fiscal year 2004, \nand a 30 percent cut from the fiscal year 2003 funding.\n  As for fiscal year 2006, the President's budget request proposed the \nelimination of the Byrne/JAG program, but Congress refused. However, \nthe Byrne/JAG program still received a $218 million cut from fiscal \nyear 2005 level.\n  This year, the President's budget request once again eliminates the \nByrne/JAG program from the $416 million--a 34 percent cut from fiscal \nyear 2005 funding level--passed by Congress last year.\n  In Illinois, these cuts will have an immediate and direct effect on \nthe ability of law enforcement to use Byrne grant funds to fight one of \nthe gravest drug threats facing the nation today--methamphetamine.\n  In downstate Illinois, as in other rural communities around the \ncountry, there has been a tremendous surge in the manufacture, \ntrafficking, and use of meth. Illinois State Police encountered 971 \nmeth labs in Illinois in 2003, more than double the number uncovered in \n2000. According to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, \nthe quantity of meth seized by the Illinois State Police increased \nnearly tenfold between 1997 and 2003. This surge is placing enormous \nburdens on smalltown police forces which are suddenly being confronted \nwith a large drug trade and the ancillary crimes that accompany that \ntrade.\n  These police departments rely on Byrne grant funding to participate \nin meth task forces, such as the Metropolitan Enforcement Group or the \nSouthern Illinois Enforcement Group. These task forces allow police in \ndifferent communities to combine forces to battle a regional problem. \nThere are a total of seven meth taskforce zones in Illinois, and these \ntask forces have seen real results with Byrne grant funding.\n  In 2004, the Southern Illinois Enforcement Group accounted for more \nthan 27 percent of the State's reported meth lab seizures, and in that \nsame year alone, Byrne/JAG grants helped Illinois cops make over 1,200 \nmeth-related arrests and seize nearly 350,000 grams of meth.\n  In towns like Granite City and Alton, cuts in Byrne grant funding \nwill force them to make difficult choices about how to allocate already \nscarce police resources. Indeed, the chief of police in Granite City \ntold my staff last year that cuts in Byrne/JAG grant funding would \nthreaten the fundamental viability of his meth task force.\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\n  While meth use continues to grow, it is inconceivable to me that the \nPresident would propose another cut to the resources needed by law \nenforcement to fight crime and clean up the streets. To me, this is yet \nanother example of the misplaced priorities of this administration.\n  We all know that we are facing a real budget crisis in this Nation. \nThe deficit is growing, and we must enforce some fiscal discipline. But \nI don't believe we should be balancing the budget on the backs of our \nNation's law enforcement officers who keep our families and communities \nsafe every day.\n  I am disappointed by the President's fiscal year 2007 budget request \nand hope that the Senate will support my colleagues' amendment and find \nthe necessary funding that local law enforcement needs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dayton amendment \nthat increases funding for the Byrne grant program by $900 million. \nThis is a straightforward amendment worthy of unanimous support.\n  As most of us know, the Byrne grant program is a law enforcement \nfunding program run by the Department of Justice. For 20 years, Byrne \ngrants have funded State and local drug task forces, community crime \nprevention programs, substance abuse treatment programs, prosecution \ninitiatives, and many other local crime control programs. \nUnfortunately, all of this funding is eliminated in the Senate budget \nresolution which follows the administration's budget proposal.\n  This marks the second year in a row in which President Bush has tried \nto kill the Byrne grant program. Given the Bush administration's attack \non law enforcement funding, this proposed cut should come as no \nsurprise. That said, the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program was \nappropriated a little more than $416 million last year in formula \nfunds--despite the administration's desire to eliminate it. But this \namount is less than half of what the program received just a few short \nyears ago.\n  Quite simply, funding for local law enforcement has taken a nosedive \nunder this administration, and it is our local police chiefs and \nsheriffs who are feeling the pain of these cuts. Consider this: since \nPresident Bush has taken office, funding for local law enforcement in \nWisconsin via the Byrne grant program has been cut by more than two-\nthirds. As recently as 2001, Wisconsin received more than $9.2 million \nfrom the Byrne grant program. Thanks to this administration, Byrne \ngrant funding has been steadily declining ever since, with Wisconsin \nreceiving just a little under $3 million last year. Nonetheless, \nPresident Bush wants to go even further and eliminate this funding \nentirely. Of course, this would leave Wisconsin law enforcement nothing \nfrom the Byrne program.\n  What do these cuts mean? It means law enforcement personnel are \ngetting laid off, and that translates to fewer cops patrolling the \nbeat, fewer assistant district attorneys prosecuting cases, and fewer \ndetectives working drug cases, to cite just a few examples. Talk to any \npolice chief, sheriff, or prosecutor back in your home State and they \nwill tell you that the Byrne program is the backbone of Federal Aid for \nlocal law enforcement. Do we really want to walk away from a program \nwith twenty years of success supporting our local police chiefs, \nsheriffs, and district attorneys? We can and must block the elimination \nof the Byrne grant program. The Dayton amendment would achieve this by \nboosting Byrne grant funds back to the fiscal year 2003 level of $900 \nmillion. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment which \nsupports our local law enforcement agencies.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time remains on the measure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 8 minutes 20 seconds and the \nopposition has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I don't believe there is opposition. The Senator from \nMissouri is ready to go and then we go to the Senator from Washington \nfor her amendment.\n  Mr. TALENT. I have no objection to the Senator from Washington going \nahead because she was here.\n  Mr. GREGG. I don't think she is speaking on this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am ready to go with my amendment which follows this.\n  Mr. GREGG. Complete your statement on this topic.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment offered by Senator Chambliss and Senator Dayton, to \ncongratulate them on their efforts in this important area to restore \nfunding for the justice assistance grants, which we have known in the \npast as the Byrne grants, and the local law enforcement program to the \nfiscal year 2003 level of $900 million. I am pleased to be a cosponsor \nof the important amendment.\n  The amendment is almost identical to what was offered on the relevant \nappropriations bill last fall. That amendment passed unanimously. It \nraised the funding amount at that time to $900 million. Unfortunately, \nas Senators have noted, the final appropriations more than stripped the \namendment. It cut Byrne/JAG grants by 34 percent from fiscal year 2005 \nwhich resulted in only $416 million for the program. It is even more \nunacceptable that the administration has zero funded the program in its \n2007 budget request.\n  Justice assistance grants fund a number of local drug education and \ndrug law enforcement programs. These include the crucial \nmultijurisdictional task forces which are especially important in \ncombating the rising rates of methamphetamine production and \ndistribution in communities across the country. Over the past 5 years, \nfunding for Byrne grants and the local law enforcement block grants, \nwhich again are JAG predecessors, have been cut significantly despite \nthe fact that State and local law enforcement have not only been \nsaddled with the additional burden of homeland security but also with \nfighting the methamphetamine scourge that has grown in rural and urban \ncommunities across the Nation.\n  These grants are an essential component of statewide efforts to \naddress violent crime and drugs in my State of Missouri. They funded \nvital projects in the State, including a multijurisdictional task force \nprogram that worked to integrate Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies and prosecutors for the purpose of enhancing \ninteragency coordination and intelligence.\n  To cut this funding would severely damage law enforcement's ability \nto address the methamphetamine crisis in Missouri and would place \ncommunities at risk across the country. That is why major law \nenforcement organizations, including the National Sheriffs Association, \nthe National Police and Peace Officers, and the National Narcotics \nCoalition have all endorsed the amendment.\n\n  In short, the funding is crucial in fighting the Nation's war against \nmethamphetamine and other drugs and necessary for keeping America's \nneighborhoods safe. So I congratulate Senator Dayton and Senator \nChambliss for offering this amendment and urge the Senate to approve \nit.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will claim the time in opposition and \nyield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think Senator Murray is next to be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3063\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator Leahy, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 3063.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restore funding for the Community Development Block Grant \n Program to the fiscal 2004 level by closing tax loopholes previously \n          slated for elimination in Senate-passed legislation)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $26,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $416,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $546,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $182,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $65,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $26,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $416,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, increase the amount by $546,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $182,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $65,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $26,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $416,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $546,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $182,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, increase the amount by $65,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 22, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 23, increase the amount by $26,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 3, increase the amount by $416,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 7, increase the amount by $546,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 11, increase the amount by $182,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 15, increase the amount by $65,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 1, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 2, increase the amount by $26,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors to the amendment Senators Reed, Kennedy, Lautenberg, \nStabenow, Schumer, Mikulski, Durbin, Rockefeller, and Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk \ntonight, that we will vote on tomorrow, restores the $1 billion cut in \nfunding for Community Development Block Grant Programs that are assumed \nin the budget resolution that is before the Senate this week.\n  For more than 30 years, the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram, known as the CDBG, has served as a tremendous catalyst for \nchange in communities across the Nation. It has brought hope and \nopportunity to families and to residents and to communities everywhere \nwe look in this country. For both cities that are urban and rural, CDBG \nhas supported efforts to expand affordable housing. It invests in \nneighborhoods, and it supports local economic development projects that \nhave literally revitalized communities.\n  But tonight, as we look at this budget resolution, that future, that \nhope is really being diminished. The actual opportunity that so many \nfamilies have seen is threatened by the work that will not be done if \nthis budget resolution passes in its current form.\n  The budget resolution we are now considering assumes the President's \nproposed cap on domestic discretionary spending. And that includes a $1 \nbillion cut to the Community Development Block Grant Program. By the \nway, that is on top of a $500 million cut that this program received \nlast year.\n  Now, every one of my colleagues knows how successful this CDBG \nProgram is. You can see its impact in every community back home. Over \nthe past 4 months, I have had the opportunity to talk with mayors and \nhousing authority officials and other local leaders to see how they are \nusing CDBG, and there are some great examples I want to share with the \nSenate tonight.\n  The city of Spokane, WA, used $220,000 in CDBG funds and helped \nremodel and expand the Native Health Clinic and Community Center. This \nis a clinic in Spokane that provides medical care, substance abuse \ntreatment, mental health and counseling services to economically \ndisadvantaged children, youth, and adults. This money made a \ndifference.\n  In Vancouver, WA, in the other corner of my State, the Vancouver \nHousing Authority used CDBG funds to help fund the Esther Short \nCommons. This is a mixed-use, mixed-income building with 160 units of \naffordable workforce housing. It is home to businesses in the Vancouver \nFarmers Market. That building is a very important part of downtown \nVancouver's redevelopment. Those funds made a critical difference.\n  In Bremerton, in Kitsap County, Kitsap Community Resources is using \n$950,000 in CDBG funding to help build a new facility that will serve \nthe needs of low-income people in Bremerton and Kitsap County. That \nfacility houses a WIC clinic and employment and education programs and \nis a great addition to the city's efforts to revitalize its downtown. \nIt is a great investment of Federal dollars.\n  And in Seattle, the Delridge Neighborhoods Development Association \nreceived $850,000 in CDBG and home funds from the city of Seattle and \ndeveloped the Croft Place Townhomes. That is a development that is now \nproviding good housing for 21 families at or below the 30- and 50-\npercent of median income, including families who were previously \nhomeless.\n  These are just a few examples of how these Federal dollars leverage a \ndifference in our home States. I know every one of my Senate colleagues \nhas heard from their mayors and their communities about the importance \nof the flexibility of this money and the critical difference it makes \nin the lives of so many.\n  As I have said on this floor many times, if we want to be strong \nabroad, we have to be strong at home. And investing in our \ninfrastructure, bringing new economic revitalization, making sure that \naffordable housing is available for families, is an absolutely \nessential part of making sure our country is strong at home.\n  Any one of us can tell you that if a family does not have a place to \ncall home, then they are not going to be strong, and they are not going \nto feel their family has opportunity in the future. If you are a young \nwoman trying to raise a family alone, you know you need to have a place \nto live or those kids are not going to do well in school and your \nopportunity to send them to college is minimized.\n  Every one of us knows that a senior citizen who does not have a place \nto call home that is convenient to services they need--whether it is \ntheir doctor or physical activities--is not going to be able to have \nthe dignity they deserve at the end of their life.\n  And every one of us knows that for families who cannot afford housing \nin many communities across our States--my State and across the Nation--\nif they do not have a place to call home that is close to a job, they \nare not going to be economically self-sufficient.\n  These CDBG funds have made an incredible difference in people having \nthe security of housing, a place to call home, and financial stability. \nAt the same time, they are bringing economic development, new jobs, new \nbusinesses, new economic revitalization, to many of our communities.\n\n  Cutting these programs by $1 billion is a disservice to those \nfamilies, but it is a tragedy for this Nation because we cannot be \nstrong if our families are feeling insecure at home because of the lack \nof housing. These dollars, we all know, make an incredible difference. \nThis program has changed lives and changed communities.\n  Now, tomorrow our colleagues on the other side are going to offer an \namendment they say will do the same thing. First of all, I thank them \nfor recognizing the budget resolution is not sufficient and does not do \nthe job when it comes to CDBG. But I will call them on how they are \ngoing to fund it. Once again, we will see them funded with funny money, \nsaying: We are going to take it from section 920.\n  Well, already today, this Senate has gone on record taking $6.5 \nbillion from the so-called 920 fund. And it is not there. Why do I know \nthis? Because last year, at this same exact time, Senators on the other \nside offered an amendment to restore funding for CDBG, and come \nOctober, November, and December, when we were doing appropriations \nbills, this Senate cut half a billion dollars from CDBG. Why? Because \nthe money offered in the amendment on their side was not real.\n  The same thing is going to happen tomorrow. Senators will have an \nopportunity to pass a phony amendment and to go home and say to their \nconstituents: Oh, I voted for CDBG. But the bill will come due in the \nfall, when we do an appropriations bill and that money is not \navailable, and we will see CDBG cut dramatically.\n  As ranking member on the TTHUD Subcommittee that has the funding on\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\nthis, I know where this is going to go. I urge my colleagues, and I \nwill tell this country, if you vote for the Murray amendment, you are \nasking for real dollars. You are telling your communities you are going \nto be there to help families with affordable housing and communities \nwith redevelopment. If you vote for the amendment from the other side \noffered by Senator Santorum, you are going to get a nice vote for the \nday. All Senators will support it. But all it does is say, politically: \nYes, I think CDBG is good. It will not provide one single additional \ndollar when we come to actually appropriating these funds.\n  So this is extremely critical. Everywhere I go in neighborhoods \nacross my State, I see the insecurity of so many families. They are \nworried about their jobs. They are worried about whether their kids can \ngo to college. They are worried about whether their pension is going to \nbe there. They worry about whether transportation infrastructure is \ngoing to be capable of getting them to their job or back home again. \nPart of that insecurity, and the most basic part of that insecurity, is \nhousing.\n  That is what these CDBG funds do. Every Senator on this floor knows \nit. When you invest in our infrastructure, whether it is housing or \ntransportation, especially through funds such as this, you are creating \nnew jobs, new economic development, and revitalizing communities in \nways that I have seen no other dollars do.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow, again, we will have an opportunity to do a \npolitical move if we vote for the Santorum amendment and say we are \ngoing to take money from this 920 fund that does not exist, or we can \nraise the cap, and then, when we are here next fall, actually fund CDBG \nat a promised level that this Senate will go on record on. It is a \ncritical amendment. I urge its adoption by my colleagues tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 5 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3054\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will take one additional minute and \nthen yield back my time. But I did want to say, while I had the floor, \nthat I added myself as a cosponsor to the Menendez port security \namendment. This is a critical amendment. It is an issue I have been \nworking on since September 11. I have joined with Senator Collins to \nintroduce the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act.\n  I think what we have all learned over the past week is that our ports \nand our cargo containers are a huge hole in our Nation's security. We \ncannot fix it with more rhetoric from this floor. We can fix it if we \nfund it adequately. This Senate will have an opportunity to vote on \nthat tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support that amendment when it \ncomes to the floor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I will yield back my time in order to move \nto the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3063\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in a second we are going to go to the \nSenator from Ohio, who is going to speak relative to the resolution. \nBut I want to quickly respond.\n  The Senator from Washington has proposed an amendment which raises \nthe cap, and it raises taxes. There is a better way to do it. The \nbetter way is Senator Santorum's amendment, which will come tomorrow, \nwhich says we identify CDBG as a priority, and within the caps we find \nthe money for CDBG recognizing we may have to do an across-the-board \ncut of other accounts. That is the right way to do this. It sets \npriorities.\n  The Senator from Washington is the ranking member on the \nappropriating committee which will have responsibility for this. \nHistorically that committee has always funded this account. They have \nalways found this to be a priority, and they have always found the \nmoney to do it. I do not think that history is going to change this \nyear.\n  I do think Senator Santorum has the right way to do this. We should \nnot be passing a tax-and-spend amendment, which is what this amounts \nto.\n  At this point, I will yield back the remainder of the time in \nopposition to the Murray amendment and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak not only on the \nfiscal year 2007 budget resolution that has been placed before this \nbody but also on the environment in which Chairman Gregg has had to \nwrite the resolution.\n  First of all, I thank our chairman for his yeoman effort to bring \nthis budget to the floor. Chairman Gregg has produced a very strong \neffort under difficult circumstances.\n  For once, I am excited to see the chairman's limitation on the use of \n``emergency'' designations for the fiscal year 2007 budget. While \nutilizing ``emergency'' spending may be necessary, Senator Gregg has \nput in place a process to force us to reflect on what should be deemed \nas an ``emergency'' and consequently sidestep the regular budgetary \nprocess versus what should be moved as part of the regular \nappropriations process. In other words, all of us feel that in terms of \nour emergency spending, much of it should be actually in the regular \nbudget resolution rather than considered as emergency spending.\n  I also applaud the chairman's inclusion of a new point of order \nagainst direct spending that would apply once it was determined that \nthe general fund would contribute more than 45 percent of total \nMedicare outlays. This new point of order serves to highlight what all \nof us know is decimating future budgets--the impending costs of \nMedicare and other entitlements.\n  While I respect the efforts required in producing this budget, and \nthe effort to try to comply with the cap that the President issued, it \nis the view of this Senator that the budget falls short of meeting the \ncurrent pressing needs of our country, and those sentiments are \nreflected in some of the amendments that have and will later be offered \nto the budget.\n  Each of us must be able to justify our actions on behalf of our \nconstituents. During my first biennial budget, as Governor of Ohio, I \nhad to go back to the budget four separate times to find additional \nareas to cut. But after cutting program after program, I could not \njustifiably say I provided for the public good by slashing more. \nIndeed, I made the difficult choice to ask the legislature to increase \ntaxes at the margins. After keeping spending to its lowest growth in 30 \nyears, we were able to reduce taxes my last 3 years in office. But we \ndid take care of the needs of the people of the State of Ohio.\n  I am not calling for raising revenues at this time. However, I am \ncalling attention to what I view as a lackadaisical attitude toward \nwhat I believe is a freight train bearing down on our fiscal house. I \nvoted for tax cuts in 2001, 2002, and 2003. In 2001, we were projecting \nsurpluses beyond the horizon, I think a $5.4 trillion surplus in 10 \nyears. We believed those surplus funds were better utilized in what I \ncalled the three-legged stool of fiscal responsibility--pay down the \ndebt, spending restraint, and returning excess funds to households so \nas not to be unwisely spent.\n  In 2002, I supported additional tax cuts to stimulate our economy in \nthe aftermath of September 11. And in 2003, our country was still \nreeling from September 11, the war against terror, and corporate \naccounting scandals. We needed additional stimulative medicine. I \nfought to ensure that the amount we passed was the right amount. I said \nthat $350 billion in tax cuts would be enough to get the economy \nmoving, and I believe that it worked.\n  However, the world does not stand still, and we now face different \nchallenges. Since that time, the economy has grown. The Nation's GDP \ngrew by 4 percent in both 2003 and 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005. \nUnemployment has dropped since we enacted the tax cuts from 6.6 percent \nto the current 4.8 percent. I wish it were as good in the State of Ohio \nas that, but overall that is what it is. While the tax cut stimulation \nworked, making these tax cuts permanent should be subject to pay-go. I \nam sorry today that we didn't have the votes to do that.\n  While the economy has been renewed, our Nation has had to pay for the \nextraordinary expenses of Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as responding \nto our concern for homeland security for\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\nwhich, since 2001, we have tripled governmentwide spending related to \nnondefense homeland security, and on top of that add in the expenses of \nHurricane Katrina. What I am saying is that with the 22 agencies we \nbrought together after 2001, 180,000 people, we have tripled the budget \nof those agencies since 2001. While we are dealing with all these \nexpenses, we are ignoring the 800-pound gorilla in the room: the \nimpending tidal wave of entitlements coming due. In his State of the \nUnion Address, President Bush acknowledged that:\n\n       The retirement of the baby boom generation will put \n     unprecedented strains on the federal government. By 2030, \n     spending for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will be \n     almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. And that will \n     present future Congresses with impossible choices--staggering \n     tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every \n     category of spending.\n\n  I am pleased that the President decided to focus on what some have \ncalled the demographic tsunami coming our way and the necessity to \nreform entitlement programs before it hits. The 77 million baby boomers \ncoming into Social Security and Medicare Programs will put the Federal \nbudget under unprecedented pressure. Chairman Gregg took the courageous \nstep to take on entitlement spending through the Deficit Reduction Act \nof 2005, and I supported those efforts. However, this was just the tip \nof the iceberg. I would support greater efforts to continue to debate \non entitlement reform so that we may make wise decisions and not \ndecisions stemming from unneeded dawdling and delay.\n  No matter which way you look at it, if we leave reform of entitlement \nprograms to future Congresses to handle as well as a mountain of \nnational debt to pay off, it will have devastating consequences on the \neconomy and our children.\n  We owe it to the American people to let them know the true condition \nof our Federal budget. Currently, governmental expenditures absorb \nabout 20 percent of the GDP, while our tax receipts are only 17.5 \npercent of GDP. The debt has grown from about $5.5 trillion when I \nfirst came into office in 1999 to a staggering $8.1 trillion today. \nThat is a 47-percent increase. The debt service alone threatens to \ngobble up revenues in the near future.\n  According to the CBO, in fiscal year 2005, interest on the public \ndebt grew more rapidly than any other major spending category, rising \n14 percent above the fiscal year 2004 level. Without major spending \ncuts, tax increases, or both, the national debt will grow more than $3 \ntrillion through 2010 to $11.2 trillion according to GAO--nearly \n$38,000 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. The \ninterest alone will cost $561 billion in 2010, the same as today's \nbudget for the Pentagon. Think of that.\n  However, we all know that the real problem is our long-term debt. I \nmight mention in terms of our interest costs, if the central banks of \nforeign countries that are investing in our debt decide to redo their \nportfolios, we are really going to be in trouble because we will see \nour interest costs spike dramatically.\n  By the General Accounting Office's own estimates, about 35 years from \nnow, when my grandchildren have their own children to care for, \nbalancing the budget will require actions as large as cutting total \nFederal spending by 60 percent or raising taxes to 2\\1/2\\ times today's \nlevels. Think about that. And if we are going to be honest with the \nAmerican people about the shape of our fiscal house, we should be \nhonest on budgeting. Accrual accounting is what we require private \nbusinesses to use in presenting their finances to give an honest \nsnapshot. On an accrual basis, our Federal deficit for fiscal year 2005 \nwas $760 billion, representing an increase of $144 billion or 23 \npercent over the previous year's deficit of $616 billion. That is a \nstark difference from the $319 billion deficit that was reported. That \nis what we told the American people: It is $319 billion. Under this \nconvenient Government accounting, it made it look as if we had a \ndecrease in the deficit of $93 billion from the previous year's deficit \nof $412 billion.\n  Frankly, if the Treasury Department already has the numbers, why \ndon't we use the accrual method of accounting for our budget? I want to \nremind the American people again, as well as my colleagues in the \nSenate, that the true deficit in 2005 was $760 billion--an increase of \n$144 billion or 23 percent over the previous year's deficit.\n  I have also introduced a bill called the Truth in Budgeting Act, \ncosponsored by Senator Conrad, which stops the Federal Government from \nusing surplus trust fund revenues to hide the true size of the \nGovernment's deficit and highlighting the true size of the Federal debt \nby forcing the Government to increase borrowing from the public to \ncover general fund expenses. It is important to have an honest \naccounting of where we are and where we are headed from a fiscal \nperspective. We need to change the current Federal accounting and \nreporting model and budgeting systems to better reflect the \nGovernment's true financial condition. This will bring about greater \ntransparency and accountability in Government operations and really let \nthe American people know what is happening here in Congress.\n  Additionally, if we are to be honest about the budget, we should make \nreasonable assumptions. The administration's budget assumes enactment \nof more than a dozen user fees totaling $3.2 billion in 2007 to offset \ndiscretionary spending increases. The user fee proposals in the budget \ninclude an increase in airline passenger security fees, changing some \nveterans' enrollment fees for medical care--which, by the way, was \nrejected by the Senate today 100 to 0--increased TRICARE enrollment \nfees and deductibles for military retirees under 65, regulatory fees \nfor explosives, and Food Safety and Inspection Service user fees. These \nproposals have been rejected by Congress in the past and are unlikely \nto materialize. What they will do is, because that money is not going \nto come in, it is just going to squeeze other priorities.\n  Additionally, we are not being honest about the Medicare physician \nfee schedules. Physicians are reimbursed for treatment of Medicare \npatients through that fee schedule. Right now, physicians are facing \nanother 5 percent decrease in their Medicare payment on January 1, \n2007. Reducing physician payments will have a direct negative impact on \nseniors' access to quality health care. Last year, we responsibly \noffset funding to avoid a scheduled 4-percent reduction. We included a \nfreeze in their payment rates in the deficit reduction bill. It has \nbecome evident that we must face this annually, but never truly budget \nfor it. In other words, we know that we can't cut the reimbursement for \ndoctors in this country for Medicare patients, but we just assume that \nwe are going to do it, at least the administration does, knowing full \nwell that Congress is going to have to come in with that additional \nmoney--in this case, $1.5 billion--and that means that there is just \ngoing to be less money for other priorities that we have on our \ndomestic side of the budget.\n  The administration's budget also accounts for an extension of AMT \nrelief in 2006 but not for 2007 or the rest of the 5-year budget \nwindow. The administration says that a permanent solution to the AMT \nissue should be enacted as part of tax reform. However, the likelihood \nof Congress passing tax reform this year, as much as I would like to \nsee it since I offered the legislation calling for the blue ribbon \npanel on tax reform, is slim to none. I feel bad that the \nadministration has backed away from tax reform as a priority since \nsimplifying the Code to make it more simple, fair, and honest could, by \nsome estimates, save taxpayers $260 billion in costs associated with \npreparing their taxes. That is across the country. Saving that cost \nwould be a real tax reduction and not cause the Treasury to lose one \ndime of lost revenue.\n  The question we must ask ourselves is, If we don't have enough \nrevenue to pay our current bills, how in the world are we going to \nprepare to cover much larger future promises? The simple fact is that \nwe can't have it all. We need to set priorities. We need to make \nchoices; otherwise, our children will end up paying for it.\n  Our forefathers recognized the inequity of passing on debt to future \ngenerations. George Washington in his farewell address stated:\n\n       [likewise avoid] the accumulation of debt, not only by \n     shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertion in \n     time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\n     may have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity \n     the burden which we ourselves ought to bear.\n\n  In other words, throwing the cost of a war on to the next generation. \nFrankly, if we are willing to be honest with ourselves and make the \nhard decisions, the last thing we should be doing is talking about \nmaking tax cuts permanent. If we are to be honest and forthright with \nthe American people, we should be asking them to pay for the \nextraordinary cost of the war and improving our homeland security. \nBecause if we are not willing to do so, it will not be Members of this \nbody who are going to be paying the tab. We will be gone. Instead, \nrepayment of the debt will land squarely in the lap of our children and \ngrandchildren. I don't know any parents or grandparents who would think \nit was a good idea to run up huge personal debts that their children \nand grandchildren would have to pay at the time of their death, but \nthat is exactly what we are doing with our Federal budget--passing it \non to our children and grandchildren. The major reason I sought \nreelection to this venerable body was to make sure that was not going \nto be our legacy or the legacy I left my three children and seven \ngrandchildren and my fellow Americans.\n  According to the administration's fiscal year 2000 budget, mandatory \nspending will take up 54 percent of the $2.8 trillion budget; net \ninterest we will have to pay on the debt will eat up 9 percent; 18 \npercent would be allocated for the defense discretionary budget, \nleaving 19 percent for all the discretionary programs or about one-\nfifth of the budget. And what we have been doing the last couple of \nyears is flat-funding discretionary spending, the real increases in \nthis budget. People say: You are spending money. The money is being \nspent on the war and on homeland security. And in terms of \ndiscretionary nondefense spending, we basically have flat-funded that.\n  As I quoted, by the administration's conservative estimate, the \nprograms on auto-pilot, such as Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid, will account for over 60 percent of the budget by 2030. That \ndoes not leave much for all other governmental obligations we have. We \nare putting the squeeze on just one-fifth of the budget while the rest \nsees large increases.\n  We must make entitlement reform a priority, but in the meantime, we \nshould not pretend that by flat funding or cutting nondefense, \nnonhomeland security needs or programs that work and serve a critical \ngovernmental purpose will get the job done. Some of these programs \nactually save the Government money by benefiting the economy or \navoiding further costs down the road.\n  The point is that in this global economy, we are confronted with the \nmost competitive environment our Nation has ever faced, at least in my \nlifetime. Anyone who has read Tom Friedman's book ``The World is Flat'' \nor read the National Academy of Sciences report ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm'' gets it. They get it.\n  In the big picture of where the United States stands, it is clear to \nme that the economic framework of our Nation needs to be refurbished. \nThere are certain investments and responsibilities that this Senator \nbelieves we can no longer ignore and must address. We should be \nrebuilding an infrastructure of competitiveness so that future \ngenerations can compete in that global marketplace and have at least \nthe same opportunity to enjoy our standard of living and quality of \nlife.\n  We cannot remain competitive without a workforce full of educated and \nmotivated young Americans. As a nation, we have to invest in our \nchildren and enable them to fully develop their God-given talents in \norder to compete in a knowledge-based global economy. This means we \nhave to place more emphasis on careers in science, engineering, and \nmath. And right now we are not getting the job done.\n  Globally, the United States ranks 17th in proportion to college aid \npopulation earning science and engineering degrees, down from third \nplace several decades ago. In fact, the percentage of 24-year-olds with \nscience or engineering degrees is now higher in many industrialized \nnations, including England, South Korea, Germany, Australia, Singapore, \nJapan, and Canada. All produce a higher percentage of science and \nengineering graduates than the United States.\n  The National Academy of Sciences released a report this fall that \nrecommends action that the Federal Government should take to enhance \nour ability to compete in our global economy. The recommendations range \nfrom those that will improve our Nation's math and science coursework \nand establish a workforce of qualified teachers who will prepare our \nstudents for futures in highly innovative careers, to the crucial need \nfor energy independence, and an investment in research.\n  I am encouraged the President recognized that America needs to wake \nup and build a new infrastructure for competitiveness, and I applaud \nhis American competitiveness agenda.\n  Also, I have joined a number of my colleagues as an original \ncosponsor of the Protecting America's Competitive Edge Act of 2006, \nPACE. This legislation is aimed at improving our Nation's \ncompetitiveness through advancements in and emphasis on math and \nscience education. Like the President's initiative, this legislation is \ncomprehensive in its aim to increase our Nation's research capacity, \nemphasize strong science and math education, but it will require a \nnational commitment to reengage our Nation's youth in science and math, \nsimilar to our response in the late 1950s to Russia's launch of Sputnik \nand the ensuing space race.\n  In order to implement PACE, it is going to take $10 billion a year \nfor the next 10 years, including making the research and development \ntax credit permanent. That money is not in this budget. That money is \nnot in this budget.\n  Funding for nuclear engineering programs truly showcases the \ndisconnect between our stated priorities and the budget. The \nadministration and numerous Members in this body are supportive of the \nrecommendations in the National Academy's report, which also \nhighlighted the importance of moving toward greater energy \nindependence. However, the administration's budget zeroes out funding \nfor the Department of Energy's University Nuclear Reactor \nInfrastructure and Education Assistance Program from $27 million in \nfiscal year 2006--it is a relatively innocuous amount within the \ncontext of a $2.6 trillion budget. But with our renewed focus on our \nNation's competitiveness and the need to address our education and \nenergy policies, it doesn't make sense to eliminate this program. That \nis what we see all the way through this budget.\n  Additionally, beyond our human capital infrastructure needs, our \nphysical infrastructure needs are facing a real dilemma as well. In \nother words, we have to build that infrastructure of competitiveness. \nWe are not getting it done. We desperately need to provide increased \nfunding for the Army Corps of Engineers, including funding for levees \nand additional civil engineers. This Nation has an aging national water \nresources infrastructure. If we continue to ignore the upkeep, the \ndeterioration of locks, dams, flood control projects, and navigation \nchannels, we risk disruptions in waterborne commerce, decreased \nprotection against floods, as we saw in Katrina, and other \nenvironmental damage.\n  I have been concerned about the backlog of unfunded Corps projects \nsince I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure in 1999 and 2000 on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. When I arrived in the Senate in 1999, the operation and \nmaintenance deficit was about $250 million. Today it is $1.2 billion. \nIn 2001, there was $38 billion in active resources projects waiting to \nbe funded. Today there is $41 billion in active construction general \nprojects that need to be funded. This budget is only going to increase \nthis backlog.\n  This budget proposes a 33-percent cut in the Corps construction \nbudget and a 42-percent cut in the Corps investigations budget. \nCurrently, the Corps is able to function only at 50-percent capacity at \nthe rate of funding proposed by this budget. Listen to this: Currently \nthe Corps is able to function only at 50-percent capacity at the rate \nof funding proposed by this budget.\n  Can you believe this, after the lesson we learned from Hurricane \nKatrina? We had people testify before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee who were a part of the American Civil\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\nEngineers Society saying that if we had properly funded the levees in \nNew Orleans, they would have survived Katrina.\n\n  Let's talk about our highways. According to the Federal Highway \nAdministration 2002 Conditions and Performance Report, $106.9 billion \nthrough 2020 is needed to maintain and improve our highways and \nbridges. We are just not getting the job done.\n  Community development block grants, which was spoken to by Senator \nMurray earlier, is another example. These grants support State and \nlocal government-directed neighborhood revitalization, housing \nrehabilitation, and economic development activities. I know in my time \nbeing mayor of the city of Cleveland how important CDBG is in terms of \nproviding funds to local government officials so they can do housing \nrehabilitation, neighborhood revitalization, and economic development. \nI refer to it as the yeast that raises the dough. It is probably the \nbest leveraged Federal program we have for our cities in the United \nStates of America.\n  By the way, it is a program that was put in place by Richard Nixon \nwhen he was President of the United States.\n  When we fail to recognize our country's needs, it is at the expense \nof our seed corn programs that are essential to the future of our \ncountry. We must not be pennywise and pound foolish while we consider \nthis budget. While cuts and reforms need to be made, it should not be \nmade at the expense of programs that our country relies on, such as \nthese.\n  It is too bad that we don't have to balance our budget. That would be \nbeautiful. The thing that drives me crazy about this place, after being \nmayor for 10 years and doing 10 budgets, and being Governor and having \nto do four budgets when we had to balance our budget, is that we are \nirresponsible when it comes to budgeting.\n  I recall as Governor, as I mentioned earlier, we had to raise taxes \nat the margin to balance the budget and respond to critical needs of \nOhio. It was through cuts in spending and making very difficult choices \nthat we balanced the budget and accumulated over $1 billion in our \nrainy day fund. It was through these efforts--in other words, we tried \nto do everything, and at the end, through what I call the strong-\nmanagement, good-economy bonus, we reduced our State income tax 3 years \nin a row, including almost 10 percent in 1998.\n  It is difficult for this Senator to believe that we have the ability \nto fund the war on terror, respond to homeland security needs, pay for \nemergencies such as Hurricane Katrina, deal with explosions in \nentitlement costs, guarantee our country will have the infrastructure \nof competitiveness to battle the global marketplace, balance budgets, \npay down the debt by focusing our attention solely on the \ndiscretionary, nondefense, nonhomeland security part of the budget--it \ndoesn't make sense, and it is not fair. It is not fair, and I think the \nAmerican people understand what I am talking about.\n  The problem is that Congress has not told the truth about what we can \nand cannot afford. We want to have it all but don't want to pay for it. \nAmerica's families don't live like that, nor should we. I learned this \ndifficult lesson while serving as mayor of Cleveland for 10 years and \nGovernor of Ohio for 8 years. It is time that we in Congress learned \nthat lesson as well.\n  Yesterday, I sat in the Presiding Officer's chair listening to \nChairman Gregg and Senator Conrad debate. I was heartened to hear these \ntwo budgeteers agree that we have to take on the debt on a bipartisan \nbasis, and sooner rather than later. I wish to be associated with those \nsentiments, and I hope both sides of the aisle will promptly realize \nthe dilemma and heed the words of Senators Gregg and Conrad. We can get \nthe job done. We can be responsible, but we have to do it on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  When I had my problems when I was Governor of Ohio, I had the \nstrongest leader we ever had, a Democrat, in the House of \nRepresentatives. He had been there for 24 years. We named a building \nafter him while he was alive. In fact, I had to genuflect to his statue \nevery day when I went to my office at the State House. He was a very \npowerful guy. We had problems. I went to him and said: Vern, we have to \ndo something about this. He said: Partner, OK, but you have to give a \nlittle, we will have to give a little. We spent 3 weeks and came up \nwith a program to get the job done.\n  The President recognized this. One of the things I felt very bad \nabout last year is we spent all this time on dealing with Social \nSecurity when I knew right from the beginning if it wasn't going to be \non a bipartisan basis, it would go nowhere, and it went nowhere. The \nPresident wasted a lot of time--I give him credit for pointing out the \nfact that we had a problem with Social Security, but it had to start \nout on a bipartisan basis.\n  I was so delighted, I got up and clapped when the President said: We \nhave to put together a commission of the best and brightest to tackle \nthe problem of entitlements so we can move toward fiscal sanity.\n  We have to do that. The American people are looking at what we are \ndoing here and they are saying: Put aside your partisan differences; \ncome together for the benefit of our country, for our children, for our \ngrandchildren.\n  I am concerned about this budget, but I am more concerned about the \ndirection we are going. Our problem is that we are unwilling to pay for \nthings or do without them. Unless we wake up to that fact, we are in \nvery deep trouble.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/14/senate-section/article/S2116-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On May 3, 2005, Galo Garcia was walking on the Harvard University \ncampus in Cambridge, MA, when a passing driver began yelling sexually \nderogatory terms at him and his companion.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the Dubai Ports \nWorld acquisition and the subsequent announcement to transfer operation \nof U.S. port terminals to a U.S. entity. Last week, my colleague from \nNew York offered an amendment to S. 2349, the Legislative Transparency \nand Accountability Act of 2006. While the security of our ports is my \nforemost concern, especially as a Senator representing a State where \none of the ports in question is located, I do not believe the time or \nthe vehicle was appropriate for a vote on Senator Schumer's amendment. \nI have been a vocal critic of this transaction for weeks, but when my \ncolleague's amendment was offered, Dubai Ports World had already \nresubmitted its application to the Committee on Foreign Investment, \nCFIUS. A second review of the transaction was pending. Furthermore, I \nhad signed onto a bipartisan letter with Senator Schumer and eight \nother Members just the week before to the majority and minority \nleaders. In that letter, we expressed our desire to closely examine the \nfacts that would be presented, and we retained our right to pursue \nlegislative action after the review was completed should the outcome \nprove unsatisfactory.\n  Then, just last Friday, DP World announced their decision to transfer \nthe U.S. port terminals acquired from Peninsular and Oriental Steam \nNavigation Company to a U.S. entity. While we are still seeking \nclarification of exactly what that means, my hope is that this decision \nwill allay our concerns about this particular transaction. I expect a \nthorough review of this proposal by the appropriate agencies, and \nCongress assuredly has the will to act if concerns remain.\n  Should the immediate need for action disappear, Congress cannot \nignore the underlying problems this acquisition has brought to light. \nFirst, we need to remain diligent in securing ports both domestically \nand abroad. Significant investments at foreign ports are critical. We \ncannot allow hazardous materials or weapons of mass destruction to \nenter our ports in the first place. By then, it could be too late. \nSecond, Congress must undertake a comprehensive review of the CFIUS \nprocess. Chairman Shelby has already begun that process in the Banking \nCommittee. I look forward to working with him and my colleagues to \naggressively execute our oversight authority and expeditiously enact \nany reforms that may be necessary to ensure the safety and economic \nvitality of my State and this great Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the above mentioned letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2006.\n     Senator William H. Frist,\n     U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Harry Reid\n     U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Frist and Reid: As you know, we recently \n     joined together to introduce S. 2333, The Foreign Investment \n     Security Act of 2006, a bill to require a 45-day CFIUS \n     investigation and a Presidential determination regarding the \n     national security implications of Dubai Port World's takeover \n     of Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Navigation Company. This \n     bill stemmed from our joint concern that allowing the \n     takeover of U.S. terminal operations after only a cursory \n     review raised serious national security concerns.\n       The President and the companies have now moved voluntarily \n     to provide for such a 45-day investigation, and we are \n     encouraged by that decision. Though some of us remain \n     troubled about how this new review will proceed given the \n     Administration's continued support of the deal, we have \n     decided not to press for a vote on our bill at this time in \n     the hope that this new investigation will be thorough, fair, \n     and independent.\n       Nevertheless, several key components of our legislation \n     have yet to be addressed namely, the notification to Congress \n     and the ability of Congress to disapprove the deal within \n     thirty days if security concerns are not met.\n       As a result, we write to ask for your assistance in \n     guaranteeing that:\n       (a) the Congress is kept fully informed as the 45-day \n     review progresses, and notified how security concerns are \n     being investigated and addressed;\n       (b) the Congress is provided 30 days to review the results \n     of the report including reasoning for the decision to either \n     approve or disapprove of the deal; and\n       (c) once this 45-day review period is over, Congress \n     reserves the ability to vote to disapprove the deal if the \n     security concerns have not been adequately addressed.\n       We hope you will work with us and with the Administration \n     to ensure that this review is a thorough, effective look at \n     whether this deal truly poses a threat to our national \n     security. If we need to press for a vote on our legislation \n     or to introduce further legislation to achieve the goals \n     outlined above, we hope you will work with us in the coming \n     weeks. The Administration must know that we stand united to \n     examine and review this deal independently, and that Congress \n     must have a role in determining whether it should go forward \n     or be stopped as a result of national security concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n         Charles E.

Mr. President, tomorrow, we will convene for a Joint \nSession of Congress to hear comments by the new Liberian President, \nEllen Johnson Sirleaf.\n  I hope that we will give her a warm welcome and send her home to the \n3.3 million people of Liberia with a simple and strong message: We will \nstand by you as you work day-by-day to build a safer, more prosperous \ncountry.\n  It is an exciting and hopeful time for the people of Liberia. Civil \nconflict has been replaced by civil discourse. Free and fair \nPresidential elections have taken place, with dozens of candidates and \nthree-fourths of voters turning out to shape the country's future.\n  Looking back, it is clear what the Liberian people were voting for \nwhen they elected President Sirleaf: honest government, economic \ngrowth, an expansion of infrastructure, and greater opportunity for all \nLiberians, regardless of gender.\n  They also chose a leader with three decades of experience. President \nSirleaf has served as Finance Minister in Liberia, and she has also \nheld high-level positions at the United Nations and World Bank.\n  It is no surprise that in just 8 weeks in her new job, President \nSirleaf is already making progress. She has taken bold steps to reduce \ncorruption, and she has rightly emphasized the need to\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\nget ex-combatants into schools and jobs. After more than a decade of \nconflict, this is vitally important.\n  Now, Liberians in every part of the country are turning to President \nSirleaf's government for things like clean water, electricity, health \ncare, roads, and jobs. These are enormous challenges for the Government \nof Liberia, but they are also opportunities. They are opportunities to \neducate, to employ, to strengthen the rule of law, and to consolidate \nthe peace. These opportunities are the bedrock of Liberia's great hope.\n  We have an opportunity also. It is an opportunity to partner with \nmore than 3 million people as they rebuild their country from conflict, \nusing the bricks and glue of peace. And it is an opportunity to \ndemonstrate to all the people of West Africa--and the world--that \ngreater riches flow from peace than from any form of violence.\n  In the last 2 fiscal years, Congress has appropriated almost $900 \nmillion to reconstruction efforts in Liberia. Many Americans have \nparticipated personally in this noble work, through USAID, other \ngovernment agencies, and many NGOs.\n  We must continue these efforts. President Sirleaf and the people of \nLiberia have embraced democracy and peace. We must embrace them as our \nfriends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/14/senate-section/article/S2118-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to publicly discuss the \nimportance of the Project Safe Place Program and extend my support for \ndesignating the week of March 13, 2006, as ``National Safe Place \nWeek.''\n  Project Safe Place is a nationally acclaimed youth outreach and \neducation program that provides immediate help and support to youth who \nare in crisis or at risk for abuse, neglect, or serious family \nproblems. This easily replicated community initiative, which takes \nplace in more than 700 communities around the country, educates \nthousands of young people every year about dealing with difficult, \nthreatening situations such as child abuse, substance addiction, crime, \nand family problems. Qualified agencies, trained volunteers, and \ncommunity partners such as businesses, local government, and law \nenforcement agencies, work together to sustain Safe Places where youth \nin crisis can gain immediate, free, and confidential assistance. Safe \nPlace sites, which are designated by distinctive yellow and black Safe \nPlace signs, include youth-friendly businesses, schools, fire stations, \nlibraries, Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCAs, and even buses.\n  S. Res. 390 provides an opportunity to recognize the youth-serving \nagencies, community partners, counselors, and trained volunteers who \nwork together to sustain safe places for children to turn to. We can \nshow them that they have our support and appreciation and that we value \ncommunities actively working together to help young people in crisis.\n  Throughout my tenure as a legislator, I have done my best to support \ninitiatives that work to improve child welfare. Our Nation's children \nare its greatest asset and our most precious treasure. It is vital that \nwe help them get the right start, nurture their development, and \nprovide for their well being. Quality childcare, nutrition programs, \nchildren's health initiatives, and overall poverty reduction measures \nare critical to ensuring that the children have the tools they need to \ngrow up safe, happy, and healthy. Providing services for at-risk youth \nis particularly essential because these young men and women often do \nnot have the support that would help them through the transition from \nchildhood to adulthood. These services can help young people continue \ntheir education, find jobs, and improve family relationships.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting this \nresolution. This resolution will affirm the work of those individuals \nand organizations sustaining Safe Places around the country and \nencourage them to continue making a difference in the lives of at-risk \nyouth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/14/senate-section/article/S2118-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2118-S2120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MICHAEL BERMAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my dear friend of over 30 years, Michael \nBerman, has just written his memoir, ``Living Large: A Big Man's Ideas \non Weight, Success and Acceptance.'' Mike possesses one of the most \nastute political minds along with a generous heart and kind soul. I am \nproud of his courage in writing about his struggle with weight control \nand hope his book will encourage others to honestly confront and \novercome their weight challenges.\n  This week, both The Washington Post and Roll Call reviewed Mike's \nbook. I ask unanimous consent that those articles be printed at this \npoint in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Roll Call, Mar. 14, 2006]\n\n                         Weighing in on Weight\n\n               (By Elizabeth Brotherton, Roll Call Staff)\n\n       Michael Berman is kind of a big deal.\n       Now president of the lobbying firm the Duberstein Group \n     Inc., Berman has worked on every Democratic presidential \n     campaign since 1964. He was even deputy chief of staff to \n     former Vice President Walter Mondale.\n       That's on top of all the nonprofit boards he sits on.\n       But to Berman, there has been one lingering thing that has \n     followed him all those years: his weight.\n       See, Michael Berman is kind of a big deal.\n       ``Food,'' Berman said. ``It's like a drug.''\n       Berman's lifelong struggle with food is chronicled in his \n     new book, ``Living Large: A Big Man's Ideas on Weight, \n     Success, and Acceptance,'' set to hit bookstores Wednesday.\n       Berman said he wrote the book primarily because in all his \n     years of reading weight loss books, he rarely found one about \n     overweight men. Even more rare was trying to find a book \n     written by an overweight man.\n       So he decided to provide that voice.\n       ``I'm hoping that some people will come to understand more \n     of what fat people go through,'' Berman said.\n       Berman said the book, which he co-authored with writer \n     Laurence Shames, took seven years to complete.\n       ``It really became kind of a vehicle to help me,'' Berman \n     said of the book. ``It kind of helped me stay on path with my \n     weight management.''\n       Berman, who has struggled with food since he was a child, \n     has always been conscious of his weight. He has tried every \n     diet imaginable, he said, from South Beach and Atkins to even \n     undergoing two hospitalized starvation diets. He once \n     hallucinated cheeseburgers.\n       But whenever he managed to get his weight under control, it \n     would shoot back up again.\n       The 66-year-old tipped the scales at 317 pounds in January \n     1999. (He now weights 240 pounds, he said.)\n       ``I really have the view, for really fat people like myself \n     there's a significant psychological component as to why we \n     are fat,'' Berman said. ``There's some issues, some of which \n     kind of get revealed in the book.''\n       ``Living Large'' reads a lot like a biography. Berman talks \n     about his childhood, meeting his wife and his career in \n     politics.\n       He also includes first-hand views from his wife, Carol, on \n     how his heavy stature has affected their marriage.\n       ``One day, I said to her, `Why don't you write a chapter \n     called: `Living with a fat man: A Spouse's Perspective '' he \n     said. ``I just came to realize that I had an enormous effect \n     on her.''\n       Only parts of his wife's chapter made it into the book (the \n     entire section is available on Berman's Web site, \n     www.mikelivinglarge.com). But Berman also manages to touch on \n     some serious issues.\n       For example: Why did he gain weight at certain times? How \n     has his weight affected his life and the lives of those -\n     around him?\n       Plus, he deals with the issues behind his significant \n     weight, issues he has kept secret for quite some time.\n       ``I feel like, OK. I've shared this stuff with the \n     psychologist I had all these years, and I'm really \n     comfortable with myself,'' Berman said. ``I just became more \n     and more comfortable.''\n       The book's release comes at a time when the United States \n     appears to be losing the war against obesity.\n       About 119 million adults in the United States--64.5 percent \n     of the adult population--are either overweight or obese, \n     according to the nonprofit group Trust for America's Health.\n       Obesity has been linked to a slew of serious health \n     problems, from diabetes and heart disease to strokes and some \n     cancers, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n       That means the issue will be relevant--and political--for \n     quite some time, Berman said.\n       ``It's going to kind of be an issue of, `Are we going to \n     apply resources to beginning education campaigns to show \n     young people that we are going to do something about it?' '' \n     he said. ``I think it's increasingly going to be a political \n     issue. But it is going to be a resource issue.''\n       Berman said that he now has created a manageable situation \n     for controlling his weight. He monitors his daily calorie \n     intake in a meticulous journal, and he regularly gets on the \n     scale.\n       ``I'm never going to be a thin person,'' Berman said. \n     ``But, by golly, maybe I can keep (my weight) in a somewhat \n     healthy range.''\n\n[[Page S2119]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 13, 2006]\n\nThe Measure of a Man: Lobbyist Michael Berman Comes to Terms With Size \n                      and Self in ``Living Large''\n\n                       (By Laura Sessions Stepp)\n\n       For more than six decades, Michael Berman has lived as a \n     fat person. At 5 feet 9 inches, he has weighed as much as 332 \n     pounds. He has been known to eat three racks of ribs at one \n     sitting, or a 40-ounce steak, or a whole box of saltines. In \n     1986, after dropping a few pounds, he spent $2,100 on three \n     custom-made, pinstriped suits in gray, blue and brown. By the \n     time the suits were ready, 10 weeks later, they no longer \n     fit. Eleven years after that he gave them away, having never \n     been able to wear them.\n       A highly successful political campaigner and Washington \n     lobbyist, Berman, 66, doesn't deny the dangers of fatness or \n     the urgency of encouraging people to exercise and eat \n     healthier. He acknowledges that with 60 percent of the U.S. \n     population overweight or obese, and the rate of obesity \n     increasing particularly dramatically in children, being fat \n     has serious consequences for the health of individuals and \n     the economy. He'd like to see government and private \n     resources used for a public education campaign similar to \n     that for smoking and seat-belt use.\n       But forget the notion that fat people can become slim, he \n     says in a part memoir, part self-help book scheduled for \n     release this week. They can--and should--manage their weight. \n     They can--and should--find an exercise program they can stick \n     with. But fat adults will always be fat. They are in the \n     grips of a disease over which, in the end, they do not have \n     complete control.\n       This is not likely to be a popular message among those who \n     manage their daily lives with BlackBerrys, filter out porn on \n     their kids' computers, block negative information coming from \n     government sources. Is he trying to say that the fatties who \n     sprawl over airplane seats could not shrink to a reasonable \n     size if they just stopped wolfing down those Big Macs?\n       Yes, that's what he's saying. ``The idea that you can slim \n     down by willpower is a bunch of horse manure,'' he said. If \n     ``nonfat'' Americans could be convinced of this, perhaps \n     they'd start relating better to fat Americans. And if fat \n     Americans understood why they're fat and accepted that they \n     will always have to shop at Rochester Big and Tall or Lane \n     Bryant, they could begin ``Living Large,'' as Berman called \n     his book.\n       A Minnesota native, Berman has lived large for a long time \n     among Washington's elite. He served as counsel and deputy \n     chief of staff to former vice president Walter Mondale, acted \n     as scheduler for six Democratic conventions and, in 1989, \n     formed a bipartisan lobbying firm that today counts General \n     Motors and British Petroleum among its clients. During the \n     Clinton years, he was on a ``special access list'' that gave \n     him virtually unrestricted entree to the White House. He and \n     Carol, his wife of 40 years, live in the gracious Colonnade \n     condominiums in Northwest Washington and entertain \n     powerful friends they've accumulated over the years.\n       Being a BMOC means you're treated differently than the \n     masses. The Palm restaurant, noted for its creamed \n     vegetables, serves Berman steamed spinach and broccoli. The \n     chef at I Ricchi created a dish of roasted vegetables for \n     him. The maitre d' at Georgetown's Four Seasons restaurant \n     knows that for breakfast meetings he prefers the table one \n     row from the windows near the center of the dining room; the \n     servers never place a basket of toast on his table.\n       But politics is dangerous for anyone hoping to maintain a \n     reasonable weight, Berman says over breakfast at the Four \n     Seasons.\n       ``The cocktail parties are not difficult,'' he says, his \n     shirt sleeves pushed up to reveal a large yellow Corum \n     wristwatch. He attacks a dish of large blueberries, then an \n     egg-white omelet and four wide slices of turkey bacon. ``I \n     can get a glass of Diet Coke, mingle, and only occasionally \n     grab an hors d'oeuvre as it goes by. What is hard are the \n     large sitdown dinners where you can't control the menu. Or \n     where you're with 3,000 other people, you order a vegetarian \n     meal, it takes forever to arrive and meanwhile there's a \n     basket in front of you full of bread.''\n       He is comfortable with being different, now. But he has \n     suffered through countless eight swings, 20 diet programs, a \n     kidney infection and knee surgery. And it has taken him eight \n     years of counseling, the careful attention of a personal \n     trainer/nutritionist and the sustained support of his wife to \n     get to that place.\n       Berman first realized he was not just husky, but really \n     fat, when he was 13, weighed about 170 pounds and was \n     standing in the shower of the boys' locker room one day after \n     gym class in his home town of Duluth, Minn.\n       ``I hated gym,'' he recalls in ``Living Large: A Big Man's \n     Ideas on Weight, Success and Acceptance,'' written with \n     Laurence Shames. ``I couldn't climb ropes, couldn't do \n     pushups. . . . I dreaded being naked in the shower with the \n     other boys. . . . I hid as much as possible, showered as \n     quickly as I could, and pulled a shirt on even before my skin \n     was fully dry.''\n       On the morning in question, as he stood in the open \n     showers, a boy next to him grabbed his chest, saying he \n     wanted to know what it felt like to touch a girl's breast. \n     That was just one of thousands of indignities he would \n     encounter or bring upon himself.\n       In his sophomore year at the University of Minnesota at \n     Duluth, his fraternity brothers determined that he should \n     lose his virginity at a party in a cabin by a lake and \n     enlisted the help of an attractive woman a couple of years \n     older than he. She took his hand and led him into a bedroom. \n     She lay down and motioned for him to join her. As he did, he \n     realized she had passed out, having drunk herself silly \n     before having sex with a 250-pound 19-year-old.\n       One afternoon in law school, reading in a wooden armchair, \n     he started to get up only to realize that he was stuck in the \n     chair.\n       ``My body had essentially flowed out to fill the space \n     between the arms and seat,'' he writes. ``My hips were \n     captured; my bottom stayed glued to the chair and the whole \n     thing lifted up with me as I tried to stand. . . . I felt all \n     eyes on me, understood that people didn't want to look but, \n     as at a train wreck, couldn't turn away.''\n       He decided to play the clown. ``Still crouched over, taking \n     small, constricted steps, I carried [the chair] across the \n     room, somewhat like a turtle with its shell, and sat down \n     once again.'' Today he winces at all the times he played the \n     jolly fat man: leading college cheerleaders onto the football \n     field by pedaling a miniature girl's bike; assuming the role \n     of Santa Claus at White House Christmas parties, the Easter \n     Bunny at the vice president's residence. Perhaps his \n     experience in acting the fool is why he was able to ignore \n     the advice of a friend who tried to steer him away from \n     writing a book about his fatness, saying it would be \n     ``undignified.''\n       Undignified? His pal, like so many thinner people, didn't \n     know from undignified.\n       Berman realized pretty quickly as a teen that in order to \n     be taken seriously and make something of his life, he would \n     have to develop talents other than vaudeville. In the family \n     rec room, his parents taught him ballroom dancing--the first \n     thing, he writes, that his rotund body was good at. He took \n     up musical theater in high school and continued it in \n     college. He managed his first political campaign in junior \n     high for a girl running for president of the student council. \n     She lost, but the campaign taught him he could succeed in \n     politics behind the scenes. He didn't need to be cute, just \n     hardworking, shrewd and resourceful.\n       He would have preferred to be a football star. ``Over time, \n     though--and largely without my noticing from day to day--I \n     realized that something sort of wonderful had been \n     happening,'' he writes. ``My various `compensations' had been \n     adding up to a pretty good approximation of the sort of life \n     I feared I'd never have. I was busy; I had friends; I was \n     appreciated and respected for things I was good at.''\n       One of the things he was, and is, good at, says wife Carol, \n     is listening to and valuing women.\n       In the book, Berman calls Carol ``the strongest and most \n     stable component'' of his life. But their first date almost \n     didn't happen. It was Aug. 1, 1964, and Berman, 26, had been \n     hired to lead a voter registration drive in a Duluth suburb \n     for President Lyndon Johnson's reelection campaign. After \n     swearing off blind dates at least half a dozen times, he \n     arrived at the door of the apartment for yet one more try, \n     this time with Carol Podhoretz, a 24-year-old speech \n     pathologist.\n       She greeted him in a nice dress, stockings and high heels. \n     Taking one look at his 288-pound frame, she announced that \n     she had a headache and wouldn't be able to go out. Here we go \n     again, he thought. But then she invited him in for a drink.\n       ``He was big, and I reacted like a lot of young women would \n     have reacted,'' Carol Berman recalls in a phone conversation. \n     ``He asked me why I worked as a speech pathologist and I \n     really liked the reaction I got when I said I liked to help \n     people. He said, `I love that.' ''\n       About an hour into their conversation, Carol announced that \n     her headache had disappeared and she'd like to go out as \n     planned. They dined at his favorite restaurant, then headed \n     to a club to dance. That was all it took. Carol, a former \n     Arthur Murray instructor, was as graceful on her feet as he \n     was. ``Somewhere between the cha-cha and the Lindy,'' he \n     writes, ``we began to have the feeling that it would be nice \n     to see more of each other.''\n       They went out on 29 of the next 30 nights. Carol said she \n     found him ``adorable,'' and a man with ``great lips.'' In \n     early December, while they were dancing together and a little \n     bit tipsy, she whispered, ``You know, we should just get \n     married.''\n       ``Fine,'' he said.\n       Life together since has been good, although Carol had to \n     make a couple of what she calls ``accommodations.'' The \n     hardest for her was not being able to have children. Six \n     years after they married, she began trying to conceive. For \n     several years after that, she endured various painful \n     interventions, none of which worked. A fertility specialist \n     told Michael and her that his sperm count might be a factor; \n     fat men tend to have a lower number. For Michael, not having \n     children wasn't that big a deal. For Carol, who eventually \n     had a hysterectomy because of fibroid tumors, it was. ``It is \n     still what I consider a loss,'' she said.\n       Michael gradually realized during these years how hard \n     politics was on a man trying to shed pounds. He had developed \n     sharp political skills that were in demand at the highest \n     levels of political and corporate Washington: making someone \n     feel as if he or she were the only person in the room, paying \n     attention to detail, distilling and delivering big ideas in a \n     few seconds. What he couldn't\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\n     do was turn down the doughnuts, chips, big steaks and \n     potatoes that are the staple of political life. By the time \n     his first Democratic convention was over, the famous Chicago \n     convention in 1968, his weight exceeded 300 pounds for the \n     first time.\n       Convention years were tough on the marriage. Michael and \n     Carol first realized this in 1989, on their 25th wedding \n     anniversary. On a visit to the beach, Michael brought Carol a \n     handful of shells, put them on a board and suggested she use \n     them to show how happy she was in their marriage for each of \n     their 25 years. The year 1965 got a big shell; 1968 a little \n     shell; 1984 a shard.\n       That was the year Walter Mondale lost the election to \n     Ronald Reagan, and Berman weighed 330 pounds. He was wearing \n     a size 58 suite, consuming up to five pounds of red meat a \n     week along with up to 18 eggs. He couldn't walk a city block \n     without panting. He developed sleep apnea, where his body \n     would forget to breathe. Carol told him he looked green. \n     Scared for his health for the first time in his life, he \n     enrolled in a Pritiken Longevity Center in Pennsylvania. He \n     lost 112 pounds--and that's when he ordered the custom suits.\n       Berman never again weighed as much as he did in 1984. In \n     1989, he joined Republican Ken Duberstein--who had served as \n     Reagan's chief of staff--in forming the Duberstein Group. He \n     started psychotheraphy in 1990 and, several years after, \n     employed a private nutritionist and trainer.\n       Still, his weight seesawed. By 1997--a year after he was \n     diagnosed with a kidney problem--he was up to 309 pounds.\n       In 1998, on the advice of a friend, he started jotting down \n     thoughts and memories about being fat with the idea of \n     writing a book someday. The exercise became, not \n     surprisingly, an obsession. He read scientific reports and \n     researched cultures of the past in which fatness was \n     considered a symbol of wisdom, serenity and wealth. One day \n     he walked into a pharmacy and bought 22 different diet aids, \n     one of everything on the shelf, to investigate how effective \n     they are. His conclusion: They aren't.\n       He read that for some people, fatness is genetic. But he \n     had researched his family tree; that wasn't true for him. So \n     he began to develop his own theory on why people are fat.\n       The easy answer, of course, is that they take in more \n     calories than they burn. But then it gets more complicated, \n     he writes. Each person's metabolism is different. He, his \n     sister and his parents all ate a lot of his mother's \n     delicious briskets and lamb chops and none of them \n     exercised much. But he was the only one who got fat.\n       Emotions, buried for many years, play a role, too. From the \n     age of 4, he sneaked cookies, crackers and anything else he \n     could into his bedroom.\n       ``I could not control my appetite because something was \n     driving me,'' he writes, ``something that was beyond the \n     reach of willpower, outside the realm of reason.''\n       He and his psychologist came to believe that his compulsion \n     started partly as a reaction to his mother. Early in his \n     life, she showed her affection by cooking rich meals and he \n     showed his affection by eating lots of it. As he got older \n     and heftier in early adolescence, she started withholding \n     food and he ate as a way of asserting his emerging will.\n       Later in life, dropping out of weight-loss programs even \n     though he was losing weight, he had to confront another \n     factor: He was fat-dependent.\n       Fat was something he could hide behind, an excuse for not \n     doing things that he was afraid of doing. For example, in \n     high school, he felt anxious around girls. By making himself \n     fat and unattractive, he could approach them as potential \n     friends, not girlfriends.\n       Eventually he had to admit that he was an addict. But \n     unlike alcoholics or drug users, he couldn't go cold turkey.\n       ``The most difficult thing about a food addiction is that \n     you can't give up food,'' he said at breakfast.\n       He pulled out a tiny spiral notebook in which he records \n     everything he eats each day and the total calorie count, as \n     well as how much he exercises.\n       ``March 1--1,610 calories. March 2--2,295. March 3--2,500. \n     March 4--4,465.''\n       What happened on March 4? He and Carol attended a dinner \n     party at pollster Peter Hart's. He couldn't resist the \n     chocolate cake. ``I ate probably eight ounces of chocolate,'' \n     he admitted. ``But I don't beat myself up anymore. I knew I'd \n     be heavier the next morning so the next couple of days I'd be \n     careful.''\n       A couple of years ago, he wouldn't have been so sanguine. \n     But if there was one thing he had learned in writing his \n     book, it was this: ``Losing weight is only one aspect of \n     dealing with the reality of being a fat person--and not \n     necessarily even the most important one. Managing fatness \n     means accepting ourselves as who we are. . . . in short, \n     learning to live a full and satisfying life at whatever \n     weight and size we happen to be.''\n       Two days after Hart's party, he was back down to 1,830 \n     calories.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/14/senate-section/article/S2120-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \n125th anniversary of the founding of Dakota State University. Over the \ncourse of its history, DSU has changed names and modified its mission, \nbut throughout it all, it has continuously produced extraordinary \ngraduates. In the modern, high-tech, and competitive environment in \nwhich we live, DSU students are equipped with the skills that are \nessential for success.\n  Originally known as Dakota Normal School, DSU was founded in the \ncommunity of Madison, which was then part of Dakota Territory. At \nvarious times, DSU has been called Eastern State Teacher's College, \nGeneral Beadle State College, and Dakota State College. In 1989 the \nschool's name changed once again to Dakota State University.\n  Since its inception, DSU has been renowned for giving students the \ntools they need to become exceptional teachers. More recently, an \nemphasis on computer and information systems has turned DSU into one of \nthe most technologically-savvy universities in the Nation. DSU \nregularly appears near the top of Yahoo magazine's list of 100 most \nwired campuses.\n  With enrollment now at 2,300, DSU continues to attract more students \nby utilizing distance learning and Internet classes. It has also been a \nleader in integrating traditional academic disciplines with cutting-\nedge technology. For its innovation and adaptability, DSU was selected \nas one of the 10 finalists for the 1987 G. Theodore Mitau Award, a \ndistinction awarded by the American Association of State Colleges and \nUniversities. In addition to offering three master's degree programs, \nDSU offers a doctorate program for science in information systems, \nwhich will be available starting in the fall of 2007.\n  In education, technology, and research, DSU is at the forefront of \nacademic and cultural achievement. For 125 years, the university has \nhelped students realize their potential by offering them a quality \neducation and a positive social environment. DSU graduates are well-\nequipped to succeed in a competitive world, delivering countless \nbenefits to organizations and communities close to home and around the \nglobe. Through commitment to change and transformation, DSU continues \nto live up to its motto: ``Get on the edge and stay there!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/14/senate-section/article/S2120-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2120-S2121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING ELEANOR SLATER\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Eleanor Slater, \nan extraordinary woman and leader who did so much for the State of \nRhode Island and the country. Her passing is a great loss to her family \nand to Rhode Islanders. Not only did I have the privilege of knowing \nher throughout my political life, she was an ally, a mentor, an \nexemplar, and trustworthy friend.\n  Born in 1908, Eleanor entered the political arena by winning election \nto the Rhode Island General Assembly at the spry age of 50. During the \ncareer that followed, she was widely known for fighting for the \nindividuals and causes that are so often marginalized by our society. \nOne of her greatest contributions, and there were many in her political \ncareer, was passage in the Rhode Island General Assembly of the \nNation's very first fair housing legislation. The Slater Act of 1968 \nmade it illegal to discriminate when selling or renting real estate \nproperty. This sorely needed law, which she had long championed to help \nbring greater equality to housing in Rhode Island, set a precedent for \nthe entire country.\n  Her determination remained a key characteristic throughout her \npolitical career. As a delegate to the 1968 Democratic National \nConvention in Chicago, Eleanor refused to succumb to the pressures of \nher peers to support President Johnson's strategy for the Vietnam War. \nShe held steadfastly to her own opposing point of view and never \ncompromised her values or beliefs.\n  Eleanor joined the political fray at a time when women were largely \nleft out of the inner political processes, and she is credited with \ngetting women involved in Democratic politics in Rhode Island. As a \nstandout member of a predominately male legislature, she actively \nencouraged other woman to run for political office and became the vice \nchairwoman of the Democratic State Committee in 1958.\n  Upon leaving the Rhode Island State Senate, she served as the first \nchief of\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\nthe Division of Aging. Then, recognizing the importance of education, \nshe fulfilled her longtime goal and desire of completing her studies, \nobtaining a bachelor's degree in political science at age 70 from the \nUniversity of Rhode Island, URI. She continued to contribute to the \ncommunity as an adjunct professor and guest lecturer on aging at URI, \nreceiving an honorary Ph.D. in 1980.\n  So today I honor Rhode Islander Eleanor Slater for her lifetime of \npassion and commitment, and I thank her for her friendship and \ninspiration. She will be sorely missed by those who knew her and those \nthat have benefited from her unwavering efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/14/senate-section/article/S2121-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE--MARCH 13, 2006\n\n  At 10:19 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2829.

A bill to require the Director of National Intelligence to \nrelease documents captured in Afghanistan or Iraq during Operation \nDesert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, or Operation Iraqi Freedom; \nto the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer remarks on \nlegislation that I am introducing today here in the Senate.\n  This legislation concerns the need to release military documents and \nphotographs recovered in Iraq and Afghanistan. Specifically, the bill \nrequires the Director of National Intelligence to make publicly \navailable on an Internet website documents captured in Afghanistan or \nIraq during Operation Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, or \nOperation Iraqi Freedom.\n  In my conversations with President Bush and Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld, I urged that efforts to examine these documents and \nphotographs be accelerated. With U.S. and Coalition forces actively \nengaged in Iraq, the analysis and release of these documents should be \nmade a top priority within the Department of Defense.\n  Recently, I gave a speech at the Valley Forge Military Academy in \nPennsylvania concerning ongoing military operations in Iraq and \ndetailed why we must prevail. In my speech, I noted that U.S. and \nCoalition forces are fighting the forces of Islamic fascism and those \nwho seek to overthrow the values and beliefs that civilized nations \ncherish. In short, this is a battle we cannot afford to lose.\n  By way of background, The Weekly Standard published several articles \ndetailing a number of these documents and the information contained \nwithin them which ``connect the dots'' between Saddam Hussein and the \ntraining of Islamic terrorists. Among the points highlighted in a \nrecent The Weekly Standard article:\n\n       The photographs and documents on Iraqi training camps come \n     from a collection of some 2 million ``exploitable items'' \n     captured in postwar Iraq and Afghanistan. They include \n     handwritten notes, typed documents, audiotapes, videotapes, \n     compact discs, floppy discs, and computer hard drives . . . \n     Nearly three years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, only \n     50,000 of these 2 million ``exploitable items'' have been \n     thoroughly examined.\n\n  Many of the translated and analyzed documents were entered into a \ngovernment database known as ``HARMONY.'' It is now 4 years since these \ndocuments were captured. I understand that previous requests to release \ninformation from the HARMONY database have been rejected or delayed. It \nis reasonable to assume that over the course of the last 4 years any \nactionable intelligence contained within these documents has already \nbeen exploited.\n  It is imperative that documents captured in Iraq which highlight the \nconnections between Saddam Hussein's brutal regime and Islamic \nterrorists be released as soon as possible. These documents are \nincreasingly necessary to help the American people understand both the \nreasons for our involvement in Iraq and the challenge of defending \nfreedom and democracy.\n  However, in the interest of national security, the bill permits the \nDirector of National Intelligence to withhold making a document \npublicly available--provided he informs the relevant congressional \ncommittees of the justification for not disclosing the document.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2409. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nreduce cost-sharing under part D of such title for certain non-\ninstitutionalized full-benefit dual eligible individuals; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am proud to join with my \ncolleagues, Senators Bingaman, Clinton and Nelson, to introduce the \nHome and Community Based Services Copayment Equity Act of 2006. This \nimportant piece of legislation addresses a significant oversight in the \nMedicare Part D prescription drug benefit. While nearly 22 million \nseniors now have access to affordable prescription drug coverage under \nthe program, many of the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries are \nbeing charged unnecessary copayments simply based upon how they choose \nto receive their long-term care services.\n  Under current law, dual eligible Medicare beneficiaries, those who \nqualify for both Medicaid and Medicare coverage, receive a subsidy from \nthe government to pay the benefit's required $250 deductible. These \nindividuals also qualify for reduced copayments for both generic and \nbrand named drugs in the amount of one and three dollars respectively. \nIf a dual-eligible beneficiary receives long-term care services in an \ninstitutional setting, such as a nursing home, he or she is exempt from \npaying the required copayment. Congress decided to provide this \nassistance because dual-eligible beneficiaries residing in nursing \nhomes live off of very limited incomes. For instance, in Oregon the \npersonal needs allowance beneficiaries receive each month for \nincidentals, including medications, is only $30. As many \ninstitutionalized beneficiaries are on multiple medications, they would \nnot be able to meet their share of drug costs.\n  This is the very reason Congress provided institutionalized dual-\neligible beneficiaries with an exemption from all copayments under \nMedicare Part D. However, many dual eligible beneficiaries choose to \nreceive long-term care services in home or community-based settings, \nsuch as assisted living or resident care program facilities. Almost all \nstates have chosen to establish Home and Community Based Services \nMedicaid demonstration projects that have expanded access to community \nbased alternatives to an even greater number of low-income elderly \nAmericans. The State of Oregon operates one of the Nation's most \nsuccessful HCS waivers, serving approximately 23,500 dual eligible \nbeneficiaries this year. My State has a thriving community based care \nindustry that has provided many dual eligible Oregonians the freedom to \nchoose the care setting that best meets their own physical and social \nneeds.\n  While dual eligible beneficiaries are exempted from prescription drug \ncopayments under Medicare Part D, those choosing community based \nalternatives are required to pay them. This is despite the fact that \nbeneficiaries choosing community based care options typically live off \nof the same limited incomes as those residing in nursing homes. Despite \nthe fact that some States provide HCS beneficiaries a larger personal \nstipend each month, they may have greater financial demands. At the end \nof the day, they are in no better position to pay the costs of \nprescription drugs than those beneficiaries living in nursing homes.\n\n[[Page S2125]]\n\n  I should also note that their less restrictive living environments \nmay require them to take additional medications to support their daily \nroutines. It is not uncommon for dual eligible beneficiaries in \ncommunity-based care settings to be on 8 to 10 medications at a given \ntime. At that level, even minimal copayments create a significant \nfinancial burden to these individuals.\n  The current dual-eligible copayment exemption policy is not only \ncreating inequity in Medicare Part D, it is potentially restricting \naccess to life-saving medications. This is certainly not what Congress \nintended when it created the new prescription drug benefit, especially \nfor this incredibly vulnerable population. If Congress does not act \nquickly to extend the exemption to dual eligible beneficiaries in \ncommunity based care, individuals may begin to gravitate toward \ninstitutional options simply because they can have their drugs costs \npaid in those settings. I believe we need to do everything possible to \nsupport choice in long-term care, and by applying the current \ninstitutional copayment exemption more uniformly, Congress will ensure \nthe Medicare drug benefit does not adversely affect beneficiaries \nchoices.\n  I ask my colleagues to improve the fairness of the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit for all dual eligible beneficiaries by \nsupporting the Home and Community Based Copayment Equity Act. I hope \nyou will join me in calling for its quick passage in the Senate.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with my colleagues Senators Smith, Nelson, and Bingaman to \naddress yet another serious flaw in the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit that has come to light.\n  On January 1, the new Medicare prescription drug benefit went into \neffect. Overnight, millions of seniors and disabled Americans found \nthemselves thrown into a confusing and complex transition.\n  Some of our poorest and most vulnerable beneficiaries, those in \nassisted living facilities, have found themselves suddenly forced to \nproduce co-payments to get the medications they need.\n  These are beneficiaries with serious mental illnesses who have been \nstabilized on medications, and people with developmental and physical \ndisabilities who have little or no incomes and no way to afford the \nmedicines that they depend on.\n  The bill we are introducing will fix this problem by waiving co-\npayments for this group of vulnerable beneficiaries in the same manner \nthat these co-payments are already waived for Medicare beneficiaries in \nnursing homes.\n  This is just one of so many problems we have seen plaguing this \nprogram. I am working on all fronts to help Medicare beneficiaries \nweather this transition. Before this program went into effect, it was \nclear that those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, our poorest \nand most vulnerable seniors and disabled, would have a particular \nchallenge navigating this transition. I was very concerned that many of \nthese Medicare recipients would walk up to their pharmacy counters on \nJanuary 1 and be unable to get their prescriptions filled.\n  In anticipation of these problems, I introduced legislation in \nDecember to keep these Medicare recipients from falling through the \ncracks by stepping up outreach and education to pharmacists and \nproviding reimbursement to pharmacists who are charged a transaction \nfee to access beneficiary information through Medicare. I also co-\nsponsored legislation to give Medicare beneficiaries more time to \nenroll in the new program.\n  And I issued a resource guide, now available in both English and \nSpanish, to help New Yorkers navigate this new program. To date more \nthan 75,000 copies of the guide have been distributed.\n  Since the new program went into effect, I have repeatedly urged the \nBush Administration to address the problems plaguing this program. And \nin January, I introduced comprehensive legislation along with several \nof my Senate colleagues, that includes my bill to help pharmacists help \ntheir customers, and makes the other fixes I have been calling for: \nprovisions to improve outreach and education, fix problems with drug \nplans transition programs, protect the benefits of seniors who also \nhave coverage from a retiree drug plan, and make sure that states and \nlow income beneficiaries are reimbursed for excessive costs they have \nbeen forced to shoulder by the inept implementation of the new benefit.\n  We owe it to our seniors and disabled Americans to get this right. \nAnd I will keep fighting to ensure that we do.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues Senators Smith, Bingaman and Clinton as we introduce the \nHome and Community Services Co-payment Equity Act of 2006.\n  For years now, I have advocated providing seniors and the disabled \nwith meaningful prescription drug coverage. No one in this country \nshould ever have to choose between their meals and their medications. \nIn 2003, Congress passed the Medicare Modernization Act, which created \na Medicare prescription drug program. I did not support this \nlegislation, because I believe it created a program that contains \nseveral major flaws. However, I think that our job now is to do our \nbest to help beneficiaries by fixing the underlying law.\n  The Medicare prescription drug program exempts the lowest income \nnursing home residents from all prescription drug co-payments. However, \nit leaves out the equally vulnerable group of low-income beneficiaries \nwho live in assisted living and other home and community-based \nfacilities. These are often beneficiaries with serious mental illnesses \nwho have been stabilized on medications, and people with developmental \nand physical disabilities who have little or no incomes and previously \nreceived prescription drug coverage under Medicaid.\n  In my home State of Florida, thousands of individuals with mental \nillnesses are integrated into community-based programs such as \nassisted-living facilities. Unfortunately, many patients in these \nfacilities are forgoing their medications on account of the new \nMedicare co-payments. Reports also indicate that patients have been \nhospitalized because they have been unable to afford their essential \nmedications due to the new cost-sharing requirements.\n  In response, we are introducing the Home and Community Services Co-\npayment Equity Act of 2006. The legislation would waive co-payments for \nlow-income beneficiaries residing in assisted living and other home- \nand community-based facilities. This bill is a small step that will go \na long way towards ensuring that low-income patients get their \nprescription drugs.\n  This issue boils down to just one goal--helping low-income seniors \nand people with disabilities afford the medications they need. I urge \nall of our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, to join us in this \nvital effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2410. A bill to amend the Homeland-Security Act of 2002 to limit \nforeign control of investments in certain United States critical \ninfrastructure; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

A bill to address homeland security issues relating to first \nresponders, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the use of technology, \nFederal, State, and local coordination, and critical infrastructure, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the 9/11 Commission \nRecommendations Implementation Act of 2006. This legislation will \nprovide $41.625 billion over the next 10 years to help ensure that we \nimplement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  Back in July of 2004, the 9/11 Commission--with distinguished \nbipartisan leadership from former Republican Governor Tom Kean and \nformer Congressman Lee Hamilton--issued its report with recommendations \nof what the government should do to help better protect the Nation.\n  Nearly a year and a half later, they issued a so-called report card \nto tell us how well the government had been doing at implementing their \nrecommendations.\n  Well, it doesn't look good. That report card was riddled with Cs, Ds, \nFs, and incompletes.\n  Most Americans believe that we've taken the obvious steps to close \nthe gaps in our homeland defense. They believe that at the very least, \nwe have a plan, that we've set priorities, and that we know what the \nnext steps are.\n  But, let me quote from the Commission's report card from December on \nwhat we've done to assess the risks and vulnerabilities of our critical \ninfrastructure--transportation, communications, and industrial assets.\n  Here's what they say--and I quote--``no risk and vulnerability \nassessments have actually been made. No national priorities are yet \nestablished. No recommendations have been made on the allocation of \nscarce resources. All key decisions on homeland security are at least a \nyear away.''\n  We all remember 9/11, when we learned for the first time that local \npolice, fire, and rescue units could not communicate with each other \nand could not communicate with Federal agencies. We saw how this \ninability probably resulted in many deaths that could have been \nprevented. Well, we learned during Hurricane Katrina that things are no \nbetter today. No better today.\n  The one place I think most Americans think we've probably done pretty \nwell--passenger screening--actually got an ``F.'' The 9/11 commission \nreports stated that, in fact, ``few improvements have been made to the \nexisting passenger screening system since right after 9/11.'' With \nrespect to checked bag and cargo screening for commercial flights, the \n9/11 Commission gave a score of ``D'', stating that ``improvements have \nnot been made a priority by Congress or the Bush Administration.''\n  This is unacceptable. This Administration hasn't even filled in the \nvery obvious gaps in our homeland defense. We haven't done it. We \nsimply haven't done it.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will ensure that we address the \nmost obvious gaps in our homeland defense. It begins with those areas \nwhere the Commission graded us and the President as ``F'' and ``D.'' \nAnd, it addresses those areas that were outside the scope of the report \nbut are commonsense things that we should be doing, such as securing \nthe rails and providing funding for local law enforcement.\n  And it's pretty basic. We have done nothing much to deal with the \nproblems most Americans know relate to homeland security. We are safer \nbut not nearly safe enough. The bipartisan commission that got great \ngrades from everybody in the Nation felt compelled on their own dime, \ntheir own money, their own resources, not funded by the government, to \ncontinue to issue reports and to hold hearings. And they issued a \nreport on December 5 that is, quite frankly, embarrassing and \ndangerous.\n  We can and we have to marshal all our country's resources in this \nstruggle. Do you think that the American people would rather us spend \nthis money on securing our ports, our chemical plants, our railroads, \nour cities, or give it back as a tax break for the wealthiest \nAmericans? Given the choice, the American people said, let's make our \nstreets safer. I'm confident they think we should make the country \nsafer. This legislation will help take us down that path, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 2413. A bill to establish the Return of Talent Program to allow \naliens who are legally present in the United States to return \ntemporarily to the country of citizenship of the alien if that country \nis engaged in post-conflict or natural disaster reconstruction, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, two of the greatest challenges we face \ntoday are how to address the needs of post-conflict countries, and \ncountries that are suffering from large-scale natural disasters. These \nare critical issues, and ones that we cannot afford to get\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\nwrong--for the sake of the people living in those nations, and for the \nsake of our own security.\n  On the post-conflict front, a 2004 commission organized by the Center \nfor Strategic and International Studies and the Association of the U.S. \nArmy found, to no one's surprise, that ``failed states matter--for \nnational security as well as for humanitarian reasons. If left to their \nown devices, such states can become sanctuaries for terrorist networks, \norganized crime and drug traffickers, as well as posing grave \nhumanitarian challenges and threats to regional stability.''\n  The most obvious case in point is the reconstruction of Iraq. I've \nspent many hours on this floor, for three years, making clear that we \nhave to get it right in Iraq. And in addition to Iraq, unfortunately, \nwe can talk about many other states that are either unstable, or are \ntenuously recovering from past conflicts including Liberia, \nAfghanistan, East Timor, Kosovo, Haiti, and the Democratic Republic of \nCongo.\n  Earthquakes, floods, drought and landslides often have the most dire \nimpacts in developing countries that are the least equipped to respond. \nThe countries ravaged by the 2004 tsunami are on a path to recovery, \nbut there is still a long way to go: Indonesia lost over 150,000 \npeople, with half a million left homeless. In India, almost 20,000 \npeople lost their lives and 2.79 million people were affected, losing \nhomes, land, and livestock. The tsunami set back the Maldives twenty \nyears in development, eviscerating the country's economic backbone and \ntourism industry.\n  Recent years also saw devastating natural disasters in other parts of \nthe world. Earthquakes in Iran affected more than 30,000 people. \nCatastrophic floods in Bangladesh left thousands dead and hundreds of \nthousands homeless. Recurring droughts in Afghanistan left over 130,000 \npeople--some 92 percent of the population--in need of food or aid.\n  We need comprehensive--and creative--strategies to address the need \nto rebuild in countries on the rebound from conflicts or natural \ndisasters. One such strategy is to tap into the store of human as well \nas financial resources here in the United States. We should allow, and \nindeed encourage, immigrants to use their skills, talents, and \nknowledge to help rebuild their native lands. In fact, the diaspora \npresents one of the best collective resources that exists: these \nindividuals know the communities. They know the culture. They know the \nlanguage--more than any contractors and more than any humanitarian \nworkers from the outside, no matter how well trained or how much \nexpertise they may have.\n  So today, I am introducing legislation that would create a ``Return \nof Talent'' visa program.\n  The idea is simple: a Return of Talent program would allow legal \nimmigrants in the United States to return home to help with \nreconstruction efforts. ``Legal Permanent Residents'' will be able to \nreturn temporarily to their countries after a conflict or a significant \nnatural disaster to help rebuild, without their time out of the United \nStates affecting their ability to meet the requirements for U.S. \ncitizenship.\n  Under current law, a Legal Permanent Resident who wants to apply for \nU.S. citizenship is required to be physically present in the United \nStates for at least half of the five years immediately preceding the \ndate of filing the naturalization application.\n  This residency requirement could be particularly difficult to meet \nfor those who may have family and friends in their country of origin \nwho are in desperate need of help. We should not stand in their way of \nreturning, allowing them to bring their talent and expertise home, \nhelping them help others at a time of greatest need.\n  Press articles have highlighted stories of such individuals--\nengineers, bankers, teachers and translators--who are willing to \ncontribute to reconstruction efforts. They simply cannot do so without \njeopardizing their immigration status.\n  This legislation would encourage those skilled and committed \nindividuals to return to their countries of origin to revive the \nbusiness, industry, agriculture, education, health and other sectors \nthat have been weakened or destroyed after years of conflict or \ndevastating disasters.\n  The Return of Talent program would include any individual who \ndemonstrates an ability and willingness to make a material contribution \nto the post-conflict or natural disaster reconstruction in their \ncountry of origin.\n  The program would apply to immigrants from countries where U.S. armed \nforces have engaged in armed conflict or peacekeeping, or countries \nwhere the United Nations Security Council has authorized peacekeeping \noperations in the past ten years. Immigrants from countries which \nreceived funding from the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance \nalso would be eligible to participate in the program.\n  Estimates of individuals who could participate in this program are \nrelatively low. For example, the United States admitted 2,137 Afghani \nand 3,494 Iraqi immigrants in 2004 who are now Legal Permanent \nResidents eligible to pursue U.S. citizenship. Immigrants from \nIndonesia numbered 2,418 and Bangladesh, 8,061 in the same year. Yet, \nwhile the program would have a small impact on the U.S. naturalization \nprocess, the contributions of even a few hundred individuals could have \na tremendous positive effect on reconstruction work.\n  In simple terms, a Return of Talent program makes sense. Everybody \nwins: The United States is able to support badly needed rebuilding \nefforts without increasing foreign aid; immigrants are able to use \ntheir skills and resources to help communities without jeopardizing \ntheir immigration status; and the people recovering from conflict and \ndisaster receive much-needed assistance.\n  A Return of Talent program is an important piece of our overall \nstrategy to stabilize and rebuild countries torn by conflict and \ndevastated by natural disaster. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require \nbroker reporting of customer's basis in securities transactions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of a bill I am \nproud to introduce today with Senators Bayh, Kerry, and Carper to help \nclose the tax gap by improving the reporting of capital gains income. \nThis bill requires brokerage firms and mutual fund companies to track \nand report the adjusted cost basis of their clients' stock, bond, and \nmutual fund investments.\n  This bill is a simple, commonsense solution to a serious problem. \nMany taxpayers have a hard enough time filing their taxes. One of the \nmost complex parts of an individual's tax return is the schedule for \ncapital gains income. And what makes capital gains particularly \ndifficult is the challenge of figuring out the adjusted basis of a \nsecurity that has been sold.\n  Many taxpayers do not have the proper records or they don't know how \nto calculate adjusted basis for a stock that has split or been \nexchanged as part of a company's merger or acquisition. And right now, \nthe IRS does not have the ability to monitor the accuracy of taxpayer \ncalculations. As a result, there is a risk of error or fraud. In some \ncases, taxpayers may end up paying too much in taxes. More often, they \nreport too little income and pay too little in taxes.\n  In 2001, the IRS estimated that underreporting cost the Treasury $11 \nbillion annually. Today the loss is even greater.\n  Because the IRS fails to collect these funds, the taxes that the rest \nof us have to pay are greater than they should be. Most people pay \ntheir taxes honestly and follow the law to the best of their ability. \nBut a small number of tax frauds--who often owe great amounts of \ntaxes--cheat the system. And it's hard now for the IRS to stop them.\n  This bill makes it easier to stop them and it helps reduce the amount \nof Federal tax dollars that the IRS fails to collect each year. \nBrokerage firms and mutual fund companies will be required to keep \ntrack of a taxpayer's cost basis and to report that information to the \nIRS. This will make it easier for honest taxpayers to calculate their \ntaxable capital gain, and harder for dishonest ones to lie about it. \nBased on information from the Taxpayer Advocate, reporting to the IRS \ncan improve compliance of capital gains reporting from an estimated 50 \npercent today to 90 percent.\n  Fortunately, this new reporting requirement will not pose an undue \nburden to the financial firms affected. First, the firms will have \nplenty of time to put the necessary systems in place since the \nreporting requirement will not take effect until 2009, and then will \nonly apply to securities acquired starting in 2008. Second, technology \nhas made tracking by financial firms simple and efficient. More than 80 \npercent of all retail accounts already subscribe to a national \nreporting service for transferring basis information at a nominal cost \nper account. Finally, in cases where it is impossible to track basis, \nthe Treasury Secretary may develop regulations to require alternative \ninformation.\n  It is estimated that $345 billion of Federal taxes goes uncollected \neach year. This bill doesn't solve that full problem, but it is a step \nin the right direction. It reduces the Federal deficit without raising \ntaxes or cutting spending. It simplifies the tax filing process and \nreduces the chance of error or fraud. It applies what we know about the \nbenefits of automatic reporting to the IRS--which is required now for \nwage income--to capital gains income as well.\n  This bill makes sense. It's good policy. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting it and to helping to improve our tax code.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/14/senate-section/article/S2128-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2128-S2129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3013.

Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the concurrent resolution S. Con. \nRes. 83, setting forth the congressional budget for the United States \nGovernment for fiscal year 2007 and including the appropriate budgetary \nlevels for fiscal years 2006 and 2008 through 2011; which was ordered \nto lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT AND \n                   EQUITABLE, FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE APPROPRIATIONS \n                   AND REVENUE DECISIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Federal programs and policies directly influence local \n     growth patterns through the location of Federal facilities, \n     spending on public infrastructure, tax incentives, and \n     Federal regulations.\n       (2) A majority of Americans favor walkable neighborhoods, \n     shorter commutes, and natural resource conservation, which \n     are land development patterns favored by smart growth.\n       (3) Federal programs and policies should support local \n     development choices that improve communities through the \n     revitalization of town centers, transit- and pedestrian-\n     oriented development, increased access to retail and public \n     services, preservation of natural resources and parklands, \n     and a greater mix of housing, commercial, and retail uses.\n       (4) Federal incentives should encourage enhanced community \n     quality of life, fiscally sound reinvestment in existing \n     infrastructure, a balanced transportation system, and safe, \n     decent, affordable places for people to live.\n       (5) Investing in existing infrastructure is a fiscally \n     responsible use of resources. When not properly planned, \n     local development decisions may actually burden the Federal \n     budget by requiring the construction of new water, sewer, and \n     transportation infrastructure in low-density areas, rather \n     than funding the maintenance of existing infrastructure. \n     Poorly planned development also often results in increased \n     commuting times, traffic congestion, impaired air quality, \n     loss of open space and environmentally sensitive areas, \n     public health problems, lack of affordable housing, and poor \n     accessibility to critical services such as schools and \n     hospitals.\n       (6) Improving and investing in communities through good \n     planning and sustainable community development has positive \n     effects, reflected, for example, in fiscal cost savings, \n     lower energy consumption, and healthier environments. In \n     addition, businesses are increasingly locating to areas that \n     offer parks and preserve natural resources, provide walkable \n     mixed-use communities, and include a variety of housing \n     options.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that in \n     making appropriations and revenue decisions, the Senate \n     should--\n       (1) support Federal policies that encourage growth patterns \n     that make efficient and equitable use of available housing, \n     transportation, and infrastructure resources, including such \n     policies as brownfields redevelopment programs, farmland \n     protection programs, the retention of the Community \n     Development Block Grant Program (CDBG), and Federal facility \n     decisions, such as those made by the General Services \n     Administration that consider the benefits of utilizing \n     existing infrastructure; and\n       (2) address the unintended consequences of urban and \n     suburban sprawl resulting from specific Federal programs and \n     policies through the allocation of budgetary authority to \n     provide incentives for sustainable growth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3044.

Over 40,000,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS \n     worldwide, and 5,000,000 more people become infected each \n     year. HIV/AIDS is estimated to kill 3,000,000 men, women, and \n     children each year.\n       (2) The United States was the first, and remains the \n     largest, contributor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Global Fund'').\n       (3) The Presidential Administration of George W. Bush \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Administration'') has \n     supported legislative language that links United States \n     contributions to the Global Fund to the contributions of \n     other donors, permitting the United States to provide 33 \n     percent of all donations, which would match contributions on \n     a 1-to-2 basis.\n       (4) As of the date of the approval of this Resolution, \n     Congress has provided \\1/3\\ of all donations to the Global \n     Fund since its inception.\n       (5) The Global Fund currently estimates that during fiscal \n     year 2007, it will renew $1,600,000,000 worth of effective \n     programs that are already operating on the ground, and the \n     Administration and Global Fund Board have said that renewals \n     of existing grants should receive priority funding.\n       (6) The Global Fund estimates that during fiscal year 2007, \n     it could award $1,000,000,000 in funding to proposals \n     submitted for Round 6.\n       (7) For fiscal year 2007, the President has requested \n     $300,000,000 for the United States contribution to the Global \n     Fund.\n       (8) The Global Fund is an important component of the United \n     States efforts to combat AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and \n     supports approximately 350 projects in 130 countries.\n       (9) Through a mid-year review process, Congress and the \n     Administration will assess contributions to date and \n     anticipated contributions to the Global Fund, and ensure that \n     United States contributions, at year end, are at the \n     appropriate 1-to-2 ratio.\n       (10) Congress and the Administration will monitor \n     contributions to the Global Fund to ensure that United States \n     contributions do not exceed \\1/3\\ of the Global Fund's \n     revenues.\n       (11) The United States will need to contribute $566,000,000 \n     more than the President's fiscal year 2007 request for the \n     Global Fund to--\n       (A) fund \\1/3\\ of renewals during fiscal year 2007;\n       (B) support at least 1 new round of proposals in fiscal \n     year 2007; and\n       (C) maintain the 1-to-2 funding ratio.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3053.
