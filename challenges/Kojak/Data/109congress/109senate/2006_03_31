We were unable to reach any \nagreements to allow that to happen, but today we do need to make \nprogress on setting up votes for Monday. We need to put in full nights \nand days next week to complete the bill and, therefore, I am prepared \nto have several votes on Monday to begin to process as many amendments \nas possible. I encourage Senators to come to the floor today and Monday \nand use this time for any statements they may have on the border \nsecurity issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2677-8", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2677-S2678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, so far this week, we have had good debate, \nstrong debate, robust debate, on strengthening our borders and crafting \na comprehensive immigration plan. Everyone agrees we need to secure our \nborders, that our national security is at stake.\n  We are also in agreement that we need to craft a comprehensive \nimmigration plan that is compassionate, reasonable, and fair, that \nupholds our immigrant tradition without crossing over the line of \ngranting amnesty. As I have said before, a nation that cannot secure \nits borders cannot secure its destiny.\n  I am gratified by my colleagues' support for my amendment yesterday \nto have the Department of Homeland Security collect data on the \nterrible problem of border crossing fatalities, of deaths of people \ncrossing the border. The amendment also suggests policies to reduce the \nnumber of these tragedies.\n  As I mentioned on the floor, over the past decade over 3,000 men, \nwomen, and children--families--have died along our borders, in many \ncases because of the brutality and indifference of criminal human \nsmugglers who, at the first sign of trouble, abandon their human cargo \nin the desert to suffer and die.\n  We have an obligation to protect our borders, but we also have an \nobligation to protect and preserve the life of every person who sets \nfoot on American soil. I am hopeful that by gathering this information \non this tragic problem, we can devise the best methods to put an end to \nit.\n  I am also certain that as we continue with the larger debate, we will \nbe able to craft a comprehensive plan that deals fairly with the 11 to \n12 million illegal immigrants now residing within our borders without \ngranting amnesty.\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\n  I believe the Judiciary Committee bill--the bill that came out of the \nJudiciary Committee--goes too far in granting illegal immigrants with \nwhat can fairly be described as amnesty.\n  We will hear a lot of debate on what is amnesty, and I hope there \nwill be some consensus over time coming out of this debate as to what \namnesty actually is. I believe the Judiciary bill does enter this realm \nof amnesty, and, thus, I am very hopeful that over the next several \ndays amendments will be offered on the floor to pull back from this \namnesty provision.\n  I disagree with the amnesty approach. I do not think we should be \nrewarding illegal behavior, not just as a matter of principle but also \nbecause granting amnesty now will encourage people in the future to \ncross the border illegally, expecting amnesty to be granted every 5 \nyears or every 10 years or every 15 years. It undermines our securing \nour borders. It gives an incentive for people to cross our borders, not \njust legally but illegally, if we grant amnesty.\n  In the coming week, I look forward to my colleagues coming to the \nfloor to offer a variety of ideas and solutions to these problems, \nthese challenges. I hope they will have ample opportunity to do that.\n  I said 2 or 3 months ago, we would have 2 weeks--in essence, 2 \nweeks--on the floor of the Senate to provide an opportunity to come and \ndebate and amend whatever bill came to the floor. I am concerned a \nlittle bit that we are entering into a delay or a postpone mode. I say \nthat because we did not have votes last night, after my amendment--or \nlate yesterday afternoon--and we are not having votes today. It does \ntake consent on both sides of the aisle to have these votes. I \nencourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come forward so \nwe can have that debate, we can have that amendment, we can have those \nvotes, and define this bill in a way that will reflect the majority of \npeople on this floor.\n\n  An example: Last night, Senator Alexander offered his widely \nsupported Strengthening American Citizenship Act--a beautiful and a \nvery important amendment. It is reasonable. It is common sense. It is \npatriotic. It would help newly arrived immigrants to learn their \nresponsibilities and assimilate the habits and privileges of American \ncitizenship. Unfortunately, however, the other side objected to \nallowing a vote on the amendment.\n  I mention that because we cannot run the bill that way throughout. We \nhave to have the debate, we have to have the votes in order to define \nthis bill. We need a debate that is robust, that is vigorous, that is \nopen, that is participatory in the sense that people can come forward \nand get the votes they deserve.\n  I have set up a process to be as fair as possible so all points of \nviews are heard. Many of the Senators, understandably, do want to offer \namendments. For my part, though we began with the Securing America's \nBorders Act, a bill I brought to the floor, the first amendment was \nChairman Specter's amendment, and that is to offer the Judiciary \nCommittee bill as a substitute. I, and I think the whole body, accept \nthat out of deep respect for the committee process and the great work \nthe committee has done thus far and the right for the committee's voice \nto be heard.\n  I am optimistic about where we are going with this bill. It is \ninteresting, in our caucus, and I know in the Democratic caucus as \nwell, there is a lot of discussion going on. You can't help but to pick \nup the papers now and listen to the radio and watch television and not \nsee this discussion of these very real problems being put first and \nforemost in the headlines and in the stories.\n  I think that is healthy because we have problems which we have failed \nto address as a people, problems we absolutely must address, the \nproblems of people crossing these borders illegally, at a rate that \nabout 2.8 million people came across our Southwest border last year. \nThat number is increasing every year by about 25 percent. These are \nillegal people coming across the borders. It is a problem that is \nthere. It is a problem that is growing. It is a problem we have to \naddress.\n  The challenge which is probably the most difficult is how to address \nthe 11 million people who have crossed those borders in the past, \nprobably 7.5 million of whom are working, many of them families. Many \nof them--I guess all of them--came here with the intention of a better \nlife. But they broke the law and they are here illegally. How can we \ntreat them with compassion and understanding but not give them a leg up \namong other law-abiding people who also want citizenship?\n  Those are challenges. I think everybody is struggling with that. I \nappreciate it. And it means we are going to have passionate debate, \ncontentious debate. Not everybody is going to agree on even those two \nissues I mentioned. It is going to be a highly charged issue. There are \ndeep feelings and deep and strong principles at stake.\n  The process will work. I am confident in this body the process will \nwork if we keep our debate civilized and dignified and fair to every \nMember of the body. And by ``fair,'' I mean allow people to come to the \nfloor and offer those amendments and have them voted on.\n  As I said when I introduced the border security bill, I do want our \ndebate to reflect our commitment to the rule of law and to our proud \nimmigrant heritage--to both. We are a nation of immigrants, and we have \nall benefited from America's uniquely inclusive character. I believe we \ncan honor both our history and our laws, and by working together, we \ncan forge a solution that does credit to this body and to the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nas in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2678-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2678-S2679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        sergeant ryan montgomery\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to pause for a \nmoment today to commemorate the life and sacrifice of SGT Ryan Jay \nMontgomery.\n  Sergeant Montgomery of Greensburg, KY, served with the 623rd Field \nArtillery in the Kentucky Army National Guard. On July 3, 2005, he gave \nhis life in defense of our country near Baghdad, Iraq. He had served \nhis Nation as a citizen-soldier for almost 5 years. He was 22 years \nold.\n  On that day in July, Sergeant Montgomery and two of his fellow \nKentucky National Guard soldiers were returning from escorting a supply \nconvoy when, just outside of Baghdad, a roadside bomb struck his \nhumvee. The other two soldiers were injured; sadly, Sergeant Montgomery \nwas killed.\n  For his valiant service, Sergeant Montgomery was awarded the Bronze \nStar Medal, the Purple Heart, and the Combat Action Badge. He had \npreviously received both the Army Commendation Medal and the Armed \nForces Reserve Medal. And he was awarded the Kentucky Distinguished \nService Medal, for demonstrating all the qualities of a great soldier, \nremaining combat-focused while decisively engaged with the enemy, \nperforming his duties and accomplishing his mission.\n  While a student at Green County High School, Sergeant Montgomery \nstarted a Junior ROTC program there, for kids interested in a military \ncareer. The discipline and purpose of Army life appealed to him, so \nyoung Ryan decided he could better himself through joining the Guard. \nEnlisting before he finished high school, he hoped to use money from \nthe Guard to help him pay for his education necessary to realize his \ngoal of becoming an architect.\n  Ryan's mother, Patricia Montgomery, said that Ryan's service in the \nKentucky National Guard could ``give him a better start in life.'' His \ntwin brother, Bryan, who never strayed far from his brother's side, was \nso impressed by the opportunities the military gave his brother that \nhe, too, decided to serve, and ended up a member of Bravo Battery, \nFirst Battalion, in the 623rd Field Artillery--the same unit as his \nbrother Ryan.\n  Before he was deployed to Iraq, Ryan worked two jobs in addition to \nhis\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\nwork with the Guard. He was training with the Green County Fire and \nRescue Team, to become a volunteer firefighter. He also helped out with \nthe junior ROTC program at Green County High that he had formed, \nteaching classes and encouraging the students who were following his \nexample to serve their country.\n  Sergeant Montgomery was deployed to Iraq in January 2005. Ryan and \nhis unit were charged with escorting the many supply convoys which \ntraveled in and out of Baghdad, often a hazardous assignment, and also \nsearching for the enemy or their deadly roadside bombs. Sergeant \nMontgomery successfully took part in 130 missions. As his father, \nRaymond Montgomery said, ``He really felt like he was doing good over \nthere. He absolutely loved it.'' Before deploying to Iraq, Ryan's unit \nalso served in Kuwait.\n  During his downtime in Iraq, Ryan could most often be found working \non his humvee with his twin brother Bryan, who served as a mechanic for \nthe 623rd. He would also write or e-mail the folks back home, or he \nwould talk or watch a movie with his brother Bryan. The two didn't get \na lot of free time together in Iraq, but they usually saw each other \nevery day.\n  Born in Greensburg, where he lived his whole life and which is the \ncounty seat of Green County, Ryan and Bryan were known as twin cut-ups, \naccording to their mom, Patricia. She recalls that the two identical \nbrothers would often switch clothes to confuse family friends and \nbabysitters.\n  Patricia remembers that Ryan taught Bryan how to ride a bike when the \ntwo were little. As a child, Ryan loved family dinners. And he loved to \nmake people laugh. ``If you see someone without a smile, give them \nyours''--that was Ryan's motto, according to his mother. Bryan \nrecalled, ``My brother and I always lived like a laugh could solve \nanything.''\n  Both Ryan and Bryan played the great American pastime--Little \nLeague--as kids. What they may have lacked in athleticism, they made up \nfor in enthusiasm. ``They were average athletes,'' says John Durham, \nthe boys' Little League coach. ``But I don't think there was another \nmember of the team that had as much fun out there playing than they \ndid.''\n  In high school, Ryan played in the marching band in addition to his \nwork with Junior ROTC. He played the trumpet and Bryan played the tuba \nand the trombone. And he liked to go hunting with his dad.\n  Ryan was also interested in truck-pulling. As a kid, Ryan's dad took \nhim and his brother to truck pulls at local fairs. It was something \nthat naturally appealed to both boys, and when he was old enough, Ryan \nbought a Chevy S-10 that all three men worked to modify together.\n  After Ryan's death, Bryan continued his brother's project, driving \nthe truck they had collaborated on to victory in a truck pull that was \ndedicated to Ryan in Temple Hill, KY. It was the same competition that \nRyan had won in 2004 with the same truck. After winning, Bryan said, \n``It felt great to follow in Ryan's success like that.''\n  Ryan left behind a loving family who will forever treasure his \nmemory. We thank his father, Raymond Montgomery, his mother, Patricia \nMontgomery, and his brother, Bryan Montgomery, for sharing their \nstories of Ryan with us. We are also thinking of Ryan's sister, Ashley \nMontgomery, and his stepmother, Sharon Montgomery, today.\n  I want to leave my colleagues with the words of SGT Ryan Montgomery \nhimself. These words were found on his computer in Iraq. He wrote:\n\n       This place is a roller coaster ride; you never know what is \n     going [to] happen next. It's scary when you think about it. \n     But I pray every night for every soldier who has given their \n     freedom to free these people.\n\n  Ryan continued:\n\n       I pray for my family and every blessing God [has] put in my \n     life. [It's] hard to live day to day, not knowing what the \n     next day holds. I just pray and carry on with the mission. I \n     didn't think this place was going [to affect] me like it has. \n     I'm a different person, but for the good.\n\n  Words cannot describe the overflowing of gratitude, and pride, and \nhonor one feels after reading this young man's words. Nor can they \ndescribe the depths of sorrow we feel at his loss. Sergeant \nMontgomery's courage was so strong that, even amidst the ``roller \ncoaster'' of battle, he was able to hold on to his love of God, his \nfamily, and his mission to spread freedom.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in saying that America can never \nrepay the debt we owe SGT Ryan Montgomery or the Montgomery family. We \nare truly blessed to live in a country where so many brave men and \nwomen, like Ryan, volunteer to face hardship out of the love of \nfreedom, and love for the rest of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2679-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2679-S2681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SECURING AMERICA'S BORDERS ACT AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I return to the floor to speak about the \npending amendment to the border security and immigration bill that was \nvoted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I am proud to \nserve. I want to explain to my colleagues and anyone else who may be \nlistening why I oppose this amendment. I believe that, while there are \nmany good things in the bill, or amendment, one of the bad things it \ncontains is that it provides amnesty to those who have violated our \nimmigration laws. As I have said before and I will say again, I cannot \naccept amnesty as part of any comprehensive solution to our immigration \ncrisis. But more important, it is not a question of whether I can \naccept this as part of the solution. I don't believe the American \npeople will accept amnesty as part of the solution either.\n  Unfortunately, at its core the committee product includes an amnesty. \nLet me explain in some detail because I think there are those who see \namnesty in every solution that has been offered. Some say the guest \nworker program that the President speaks about is an amnesty. I don't \nnecessarily agree with that because it is a temporary worker program, \nas he has used that term, not an alternative path to citizenship such \nas the Judiciary Committee bill. But I do think that there are some \nthings that can justifiably be called amnesty; that is, if words have \nany meaning.\n  The reason why I conclude that this Judiciary Committee bill provides \nan amnesty is because it creates a new path to citizenship for \napproximately 12 million people who have entered our country in \nviolation of our immigration laws. I want to be quick to interject, we \nunderstand why it is that people come to America. It is the same reason \nthat everyone wants to come to America, and that is because we are the \nbeacon of hope and freedom and opportunity for the planet. We \nunderstand that and we harbor no ill will or grudge against people who \nsimply want to provide for their family. We understand that. But as a \nsovereign nation, sovereignty implies control of our borders, and we do \nnot have control of our borders today. It also implies that we will do \nfirst what is good for America and American interests, and then if we \ncan, and certainly we do, we could go help our neighbor. But we simply \ncan't throw our hands up in the air and say we give up when it comes to \ncontrolling our borders and enforcing our laws.\n  First of all, that would violate the sacred oath that we have taken \nas Senators, as Members of Congress, to defend and uphold the laws of \nthe United States, including the Constitution. So what we are talking \nabout is not a matter of wanting to be unnecessarily harsh or punitive \ntoward those who have come here for what are all understandable and \nhuman reasons. But I do not believe the American people will accept a \nproposal which includes amnesty because they understand that American \ncitizenship is a very special privilege, and they reject the notion \nthat we have no choice but to give it out because the Federal \nGovernment has simply failed to enforce the law.\n  I strongly believe that we need comprehensive immigration reform, \nincluding border security. I think we need to provide a path to the 10 \nmillion people who have come here in violation of our immigration laws, \nwho already live in the United States. But I have a fundamental \ndisagreement with the approach contained in this amendment.\n  I believe we must start with the rule that people who have come to \nthis country in violation of our immigration laws should be required to \ngo through the same process as all other legal immigrants.\n  Let me say that again.\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\n  I believe we must start with an approach that people who have come to \nthis country in violation of our immigration laws should be required to \ngo through the same process as all other legal immigrants.\n  But this committee product does exactly the opposite. It is a \nsolution of sorts based on weakness and the self-fulfilling prophesy \nthat we cannot enforce our own laws. The message this amendment sends \nto the American people is that because we can't enforce our immigration \nlaws, the only way to address the 12 million people who have come here \nin violation of our immigration laws is to reward them with a special \npass, a permanent resident status, and citizenship.\n  Some say this legislation--the committee bill--is the only way to \nrealistically deal with people who have come to our country in \nviolation of our laws. But I reject this point of view--this defeatism. \nIn fact, when I hear someone say that only amnesty will work, what I \nreally want to ask them is: Why do we have immigration laws at all?\n  There are those, as I have said earlier, who see amnesty behind every \nbush and call every proposed solution to the problem amnesty. I am not \naddressing those people with my remarks today because I don't think \nthey will ever be convinced otherwise.\n  But I do think there are ways to determine whether a proposal is \namnesty, and I suggest to you the best way is to look at what this \ncountry did in 1986 and to compare the proposal in this Judiciary \nCommittee bill with that 1986 law because that 1986 law is unarguable, \nundisputed. No one argues that law did not create amnesty. And if there \nare two things we can agree on, it is not only did it create an \namnesty, but it was a complete and abject failure.\n  Amnesty didn't work in 1986 and it won't work today. That is because \namnesty encourages disrespect for our laws, and it shows disrespect for \nthose who have earned or are trying to patiently earn U.S. citizenship \nlawfully.\n  As I have said in this divisive debate, surely we can all agree that \nthe 1968 law was amnesty and that it was a complete failure. Some argue \nthat the committee amendment is not because it is different from the \n1986 amnesty. But I don't agree the two proposals are that different. \nWhat I would like to do is show this chart to those who are listening \nand watching. In 1986, these are the elements of the 1986 bill that was \nsigned by President Ronald Reagan. It creates a two-step amnesty \nprocess.\n  First, illegal aliens obtain temporary resident status. At the end of \nthat period--just under 4 years--they could apply for a green card. \nThat is for a legal permanent resident. But before they could get that \ngreen card, the 1986 bill required applicants for the green card to pay \na fee and learn basic citizenship and English skills.\n  If this sounds vaguely familiar, it is because it is exactly the same \nmodel carried forth in the legislation voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, which is the basic bill that we are working on as part of \nthis debate.\n  As you can see from this chart, both bills--both the Judiciary \nCommittee product that we are now debating and the 1986 amnesty--are \nstrikingly similar. And in some respects--this is really curious--the \n1986 amnesty was tougher than the one currently before the Senate.\n  For example, the 1986 amnesty, like the current proposal, required \nthat the person applying for legal status had to be in our country \nbefore a specified date. That date was you would have to have entered \nbefore January 1, 1982. That is 5 years prior to enactment. And the \nproposal on the floor says that you have to have come into the country \nbefore January 7, 2004.\n  This is an important concept when considering amnesty because there \nare always reports of rushing to the border by those working along the \nborder as aliens seeking to make their way here to take advantage of \nthe amnesty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article in \nthe Washington Times entitled ``Illegals Acted on Rumors of Amnesty.''\n  Part of this article says:\n\n       Nearly 35 percent of the illegal aliens captured trying to \n     enter the United States in the 19 days after President Bush \n     proposed a still-pending guest-worker program say they were \n     trying to take advantage of what they saw as an amnesty.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in 1968 Congress recognized it was \nimportant to grant amnesty only to those aliens who had been here more \nthan 5 years. In contrast, the pending legislation puts the date of \neligibility to January 2, 2004, a little over 2 years ago.\n\n  This chart also addresses other eligibility requirements. As Senator \nKyl and I discussed yesterday, the 1986 amnesty required that \napplicants be admissible under immigration laws and that they not have \nbeen convicted of a felony or more than three misdemeanors, compared to \nthe current proposal that simply requires that the applicant be \nadmissible under immigration law; that is, they might still come to the \ncountry and be eligible for amnesty even if they are a felon or even if \nthey have committed more than three misdemeanors because of certain de \nminimis provisions of the immigration law.\n  Hopefully, our amendment will cure that omission, which will now \nensure that felons and those who have been convicted of at least three \nmisdemeanors cannot take advantage of the amnesty.\n  My hope is that we will at least make this bill as tough and set \nstandards as high as they did in 1986, which certainly is not the case \nfor the current proposal pending on the Senate floor.\n  Continuing under this chart, in 1986, the law created a new temporary \nresident status that lasted for 43 months. The current amendment \ncreates a new conditional nonimmigrant status valid for 72 months. That \nis step 1, a temporary status.\n  Much has been made under the committee proposal about the hurdles \nthat those who are currently in violation of our immigration laws but \nare nevertheless here in the United States will have to achieve in \norder to obtain a green card which then, of course, is a pass to \ncitizenship. It is described by critics as a difficult process because \nillegal aliens will have to learn citizenship skills, pay a fee, pay \nback taxes, and continue working here in the United States.\n  But as the chart shows, the 1986 amnesty also required applicants to \nlearn basic citizenship skills, including understanding ordinary \nEnglish and history of the Government of the United States and to pay a \nfee.\n  But the most important point beyond the similarity of the amnesty in \n1986, which everyone agrees was amnesty, the most important point is \nthat we all can see that the amnesty in 1986 did not work and was a \ncomplete and total failure.\n  All you have to do is look at the fact that about 3 million people \nwho have come into the country in violation of our immigration laws \nbenefited from that 1986 amnesty.\n  Here we are 20 years later and we are not talking about 3 million \npeople, we are talking about 12 million people, and maybe more.\n  That is part of the reason some people regard amnesty as a magnet \nthat will attract further illegal immigration across our border and \nonly to have us agree to another amnesty and then meet the next wave of \npeople coming across our border who have perhaps a future amnesty.\n  Some people are very upset with the Federal Government and its \nfailure to enforce our laws and to secure our borders. But the American \npeople are a very forgiving people. I think if they believed that \nCongress is actually trying to solve this problem, as I believe we are, \nthey will perhaps forgive us for not having secured our border before, \nmade sure we had enforceable worksite verification and employer \nsanctions for those who hired people in violation of our immigration \nlaws.\n  But there is one thing the American people won't forgive; that is, if \nwe try to trick them again by trying to sell them an amnesty in 2006 \nwhen they know good and well that the amnesty in 1986 was a complete \nand total failure.\n  I am earnestly interested in finding a solution to this problem. I \nbelieve the better starting point for solving this complex problem is \nwith fairness. That means treating the people who have entered our \ncountry in violation of our\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\nlaws no better than those who patiently wait outside of our country for \ntheir chance at the American dream through legal channels.\n  This can be done by allowing those who have come here illegally a \nsecond chance to depart and then reenter the country legally. This is \nthe model that was contained in legislation that Senator John Kyl and I \nintroduced well over a year ago. We did so after holding about half \ndozen hearings on the broken immigration system and ways to fix it. \nBoth of us, like all of our colleagues, but particularly Senators from \nborder States, are earnestly interested in trying to find a way to fix \nit. But I recognize--and I believe Senator Kyl does as well--that there \nneeds to be flexibility built into any proposal.\n  We recognize there will probably have to be humanitarian exceptions \nfor the elderly or third country processing for those who have no \ncountry to return to. Senator Kyl and I are working on proposals to \nmake these concepts work as part of a comprehensive bill. But then for \nthe 12 million illegal aliens in this country, I am confident for their \npersonal situations we would all agree that some special consideration \nis warranted. No one can test that.\n  But when creating a Federal policy that will impact tens of millions \nof people in the years to come, there has to be agreement and consensus \non a general rule. That is why I disagree with the Judiciary Committee \nproduct. The general rule under their proposal is that illegal aliens \nwill be rewarded with a special pass to citizenship and that person \nwill be allowed to break in line ahead of those who have attempted to \ncome to this country legally and are patiently waiting outside the \ncountry for their chance.\n  As you can tell, it is no secret that I oppose the committee product. \nI oppose it because I think it is bad policy and will reward illegal \nbehavior. I believe it is a proposal built on an assumption that our \nimmigration laws cannot be enforced. That is something I will never \nagree with because that is simply to give up and to admit defeat.\n  But, most importantly, I oppose it because I believe it repeats a \nmistake that our country made 20 years ago which, if repeated, will \nnever be excused or forgiven by the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Aug. 2, 2004]\n\n                  Illegals Acted on Rumors of Amnesty\n\n                            (By Jerry Seper)\n\n       Nearly 35 percent of the illegal aliens captured trying to \n     enter the United States in the 19 days after President Bush \n     proposed a still-pending guest-worker program say they were \n     trying to take advantage of what many saw as amnesty.\n       According to a confidential Border Patrol report to a \n     Senate committee, 1,000 of 2,881 foreign nationals \n     interviewed by agents after their capture at the U.S.-Mexico \n     border between Jan. 7 and Jan. 26 acknowledged that rumors of \n     an amnesty program--outlined in Mexican press reports and \n     passed on by relatives--had influenced their decision to try \n     to enter the United States illegally.\n       Mr. Bush's proposed immigration initiative, formally \n     announced Jan. 7, would allow millions of illegal aliens in \n     the United States to remain in the country as guest workers \n     for renewable three-year periods if they have jobs. The \n     aliens eventually could apply for permanent legal residence.\n       About 8 million to 12 million illegal aliens, mostly \n     Mexican nationals, are estimated to be in the United States.\n       Beginning just days after the Bush announcement, the number \n     of illegal aliens caught crossing into this country from \n     Mexico increased dramatically, immigration-enforcement \n     officials said, although the White House painstakingly has \n     denied that the president's guestworker proposal offered \n     amnesty--saying, instead, it would give illegal aliens \n     holding jobs in the United States temporary work permits, but \n     they eventually would have to go home.\n       Outlined as a set of principles and not as specific \n     legislation, the Bush proposal did not prescribe any \n     penalties for those caught entering the country illegally and \n     would allow those here to remain in the United States for an \n     as-yet undetermined number of renewable three-year periods.\n       The Border Patrol report said 66,472 illegal aliens were \n     apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border during that 19-day \n     period, about 3,500 a day. The January 2004 total is more \n     than 11 percent higher than the number of apprehensions \n     reported in January 2003, according to patrol records.\n       The report said questionnaires were given to field \n     intelligence agents to interview apprehended aliens on a \n     random basis to determine their ``perception of the proposed \n     temporary guestworker program.'' The questionnaire used the \n     word ``amnesty'' because of the widespread reporting in the \n     Mexican press referring to the proposed program as an offer \n     of amnesty, the report said.\n       The questionnaire was canceled Jan. 26 after its public \n     disclosure. The report said Border Patrol officials \n     determined that the questionnaire's integrity had been \n     compromised by the press coverage.\n       The Border Patrol has denied that the questionnaire was \n     politically motivated or intended to imply that Mr. Bush was \n     calling for a general amnesty, saying, instead, that the \n     agency routinely develops questionnaires to request \n     information from field offices on a variety of issues.\n       ``This practice is critical to providing the Border Patrol \n     with a comprehensive understanding of the border \n     environment,'' the report said. ``The collection of this type \n     of information is an essential tool that enables decision-\n     makers to develop plans and operations specifically designed \n     to counter threats or issues that the questionnaire \n     identifies or confirms.''\n       The National Border Patrol Council, which represents the \n     agency's 10,000 nonsupervisory agents, said apprehension \n     totals increased threefold in the San Diego area alone, \n     adding that the majority of aliens detained along the border \n     in January told arresting agents that they had come to the \n     United States seeking amnesty.\n       Most of those arrested and eventually deported had no \n     history of immigration violations, the council said.\n       The council has told its members to challenge the guest-\n     worker proposal, calling it a ``slap in the face to anyone \n     who has ever tried to enforce the immigration laws of the \n     United States.''\n       Congress approved an amnesty program in 1986 that gave \n     legal status to 2.7 million illegal aliens.\n       A CBS News/New York Times poll in January 2004 said no \n     issue upset the public more than Mr. Bush's amnesty/guest-\n     worker proposal, with only one-third of Americans supporting \n     him. And a CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll that same month said 74 \n     percent of respondents thought the United States should not \n     make it easier for illegal aliens to become U.S. citizens.\n       Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican and a senior \n     member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had asked Homeland \n     Security Secretary Tom Ridge to explain whether ``rumors of \n     amnesty'' concerning the Bush proposal had played any role in \n     attempts by illegal aliens to cross the border.\n       Mr. Grassley told Mr. Ridge in a letter that he was \n     concerned that illegal aliens were risking their lives and \n     putting their futures in the hands of corrupt alien smugglers \n     in an attempt to gain entry to the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2681-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2681-S2686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SECURING AMERICA'S BORDERS ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my sincerest appreciation for \nthe leadership of Senator John Cornyn as we have attempted in the \nJudiciary Committee--of which we are both members--to try and help \nproduce a bill that will actually work, that will allow legal \nimmigration to be formal, effective, and allow more people to come into \nour country legally while ending the disarray which now exists. He is \nso knowledgeable as a former justice on the Supreme Court of Texas and \nformer attorney general of Texas. He understands it so well, being a \nMember from a State that deals with this in such a consistent and \ncontinuous way. I thank the Senator for his excellent work.\n  One of the aspects that is most troubling to me about the process--as \nit has gone along, I have become even more concerned about it--is that \nit indicates a lack of serious thought about what we are going to do as \na nation to deal with those who are here illegally now. We know there \nare a lot of good\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\npeople here. What are we going to do in the future?\n  Let me report how things went in the Judiciary Committee. We had the \nAlito hearings, we had the Roberts hearings, we had the PATRIOT Act \ndebate, and we had the asbestos debate. We have been as busy as any \ncommittee has ever been on a host of important issues facing our \ncountry all year. It seems as if that is about all I do, and I am on \nthe Armed Services Committee at a time when we are a nation at war. We \nhave a lot of things going on, and we have worked very hard.\n  At the beginning of the process, I expressed concern asked that we \nnot rush the committee into something before it was ready. The majority \nleader set this time for this bill to come to the floor, and he said he \nexpected us to complete a bill if we wanted a Judiciary Committee bill \nto be the vehicle on the floor. So the committee tried to do it. But \nthere was not enough time. We did not give enough thought to it, in my \nview. We met for 6 days in the Judiciary Committee attempting to mark \nup Chairman Specter's immigration legislation, a mark that he put out \nwhich is considerably better, in my view, then what is currently on the \nfloor. His was not acceptable in some ways, but it is better than the \none we produced. He put his mark out for debate in Committee.\n  We began to discuss it. We met on March 2, March 8, March 9, March \n15, 16, and 27. Six days may sound like a lot in the committee process, \nbut this bill is 400 pages involving tremendous national issues which \nmany people feel strongly about and which deserve real discussion.\n  During the first day, we basically just talked about the bill. No \namendments were offered during the markup. During the next 3 days, we \ntalked about the enforcement provisions of the bill and simply accepted \nby unanimous consent noncontroversial amendments to the first two \ntitles of the bill, two of the seven titles. We accepted some \namendments.\n  Then we get to day four. We did not have a single vote on any \namendment during those first four days of hearings. On the fifth day, \nwe once again in committee talked about how best to proceed. No \namendments were offered, and none were voted on.\n  During the 5 days, we did not vote on a single amendment. All the \ncontroversial issues got pushed off to Monday. We are not normally here \non Monday, but we showed up on Monday because the leader said we had to \nhave a bill out Monday night or he would bring up his own bill.\n  During the morning session on Monday, we spent 3\\1/2\\ hours talking \nabout amendments on the enforcement provisions of the bill. We spent a \ngood bit of time on the enforcement provisions and made some progress. \nI got optimistic to the point that I have said if we did just a few \nmore things, we could create an enforcement system that would work. So \nwe spent a little time on enforcement. But we are still now talking \nabout title II of the seven titles in the bill.\n\n  After lunch on Monday of this week, we met for another 3\\1/2\\ hours \nand ran through the remaining five titles, five sections of the bill, \nwith little discussion and less understanding of what the amendments \nwere and what they amounted to. We voted on several amendments without \neven having language to review. In only 3\\1/2\\ hours on Monday, we \nvoted on four amnesty provisions and increased the chairman's mark by \nover 100 pages.\n  Let me make this clear. We spent 5 days talking about the enforcement \nissues with little controversy there. In contrast, we spent 3\\1/2\\ \nhours passing out the massive amnesty provisions in the bill that is \nnow in the Senate that will attempt to legalize and put on an automatic \npath, virtually, to citizenship.\n  We also passed legislation that increases the legal immigration in \nour country by at least double--probably more than that--to 400,000 per \nyear, with little discussion of who and how that should be done. It \njust was offered and passed.\n  I believe this Senate needs to slow down and think about where we \nare. It is very important.\n  Members of this Senate have expressed deep concern that the border \nhas become a major gateway for terrorists to have access to the United \nStates. Senator Feinstein expressed that. Clearly, she is from \nCalifornia. We are pleased to have three Senators--Senator Feinstein \nfrom California, Senator Kyl from Arizona, and Senator Cornyn from \nTexas--who live on the border and know about it and understand it in \nmany ways, far better than the rest of us. I share her concern and \nbelieve it can only be remedied by focusing on fixing our immigration \nsystem as a whole. It is something we can do. This is within our grasp \nat this point, but we are not there yet.\n  Securing our borders and being able to keep track of the people who \ncome in and out of our country is essential to our security. We know \nthat countries without secure immigration policies are a natural fit \nfor bad actors who seek to live anonymously within their borders. A \ncountry that does not protect its borders and does not know the \nidentity of those who come in and out of the country is laying out the \nwelcome mat for criminals and even terrorists.\n  I have visited a number of times with troops and other government \nofficials in Afghanistan. I have had the honor to meet with General \nJones, our commander in Europe, General Abizaid, our commander in \nCentral Command, and they have expressed exceedingly great concern to \nme about unregulated border areas. They have emphasized that there are \na number of places around the globe, border areas of countries that are \nnot very effective countries, in which criminals can gather and nobody \ndoes anything about it. It gets worse and worse, and terrorists nest \nthere. The most dramatic example of that, of course, is this very long \nand very large border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, where many \nthink Osama bin Laden hides out today. Some ask why isn't it possible \nfor us to find him? It is a very large area. It is basically an area \nthat has not been controlled effectively by the Governments of Pakistan \nor Afghanistan, and as a result, it is far more difficult.\n  I just came from there last week and had a briefing on this specific \narea. If anyone heard the briefing I had, there would be a far greater \nunderstanding of how difficult it is to control these areas.\n  A great nation like the United States has to do better. We cannot \nallow that tendency to occur in our country. I believe we can say with \nsome integrity and honesty that tends to be what is happening here on \nour border.\n  Last night, I had an exchange with Senator Kyl in the Senate, and he \ntalked about the increasing number of people who are involved in crime \non the Arizona-Mexico border. Many are not from Mexico. Many are from \nfurther south, from other countries, who come into Mexico, but it is an \narea in which they operate, move drugs, extort, carry people, and it is \nnot a healthy situation at all. It is something a great nation, if we \ncare about the people who want to live here and come into our country \nlegally, should be very concerned about.\n  The United States felt the sharp consequences of open borders and lax \nenforcement when our ineffective immigration policies enabled 19 \nterrorists to obtain visas into the United States on September 11. \nSeptember 11 was not the only act of terrorism on U.S. soil, though, \nthat has resulted from poor immigration policies.\n  Let's talk about the Brooklyn subway plot. People may have forgotten \nthat. Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer was caught by the Border Patrol agents \nthree times while trying to illegally cross the Canadian border. After \na third apprehension, Canada would not take him back. Because the \nUnited States suffers from a severe lack of detention space for illegal \naliens like Mezer, what happened to him? Canada would not take him \nback. He was released into the country on bail with a promise that he \nwould show up for a hearing at which he would be deported. So he wants \nto come to this country, he is apprehended for the third time, Canada \nwill not let him come back, and they release him on a promise that he \nwill show up for a hearing on whether he should be deported. It sounds \nlike, based on those facts, he probably was confident he would be. \nWhile waiting for his hearing, Mezer busied himself by plotting to bomb \nthe Brooklyn subway.\n  Mohammad Salameh, one of the World Trade Center bombing \ncoconspirators in the first World Trade\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\nCenter bombing attempt in 1993--more than an attempt; an explosion that \ndid not bring down the building applied for a tourist visa to the \nUnited States. Although Mohammad Salameh overcame the presumption that \nhe was required to overcome as a single male, young, and received a \nvisa, he overstayed the visa and remained illegally in the United \nStates. We passed amnesty. He applied then to be a permanent resident. \nIt was rejected. Somebody caught it somehow and saw something there. \nWhat did he do? He applies for amnesty under the 1986 act, and they \nreject it. So what does that mean? Was he sent home? No, he just simply \nremained in the United States. Nobody bothered to come and look for \nhim. He continued living and working here because there was no \nenforcement mechanism in place allowing authorities to detain and \nremove rejected green card applicants.\n  Mahmud Abouhalima, a leader of the 1993 trade bombing, was legalized \nas a part of the 1986 amnesty, also. It was only after he was legalized \nthat he was able to travel outside the United States. The trips he took \nafter being granted amnesty included several to Afghanistan and \nPakistan, where he received the training he used in the bombing.\n  Most people who seek to stay in our country are good and decent \npeople. They are not terrorists. We know that. But we have an \nincreasing number of criminals from around the world seeking to enter \nthis country, and we have the terrorist problem.\n  Abounalima took advantage of the amnesty. He got approved. Proper \nbackground checks apparently were not conducted, and he then, as a \npermanent legal resident, green card holder, was free to travel back \nand forth around the world and go to Afghanistan and Pakistan. That is \nwhere he got his training for the 1993 bombing.\n  The mastermind of the 1993 bombing was Ramzi Yousef. He did not waste \ntime applying for a visa to come to the United States. Upon his arrival \nat JFK Airport, he simply applied for asylum, saying he was persecuted. \nThere was a lack of detention space while they were trying to determine \nhis status. They said to this man who illegally appeared at John F. \nKennedy Airport--You are here illegally; we will arrest you. And he \nsays: I claim asylum; I am here because I have been run out of my \ncountry. So he is entitled, now, to a trial or a hearing on that. But \nthey cannot do it that day, and they do not have any place to put him, \nso they release him. They parole him into the country until a hearing \ncan be held on his asylum claim. Yousef then used that time inside the \nUnited States to plan the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Tower.\n\n  Not only have our amnesty, visa issuance, and asylum policies brought \nterrorists into the United States, our programs have also served as a \nconduit for criminals and terrorists.\n  Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, murdered two people at the El Al counter at \nLos Angeles International Airport in July 2002. Less than a year after \n9/11, Hadayet conducted that attack at the airport which resulted in \nthe murder of two people.\n  He received legal status through the diversity lottery visa in this \nfashion: In 2002, Hadayet was a visa overstayer. He got a visa, came \nhere, but he stayed illegally beyond the time he was supposed to stay. \nIn his asylum claim, when they confronted him about it, he claimed that \nhe was entitled to asylum, too. That is a good thing to say because \nthat stops the works. So he claimed asylum. But a hearing was held, and \nthe determination was that he was not entitled to asylum. It was \nrejected.\n  But with no mechanism, no will and no capacity to tell the truth, to \nremove him, he just stayed in the United States with his wife. Then \nHadayet's wife won the diversity visa lottery. She got a green card and \nshe was able to get one for her husband. So both of them were \nlegalized. That is how he got into the country--not a way it should \nhave happened. Once his asylum had been rejected, he should have been \nremoved.\n  Now, we have been reading in the paper about Zacarias Moussaoui, who \njust confessed, apparently, to his intent to participate in the \nSeptember 11 bombings in plane attacks in our country. He entered the \ncountry under the visa waiver program, and he just confessed that he \nwas to fly a plane into the White House.\n  I would like to share a few more things about the ineffectiveness of \nour system. Most of the people who come here are not criminals. Most of \nthe people who come here have legitimate reasons. They ought to wait \nuntil we are able to check their records and verify they are an \nappropriate person to come in our country. That is how the system is \nsupposed to work. But the truth is, we are seeing a larger number of \ncriminals coming in than we ever have before.\n  Criminals from other countries, and those who would commit crimes, \nalso use the immigration system against us.\n  On December of 2005, Secretary Chertoff, the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, testified that the Border Patrol \nencountered 1.1 million illegal aliens attempting to cross the \nsouthwest border between the legitimate ports of entry illegally.\n  Just a few weeks ago, a Department of Homeland Security employee told \nus that approximately 12 percent--12 percent--of the people apprehended \nalready had criminal records. That is 139,000 people. So for those they \napprehended, they did a background check on them, and they found that \n12 percent of those had a criminal record already, totaling 139,000 \npeople.\n  In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security deported over 88,000 \ncriminal aliens. Those removals accounted for over 40 percent of the \npeople who were removed. Now, these are not simple immigration \nviolations. They are serious offenses: fraud, drugs, extortion, or \nviolence.\n  If we catch one criminal entering the country, each year, for every \ncriminal entering the country we do not catch--and some say that is \nabout correct--it is highly likely the United States received a net \ngain, in 2004, of 51,000 criminals, none of whom should have been \nallowed in the country if an appropriate system were operating.\n  A great nation does not have to accept everybody who wants to come. \nNo nation does--not everybody. So we set standards. One of the \nstandards is, people are not allowed in the country who have criminal \nrecords or charges are pending against them.\n  Now, the numbers of criminal aliens in the country is startling, I \nhave to tell you. I wish it were not so, but I am just telling you what \nthe numbers are. Criminal aliens now constitute a large percent of all \nthe Federal prisoners in Federal prisons today. How many? What percent \nwould you suspect? I will have to tell you, it is an astounding 27 \npercent. Twenty-seven percent of the Federal prisoners today are \nillegal aliens, criminal aliens.\n  In 2003, that means 44,000 criminal aliens were serving sentences in \nFederal jails. This is just the Federal jails, which probably represent \n10 percent of all the prisoners in the United States. I believe those \npercentages could be even higher in State and local prisons. And I \nunderstand in some States it may be even higher, like in California and \nothers.\n  An April of 2005 a GAO, Government Accountability Office, report \nfound that the number of criminal aliens incarcerated in the United \nStates increased 15 percent from 2001 to 2004. That is a steady and \nsubstantial increase.\n  According to the Bureau of Prisons, the cost of incarcerating \ncriminal aliens totaled approximately $1.2 billion in 2004.\n  Now, again, I am not saying that we need to reject people and stop \nimmigration and never allow anybody into our country because we are \nhaving an increasing number of people who attempt to come here who are \ncriminals. What I am saying is, we need to make our system work so we \ncan identify those people who have criminal histories and not allow \nthem in and allow the good and decent people in. Isn't that what it is \nall about? It is a very important point.\n  Criminal aliens are also having a severely negative impact at the \nState and local level. Recently, an ICE agent--those are the \nimmigration enforcement officers--in Alabama contacted me to tell me \nthere is an enormous, growing problem with aliens trafficking drugs \nacross north Alabama. Who would think that? He informed me that all of \nthe green card holders he arrests for criminal convictions for \ntrafficking dope were once illegal aliens but have been granted amnesty \nsomewhere along the way.\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\n  To quote him directly, he said--this is what he told me:\n\n       [It is] because they had no respect for the law when they \n     jumped the river, worked illegally, and used fake documents \n     with false names.\n\n  That is what he said. Who can say there is no truth to that? I think \nthere is some truth to that. Simply giving an illegal alien a green \ncard does not suddenly make that person a law-abiding citizen. We need \nto make sure we have ascertained, when a person applies to come into \nour country by visa, or to obtain a green card, that they are law- \nabiding citizens who are going to contribute positively to our country.\n\n  I like to tell my friends in Texas the whole story about Alabama. \nPerhaps Georgia has a spin on it. It probably has a little spin on it, \nI say to the Presiding Officer. But the story was: If somebody got in \ntrouble with the law in Alabama, and you went to their house, they \nwould have ``GTT'' on the door. What did that stand for? ``Gone To \nTexas.'' In the old days, they did not have many prisons, and basically \nif you got out of town, that was fine.\n  I am wondering, sometimes, if people who are getting in trouble in \ntheir home countries are not finding it easier than being arrested and \nput in jail in their own country to just leave town. And if they leave \ntown, maybe the local police and constabularies are happy to have them \ngo and do not mind what happens to them. I am afraid some of that may \nbe occurring here. I suspect in the early days, Georgia sent their \npeople to Alabama, Mr. President. I don't know. Of course, your State \nwas founded--I will not get into that story.\n  The next story from Alabama ICE agents was surprising to me. In \nDecember of last year, in the past few months, they arrested, in the \nnorth Alabama area, a leader of the MS-13 street gang--that is \nbasically an El Salvadorian violent street gang--for possessing a \nstolen firearm. ICE had to release the gang member from custody a \ncouple months later because the judge determined that he derived U.S. \ncitizenship from his father who received amnesty in the 1990s and was \nnaturalized when the gang member was 17. Normally, as a noncitizen, \nbeing charged with this offense, he would be deported.\n  A few weeks ago, just 30 days after being released from custody, the \ngang leader was again arrested, this time for firing eight rounds out \nof a car at a rival gang member in the town of Pelham, AL. Because he \nreceived citizenship through amnesty, Alabama will not see him \ndeported.\n  The guy the gang leader shot at is the area leader of the Brown Pride \n13 street gang, which is another street gang. ICE tells me this gang \nleader is also a once-illegal alien who received amnesty and a green \ncard.\n  Now, we want to give amnesty to the people who deserve it. But we \nneed to create a system that when we do that we have examined them to \nmake sure they are the kind of people who would make good citizens. \nThat is what we tell the American people we are going to do. That is \nwhat we tell them we are going to do. We tell them this bill sets up a \nlawful system for people to apply to immigrate to our country and that \nbefore they are allowed to immigrate and become a citizen, get a \npermanent status to stay here permanently, that we have checked them \nout. I am saying to you, too often we fail to do that. It is a hollow \npromise. ICE, in dealing with this gang leader, must wait for him to be \nconvicted of a crime for him to be arrested.\n  Unlike any of us, these Federal agents are in the trenches every day \nworking hard to enforce the law, of which most of us only hear about on \nthe news. As this ICE agent told me, he gets aggravated that people do \nnot realize that yet another amnesty or allowance for adjustment of \nstatus will only ensure that the Government rubberstamps more criminals \ninto our country and allows them to receive green cards. He is worried \nabout that.\n  I think if we took care and did it right, that might not be the case. \nI believe we can do it. But we have to be fully aware and take \nintentional steps or his prediction will be correct. And based on what \nhe has seen in his experience, I have no doubt that he is somewhat \ncynical about the willingness of our Congress to take the necessary \nsteps to make sure it does not happen.\n  Around the country we are seeing an increase in the number of illegal \ncriminal aliens who are being apprehended, some with access to critical \ninfrastructure and information pertaining to national security \ninterests.\n  Jerry Seper of the Washington Post has written about these issues for \nsome time. I have noted with some interest his accounts that \ndemonstrate the gaping holes in our immigration enforcement and \nsecurity policies. Let's share some examples of what he reported.\n  In May of 2004, John Torres, Deputy Director for Smuggling and Public \nSafety, of ICE, the Immigration Service, testified before the House \nJudiciary Committee that criminal organizations worldwide make over \n$9.5 billion a year smuggling foreign nationals. This is his testimony \nbefore the House Judiciary Committee, the Government official at ICE, \nthat these criminal organizations make over $9.5 billion a year \nsmuggling foreign nationals, illicit drugs, and weapons into the United \nStates.\n  This smuggling includes as many as 17,500 people forced to work as \nprostitutes. We have heard about the sex slave prostitution problem. He \nsays it includes as many as 17,500 sweatshop laborers and domestic \nservants. Mr. Torres testified that these well-established smuggling \nand trafficking pipelines serve as conduits for illegal immigrants and \ncriminals seeking entry into the country. Many of these people are \neasily exploited by terrorists and extremist organizations. It is these \npeople who will be granted amnesty under many of the proposals \ncurrently pending on the floor. This is a prime example of why we must \nfocus on enforcement and border protection before anything else.\n  That is what the House decided to do. People say the House bill is \nharsh. The House bill is not harsh in the sense that it simply examined \nour enforcement procedures and found them totally lacking. They \nconcluded the most honest way to deal with the problem was to confront \nborder laxity and our enforcement mechanisms and get that under \ncontrol. Once we have done that, then we could go to the American \npeople with a plan to determine how many people will come in in the \nfuture, how many people are here, and how to handle those people who \nare here, many of them as fine and decent a people as anybody would \never want to know, working hard every day, contributing to our country. \nWe do owe them fair and humane treatment. I will not support any bill \nthat does not give them that. But the House said, as a first step, \nlet's do that.\n  We spent most of our time in the Judiciary Committee marking up the \nenforcement protections in the bill. But at the last day, this Monday, \nwe dumped in about 100 pages or more of this issue, the more serious \nand complex issue of the people who are here, how to handle them, and \nwho to allow in in the future. That is why we are a bit rushed. As a \nmatter of fact, that bill was not even printed and received by the \ncommittee members. We did not know what the language was until it was \nfinally printed Wednesday night at 8. Now they want us to pass this \nlegislation dealing with the historic challenges in immigration going \nbeyond improving enforcement to the entire philosophy and policy of our \nNation for many years to come. We are not ready to do that. Certainly \nif we are, this bill is not the vehicle to do so.\n  Last year in an isolated incident in Virginia, ICE agents arrested \nnine criminal aliens, six of whom had been previously convicted on \naggravated felony charges, including child molestation, drug \npossession, and sexual assault. These aliens should have been deported \non conviction. That is what the law says. These aliens were identified \nduring an investigation that found they had attempted to obtain \nimmigration benefits through the CIS, the immigration services agency, \nincluding work permits and permanent resident status. These are nine of \nthe estimated 85,000 criminal aliens walking our streets today.\n  Last March, ICE agents deported 37 criminal aliens rounded up in the \nWashington area, two of whom had ties to MS-13, the Salvadoran gang \nwhich operates within the region. This group of criminal aliens were \npeople convicted of theft, assault, burglary, sexual battery, and \nmalicious wounding. From the Washington area alone in\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\n2004, ICE deported 819 criminal aliens. MS-13 has an estimated 2,000 \nmembers in northern Virginia alone. This is not your ordinary street \ngang. It is a malicious, violent gang involving alien and weapons \nsmuggling, murder, robberies, burglaries, carjacking, extortion, rape, \nand aggravated assault.\n  In May of 2005, ICE arrested 60 illegal aliens working as contract \nemployees at a dozen critical U.S. infrastructure sites nationwide, \nincluding seven petrochemical refineries, very much potential targets, \nthree powerplants, a national air cargo facility, and a pipeline \ncompany. What these things demonstrate, when I talk about Alabama or \nnorthern Virginia, is that the system currently is not working. We can \nmake it work. It is not that hard. We are pretty close to getting \nthere. We have jumped 8 feet, but the ravine we need to jump across is \n10 feet wide. Let's go the extra 2 feet. Let's get out there and create \na legitimate enforcement mechanism that will guarantee that we are as \nopen and friendly as we have always been to those who want to come to \nthis country but with a system that does not allow criminals to take \nadvantage of us, does not allow terrorists to take advantage of us. In \nfact, this bill fails to prohibit the entry into our country of \ncriminals in an effective way. That is why Senator Kyl and Senator \nCornyn have offered their amendment dealing with this particular issue. \nIt absolutely needs to be a part of it. I was pleased that Senator \nCornyn talked about the similarity between the bill we are moving today \nand the one we passed in 1986, which everybody agreed was amnesty. \nBlack's Law Dictionary even defines amnesty by referring to the 1986 \nbill in their definition. Everybody admitted in 1986, it was amnesty. \nPeople have said we are not for amnesty. We have campaigned on it. \nVirtually every Senator, every leader, even the President has said we \nare not for amnesty. But anything you try to do, they say: That is not \namnesty.\n  Is it not an automatic path to a green card and citizenship? Why \nisn't it automatic? Well, they have to pay $1,000. They have to pay \ntheir income taxes. Don't you have to pay your income taxes? What is \nthis? You have to have a job. What do they come here for? To have a \njob. And then only the most part-time job with the most minimal proof \nwould establish the work requirement. Basically it guarantees anybody \nhere a path to citizenship as long as they don't get convicted of a \nfelony. If you get convicted of a felony before you are deported today, \nthe chances are very good you can maneuver your way out on bail and \nnever be deported.\n  A good system would take a person directly from the incarceration \nfacility and move them directly out of the country. That is what we say \nwe are going to do, but we don't.\n\n  I have many more examples of situations in which we have not managed \nour immigration system well. As a result, illegal aliens have been \ncaught working in nuclear plants and military bases in highly secret \nand sensitive areas of our country. We can do better than that. We \nabsolutely can and we must do better than that.\n  I join with my colleagues Senators Kyl and Cornyn in saying: We \ndefinitely need to fix this omission in the bill that came out of \ncommittee that fails to properly deal with those who would come into \nthe country illegally who have a criminal record and who could be put \non a path to amnesty if we don't work it correctly.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's keep an open mind on the legislation. \nLet's remember that our Nation has some of the finest people you could \never want living and working here, but we need to deal with them fairly \nand humanely. We don't need to build a barrier around our country if it \ndoes not allow people to come here lawfully. We are a nation of \nimmigrants and we always will and should welcome immigrants into the \ncountry, but we need to gain control of our borders. That includes \nphysical barriers, virtual fences, improved enforcement, additional \ndetention space, technology, and also workplace areas. If we eliminate \nthe magnet of the workplace, if we take firm, effective steps on the \nborder, we can reach that tipping point where people move from coming \nillegally into our country and we don't know then whether they are \ncriminals. We move those people from the illegal path to entry into our \ncountry to a legal path. Isn't that what we want? Isn't that what we \npromised the American people time and again, when we have been asked \nabout it in our States and on interview programs? We have all said \nthat.\n  The legislation before us won't get us there. If we vote for that and \ntell our people that it will do the job, I do not believe we will be \ncorrect. Let's fix it. Let's improve it. Then we can make it work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3215\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3215 and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3215.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To demonstrate respect for legal immigration by prohibiting \n   the implementation of a new alien guest worker program until the \n   Secretary of Homeland Security certifies to the President and the \n Congress that the borders of the United States are reasonably sealed \n                              and secured)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. BORDER SECURITY CERTIFICATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning on \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary may not \n     implement a new conditional nonimmigrant work authorization \n     program that grants legal status to any individual who \n     illegally enters or entered the United States, or any similar \n     or subsequent employment program that grants legal status to \n     any individual who illegally enters or entered the United \n     States until the Secretary provides written certification to \n     the President and the Congress that the borders of the United \n     States are reasonably sealed and secured.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, yesterday I took the floor to speak at \nlength about the legislation before us and to talk particularly about \nthe history of amnesty in the past dealing with immigration. I talked \nabout the dangerous step we would take if we created another \nopportunity to attract even more to come here without first having \nsecured our borders. The amendment I have asked to be placed before the \nSenate today accepts a very simple premise, and that is that we have \nfailed as a country to secure our borders. We continue to have those \ncoming here illegally to work because it is easier than coming here \nlegally. And until we stop that and shut that down, any program \ngranting status to an illegal person in this country should never be \nimplemented.\n  In the insurance industry, swimming pools are entitled an attractive \nnuisance. In the business of immigration, American policy is an \nattractive nuisance. We are attracting people to come here the wrong \nway. We are not penalizing them for coming here the wrong way. And we \nare now allowing people to come here the right way, a seamless system \nthat seems to work. So this amendment is merely a trigger. It says that \nnotwithstanding what programs we adopt in the Senate before final \npassage, no program granting status to someone who is here illegally or \nmay come here illegally in the future will take effect until the \nSecretary of Homeland Security has certified to the President of the \nUnited States and to the Congress that our borders are reasonably \nsecure.\n  I am not going to take a lot of time, but I want to repeat something \nI said yesterday: A month ago I took to the\n\n[[Page S2686]]\n\nborder myself along with Senator Coleman.\n  We went to Tijuana and San Diego, Fort Huachuca in Arizona. We saw \nfirsthand the mechanisms that are available and being used today that \nwill secure our border. We also saw firsthand the huge holes because we \nhave neither funded the intelligence equipment and the eyes in the sky \nnor put the manpower on the border.\n  I, for one, will hold myself responsible and will be a reminder to \nthis entire Senate that when we pass an appropriations act this year \nfor Homeland Security and enforcement of immigration and customs, if it \ndoesn't include the unmanned aerial vehicles we need on the border and \nthe agents we need to enforce immigration law, then we are turning our \nback on a problem that began in 1986 and has continued until this day, \nand that is the benign neglect of us to fund the necessary equipment, \nmanpower, and material to make the laws of this country work to allow \npeople to come here in the right way as easily as possible but with \naccountability, and the people who come here the wrong way, to know \nthere is a consequence to pay.\n  Human nature is human nature. People will respond when they know what \nthe story is. Right now, they know the story is that it is easier to \nget here by sneaking in. In this measure, we send a signal that there \nwill be no amnesty, no more free pass nor a continued flow of illegal \npeople coming into this country. Instead, there will be consequences \nfor ignoring the law, and there will be respect and appreciation for a \nnormal, rational immigration process to work, so that America's labor \nneeds are met, but America respects the borders between ourselves, the \nnation of Canada and the nation of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nSenator's view that we need to certify that we have the enforcement \nsystem working for the immigration system before we make these other \nchanges that allow people to be given amnesty or be given a right to \nstay here in some lawful way.\n  The reason that is important is this: To boil it down in 1 minute \nbefore I yield the floor, the reason that is important is that once we \npass the policies--the amnesty that is in this bill, or whatever \npolicies we eventually pass--to deal with new immigration for years to \ncome or to deal with those already here, that becomes law then. The \nproblem has been that no President whom I know of--Presidents Carter, \nReagan, Bush, Clinton, or Bush--has ever taken it as a personal \ninterest to ensure that what happens on our borders actually works. So \nthey have not asked for more money, more people or asked sufficiently \nfor technology for it to work. And the Congress, as the Senator said, \noften doesn't fund it.\n  So what are we saying? Fundamentally, what happened in 1986, I \nbelieve, was that amnesty was granted and the promise to create a legal \nsystem in the future never developed. We have a very rightful \nresponsibility to make sure that doesn't happen again. I think that is \nthe intent of the Senator's amendment. I look forward to studying it, \nand I thank him for offering it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Marcelle and I have been privileged to know both Senator and \nMrs. Byrd for well over 30 years.\n  While there, we talked with the distinguished senior citizen from \nWest Virginia and told him how much that relationship meant, but \nespecially how much it meant to us to see a love affair such as theirs, \none that continued from the time they were teenagers to the time of \nMrs. Byrd's death.\n  Mrs. Byrd and my wife used to sometimes drive down together for \nSenate spouse meetings. Every time Marcelle would come back, she would \ntell me something new and valuable she had learned from Erma and how \nmuch that friendship meant.\n  In recent times, when illness stopped her ability to come here, I \nwould talk with my good friend Robert Byrd and ask him how Erma was \ndoing and to tell him that both she and Robert were in our prayers and \nour thoughts.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of a \ngood friend of mine and a distinguished public servant, Secretary of \nInterior Gale Norton. Today is her final day as Secretary of Interior. \nI am certain that her presence in that position will be missed.\n  Secretary Norton hails from my home State of Colorado where she built \na reputation as a hardworking conservationist and public servant. In \nColorado she served as the State's attorney general where she \nrepresented the State before the Supreme Court on several occasions. \nBut arguing cases before the Supreme Court wasn't challenging enough \nfor Gale, so when asked by President Bush to be the first female to \nhead the Department of Interior she wholeheartedly agreed.\n  Throughout her time at Interior she employed a commonsense approach \nand an understanding of Western issues which has proven to be an asset \nto the agency and the Nation. It is vital to have someone who \nappreciates Western issues as Secretary of Interior. This understanding \nis so crucial because, on average, 52 percent of the land mass in the \n13 Western States is federally owned, while the average for the rest of \nthe Nation is 4 percent.\n  Secretary Norton has guided Interior through one of the most \nchallenging periods in the Department's history with an enthusiasm, \nconfidence, and expertise that will be difficult to match.\n  She saw the Department through some of the most devastating fire \nseasons in recent history, and in response\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\nto this was charged with implementing one of the most important natural \nresource laws ever enacted, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. The \nbenefits of this legislation and her actions are already being seen on \nthe ground on public land throughout the Nation.\n  Secretary Norton also recognized the importance of domestic energy \nproduction before many others; her legacy will help decrease our \ndependence on foreign energy sources. This understanding of energy \nneeds was priceless as she worked with Congress on the most \ncomprehensive energy reform legislation in decades.\n  She also worked tirelessly to improve the efficiency of DOI, reducing \nduplicative measures and cutting bureaucracy while improving citizen \nsatisfaction with the Department.\n  She excelled at pushing issues on a national level, but was also \ninstrumental in several projects which are closer to my heart as they \nare located in Colorado.\n  Secretary Norton helped with the creation of our Nation's newest \nnational park, The Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado. She also \nhelped to create the largest Wildlife Refuge in Colorado, the 92,500 \nacre Baca National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Secretary Norton worked to help take the Rocky Mountain Arsenal and \nRocky Flats and transform them from national defense sites to wildlife \nrefuges.\n  As Gale steps down I am somewhat saddened. Her moving on signals the \nclosing of one of the most productive chapters in the Department of \nInterior's history. But I am excited to see what new endeavors she will \ntake on. In these new adventures I have no doubt that she will meet \nchallenges head on and find the same success that she has seen as \nSecretary of Interior. I wish Secretary Norton all of the best in her \nnew adventures.

Mr. President, unfortunately the U.S. Congress is not \naddressing the issue of gun violence prevention, and several States \nhave enacted laws which have made communities, and especially the \nchildren who live in them, less safe. Earlier this month, the Brady \nCampaign to Prevent Gun Violence released its 9th annual Report Card on \nState Gun Violence Prevention Laws and highlighted the inadequacy of \nmany state laws relating to gun safety.\n  Each year, the Brady Campaign report assigns individual states a \ngrade of ``A'' through ``F'' on seven types of gun safety laws that \nprotect children from gun violence. The Brady Campaign includes in its \nanalysis such questions as: Is it illegal for a child to possess a gun \nwithout supervision? Is it illegal to sell a gun to a child? Are gun \nowners held responsible for leaving loaded guns easily accessible to \nchildren? Are guns required to have child-safety locks, loaded-chamber \nindicators and other childproof designs? Do cities and counties have \nauthority to enact local gun safety laws? Are background checks \nrequired at gun shows? And, is it legal to carry concealed handguns in \npublic?\n  The grades assigned by the Brady Campaign show that State gun laws \naround the country continue to fall well short of what is needed to \nadequately protect children from gun violence. While six States \nreceived an ``A,'' unchanged from last year, 32 states received a grade \nof ``D'' or ``F,'' an increase of one. Only one State improved its \ngrade from last year, while three others took actions that will make \ncommunities less safe from the threat of gun violence.\n  The Brady Campaign notes a few positive developments in State \nlegislatures, including the consideration of state-level assault \nweapons bans by at least four states. Despite bipartisan support for \nits reauthorization, the 1994 Federal assault weapons ban was allowed \nto expire in 2004 due to inaction by the President and Republican \nleadership in the Congress.\n  Fortunately, the lack of Federal leadership on the assault weapons \nban and several other gun safety issues has not discouraged citizens \nfrom working within their own communities and urging State legislatures \nto address the problems associated with gun violence. The Brady \nCampaign specifically recognized the importance of gun violence \nprevention advocates and leaders in several major cities, including \nDetroit, for their grassroots efforts. These efforts by local community \nleaders are needed now more than ever. Congress should take up and pass \ncommonsense gun safety legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the \nassault weapons ban and help keep other dangerous firearms out of the \nhands of criminals and children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2687-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2687-S2688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WOMEN: BUILDERS OF COMMUNITIES AND DREAMS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Women's \nHistory Month during which we as a Nation reflect on the momentous \ncontributions women have made over the course of American history. \nThroughout our history, women have played vital roles that have helped \ninitiate and guide important social, economic and political change, \nwhich has helped to solidify the greatness and prosperity of this \nNation. I also want to, in turn, acknowledge that, while great strides \nhave been made, there are still many barriers to equality that must be \novercome.\n  This year's theme for Women's History Month is Women: Builders of \nCommunities and Dreams. This theme recognizes the efforts of women in \nlaying the foundation for greater equality and in building and \nbuttressing movements that have resulted in profound change.\n  Of course, the foundation of all of our lives begins with our own \ncommunities, homes and families. We must not forget to honor the \ncontributions of the women closest to us in their roles as mothers, \ngrandmothers, wives, sisters, daughters, friends, and mentors--who \ntransform and nurture us on a daily basis. As mothers and grandmothers, \nwomen spend each and every day building healthy, educated, productive, \nand happy families.\n  Building families goes hand in hand with building communities and a \nbetter society as a whole. Women have been at the forefront of this \nNation's major social movements. One example is Anne Hutchinson, who in \n1637 was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony because her beliefs \nran contrary to Puritan teachings. Her courageous stand in the face of \npersecution helped lay the groundwork for religious freedom as a right. \nEven when their own rights were severely restricted, women rose up to \nfight for the rights of others. During the abolitionist movement, the \nsocial reform movement, the labor movement, and the civil rights \nmovement, women emerged as leaders in the drive to make our society \nfairer and better for all Americans. During the civil rights movement, \ncourageous women such as Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and Ella Baker \nhelped break down the walls of racism and ensure that equal justice was \nhad by all regardless of the color of their skin.\n  The State of Maryland has a rich history of such leaders, including \nHarriet Tubman, who courageously led a shackled people to freedom via \nthe Underground Railroad; Margaret Brent, who became America's first \nwoman lawyer and landholder; and Clara Barton, founder and first \npresident of the American Red Cross. Likewise, equality in the field of \nmedicine was facilitated with the aid of Mary Elizabeth Garret and \nMartha Carey Thomas, whose financial support led to the establishment \nof the Johns Hopkins Medical School, after it was promised that women \nwould not be excluded from admission. We in Maryland are particularly \nproud of Senator Barbara Mikulski who is Maryland's first female \nSenator and has served longer than any other woman currently in the \nSenate. In fact, it was Senator Mikulski who sponsored legislation \nestablishing National Women's History Week, the precursor to Woman's \nHistory Month, in 1981. Maryland is also the birthplace of another \ndistinguished public servant, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, \nwhose historic political career took root in the State of Maryland. \nLeader Pelosi, who hails from a legendary political family in \nBaltimore, is the first woman in our Nation's history to lead a major \npolitical party in Congress. And, in 2006, Maryland leads the country \nin the number of women serving in the State legislature.\n  Over the last 50 years, more women have entered the workforce and \nattained rights previously unavailable.\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\nBut this does not mean that, as a Nation, we have erased the adversity \nand discrimination that continues to stifle equality. According to the \nU.S. Census, women who work full time, year-round, earned 76 cents for \nevery dollar their male counterparts earned. Gaps in health care \ncoverage affect millions of Americans and women, especially those \nliving in poverty, face significant barriers to receiving care. Access \nto preventative measures unique to ensuring a woman's health, such as \nscreenings for breast and cervical cancer, has been harder to achieve \nin recent years and participation rates for such screenings have \ndeclined since 2001. Such inequalities are very troubling, and we must \ncontinue to work to ensure that these disparities are eradicated for \nthe sake of future generations.\n  It is a privilege to commemorate and appreciate the women who have \nmade an indelible impact on our lives and the history of this country. \nI encourage my colleagues to take Women's History Month as a time to \nreflect on the contributions of women, but also as a time to redouble \nour efforts to ensure that these achievements are retained and to work \ntoward the goal of full equality.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Women's \nHistory Month. As one of the 14 women in the United States Senate, I \nconsider this tribute of the highest importance. This year's theme for \nthe month is ``Women: Builders of Communities and Dreams.'' There is no \nbetter time to salute the work women around the world have done at home \nand abroad to empower communities.\n  I am proud to come from the State where Women's History Month was \nconceived in 1978. Almost 30 years ago, the education task force of the \nSonoma County Commission on the Status of Women in California first \nestablished Women's History Week in recognition of the achievements of \nwomen. This was soon expanded into a month-long celebration, realizing \nthe dream of honoring women in a special way each year.\n  Women's History Month recognizes those who continually strive for \ngreatness. One that comes to mind is Mary Helen Rogers, who passed away \nearlier this month. She dedicated her life to protecting African \nAmerican families in San Francisco from urban displacement. While \nraising 12 children, she became an expert in housing laws. She helped \nstart the Western Addition Community Organization, which forced the \ncity to assist the residents it displaced. She later went on to serve \nas the San Francisco Housing Authority's community relations manager. \nMary Helen Rogers demonstrated through her life's work the importance \nof community activism and the power of an individual to inspire action \nin those around her.\n  Just last month we lost another very special woman--Dana Reeve, the \nwidow of actor Christopher Reeve. Her commitment to spinal cord injury \nresearch and loving dedication to her husband was unmatched. Since \nChris' death, she carried his spirit with her in her drive to push \nCongress to expand embryonic stem cell research. Dana was the face of \nthe fight on behalf of patients across the country with spinal cord \ninjury, Parkinson's, juvenile diabetes and countless other illnesses. \nHer passing should serve as call for expansion of embryonic stem cell \nresearch. Mrs. Reeve's steadfast loyalty and compassionate care serves \nas an example to all women. She will be missed.\n  In Los Angeles, ``Sweet'' Alice Harris has been a leader in her \ncommunity for over 40 years. Her steadfast commitment to the community \nthrough parent organizations, emergency relief, and youth programs, has \nmade her an example of true community leadership.\n  As American women, we share a common history: It is a history of \nfighting for many of the rights and opportunities for which today's \nyoung women will prosper. We have come a long way from the days when \nwomen had no right to vote, no right to own property, and had extremely \nlimited inheritance or child custody rights.\n  It wasn't until the Women's Property Act of 1839 that women gained \nland entitlement. The women's suffrage movement began in 1848; however \nthe 19th amendment, granting women the right to vote, did not come to \npass until 72 long years later, in 1920. It is a right for which our \npredecessors worked hard for. We owe it to them to fulfill our civic \nduty.\n  Today, American women are active in every sphere of our society. We \nhave made our mark in this country's private and public sectors. Over \n65 million women are a part of the American workforce. There are over \n10 million woman-owned businesses. Women represent our Nation around \nthe world. Many proudly wear our Nation's uniform.\n  Much has changed for over the past century. But make no mistake; much \nmore needs to be done. We must provide improved health care and \neducational and workforce support for our Nation's women. We need to \neliminate violence against women. We need to ensure that women continue \nto have the right to choose and autonomy over their bodies.\n  Violence against women is intolerable. Every 15 seconds a woman is \nbattered, and each day four women die from domestic violence. Women \nshould not be threatened by fear and violence. This is why the Violence \nAgainst Women Act reauthorization is such an important piece of \nlegislation.\n  We also need to improve healthcare in our Nation. Breast cancer \ncontinues to be a serious threat to women in this country. One out of \nseven American women will develop the disease, and nearly 41,000 will \ndie from it this year. We must commit ourselves to finding a cure for \nthis disease which affects women regardless of race, class, or \nreligion.\n  As the sponsor of the breast cancer research stamp, I am proud to say \nthat since its inception in 1998, the stamp has helped raise nearly $50 \nmillion. These funds go a long way to help fund research and increase \npublic awareness for this devastating disease. I am also supporting the \nNational Institute of Health and National Cancer Institute legislative \nefforts to ensure that women undergoing mastectomy and lumpectomy \nsurgeries are protected during their hospital stays. By continuing to \nprioritize investment in research, it is my hope that we can reach the \ngoal of eradicating breast cancer by 2015.\n  Pregnant women must be provided with access to clinical care and \nparenting support. The U.S. infant mortality rate is 35th in the world. \nWe must change this. Providing mothers with proper nutrition and \nhealthy lifestyle education is key to combating preventable illnesses \nand deaths in mothers and children. Additionally, women are balancing \ncareers with families more than ever, creating the need for affordable, \nquality childcare options.\n  Women are also in the midst of the war in Iraq, and we need to honor \nthese women fighting to protect this country and for the dreams of \nthose women who have been oppressed in Iraq and Afghanistan for too \nlong.\n  Women began enlisting in the military at the start of World War I. \nToday women are serving in Iraq in record numbers. Women in the armed \nservices make up 15 percent of active duty personnel. There have been \nnearly 2,000 California female deployments since 9/11. They do jobs \nthat range from intelligence officers to doctors, to ground soldiers.\n  In Louisiana, Hurricane Katrina swept communities away in an instant. \nIn the areas hardest hit by Katrina, 56 percent of families are headed \nby women, who are now taking the lead role in rebuilding the homes and \nlives their families and neighbors once knew. They deserve our help and \nsupport. It is only through their efforts that communities in New \nOrleans can thrive once again.\n  I salute the women leading the way in building stronger communities \nin California and across the Nation. They continue to lead and inspire \nus all. It is through their tenacity, strength, and passion that we see \nthe transformation of dreams into realities. I have great hope for \nfuture generations of women, but we must protect and expand the \ncherished rights of today's women, so that they may continue to serve \ntheir communities and realize their dreams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2688-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2688-S2689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        THE PASSING OF JOE TECCE\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncelebrate the life of a great American, a Boston institution, and a \npersonal friend. Earlier\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\nthis month the legendary restaurateur Joe Tecce passed away, and with \nhis death at age 94 a colorful chapter of Boston's history came to a \nclose.\n  Joe's journey in the hospitality business started with a pushcart \nselling fruit on the North End's Salem Street at age 14, and due to his \nfather's death years earlier, that job would constitute much of the \nfamily income. His trademark perseverance and business sense allowed \nhim to open the Bella Napoli pizzeria in 1947. This 30 seat restaurant \nwould host the first of countless guests, from all walks of life and \nfrom all over the world, who would make an evening special by sitting \nat one of Joe's coveted tables.\n  Once formally established on North Washington Street, Joe Tecce's \nRistorante, or what regulars simply called ``Tecce's'', became a \nfavorite of Bostonians, tourists from around the world, and celebrities \nof every stripe for more than 40 years. His reputation grew as his \nbusiness and family did, and for Joe the two were almost inseparable. \nIn addition to his traditional culinary skills, Joe became a host of \nsuch generosity and grace that he became an ambassador for the city \nitself. Standing at the door of Tecce's, often with his trademark wide-\nbrimmed felt hat, Joe would greet everyone from Elizabeth Taylor and \nNancy Reagan, to Frank Sinatra and Al Pacino, as well as luminaries \nfrom the worlds of sports such as Bobby Orr, Reggie Jackson and Larry \nBird. His love of boxing not only attracted Rocky Marciano and Marvin \nHagler to visit, it actually resulted in Joe being named to the Boxing \nCommission by then-Governor Ed King.\n  To walk into Tecce's was to walk into his home, and as you took your \nseat you could look around and see generations of Joe's family, sons \nand cousins, pushing forward the legacy he started with his fruit cart \nover 60 years earlier. For me and my family, no trip to the Boston \nGarden for a Celtics or Bruins game would be complete without starting \nthe evening at Tecce's, and over the many years I knew Joe it became \ncustomary for my friends to gather there before a political event or a \nnight at the theater.\n  Joe Tecce loved his family, his neighbors, and the North End and its \ntraditions. But it was with his restaurant that he wove together all \nthree and throughout the course of his career they became one. His \nlegacy of generosity and hospitality leaves the city of Boston a better \nplace, and it is with a heavy heart that I join his countless friends \nand beloved family in honoring his time with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2689-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER MARK S.

A bill to ensure an abundant and affordable supply of highly \nnutritious fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops for American \nconsumers and international markets by enhancing the competitiveness of \nUnited States-grown specialty crops; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Specialty \nCrop Competition Act of 2006.'' This bipartisan legislation co-\nsponsored by the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, \nincreases the focus on the contribution that specialty crops add to the \nU.S. agricultural economy. This bill specifically provides the proper \nand necessary attention to many challenges faced throughout each \nsegment of the industry.\n  Most do not realize the significance of specialty crops and their \nvalue to the U.S. economy and the health of U.S. citizens. According to \nthe United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, \nfruits and vegetables alone added $29.9 billion to the U.S. economy in \n2002. This figure does not even include the contribution of nursery and \nother ornamental plant production, which our bill recognizes.\n  The specialty crop industry also accounts for more than $53 billion \nin cash receipts for U.S. producers, which is close to 54 percent of \nthe total cash receipts for all crops. A surprising fact to some is \nthat my State of Idaho is a top producer of specialty crops. Idaho \nproudly boasts production of cherries, table grapes, apples, onions, \ncarrots, several varieties of seed crops and of course one of our most \nnotable specialty crops, potatoes.\n  Maintaining a viable and sustainable specialty crop industry also \nbenefits the health of America's citizens. Obesity continues to plague \nmillions of people today and is a very serious and deepening threat not \nonly to personal health and well-being, but to the resources of the \neconomy as well. This issue is now receiving the necessary attention at \nthe highest levels, and specialty crops will continue to play a \nprominent role in reversing the obesity trend.\n  The ``Specialty Crop Competition Act'' will also provide a stronger \nposition for the U.S. industry in the global market arena. This \nlegislation promotes initiatives that will combat diseases both native \nand foreign that continue to be used as non-tariff barriers to U.S. \nexports by foreign governments. Additionally, provisions in this bill \nseek improvements to federal regulations and resources that impede \ntimely consideration of industry sanitary and phytosanitary petitions.\n  This bill does not provide direct subsidies to producers like other \nprograms. This legislation takes a major step forward to highlight the \nsignificance of this industry to the agriculture economy, the benefits \nto the health of U.S. citizens, and the need for a stable, affordable, \ndiverse, and secure supply of food.\n  Although we near the end of the 109th Congress, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues and the Administration to consider this \ncomprehensive and necessary legislation as we begin to discuss new \ninitiatives for the 2007 Farm Bill.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nIdaho, Senator Craig, in introducing the Specialty Crops Competition \nAct of 2006. I want to thank Senator Craig for his continued leadership \non specialty crop issues. We have worked together for a number of years \non legislation to promote American fruit and vegetable production and \nconsumption of high quality, nutritious American-grown produce and this \nlegislation is the next step in that process.\n  Michigan is a State that makes things and grows thing. We are famous \nfor our automobiles, and we are also known for our cherries, apples, \nblueberries, and asparagus. I am proud to represent a State that is \nrich in diverse agricultural production. In fact, Michigan is second \nonly to California in the variety of crops that we grow. Furthermore, \nagriculture is one of the lynchpins of Michigan's economy. Our farms \ncontribute $37 billion annually to the State economy and provide more \nthan half a million good jobs. Our specialty crops alone generate \nnearly $1.3 billion every year.\n  For far too long, specialty crops have been ignored by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. Specialty crops account for 51 percent of \ntotal national farm receipts but they do not receive the same subsidies \nor USDA consideration as program crops.\n  I want to clarify that the Craig-Stabenow bill is in no way designed \nto take funding away from program crops, but rather to bring specialty \ncrops up to the status of program crops. All of our farmers work hard \nand take a gamble every year to produce and receive a return on their \ncrops. They gamble against heat, drought, frost, storms, pests, crop \ndiseases, and most recently a flood of foreign produce to our markets. \nThe Specialty Crops Competition Act of 2006 would give specialty crop \nfarmers valuable tools to keep them competitive and productive in a \nglobal marketplace.\n  Our bill creates a specialty crop block grant to State departments of \nagriculture at a level of $200 million annually in grants for fiscal \nyears 2007-2009. The grants will support production-related research, \ncommodity production, nutrition, food safety and inspection and other \ncompetitiveness enhancing programs. Each State will receive a minimum \nof $3 million each year, and a cap of $15 million annually per State is \nset to ensure funds for a competitive grant program, for which grower \nassociations and others can apply. Our bill also fixes a longstanding \nmisinterpretation of the Tree Assistance Program by ensuring that \nfarmers who have lost trees and vines due to disasters or disease are \neligible\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\nfor assistance of up to $75,000 per year and not $75,000 maximum over \nthe life of the farm bill.\n  Our bill also increases Federal purchases of fruits and vegetables \nfor use on nutrition programs, such as the Commodity Food Supplemental \nAssistance Program. I have been a longtime supporter of nutrition \nprograms because they are a win for farmers and a win for the most \nvulnerable of our citizens--children, seniors, and the poor. Specialty \ncrop farmers benefit by having a market to which to sell their fruits \nand vegetables. And children, seniors, and those with low incomes \nreceive healthy and balanced meals. One of the key provisions of the \nCraig-Stabenow bill is the correction of USDA's chronic \nmisinterpretation of section 10603 of the 2002 farm bill. This section \ninstructs USDA to purchase at least $200 million of fruits and \nvegetables annually over and above the purchases they currently make. \nUnfortunately, USDA is not complying with this provision. Instead of \nadding the $200 million on top of baseline spending for school lunch \nand senior programs, USDA has eliminated the baseline spending so there \nis no guarantee of any new spending on fruits and vegetables for our \nchildren. In fact, in 2002 USDA did not even meet the minimum purchase \nrequirement; only $181 million in fresh fruits and vegetables were \npurchased. The Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act will correct this \ndiscrepancy and provide our Nation's children with much needed fruits \nand vegetables.\n  In addition, the Specialty Crops Competition Act improves growers' \naccess to foreign markets by requiring the Animal Plant Health \nInspection Service, APHIS, to create a division to handle industry \npetitions on sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to specialty crop \nexports, increase technical assistance funding for specialty crops, and \nstudy the effects of recent trade agreements and propose a strategy for \nspecialty crop producers to more effectively benefit from international \ntrade opportunities.\n  I am pleased to offer the Specialty Crops Competition Act of 2006 \nwith Senator Craig. This is just one more step in ensuring the future \nof specialty crop production in the United States. As the Senate begins \nwork on reauthorization of the farm bill, Senator Craig and I will \ncontinue to work with specialty crop farmers and growers' associations \nto improve and expand this legislation. Supporting American specialty \ncrop growers and providing nutritious fruits and vegetables to American \npeople is vital to ensuring our own health and the health of our \neconomy. I hope that my colleagues will join me and support the \nSpecialty Crops Competition Act of 2006.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2691-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 416--RECOGNIZING THE VICTIMS OF HURRICANE RITA 6 \n MONTHS AFTER THE DISASTER, COMMENDING THE RESILIENCY OF THE PEOPLE OE \n  SOUTHWEST LOUISIANA AND SOUTHEAST TEXAS, AND COMMITTING TO STAND BY \n              THEM IN THEIR RELIEF AND REBUILDING EFFORTS\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. Hutchison, and Ms. \nLandrieu) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 418\n\n       Whereas there are 20,000,000 children under the age of 5 in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas numerous studies, including the Abecedarian Study, \n     the Study of the Chicago Child-Parent Center, and the High/\n     Scope Perry Preschool Study, indicate that low-income \n     children who have enrolled in quality, comprehensive early \n     childhood education programs--\n       (1) improve their cognitive, language, physical, social, \n     and emotional development; and\n       (2) are less likely to--\n       (A) be placed in special education;\n       (B) drop out of school; or\n       (C) engage in juvenile delinquency;\n       Whereas the enrollment rates of children under the age of 5 \n     in early childhood education programs have steadily increased \n     since 1965 with--\n       (1) the creation of the Head Start program carried out \n     under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.);\n       (2) the establishment of the Early Head Start program \n     carried out under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et \n     seq.); and\n       (3) the enactment of the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.);\n       Whereas many children eligible for, and in need of, quality \n     early childhood education services are not served due to \n     inadequate funding;\n       Whereas over 4,000,000 children under the age of 5 live in \n     poverty;\n       Whereas only about \\1/2\\ of all preschoolers who are \n     eligible to participate in Head Start programs have the \n     opportunity to do so, and even fewer eligible babies and \n     toddlers receive the opportunity to participate in Early Head \n     Start;\n       Whereas only about 1 out of every 7 eligible children \n     receives an amount of child care assistance sufficient to--\n       (1) enable the parents of the child to continue working; \n     and\n       (2) provide the child with safe and nurturing early \n     childhood care and education;\n       Whereas, although State and local governments have \n     responded to the numerous benefits of early childhood \n     education by making significant investments in programs and \n     classrooms, there remains--\n       (1) a large unmet need for those services; and\n       (2) a need to improve the quality of those programs; and\n       Whereas, according to numerous studies on the impact of \n     investments in high-quality early childhood education, the \n     programs yield to the public a return of 4 dollars to 13 \n     dollars for each dollar invested: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning April 2, 2006, as ``Week \n     of the Young Child'';\n       (2) encourages the citizens of the United States to \n     celebrate--\n       (A) young children; and\n       (B) the citizens who provide care and early childhood \n     education to the young children of the United States; and\n       (3) urges the citizens of the United States to recognize \n     the importance of--\n       (A) quality, comprehensive early childhood education \n     programs; and\n       (B) the value of those services for preparing children to--\n       (i) appreciate future educational experiences; and\n       (ii) enjoy lifelong success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2692-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2692-S2693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 419--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE NEW \n  UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL FAILS TO ADEQUATELY REFORM THE \n UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THUS PREVENTING THAT BODY \nFROM BECOMING AN EFFECTIVE MONITOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 419\n\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on Human Rights was \n     created in 1946 to monitor and prevent the abuse of human \n     rights throughout the world;\n       Whereas, since its creation in 1946, the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights failed to consistently uphold the \n     ideals contained in--\n       (1) the United Nations Charter; and\n       (2) the Universal Declaration on Human Rights;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on Human Rights had \n     been particularly ineffective because the membership of the \n     commission included some of the worst abusers of human rights \n     in the world, including--\n       (1) Cuba;\n       (2) Sudan;\n       (3) Libya;\n       (4) Belarus;\n       (5) China; and\n       (6) Zimbabwe;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on Human Rights \n     failed to act or speak out against numerous cases of \n     egregious human rights abuses, including--\n       (1) the many abuses of communism;\n       (2) the genocide in Rwanda in 1994; and\n       (3) the ongoing genocide in Darfur caused by the Government \n     of Sudan;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on Human Rights \n     failed to condemn countries that sponsor terrorism, \n     including--\n       (1) Iran;\n       (2) Syria; and\n       (3) North Korea;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on Human Rights had \n     repeatedly singled out Israel, the only democracy in the \n     Middle East, for criticism, while overlooking serious human \n     rights abuses throughout that region of the world;\n       Whereas President Bush and the United Nations Secretary-\n     General, Kofi Annan, have repeatedly emphasized that \n     meaningful reform of the United Nations Commission on Human \n     Rights is a key element for making the United Nations more \n     accountable, effective, and efficient;\n       Whereas the creation of the new Human Rights Council on \n     March 15, 2006, failed to address the serious shortcomings of \n     the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and fell far \n     short of creating the small standing body composed of \n     appropriate countries that was initially envisioned by the \n     United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, in his March \n     2005 report, ``In Larger Freedom: Towards Development, \n     Security and Human Rights For All'';\n       Whereas the new United Nations Human Rights Council \n     succeeds only in making superficial changes to the structure \n     of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights;\n       Whereas the new United Nations Human Rights Council does \n     not--\n       (1) embody the recommended institutional reforms necessary \n     to advance human rights;\n       (2) monitor cases of human rights abuse throughout the \n     world; and\n       (3) prevent egregious human rights violators from being \n     elected to the council;\n       Whereas the new United Nations Human Rights Council only \n     reduces the number of seats on the council from 53 to 47, \n     which is not enough to make the council more efficient or \n     more effective;\n       Whereas the new United Nations Human Rights Council also \n     maintains many geographical quotas that will only ensure that \n     human rights abusers will continue to have access to \n     membership on the council;\n       Whereas the new United Nations Human Rights Council is not \n     supported by some of the leading non-governmental \n     institutions in\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\n     the world that are dedicated to the promotion of freedom and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas the United States, while voting against the \n     resolution creating the United Nations Human Rights Council, \n     was unable to ensure that the council would be structured to \n     best promote and protect human rights around the globe; and\n       Whereas if the United States, working with other like-\n     minded countries, is not able to adequately reform the \n     corrupt United Nations Human Rights Commission, then the \n     chances for the United States and other like-minded countries \n     to effect the broader changes to the United Nations that are \n     desired and needed to make the institution more effective are \n     much reduced: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that the United Nations Human Rights Council \n     should be a body that upholds the ideals contained in--\n       (A) the United Nations Charter; and\n       (B) the Universal Declaration on Human Rights;\n       (2) believes that countries charged with protecting the \n     human rights of individuals throughout the world should be \n     required to--\n       (A) hold regular, competitive, and democratic elections;\n       (B) allow for freedom of expression; and\n       (C) have a credible civil society;\n       (3) finds that the creation of the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council fails to--\n       (A) adequately reform the United Nations Commission on \n     Human Rights; and\n       (B) prevent the worst abusers of human rights in the world \n     from attaining membership to the council;\n       (4) applauds the Administration for opposing the creation \n     of the new council;\n       (5) believes that the United States should adhere to its \n     principles and not seek membership on the new council, a move \n     that would undermine the credibility of the United States and \n     give the new council unwarranted legitimacy;\n       (6) urges the Administration to not support the United \n     Nations Human Rights Council, and to advocate in favor of the \n     withdrawal of any financial support that would be used to \n     support the council until meaningful reforms are undertaken; \n     and\n       (7) believes the United States should strengthen, deepen, \n     and operationalize the work of the international community of \n     democracies by establishing an effective human rights \n     oversight body outside the United Nations system, so as to \n     make it the primary means for examining, exposing, \n     monitoring, and redressing human rights abuses throughout the \n     world.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday, I wrote a letter to President \nBush expressing my strong opposition to the United States participating \nin the United Nations Human Rights Council. I believe the newly \nestablished body represents little improvement over the old and \ndiscredited commission it is intended to replace. Furthermore, any U.S. \nparticipation or financial support of the Council undermines our \ncredibility as defenders of human rights around the world. I believe \nmany of my colleagues share my assessment, which is why this resolution \nexpresses the Senate's opposition to the Council and our strong belief \nthat the United States should take no part. The United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights was established by the United States and our \nallies in 1946 to monitor and prevent human rights abuses throughout \nthe world. It was charged to uphold the ideals embodied in the U.N. \nCharter and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. However, in the \nintervening years, the Commission fell far short of these noble \nexpectations. In particular, the Commission consistently granted \nmembership to some of the world's worst human rights abusers. Sudan, \nCuba, Libya, China, and Zimbabwe all have demonstrated egregious \ndisregard for the human rights of their own citizens and shamefully \nwere all Commission members. Moreover, the Commission repeatedly failed \nto act or condemn numerous cases of intolerable human rights abuses. \nThese include the many abuses perpetrated by Communist states, the 1994 \nRwanda genocide, and even the ongoing genocide in Sudan's western \nregion of Darfur. Many of our colleagues by now have had the \nopportunity to travel to that Darfur region. I, for one, have been \nthere, as well as Chad, the country immediately west, and seen the \nterrible tragedies that are being created by this ongoing genocide. The \nCommission refused to condemn state sponsors of terrorism, such as \nIran, Syria, and North Korea. They consistently singled out the only \ndemocracy in the Middle East, Israel, for criticism, while overlooking \nserious cases of human rights abuse in neighboring countries. The \nCommission repeatedly proved itself ineffective, unaccountable, and \ninefficient. It failed to achieve the goals and uphold the ideals for \nwhich it was created. Now, to their credit, the United States and many \nat the United Nations recognized the need for serious reform of the \nCommission in order to restore the U.N.'s credibility. However, the \nU.N.'s new Human Rights Council, established just 2 weeks ago, fails to \ndo just that. It falls far short of the standards envisioned by \nPresident Bush and Secretary General Kofi Annan. It glosses over its \ndeficiencies and offers only superficial changes to the former \nCommission structure.\n  Fundamentally, the Council lacks the mechanisms and standards \nnecessary to prevent flagrant human rights violators from gaining \nmembership. It maintains the geographical quotas that will, once again, \nensure that human rights abusers continue to have access to membership. \nIt is wrong. It does not make sense. In short, the new Council fails to \nimprove over the old Commission, and it is destined to fail in its core \nmission of monitoring and preventing human rights abuses around the \nworld.\n  I applaud President Bush and our Ambassador at the U.N., John Bolton, \nfor opposing the resolution establishing the Council. I personally urge \nthe administration, as does this resolution, to oppose U.S. \nparticipation in and deny American support for the U.N.'s new Human \nRights Council. This would uphold America's credibility and reputation \nas a protector of human rights and deny the Council unwarranted \nlegitimacy.\n  I also believe that the United States should lead a group of like-\nminded democracies to establish an effective human rights oversight \nbody outside of the U.N. system. At a minimum, countries charged with \nprotecting human rights should themselves hold regular, competitive, \ndemocratic elections; allow for freedom of expression; and have a \ncredible civil society--all of which was not the case for the old U.N. \nCommission, nor is it now the case for the new Council.\n  Regrettably, the U.N. and many of its member states have shown that \nthey are not serious about reform. Therefore, the United States and \nthose committed to protecting human rights must adhere to our \nprinciples and work toward a solution outside of the United Nations.\n  For too long, the world's worst human rights abusers have \nsuccessfully shielded themselves from scrutiny. It is time for change. \nIt is time for sunlight. I believe that under the leadership of \nAmerica, we should create a new, a stronger, a more credible body to \nprotect the human rights of all of those who are vulnerable around the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2693-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3214.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 417, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 417) honoring the National \n     Association of State Veterans Homes and the 119 State \n     veterans homes providing long-term care to veterans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering this Senate resolution, which I submitted with Senator Dole \nand 23 additional co-sponsors.\n  This resolution honors the National Association of State Veterans \nHomes, NASVH, and its 119 State homes for their support in caring for \nour Nation's military veterans. The State veterans' home program has \nbeen a successful partnership between the Federal Government and the \nStates. It is responsible for the bulk of VA-supported long-term care \nservices to veterans and their families.\n  The NASVH was first established in 1954 as a volunteer, nonprofit \norganization. Now, 119 State homes provide nursing home care, \ndomiciliary care, and hospital-type care to over 27,500 veterans in 47 \nStates and Puerto Rico. My State of New Jersey has three Veterans \nHomes, which serve approximately 1,000 veterans.\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\n  The NASVH has been vitally important in developing new methods for \ncaring for elderly veterans, such as hospice care, respite care, \nAlzheimer's care, and adult day health care.\n  The State veterans home program has been remarkably successful. This \nresolution recognizes the importance of this Federal-State partnership \nand honors the dedicated men and women of the National Association of \nState Veterans Homes for caring for our Nation's aging and disabled \nmilitary heroes.\n  I served in the Army Signal Corps during World War II. Consequently, \nI am well aware of the sacrifices brave young men and women make on \nbehalf of our country. It's important that our Nation honors its \ncommitment to look after our veterans. That's where organizations like \nthe NASVH come in and do their part. So it's appropriate to honor this \ngroup for its commitment to serving our veterans. I thank the Senate \nfor adopting this resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble agreed to, the motion to reconsider laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 417\n\n       Whereas the National Association of State Veterans Homes \n     was established in 1954 by a group of administrators of State \n     veterans homes to represent the interests of those homes in a \n     unified voice before Congress and the executive branch;\n       Whereas the National Association of State Veterans Homes \n     functions on an all-volunteer basis and focuses on endeavors \n     that improve the conditions of care furnished to veterans by \n     State veterans homes, elevate and monitor the qualifications \n     for managers of such homes, and provide continuing education \n     standards for staff who provide care to veterans in such \n     homes;\n       Whereas the National Association of State Veterans Homes \n     has been and continues to be in the forefront of developing \n     and supporting new methods and models for providing long-term \n     care services to elderly veterans, such as hospice care, \n     respite care, Alzheimer's care, and adult day health care;\n       Whereas State veterans homes, which provide long-term care \n     to thousands of veterans, were established initially in the \n     States of Connecticut, Kansas, Ohio, and Maine in 1868 to \n     house, feed, and care for thousands of homeless, wounded, and \n     permanently scarred Union soldiers and thus have been in \n     existence since before the establishment of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, the earlier Veterans' Administration, and \n     its predecessor agencies;\n       Whereas in 1888 Congress authorized the Federal payment of \n     a daily allowance for the care of each former soldier or \n     sailor in a State home-hospital, an allowance that continues \n     today in the form of a per diem grant program administered by \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs that is authorized to \n     provide up to 50 percent of the average daily cost of care, \n     but currently provides only approximately 30 percent;\n       Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs further \n     participates in the care of veterans in State homes with a \n     matching grant program to support construction and major \n     renovation projects to sustain those homes and build towards \n     sufficient levels of available, high-quality health care;\n       Whereas State veterans homes offer long-term services to \n     eligible veterans in need of such services on certification \n     of the Department of Veterans Affairs at 119 facilities in 47 \n     States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;\n       Whereas the States determine the allocation of nursing home \n     beds in individual State veterans home facilities, and \n     establish the eligibility of veterans and their dependents to \n     occupy those beds, following Federal guidelines;\n       Whereas within the limits of their capacities, State \n     veterans homes provide care for more than 27,500 veterans \n     each day, accounting for more than 50 percent of the total \n     national long-term care bed capacity for veterans, thereby \n     sharing the enormous responsibility of caring for veterans \n     with the Department of Veterans Affairs in an admirable \n     partnership;\n       Whereas State veterans homes provide quality care for \n     elderly and disabled veterans at an average daily cost that \n     is significantly less than nursing homes operated by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       Whereas the number of elderly veterans, particularly those \n     over age 85, continues to rise, and the need for long-term \n     care services for those veterans will continue to rise in the \n     coming years; and\n       Whereas the Nation's State veterans homes continue to \n     achieve their purpose of improving and sustaining the health \n     of elderly, sick, and severely disabled veterans by assuring \n     access to affordable nursing care in settings that provide \n     personal dignity to truly deserving veterans, often at the \n     end of lives spent in service to the Nation: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the National Association of State Veterans Homes \n     and the 119 State veterans homes providing long-term care to \n     veterans that are represented by that association for their \n     significant contributions to the health care of veterans and \n     to the health care system of the Nation;\n       (2) commends the thousands of individuals who work in, or \n     on behalf of, State veterans homes for their contributions in \n     caring for elderly and disabled veterans;\n       (3) recognizes the importance of the partnership between \n     the States and the Department of Veterans Affairs in \n     providing long-term care to veterans; and\n       (4) affirms the support of Congress for continuation of the \n     State homes program to address the known and anticipated \n     needs of the Nation's veterans for institutional long-term \n     care services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2697-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2697-S2698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 418\n\n       Whereas there are 20,000,000 children under the age of 5 in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas numerous studies, including the Abecedarian Study, \n     the Study of the Chicago Child-Parent Center, and the High/\n     Scope Perry Preschool Study, indicate that low-income \n     children who have enrolled in quality, comprehensive early \n     childhood education programs--\n       (1) improve their cognitive, language, physical, social, \n     and emotional development; and\n       (2) are less likely to--\n       (A) be placed in special education;\n       (B) drop out of school; or\n       (C) engage in juvenile delinquency;\n       Whereas the enrollment rates of children under the age of 5 \n     in early childhood education programs have steadily increased \n     since 1965 with--\n       (1) the creation of the Head Start program carried out \n     under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.);\n       (2) the establishment of the Early Head Start program \n     carried out under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et \n     seq.); and\n       (3) the enactment of the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.);\n       Whereas many children eligible for, and in need of, quality \n     early childhood education services are not served due to \n     inadequate funding;\n       Whereas over 4,000,000 children under the age of 5 live in \n     poverty;\n       Whereas only about \\1/2\\ of all preschoolers who are \n     eligible to participate in Head Start programs have the \n     opportunity to do so, and even fewer eligible babies and \n     toddlers receive the opportunity to participate in Early Head \n     Start;\n       Whereas only about 1 out of every 7 eligible children \n     receives an amount of child care assistance sufficient to--\n       (1) enable the parents of the child to continue working; \n     and\n       (2) provide the child with safe and nurturing early \n     childhood care and education;\n       Whereas, although State and local governments have \n     responded to the numerous benefits of early childhood \n     education by making significant investments in programs and \n     classrooms, there remains--\n       (1) a large unmet need for those services; and\n       (2) a need to improve the quality of those programs; and\n       Whereas, according to numerous studies on the impact of \n     investments in high-quality early childhood education, the \n     programs yield to the public a return of 4 dollars to 13 \n     dollars for each dollar invested: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning April 2, 2006, as ``Week \n     of the Young Child'';\n       (2) encourages the citizens of the United States to \n     celebrate--\n       (A) young children; and\n       (B) the citizens who provide care and early childhood \n     education to the young children of the United States; and\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\n       (3) urges the citizens of the United States to recognize \n     the importance of--\n       (A) quality, comprehensive early childhood education \n     programs; and\n       (B) the value of those services for preparing children to--\n       (i) appreciate future educational experiences; and\n       (ii) enjoy lifelong success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2698-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, APRIL 3, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the border security bill. Last night, Senator \nAlexander offered his widely supported Strengthening American \nCitizenship Act. This legislation is reasonable, it is patriotic, and \nit will help newly arrived immigrants learn the responsibilities, the \nhabits, and the privileges of American citizenship.\n  I had hoped that today we would have locked in a vote on that \namendment and the Bingaman amendment for Monday. Unfortunately, the \nother side objected to allowing a vote on the Alexander amendment. I \nmention that only because it leaves me concerned that the other side \nmay be falling into this pattern of delay and obstruction.\n  As I said and implied in all of my statements since we have started \non this bill, we need to proceed in a civil way, a dignified way, and \nconsider these amendments as soon as they are ready. I would encourage \nall of our colleagues to work aggressively to help bring this bill to \nclosure over the next several days. We are right where I thought we \nwould be in terms of finishing this bill, but it does mean that we are \ngoing to have to work together, come together and address substantive \namendments in a substantive way and vote on those.\n  In closing--and I will close in a few seconds--if we don't come \ntogether, it means that we are not going to fulfill our responsibility \nto address these very important issues of border security, of the 11 \nmillion to 12 million people who are in this country under the \ntemporary worker program that is being considered. We absolutely must \nhave substantive debate and discussion that respects that we are a \nnation of the rule of law and a proud nation of immigrants, legal \nimmigrants who have come to this country to work and contribute so much \nto our society.\n  So I hope that we will get back on track on Monday. We will be voting \nMonday afternoon at approximately 5:30. We will try to get a unanimous \nconsent for votes on the pending amendments, and Members should expect \nat least two votes Monday evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/31/senate-section/article/S2698-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 3, 2006 AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
